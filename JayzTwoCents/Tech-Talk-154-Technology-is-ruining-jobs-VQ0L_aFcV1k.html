cow
suck horse starts I'm just making make
sure everything's good our encoder is
good we've been going for 10 seconds
long toad longer than I last in bed
right I'm gonna roll that intro real
quick do it tick tock tick tock
technology's ruining our jobs what's
that HEC jobs you make a valid point
actually oh man check job if tech took
tech jobs then technically we'd have
Skynet we would be we'd all be military
you know what else is taking jobs people
was what people are taking has people
has anyone ever stopped to think about
what are the computers and the androids
and the robots gonna do when people
start doing people jobs again seriously
I mean come on robot lives matter okay
anyway I'd like to direct everyone's
attention down to the description down
there
yeah I'm just basically telling everyone
that this is a show where we don't talk
about tech it's called tech talk it's um
it's it's a euphemism I don't know we
just hang out that's what we're doing so
everything's linked to technology in
some way right that's like what does the
seven degrees of separation or ever
there's always technology somewhere in
that chain so technically we're talking
about sack like the seven degrees of
bacon cheeseburger Kevin Bacon or
whatever it is yeah yeah I think isn't
it seven degrees like you can't race
like anything to anything else in like
like the seven degrees of separation
yeah but I thing but dang the neighbors
is like listen I can barely hear Oh see
it's loud for us that's loud huh guys
okay so we got some stuff she has some
topics and stuff Before we jump into the
topics and actually act like we have a
show planned out if you guys
Jerry now we're actually having a car
discussion offline I don't want to talk
about my car a whole lot I think the
Internet's kind of sick of hearing about
my car I'm not actually you only if you
followed on Twitter would you guys know
about my new car my new my new what my
cool great Ritchie Rick got a new whip
Ritchie wit we were having a prior
discussion actually yeah we're Jerry new
sneakers yes my tires are bald on the
STI are they bald and hard yes watch it
yeah maybe a little bit I don't think
they're hard they're not that old
actually I've just been burning the
tread off and doing dry dry pavement
burnouts that's like the stage to clutch
is only fun when you dump it in 6,000
rpm and unfortunately the tires just
don't like that yeah so without the two
suggestions I had because and we are we
are welcome to suggestions in the
comments too on this own actually Jerry
see I live in an area where it's like 11
and a half months of the year at summer
conditions so I can get away with some
super you know some super you can just
run soft slicks on your car let's just
be honest most of the time well the
problem is in the summertime then they
melt but that's just I can run a summer
tire all year long without a problem you
however cannot because you deal with
quite a bit of rain and a bit of frosty
conditions in the winter yes it was 26
degrees last night so you're not going
to get a performance tire that's all
season I mean you you can ish but I mean
any tire that I'm recommending here like
so on the Z right now on the street set
because I've got member I got track set
of tires in a street set so my street
set is the Continental extreme contact
sport which is the new 2017 version of
the old DW which was a dry wet tire the
tire was kind of yeah on track it was
chunky like a chunked out a lot the
tread blocks so they completely
redesigned this tire to be a racing tire
slash I think we found somebody that can
challenge you to a typing contest Jerry
oh yeah bring it bring it will have to
he says you can type up to like 120 130
words per minute a hundred and thirty is
my max my average is probably like 110 a
what so you guys will get to know Phil
over time but I'm game I'm game let's do
it Phil it was going crazy
okay so when I started to say was so
that the extreme contact DW was it was
not a very well liked received tire the
extreme contact sport however was
completely redesigned it was designed by
M so drivers continental worked closely
with the racing circuit to develop a a
racing worthy Street tire it's not super
cheap but it's it is a very good tire
it's got true to tread blocks on it just
like the DW though there's a there's a
the letter D and the letter W edged into
the tire and when the and when the W
wears off then it's no longer safe for a
wet tire when the D wears off that it's
time to change the tire so it's really
cool mechanism that's a really cool
mecha so has just has to do with minimum
tread depth the other tire that I still
highly recommend for Street / track /
wet and dry conditions is the Potenza re
11 that Potenza re 11 obviously the rich
don't tire it is around the same price
as the continental but I like both those
tires because I have content those on
the car right now but I think they're
the Potenza Sutton zeros are zero or
seems like ten different Potenza they're
not agree I put them on the car I like
them on dry pavement but the second it
gets wet they just lose all grip yeah
yeah it's it's a it it depends I mean
they have a they have an entry-level
Potenza but the re Elevens is one step
below they're like Street race tire
which is the re 71 are okay the re 71
are is kind of like an are triple eight
are from that one company that makes
those well technically once I get my
wife a new vehicle I can use the truck
is my little daily driver and I could
actually put some good tires on on the
STI something that's a little bit more
geared towards drive versus wet yeah
it's don't drive it in the way I mean
but then again I I have to maintain a
set of rally tires too because I like to
rallycross the car and I'm not gonna do
that with like sticky freaking track
tires on it right
so yeah besides that ending new before
we talk about our first topic here well
I almost died today oh you're gonna
you're gonna tell that sorry you bet
your ass I can tell that story what have
you know mean to shy away from anything
okay okay well that out I put this
gently I thought I had a heart attack
today cuz uh well the wife and I were
having some nuptials I collapsed to the
floor is there any is there any more I
know you hear about all the time people
die having sex yeah well I confirm today
that I guess is true because I was I was
going to town no warning signs no
precursors I just collapsed to the floor
like for no reason gasped in prayer
grabbing my chest I was like shit are
you sure you weren't just having like
massive palpitations that's what I think
was probably happening cuz I drank a
huge cup of coffee this morning I could
have had an arrhythmia that's what it
felt like like a and when I put on the
heart I have a heart rate monitor
because I monitor all my vitals really
closely just because the medications
that I take so I put on my little heart
rate monitor for about an hour my heart
rate maxed out at about 180 ish when I
collapsed but my oxygen saturation
stayed pretty high so that's why I don't
think it was it was necessarily a heart
attack or if it was it was like a super
duper mild one but yeah Felicia is she
freaked out I collapsed to the ground
and she's like looking at me like oh it
broke him yeah the most awkward like how
do I explain this this is a dude there's
like no there's no good way to like play
that off and look cool like okay I'm
done you know and walk away but just
like mmm anyways I don't care about
telling embarrassing shit man I take
pictures of myself on the toilet for
Instagram let's be honest here but at
any rate it was an eye-opener so today
I'm eating my salad add oatmeal for
breakfast I'm eating my salad for late
Late Late lunch and since the
painkillers aren't really working
anymore from my back I'm gonna start
titrating off those two so I have a lot
of pain in my future and I gotta lose
weight so that's gonna happen I mean I'm
not I'm not consulting the internet I'm
not reaching out for advice on to become
a vegan or to adopt some religion to
make me lose weight I'm just gonna do it
just like I did last time I did it
everyone has that eye-opening moment
like me it was my car accident in 2008
was it really yeah I mean everyone
everyone has that moment so I mean it
did I'll put it this way if it comes
down to like you know your health is you
have to choose between your health your
lifestyle or your life it doesn't matter
if it's your fifth time or your 500th
time as long as you have a time that
works before it's too late then
who cares how many times it took to get
there you know right this has never
happened before this was like I've had
I've had arrhythmia for for most of my
life you know just just random you know
usually it's anxiety induced but there
was no anxiety dude I was always having
a great old time leave stress of the day
and just fucking hit me like a ton of
bricks so I think that it's probably at
this point from me being down for 22
days with pneumonia in December I think
it just I lost so much muscle mass and I
gained so much weight during that period
of time that now any level of strenuous
activity just takes me like off the end
so I'm gonna say something quick I will
i warn't ban every user in the chat who
keeps asking who won the giveaways
they've already been emailed if it
wasn't you
you didn't win so anyone that keeps
blowing up the chat won't ask about the
giveaway you're gonna get banned which
will unfortunately remove you from the
subscriber list which means if we do
have to redraw a winner it won't be you
so I would just shut up about the
giveaway check your inbox
and watch the exotic PC and the fractal
design accounts because they're the ones
announcing not me so that's the last I'm
gonna say it so anyone who asked who won
Nick time out and been every single one
yeah one okay if they do it again
then BAM I'm sick I don't care if I lose
a thousand subscribers today man every
single one so oh my god I'm sorry I'm
just laughing from the video you watched
earlier today okay fianc was great
unsubscribe now it's it's he nailed it
right he really did he really did
oh my god oh so good yeah so anyway yeah
I've that's that's that there's nothing
more annoying than doing a giveaway
because if you get a bajillion people
asking who won and then you just I would
like bug it you're gone gone if you
don't have an email saying
congratulations you won it wasn't you
but the person who has been contacted so
far as far as I know has not responded
back yet and they have 48 48 hours to
respond and if they don't respond we
pick another winner the problem is all
these dickheads are gonna screw their
chance before they even get a chance to
reap it a winner so just shut up and
wait if it was you great if not wait
your turn
wait your chance there there will be
they're giveaways yeah so anyway that
was my story life-changing event today
it was it needed to happen so now I'm
convinced that I am no longer healthy
not that I really thought I was healthy
to begin with I mean beyond my physical
numbers but physical numbers obviously
don't mean shit when your fucking heart
just like cuts out in the middle of
doing doing shit so I think the young
immature get a little more healthier
well I mean my wife and I have been on a
much more healthy regime the last
several weeks she's lost like because
she still was carrying the baby weight
from when the baby was born because she
has one of those bodies when she's
breastfeeding like it just hangs on to
every pound because breastfeeding is
like it's a it's actually a really like
intensive on on the body from what I
understand oh hell yeah totally is
you're a frickin meal factory you're
feeding yourself and another human being
but she couldn't lose weight as much as
she tried but since the baby is no
longer I see the baby she's three years
old now but she's no longer on the boob
I'm back on the boob no but I swear to
God I saw that coming a mile away uh but
no seriously though she's been that
girls been doing two-a-days you believe
that she's been working out in the
morning and in the evening like every
day and she's she's about dropping
weight like crazy now so of course I
don't want to be left out so I'm back in
like sort of a weight loss mood mode
with her and she started doing like
peloton cycling like spinning class yep
and so now we started talking talking
cycling which is really weird to talk
cycling with my wife but I'm probably
gonna get her a bike that way we can go
ride together because yes I started
riding my my red power bike again two
days ago yeah I started you know it's
too it's too cold right now though for
me to do any strenuous stuff because if
you start breathing really heavy it
frees your lungs so so but I've been
just like you could get my heart rate up
to about 120 and just cruising around
for about five miles Kyle don't be says
I joined in and we're talking about
breastfeeding do you two body bag tag
alright first official story we're
actually gonna talk about here this one
comes courtesy of CNET an apple repair
center is linked to false 911 calls you
guys can find us article on CNET so
basically if you have an iphone a newer
iPhone and every iPhone has I think has
a different way of triggering it but if
you like a my phone here and yes I use
an iPhone you
I actually have multiple androids as
well so whatever if you take the power
button and the volume up button and you
hold it you get this red slider here
which is an emergency SOS which will
basically immediately call whatever the
local 9-1-1 is based on the cell tower
it connects to that's how the 9-1-1
works anyway we doesn't appear to
reproduce on an iphone 7 though so that
must be a new feature to eight and
doesn't your seven has a physical button
you push down on though it does yes see
mine does not so the button sequence is
different just like my soft reset
sequence is different than yours what
happens if you push volume up and that
button let me try it
so vault is so vault power and volume up
it's fun okay imagine you really were in
an emergency and you needed to use this
feature well I think on mine the way you
do it is you just swipe the other door
is it there's a swipe you do like is it
down I I honestly don't know how to dial
nine-one-one on my phone so I guess if I
just died like I didn't use this as
warning to call for help whatever it's
easier just unlocking call 911 so anyway
um there was an apple repair Center in
Elk Grove California that apparently was
was having an average of 20 false 9-1-1
calls every single day and they're
estimating 1691 one calls from this
Apple repair center since last October
what's crazy do you know what a drain on
resources it is because any time a 9-1-1
call comes and they have to investigate
it they can't just ignore it okay they
usually call back but something tells me
they're not answering that call back cuz
i got the phone in some mode getting
updated or fixed right so then they
probably to send a cop out yeah the
local 9-1-1 and you hang up before
anyone answers the system will
automatically call you back
yep and some people answer the cop gets
dispatched cuz we had this happen about
three months ago when the weather caused
our lines to get crossed outside like
the corrosion in the box you are one of
them we're hearing that happened once oh
it was i yeah you were here because you
were all worried because the the police
came by and you were like really
consider you were down here when that
happened okay okay well no we had one of
those just happened up here too because
I remember Zander was standing behind me
I'm like why the hell are there cops on
my porch and they're like we received a
call from 911 and I showed him my phone
I brought the phone out when you clicked
call the dial tone was
you can hear the neighbors talking so he
just were like yeah fucking lines across
but I mean did they respond to me and
somebody else needed them mmm like yeah
but but yeah no they have to if you
don't answer the call back they will
dispatch the police to your house yeah
so anyway this this particular repair
center and the article doesn't say how
but some sort I'm assuming they had some
sort of procedure they were doing or
maybe they had some sort of software
glitch when they're hooking this up to
their to their scans or scopes or
whatever when they're working on these
devices but they were calling 9-1-1 20
times a day it is how does that can
house that keep on going I mean I think
after a couple of days as the as the
establishment in question here I'd be
trying to figure out what is going wrong
because you know what's gonna happen if
you keep getting all these false calls
there dispatch is gonna start they're
gonna start building you there's a
building you for the response effort as
a matter of fact our alarm company did
that we had a cat that figured out how
to trigger the alarm for attention yeah
so after like four or five false
responses in a month they're like dude
we're gonna have to start charging for
this so then I went in and I was like
disable that one sensor that the cat
knows how the trigger
yes but 1600 false 9-1-1 calls since
october so i can't even imagine
anyway I guess I reached out to Apple
for comment of course apples like we
don't have a comb in it you reached out
for comment oh my god the shows getting
on me the article did seen it okay I
thought you actually did okay I'm James
- sense media and we want to we want to
know what's going on over there guys
give us go back like I want to talk to
anyone an Apple you're gonna the Genius
Bar for anything they talk to you like
you're stupid oh my god don't even get
me started on the genius partner that
one time I fucking flipped out and they
were fucking with me when I went to the
store yeah I'm like my screen is broken
oh we can get you in like next week I'm
like give me another phone sorry we
don't do that sir we replace the screens
now I was like oh my god I hate you guys
hey you guys you don't have enough Apple
stores nearby where we have them like
once you get in towards LA they're like
there's literally two within one block
of each other I'm one it's like
Starbucks in the back of Starbucks is
like a replace your screen Center yeah
blame my no no I agree with you though
because I went in there for the screen
replacement and then I finally set up an
appointment I went back because the
other places said they could do it the
same day what they meant was they could
take the phone from me that day and ship
it out to a repair center not show up
that day and get it
I heard that day exactly even though
they made it sound like that on the
phone so anyways I go over I set up the
appointment and when they're doing this
goodly did the screen fix right in front
of me right they like be actually
brought the phone out in the screen and
swapped it out right in front of you
know it's kind of cool to watch and then
when they were done they're like they're
like alright so you know you know you
should probably get a case over here you
should probably one of these cases so
this doesn't happen you know I was like
dude I got Apple care like shit breaks
I'm just gonna have you fix it and
they're like all but we still highly
recommend that you put it in a
protective case I was like do I have to
put in a protective case or like no well
of course you don't have to I was like
alright have a good day somebody thinks
that that's Nick right there that's
that's not name it's just some random
guy we were like hey you won't come in
and hang out for an hour
Nick Nick doesn't wear blue shirts Nick
doesn't wear blue doesn't wear blue
shirts Nick's on that side that's Nick
over there yeah over there Nick's just
Nick doesn't respond to me anymore he's
got me an ignore you know he's put all
you guys on timeout he's put me on
timeout like in person
so anyway I just can't imagine though
that this particular problem can can get
going like that long that that's almost
six oh it's four months ago yeah what I
don't understand is is it seems like the
9-1-1 call center because as long as
it's not going over hell even if it's
going over a wireless network it should
use the location that that Wi-Fi router
or that IP address is allocated to fit
by the isp so at any rate 911 call
center should have had a chart somewhere
saying we've responded to calls like 800
times this one location like it should
have been it should have been a parent i
think somebody just dropped the ball and
just pretty much just ignored looking at
any of those data mm-hmm and that's why
it happened and they finally got around
to doing an audit or something like that
and they and they found it but no
realistically there should have been a
flag in the system saying listen you
know 1600 different phone numbers called
us from the same location in van nuys
yeah we should probably like fix this
somehow and the other thing I don't get
is why would an apple call like the
police department and report like hey
we're you know we have a high instance
rate of the phones accidentally getting
triggered because they know they're
doing it there's no way the phones are
just doing it on their own right they're
obviously pushing the wrong fucking
button I'm about to get it into whatever
mode let's drill this down even farther
so I have friends and family
who were in law enforcement I've gone on
plenty of ride-alongs with them and
every single time I go on a ride-along
the the the cop always seems to be
called out to some location they've been
to in the past right and they remember
the location one by their own memory but
together the moment the call comes up on
their MDC it will tell them about all
past calls I've ever happened at that
address so in a city like Elk Grove they
probably have a police force of about
200 maybe 250 police officers they're
like and you split that out by shift
right there's three shifts so the
likelihood of the same cop being called
out there multiple times in that 1600
the cop will eventually bring it up to
their own dispatch - and be like hey
there's something going on here we need
to figure this out because the last
thing the cop wants to do is go chasing
these false flags right so I just it
just seems this is a weird such a weird
article yeah like were they just
ignoring them I mean did it just get to
the point where you can't they just
counted as legal in the system because
then it seems like liabilities on them
if there's a real issue at that location
you can't legally just be like that's
that's Jimmy he's just boards you can't
then Jimmy really needs you and he's
screwed so they hired that AppleCare guy
he's wasn't right in the head he wasn't
right in the head he just keeps calling
out with one it's okay though okay
that's good yeah that is that is pretty
weird actually anyway so yeah let me uh
here's here's one that I wanted to talk
about - so Nick actually knows a little
bit more about this Nick scoot over here
quick come on Little Nicky he's too busy
banning people were here I know I'm
watching those banter just like holy
shit he's giving jack man a run for his
money
yeah so the Metal Gear Metal Gear
survived yeah so apparently Metal Gear
is going to be charging ten dollars for
a second save slot you know you open up
a game you have like four or five save
slots yep or just however many you end
up saving it could just keep going
because it's just it's just game data
usually in like a textbook format or
whatever saved in like the Documents
folder or something right it's right yep
but it just carries but but Xbox gives
you like free cloud storage PS gives you
cloud storage with your subscription
that's all provided okay the when I
started reading this article Nick was
like a screw man
because you went into you talked about
the developer left etc etc so what have
a basically Hideo Kojima would develop
the game middle you saw it but the
publisher Konami kicked him out from it
and then took his name and slapped it on
this game so this isn't this is not
Metal Gear as you know it yeah it's like
an office a complete offshoot so it's
not even hit videos game he won't get
support for it hmm
so they I just took his his thing and
ran with it and they didn't give him
credit anymore cuz there's a whole issue
about this like two years ago when they
wouldn't allow him to go to video games
award to receive the award for the game
that he made I remember that actually
all that all I did do gave her one to
stop bugging about the giveaway was make
the camera freeze now all the time it's
a frozen camera just like you're holding
perfectly still I like how the moment
and it came into frame it's like and cut
I don't know why it's frozen guys OBS
has been doing weird things to me today
so we're just gonna we're gonna keep
going but anyway so I wanted to start
the discussion about we've heard we
obviously have heard about DLC content
right
but now DLC features right that's like
the next progression from this yeah
honestly will give you your whole game
but if you want the whole settings panel
that's gonna cost you yeah exactly if
you want to use if you want to use
joystick left and be able to key bind
your net pay like we're will it ends
right there will be no end if this
shit's like allowed to take place so
people need to like just tell them to
fuck off and not support the game until
they do the same thing that they did
with that other game was it a the Star
Wars game oh that was about battlefront
too yes so yeah I remember how everybody
just protests it was like fuck you pay
to win model and they pulled it out well
the same things gonna happen with this
they had pulled it out temporarily when
they first pulled it and then they
decided like okay we'll leave it out
permanently and they started reducing
the amount of credits and stuff it takes
to unlock various features and stuff but
they were still hell-bent on even after
they pulled it out the first time as a
temporary thing that they were gonna
bring it back you know what I mean
so yeah but I mean that's a perfect
example of public outcry but that's
that's
ea also EA is perfectly content with
being you know the devil in terms of
game
publishers ya Konami wouldn't take me as
a company that would do that though like
because I mean they're like a ground
floor company alright Konami has been
around since like the first consoles
yeah so that's a little weird that
they're taking this model it's almost
like it's one of those things where
they're just watching the community and
they're like oh what can we get away
with ea gets away with us all the time
so fuck we'll do it too and they'll
probably won't allow the game to be on
any other platform well I mean it is it
is Metal Gear so they it is only gonna
be available on PlayStation I'm guessing
right I don't think I don't I don't
think the Metal Gear franchise has ever
been on anything but box did they do a
delayed release of one of them to xbox
it had never go on Xbox Nick or I
thought it was PlayStation only Metal
Gear that's one of them did but wasn't
it delayed didn't it go on PlayStation
first and then Xbox was like way longer
down the road or whether yeah but
account he also does he know he's he's
asking if there was a delay like where
it came out PlayStation first but then
like the same one came out in the other
platforms later or they all really all
cross-platform i right I member the
original I played that yeah this this
seems really fishy because the whole
thing with Playstations they always rip
on Xbox Live and shit right they talk
about PlayStation network's like free
and you know sorry I was talking always
I'm just doing why PlayStation is doing
stuff like this because they criticize
the hell out of Microsoft for their Xbox
Live you know subscription fee yearly
subscription fee and now they're letting
games just nickel and dime shit like
this like because that okay yeah so
obviously the ps4 Xbox one launch
PlayStation looked like the halo system
because they were all against Xboxes DRM
and all that and always-on on online and
and stuff so that was nothing more than
a marketing model where instead of
actually marketing how good your console
is you started marketing against the
competition you find that and obviously
Xbox had a lot of flack at really
changed a lot to remember they supposed
to have internally like downloaded games
no CD drive always-on DRM so community
outcry helped but but what I'm getting
at here is PlayStation played all of
their cards in their marketing
right and upfront - instead of talking
about how good the platform is it was
just look how bad Xbox is so that was
there that was like their marketing but
now that what four years have gone by
five years have gone by since that could
that platform launch right in 2013 in a
while now they're able to just start
making these tweaks because people are
embedded people people are invested now
with their game libraries and their yep
their PlayStation Alive accounts and
stuff to where they can make these
changes and you're kind of stuck right
so it's typical though I mean all these
companies do it all these tech companies
will do the bait and switch over time I
don't care who you are I don't care if
your Intel you're AMD or Nvidia all of
them have some sort of a bait-and-switch
uh nose Pascal if for instance Pascal
all of their all of your marketing okay
so so the the Pascal launch event May
2016
Austin Texas where sits it was
coinciding with Dreamhack so we're there
were press we're watching the
announcement we're watching all of the
it was backwards when Pascal launched we
got the do tech day first before the
launch event where what usually its
launch event then picked a right so we
actually got to do tech day and kind of
get all the in have 1080i okay backwards
I'm sorry Dreamhack we did the tech day
demo live thing with you know all of
their fanfare and their livestream that
night and then the next day we spent all
day getting the information so they do
their tech demo during the night and
they're showing all of their blah blah
blah the next day when we're actually
learning about the architecture of
Pascal I go right up to him and I say
hey I'm gonna be able to do we're going
to do three way because I had 3-way nine
80s remember that lull ladies seeing gig
so I asked Mike we're gonna be able to
do three of them and they're like uh
about that and I was when they were like
that was when they had the idea of this
hole and this Nvidia key to unlock the
three-way functionality remember you'd
have to download you'd have to download
a key to make 3-way work that ended up
being scrapped before it ever even
rolled out to where three-way was just
no longer three and four over just no
longer supported in games because with
DX
twelve and and this is where you know
probably a little bit more about the
architecture than than me it was a big
change we've got you got dx12 and you've
got the manufacturers of the cars and
you've got the game developers and
you've got implicit and explicit SLI
that have to do with the API calls
so it was like who's gonna handle the
the multi GPU support is it going to be
Direct X is it going to be Nvidia or is
it going to be the game developer which
has kind of been the way it's always
been but then they've got this this
implicit and explicit SLI functionality
and because it got so granular Nvidia
just pulled that all together they're
like yeah Microsoft and the developers
can figure it out it'll be there if they
want to code for it but otherwise we're
not gonna support it as soon as Nvidia
did that that is when the game
developers and Microsoft basically went
yeah we'll just function we'll just
focus on either to way or one card most
of them just optimized for one card to
weigh scales however it scales yeah I
know some of the DirectX 12 calls are
built-in automatic they automatically
scale but it's not nearly enough like
it's just some of the basic
functionality like anti-aliasing and
shit like that
it can farm it out across multiple cards
without the developer doing anything but
most of the key feature ship that takes
like full control of the card and
utilizes it yeah you're right the
developer has to actually like know that
it's there and account for it
so my point being Nvidia having built
itself up this the what was the biggest
way to show that you were a PC nerd for
for many years put for graphics card yep
but for gravels regards it as news all
of them yes so suddenly they didn't they
didn't even make it super aware or
public that three and four three and
four we weren't being supported until
like after pre-orders were out so
basically they were taking pre-orders
from people that wanted to buy two three
four cards and suddenly only two were
gonna work anyway the only program that
even still scales too far away fine is
fire strike but that's just benchmark
you know and we know they're gonna be
pulling that out too right isn't Nvidia
dropping SLI support for future
generations I don't know that's that
that's what I've been seeing and they
did it with the Titan the Titan V no
they only did with the Titan up not
because the Titan V they specifically
wanted to be a a compute card and I
think I think when we see the new
generation of graphics cards come out
now by the way
full disclosure I have not read any of
the leaks so I have no idea what any of
the the supposedly Tsar in the I think
they're calling it 2080 I have no idea
so I'm just speaking based on on like
what I kind of know from a video from
working with them now for about three
years
mm-hmm I don't think they're gonna get
away do away with two-way SLI but the
volta card I know specifically because
of its tensor cores and all that stuff
it was designed specifically to be a
compute card not a gaming card which is
why the SLI fingers are gone and ymv
link doesn't work and even explicit SLI
doesn't work Oh in dx12 so I know gamers
Nexus couldn't get it to work but
asterisks here I also know that Vince
what kingpin has four volt is working so
I don't know I really don't know
I don't want getting rid of two card
support especially SLI is always been
kind of a second-rate citizen to Nvidia
like I mean they use it for the
benchmarks and for like the wow factor
and stuff like that in a multi machine
rigs and stuff like that but you know
ninety percent of their customers are
like single screen or at least gaming on
a single screen right if they're doing
multiple screens it's off one card so I
kind of feel like even if you look at
the experience like I've even looked at
the Nvidia surround experience it's the
exact same to the T it was like six
years ago
yeah and they had that and and Karam
they called it the I forgot it was
called but was supposed to scale better
in terms of looking less warped on the
ends it's still terrible projection 3d
projection yeah it was no type or
something multi projection I can't risk
it but it still looks as stretched out
as ever it does we did it in fight
simulated another day and I was like
yeah it does it might make a little
difference but it's not as much as they
claimed it was because you're doing it
wrong and flight sim yet to actually
open up three different views and then
just change the angle of each view I did
that but it runs like shit well yeah
because you're running the simulator
three times because yeah no no but but
I'm just saying like when I put it in
video surround and I do it I can run at
4k almost maxed out in X flight and it's
like perfect six frames per second or
sixty frames per second but then when I
switch it to the three different views I
get like four frames a second it's like
that bad yeah I've seen a bunch of
people asking why Nick is timing so many
people out again it's about the giveaway
if you're bugging and nagging about the
giveaway I'm not the one picking the
winner I'm not the one announcing the
winner I'm not the one contact in the
winter so we're just sick of it
so we're
time outs so that people will stop
nagging exit again exotic PC and fractal
design the ones that are doing the
giveaway so you have to go and nag them
the winner has already been emailed he's
already been contacted if you don't have
an email it wasn't you Jerry you didn't
win okay
I know Oh sad about that too I thought
that you were gonna rig it for me now
you gotta you gotta be enough PC but
talking about flights in though dude
I've been using VR for mine that's
that's where it's at yeah I need to get
my VR setup I've got the I've got the
towers in place I just need to go pick
up my headset from from Jesse tribal
instincts I think I saw the VR stuff but
I've been using I bought an oculus just
for that for the PC in the in the the
upstairs like game slash guest room yeah
and my oculus those one those ones that
has the bad HMU so it's um whatever
caught it's like there the gyro is wrong
yeah so every the whole world is tilted
to the left all the time so I so have to
get them to replace the headset it was
bad headset out of the box yeah one
waiting for that for the pro the pro res
is a huge resolution I for the oculus
yeah
oculus are HTC right but don't tell Matt
the oculus how about an oculus fuck the
oculus man about analyst because I don't
need to light towers and stuff
you still need a camera pointed at your
face at least the camera can just go
around top of the monitor on top of the
the desk and I mean the lighthouses and
stuff I don't feel like having to run
power to those I guess if you're just
sitting stationary in front of the
computer the rift is probably the better
experience plus I like the controllers
on the rift better I'll give you that
one I do like the controllers better I
don't use the controllers at all but I
guess I just use it for the flight sim
but you know how hard it is to fly when
the whole world is tilting to the left I
don't know if I'm flying left or the
world of tilting left does that girly
got a crick in the neck you press it
down you can always tell who's never
used you can always always never used VR
because you know many people were like
just lean your head to the right it
doesn't work that way oh it doesn't work
that way it fucks with your perception
so bad it'll even give you a vertigo if
shit doesn't line up exactly in the game
as it does in real life because your
weight god of gyro in your head and yeah
and if the horizon in front of you does
not match up with what your head is
telling you then it's wrong so the
amount of people they're like we'll just
just tilt your head to the right a
little bit while you calibrate it's like
you don't understand calibration has
nothing to
do with tilt tilt and horizon it has to
do with the gyro inside the hmd so no
matter how many times you calibrate it
if it's wrong then it's not it's always
gonna be crooked and nothing makes you
feel more uneasy than a crooked horizon
in VR yeah well the other thing I like
about the HTC vive is that all the
tracking is done through the lighthouses
so so there's really no desire illage
I'm in it I think there's a gyro in
there but I don't think the user
primarily for the tilt because it tracks
that pattern no the horizon is still
based off the tilt on the hmd the
lighthouse is only to have to deal with
the 3d space are you sure about that
yeah okay well till I was only
controlled by the head interesting so
the rumor that the theory in the rumor
cuz I said I searched so many forms
because I was like damn it if I send
this off to oculus now they're gonna
send me back a refurb as I guess I
bought this thing brand new they're
gonna send me back a refurb they will
and so apparently happened with these
headsets is when they were calibrated
initially from the factory they probably
weren't level at that time and since all
right cuz if it's based if you basically
it's supposed to be in a perfectly level
environment when they run the
calibration tool that basically and it's
and we're talking about the gyro
calibration tool not the not like the
lighthouse calibration sorry the theory
has it is that that table might not have
been perfectly level so there's a
recalibration tool that's floating
around out there and you know it's based
on temperature too so it recalibrates
each increment of celsius so it'll
calibrate it like twenty eight twenty
eight point five twenty nine twenty nine
point five thirty so i don't know what
this temperature has to do with the gyro
but it affects it in some way I've run
that tool twice because you can get a
copy of the tool via you know forms and
stuff because oculus won't send the
right route I've recalibrated mine
multiple times and it's still crooked so
I'm gonna have to go through now and get
it replaced it's just it's sucks to go
and spend 400 bucks and it doesn't it's
wrong it's bad out of the box
totally I don't care but it was fifty
bucks
I don't care there's five bucks I don't
want to buy something that had to be bad
from the out of the package that's just
bullshit Wow okay so some people with
that looks like some people the HTC vive
are also experiencing a tilt issue on
some of the units yeah see my mine was
one of the very first retail units
period like available and
mine's perfectly fine but I've heard
it's funny because I I said on Twitter I
took kind of I got a little salty on
Twitter because I was just so butthurt
about it being crooked a lot of people
were like my oculus works fine my HTC
shit so it's like I don't know my vibes
been fine my oculus is shit so I think
that's gonna be the typical experience
you know some one of them is not gonna
work for you if you have both Oh one's
gonna suck so so I get I did a little
bit of reading on the HTC vive um it's
kind of a half-truth it doesn't just use
the gyro across references data from the
gyro the accelerometer and the laser
positioning sensor mhm to get its fix in
the world so I wonder if the rift is
just using one piece of data versus
everything that's available to it now
here's one thing that's kind of nice
about the the or the device and when the
vive pro comes out I'll replace the vibe
that's in my the game room you know the
full yeah yeah I'll take the one I
currently have and put it on the sim
because you can run just one lighthouse
on that for a seated position and be
fine that's cool I like I like that idea
that something like flight simulator you
might want to like turn around and look
over your your shoulder oh yeah you
might block it but if it's right in
front of me in front of them on it like
on top of the monitor it's still gonna
see the headset no matter what the two
lighthouses although they increases
accuracy and them in where you are in
that 3d space you only need one to
operate it it's just one is for if view
becomes obstructed but the the new
lighthouse pros though or the the vive
Pro is suppose to have much quieter
lighthouses like my upstairs if I turn
them everything off and I'm just sitting
there you can hear that high-pitched
buzzing coming from them
oh yeah no it's the same here if I guess
it's just me right it's a standing
mirror with a laser pointing at it and
they vibrate too like I don't realize
how much vibration that unit has you
hold it you you can tell something in
there is spinning like ass over
teakettle fast and you definitely don't
want to be holding it while it's doing
it because while it's on you don't want
to be Jolteon or whatever you can damage
it alright folks with the bearings in it
too right I don't you're right jack bro
I think it's suspended in there in some
way but like you really don't fall off
your wall while they're on yeah
the new ones are also supposed to be a
lot less susceptible to being affected
by direct sunlight and stuff because
you've seen my upstairs layout if I open
those windows it gets a lot of bright
sunlight in there it can kind of effect
because it's all IR right it can it
could be affected by the Sun but
it seems like they're both pretty much
geared for different scenarios right I
mean the the the HTC vive is a full room
experience and in the pros gonna be
Wireless - did you hear about that
there's gonna be a wireless option for
the pro right the playlist is also a
room skill now - yeah I'm wondering well
yeah but you have - how many how many
sensors do you have to cover a 15 by 15
foot area - oh really
yeah the one I bought us - oh shit I
didn't realize that they got it down to
- that's like that's actually the same
fact it's when I was just sitting there
it was telling me my play area was too
small interesting okay no so I could see
that being a being a big because I love
the controllers
I love the rift or the sorry that the
rift controllers I also think the
Riptide successor
I also think the refs rift headset is
better because it's lighter it is
lighter and scott better lenses - I
think the optics senator are better
mm-hmm
somebody was telling me I think was Adam
that was telling me that the optics and
because he has both right so the optics
and and each sorry and the rift are
better yeah I'll be able to give a
better assessment on which is better
once I have it working right because all
I can focus on right now is the like one
degree or one-and-a-half degree tilted
horizon yeah just really melting with me
my only complaint with VR is is
literally just the resolution so if they
increase the resolution I think VR still
got plenty of life and make to all the
people that think the ARS dead see and
as and as a as a resolution snob like
myself like I have to be in 1440 hundred
Hertz are better you know I mean I can
go in VR and deal with the resolution
for hours on end and not care all on the
same way but I but I do notice when I
play racing games like I know you
adapted to it a lot better than I did
but I noticed this mostly like in
project cars versus like rally racing
because you don't get up to the crazy
speeds in rally right right the corner
entry even though I've got the depth
perception the resolution still fucks
with my corner entry speed okay well I
think part of that too is because I do
so much track days in person that I'm
used to turning my head so I'm always
looking at the center of the hmd and not
the got to blurry peripheral that
actually makes a lot more sense whereas
I Drive I'm looking out way way ahead of
myself you know and then as I come into
the corner I'll start looking down into
the apex but it just a tries me nuts
because I can never get my
entry speed right with the resolution on
just a Rhonda on the HTC vive yeah Nick
Nick siesta and chat says VR is dead I
know it sounds subjective to me I get
that all the time though people say VR
is dead the cost is too high and I'll
admit the cost has come way down but but
the computer that you need to run a good
VR experience like at the top-end of
settings and everything is pretty
dramatic well and a lot of processing on
the moment the gamer senses that VR is
going on it drops post-processing it
drops anti-aliasing like all that stuff
because you have to maintain a 90 FPS
average yeah drops below that you get
sick you literally get sick so if you
guys have ever wondered about the human
9 FPS is science has said that 90 fps in
the game is where you need to be to
mimic reality yeah and if there's even
what what did they say is it like it has
to be with him I think 10 milliseconds
yeah on the dream pacing yeah the frame
piece has to be like within 10
milliseconds otherwise you'll get a
you'll get a vertigo effect in your
inner ear where it literally feels like
you're just like doing this they do a
great job at predicting though it's
amazing like I can like you said I can
stay in the rift for hours especially if
I'm playing a one-to-one game if it's a
game where I'm moving 1 2 1 to myself in
the game can stay in one long enough to
sweat 1 to death yes that's very true
it was the salt content it wasn't this
way yeah hey to be fair though HTC
didn't replace the headset and they did
say that it was their bad for not having
the seals properly like like they admit
they admitted that the seals in the riff
so if you if you kill a rift with our
sorry uh yeah oculus sorry no the vodka
by yeah I'm so confused the vibe if you
kill the vibe with sweat contact HTC and
see if they'll replace it because if
it's one of the older models that has
shitty seals in it that's why I died is
because like literally you sweat just
drained into the end of the board inside
when there should know that they were
actually considered sealed honestly
they're supposed to be sealed from the
backside so that any sweat or
perspiration inside of the lens doesn't
get into the electronics well I had no
idea so I don't think it's like sealed
on the back so don't think you can like
go in your bathtub and have a fuckin
like downhill you know rafting adventure
right there see but but but yeah
technically sweat should not kill it
like that's because sweat is very salty
and very conductive so they definitely
wanted to create it with that in mind so
I am sweat
yes I'm a salty as my hair is salt and
pepper
dude did you see that you see the
Instagram picture that though where we
set that we set the headset so I was
using the headset and I was in it I was
in there for about an hour and a half
playing a sword fighting game so I was
like swinging my arms I was exhausted I
was completely exhausted the band we set
the headset down on the floor we come
back after eating dinner there's
literally a circle about six inches out
in every direction around on his green
screen where the sweat just went down
through the headset it sent him to the
end of the green screen I saw it was
disgusting
it's so bad okay I'll admit I don't get
embarrassed that often without that was
pretty goddamn I also you were also
sitting on the ground and left a butt
stain 315 pounds what heats back not
this way as much and I drink coffee and
and I take adderall for ADHD so I don't
chase the squirrels in the front yard
why you sweating so much
well actually I sweat a lot before
adderall I don't take a lot I take like
I think it's like the 20 milligram xrl
two milligrams a day I take seven
thousand milk I said I snorted it's this
powder stuff and I snort it and doctor
said that's okay i snort my ATD meds
dude anybody that says adderall is
anything other than just a pure end feta
mean it's basically just metered meth
that's all it is
mmm but you'd be really disappointed if
you like went and bought math and it
only had the effect of a single adderall
like that all you I think would you buy
math or whatever you're actually getting
something that's like massively factored
stronger
I would imagine I've never been a meth
addict which is a miracle considering
where I grew up yeah I can't really
comment on that I know right
I don't like to talk about things I
experienced and fortunately that's one
of them that's true that's true
so I don't know we talk about cars over
here should we should we talk about the
new whip yeah I did do - absolutely man
that's like that's not that's a
milestone you've been hitting a lot of
milestones brother that car so it's
funny you can tell who who researches
cars and knows about cars versus their
response to that car
because you'll see those comments is
just a Camaro who gives a fuck to be
fair though I knew what that car was
capable of only because of one thing I
watch oh god what's that what's that
seer
he's on Netflix there's a series where
they have the the God on my brain just
fucking work you know that
no not roadkill it's that it's the older
guy that tests the cars around the track
oh yeah I know any timeout yeah yeah you
know talking about the guy he's really
kind of soft-spoken he wears glasses
yeah wears the glasses exactly I can't
remember his name up top my head but
anyways he took that he took your car
out it did a lap and he came back and he
was he like got out of the car and he's
like holy shit this thing has grip
mm-hmm he's like you do not expect that
from this car when you get in he's like
this thing he's got grip it's got power
to be said it you said it was amazing to
be fair I'm pretty sure that was the
seal 110 speed that he drove nothing 1le
no no it was the one le I'm almost
positive it was the one le because it
was there he said that it was there
absolute top spec write it at the time
granted and then they ran it against the
Corvette was it the Zr zo6 or zr1 or
whatever the hell it is they're fast
Corvette zr1 wasn't out yet at the time
it was the tenth of a second faster
they're working on new zr1 right now
because what Chevy's done it they've
allowed the F body team and the in the
and this the Corvette team to compete
with each other internally so where as
like a manufacturer would normally just
have like Randy post says named Randy
Pope's yeah so normally it's like
Chevy's like okay our top dog is our
Corvette and the Camaro is always gonna
be under that hierarchy right yeah well
that wasn't the case to stuff what they
allowed was each team to just create an
inter inner company competition to see
who could build the best pony car and so
the Camaro team came out with the zl1
the seal one was out the seal ones been
out for the fifth gen right 2012 2011 I
think there was eel ones and they were
always supercharged you know v8 sand yep
but in 2017 they bumped up the power
output to 650 horsepower and then in
2017 like mid 2017 they announced the
one le which is the extreme suspension
package the extreme handling package
yeah and basically it takes all of that
power 650 horsepower 650 Talon feet of
torque and coupled it with massively
wide and lightweight wheels so 305 tire
in the front 3:25 tires in the back came
with tires designed specifically for the
car which are by the way going to be
available for the general public later
this year from from Goodyear but they're
good your eagle f1 supercar three are so
basically they're 120 ere I can't say
tweed where I Selma Floyd anyway good
way there are 100 shred where do t slick
so basically it's got they've got what
laughingly and I'll post a picture
somebody remind me after after a tech
talk to post a picture of the tread they
have laughable amount of tread on them
like really that's you're calling that
tread it is the minimum amount of tread
required by it's by d-o-t it's also the
minimum minimum amount of tread we're
required by d-o-t so you know that like
has to be three three thirty seconds or
more to be not considered at bald tire
well what do you think my tread depth is
exactly that it's like the first light
we take it out for a test drive off the
showroom they gotta put new tires on it
so it's got three grooves on it do t
only requires two groups so they've got
three grooves on the inside of the tire
so the shoulder block is like half the
tire right and the shoulder block is
where you're all your grip is so when
you're turning all the weight goes on
the outside of the tire and the shoulder
block is is where all the grip happens
so the has three grooves on the inside
of the tire and the treads which are
normally you know they sort of angle out
towards the front of the car to kind of
scoop up water and get it out yeah my
treads are in perpendicular to the tire
so they're not angled at all they're
straight and they're super short and
there's hardly anything to them so they
are they are by all intents and purposes
a street slick and so the very first day
I drove the car was in the rain and that
was interesting to say the least Nick
was with me I think that gif I put up
there of that dog trying to walk it
trying to run in the rain was probably
the best way to put it and just slipping
and sliding everywhere so I buy the car
on Sunday and so it's a 20-18 zl1 1le
camaro and i couldn't drive it because
we I came home parked the car and then
we went out to Long Beach to have a
birthday wine and dinner with friend and
I was like I am NOT driving the one le
to Long Beach Long Beach has another
potholes it's only street parking on the
major streets I'm like I'm not gonna I'm
not about to have someone
crash into my car the first day I got it
so the next day Nick and I go out for a
drive and I'm like let's go up into the
canyon well was raining that day and
what do you think happens in the
mountains when it's raining here it
snows so that the very first day I had
it ended up in the snow and I was like
screw this we turned around and came
back down the hill because Nick was
looking out the window he's like I think
there's ice on the ground I'm like
really it's like yeah dude I'm pretty
sure that that's like snowing out there
I was like I don't know doesn't I was I
was wondering if it was just like a haze
and then next thing I know like we start
seeing the the snowflakes falling from
the sky I was like oh crap this is not
the car to be caught in the snow so
what's what are the odds Jerry that the
first day I buy that car it ends up in
the snow turned around man after my
little experience on the snow that my
butt cheeks would be puckered in that
car holy shit see glad you made a home
safe though see the perfect example
though of and I'm not I'm not putting
I'm not putting anyone down I just wanna
preface this true car people know that
the zl1 when only is a manual because
I'm see a lot of like manual auto man
you ought oh that one oles only coming
manual you only come in six feet the zl1
non and when le how God intended je the
nut the non one o Li Zi hua zl1 comes in
a ten speed automatic or a manual so
that that's just the difference like the
people that like goats just a Camaro
with the big deal it's 650 horsepower
from the factory that's a big deal a
pulley change an intake in a tune will
get me 615 wheel horsepower it'll add a
hundred horsepower to the car with those
three parts so it's like the tuning like
baseline on this car is ridiculously
high sorry I'm reading a spec on your
car here versus the challenger hellcat
that's the same speed it's just as fast
yeah the Hellcats one mile per hour
slower at the end of the quarter it's uh
well according to this has said yeah
it's - it's two tenths of a second zero
to sixty but similar times to 125 miles
an hour
mm-hmm and the Hellcat weighs 400 pounds
more the Hellcat also has more torque
yeah I'd imagine okay I mean reason it's
so heavy is cuz the fucking massive
motor right in this with a wheel well I
mean it also has 57 more horsepower to
put up the same numbers and it can't
turn like a Zeile one for sure yeah and
now they got the demon I I haven't
looked in much into the demon isn't it
like another hundred horsepower or
something like that but similar
spec's otherwise the denotes hundred
dodge deep it's the new follow-up to the
Hellcat yeah
but the nice thing about the see what
else so here's the thing I'm surprised
to get a GTR honestly though while we're
shopping for a GTR okay the car has a
twenty thousand dollar markup not the
GTR the one le the yellow shoe took the
price of the car and wanted twenty
thousand extra dollars basically I was
like hell no we walked out of there for
less than MSRP so we worked a really
good deal on this car yeah and you
weren't gonna get that on a GTR I think
the GTRs are still unless you know
somebody you're gonna get Rick Joker the
GTR base is ninety nine thousand are you
shitting me yeah they came out with a
base like a stripped GTR that doesn't
have like a lot of the luxury features
but it has all the power
yeah ninety nine thousand Wow I wouldn't
be in the GTR is only what five hundred
and fifty horsepower but the GTR still
has a faster quarter-mile time because
of its all-wheel-drive the
all-wheel-drive is always going to do
that it's unfair to compare rear-wheel
drive din all-wheel drive if you put
big-ass hubbed rear end in your car you
would you'd run it down right so the but
it suck in the corners I'm seeing no one
can seem to agree on what the actual
demon horsepower is it looks like it's
right around 840 to 850 horsepower
I know it's over 800 I know it's between
800 and 900 and and rumor had it back
when they were first announcing it that
it was gonna have 900 plus horsepower
but for some reason dodge didn't stick
so I explained the rationale about the
why the one le was the car I would
because I have talked about this before
you've asked me a million times J what
your what's your dream car I was like I
don't dream about McLaren and stuff and
you're like wait have you had to it's
like okay fine is the old one one only
how many times did I say that the l11
Elise I don't remember zl1 one le but I
do remember you saying Camaro and I
laughed hysterically at you didn't you
used to have a Camaro and race a Camaro
back in the day yeah my very first
sports car was an 89 RS Camaro and then
that got wrecked three months after I
owned it I got rear-ended at a stoplight
and then I replaced it with a 90 Tuesday
28 yeah so see it's so I knew you were
gonna eventually you know go back to it
I would only I would not own any Camaro
but in one only zero one one le I was
very very like up for I was like I would
never own a Camaro this is the only one
le and I've answered that many times
what's the specific thing about it
though the reason why that is like was
it was involves a horsepower and the
handling
it usually with an American muscle car
like the Z is a perfect example I take
the Z to the track and I smash on
Mustangs all day long
Mustangs with twice my horsepower
because for whatever reason shelby's
aside Mustangs just don't handle well I
mean there's obviously all the memes for
that reason but even on the track
Mustang challenge groups are there and
I'm putting down faster times and
Mustangs Nick rode with me when I lapped
the entire field of Mustangs now the
difference is I don't have the power so
you take me off a track you put me on
the freeway I'm gonna get smashed on by
Mustangs all day long same thing with
Camaros same things with demons you know
challengers obviously demons but even
just standard r/t or scat pack
challenges and chargers you put me on a
track that's my element the zl1 gives me
all that straight line performance and
it still out handles my Z yeah that's
why it and the thing is that car is
cheaper than anything else that has that
kind of power that car has a faster lap
time then every McLaren that McLaren has
made short of the P 1 C the only McLaren
fast when the CL one on Laguna Seca is a
p1 do the math on that well it's a
badass looking car - I mean credit where
credit's due I'm not a huge big American
car guy but looking I'm looking at
pictures of it right now the styling do
you got the wing on the back ears of
course that's part of the one le package
well I didn't know I didn't know if it
was if it's an option or not on top of
that so the z11 le is the most spectrum
arrow now one of my Clayton says I'm
full of shit in my car fuck you Clayton
anyway so the seal one one le I was kind
of like man if they wanted this to be a
truly likes track car like a like a like
a track spec car they should have like
stripped it out made it lighter less
amenities like the like Porsche does
with the GT cars right right it has you
know straps it has mesh straps for door
handles right just to make it light
right save ten ounces and charge another
$20,000 yeah my problem my problem with
the oh god this camera is being so
stupid hold on guys let me see if I can
fix this here the my problem with the
one le is the fact that it was an
addition so each time you stepped up you
know rs/ss Z l-1011 le you added stuff
to the car and they didn't take anything
away so the one only has the full
Alcantara
wait interior it's got the the giant
infotainment Center it's got everything
like every feature yeah what's that
carbon fiber dashboard - I don't think
it's carbon fiber do you not have that
okay right here this a carbon fiber they
might pay they might paint it in some of
the cars too to match the outside or
something I haven't looked at it all
that closely but anyway got cheerier
looks awesome though I'm looking I'm
looking at pictures of it right now they
twenty guys it has RGB the interior
lighting is our DV they changed the
styling a lot though the inside doesn't
look all crazy boxy like the old ones
but I mean let me finish my point though
important they've came out with a z28
track spec a few years ago and that took
away everything that like that
air-conditioning was an option like that
car was designed and I had like one
speaker for the radio right that was
ugly stripped-down z28 or track car but
it didn't sell very well so GM was like
very adamant that the one le is the O
one one le package was like the top dog
was supposed to have everything like the
car that I bought I bought it for okay
so each dealership has like one in
California so the dealership I buy it
from had one white one and white was not
my first color it was gunmetal gray the
same color is my truck was what I wanted
it's a good color for California though
white yeah just keep the heat out well
black interior but so anyway the
dealership I went to had white each
dealership had like a different color
and I was looking at the entire like
chevy inventory online and the problem
was the only one that had the PDR the
performance data recorder is the one
that I bought so might the one I bought
literally has every option available for
the Camaro but the PDR is what I really
wanted that's the one that will video
and put up all the real-time telemetry
on the video so all I have to do is put
an SD card in my car go on track hit
record and it record everything while
I'm driving and that's what I wanted so
it's a pretty neat it's pretty neat
function yeah I'm just looking up
comparing it to all these cars like the
Ferrari Enzo the 488 GTB Porsche 911 gt2
I mean anything that compares the
Porsche 911 gt2 is is pretty amazing
what are you looking at specifically so
on your I'm looking at a long B to
webpages Motor Trend the 2018
like Camaro zl1 1le first test review
guys Phil is not Asian he's human
although it like I said
agents are humans let me let me rephrase
this oh wow it's not what I meant that's
not what I meant I meant it doesn't
matter if he's Asian or not he is a
human to us clarification bro what okay
I've seen a lot of comments saying J as
a new slave why do all the tech guys
have Asian editors because Asians are
better there I fixed it Wow exam is
camera the computers that the software
runs on is that why that's not what I
was trying to say I was not I was not
trying that totally made it sound like I
was saying Asians are subhuman which is
not what I was saying I think they are
the superior race well I mean gingers
don't have souls so I guess we can just
add that to the girl you can tell I'm
legitimately embarrassed look how red I
turned right now yeah I'm pretty
embarrassed I'm waiting for the replay
[Laughter]
mmm you guys are gonna notice some
improvements in our videos moving
forward this is Phil's inauguration Phil
hi Phil Phil is a is our our he is a now
a new camera operator for us and an
editor so now we are able to like stack
our workflow so we have an editor while
we're filming and we have another guy
that's filming while editing so we've
we've got some races Jay my wife just
texted me and said racist Jay so so so
what's your Sanjay is now all you got to
do is just sit around on your ass in
front of the camera and be a goofball
and get paid and go by go race your car
on the weekend let me let me tell you
what was amazing today for the first
time since starting this channel cuz it
people don't seem to realize this nick
has never edited a video for me nick is
not an editor he's can edit photos he
knows Photoshop workflow fairly well but
he is not a Video Editor he's never
edited a video for me
so today I wouldn't got a haircut and
when I came back I had a video that was
almost done being edited that was weird
that was weird cuz normally when I leave
work stops but
that never happens to me I always leave
the room and come back and the shits
still sitting in the folder I don't know
what I'm doing wrong J well you got to
hire yourself an Asian Gordon of the
Internet where does one person pick up
said Asian video editor J where's the
best place to pick them up Wow
no seriously there has probably never
been a worse delivery of trying to say
that we are all human beings than the
way I delivered that statement Wow oh it
was priceless
my wife when your wife texts you and
calls you racist oh my god to be fair
though she likes to poke you with a
stick I mean she you guys are perfect
for each other
yeah so they can court a post Malone and
lay naked in his studio what sounds like
some of the internet would say okay well
when the giveaway winner be announced
it's not you Jimbo J it wasn't you
they already announced that it was me I
already collected on it so it's sitting
behind me in a box oh man we used gleam
gleam net I mean got net like the winner
all right so we got another topic here
to kind of finish out the show with oh
you want to go dragon heart attack
no I'm limited to only one sexual
encounter at AJ okay for health reasons
and I and I almost died so we might have
to cut the back like three times a week
so the co-founder of Facebook is
concerned that technology is taking away
jobs now that's been a legitimate
conversation that's been taking place
for a while right especially the
automation of warehouses and
manufacturing and stuff yeah right cuz
that doesn't doesn't
Amazon even have like now know Amazon
has human Pickers but aren't there
warehouses that actually have robots
that will like go and pick things off
the shelf yeah I bet you the the the
error rate is much lower with a robot
but anyway I digress the co-founder of
Facebook is concerned about that so what
he is suggesting is that if you make
less than $50,000 a year the US
government should pay you $500 per month
stiffened to be paid for by raising the
taxes on the wealthy by 1% so these are
these are two different conversations
and we're not gonna touch we're not
going to touch the taxing the wealthy
because that's so subjective there's not
gonna ever be a be as you have you're
poor you're gonna agree with the laws
the benefit the poor of your age you're
gonna agree with the law benefit the
rich it's just that well it just
raising taxes on the wealthy but now you
have to determine where that line is so
that's not even a conversation we can
have because they didn't even talk about
where that line is but well technically
I'm poor now so I want that $500 so I'm
gonna fight for the $500 Jay $50,000 in
2018 does not go a long way we know this
so it doesn't but I want to talk about
the technology taking jobs because we
talked about something like this similar
on tech talk a while back who did and
people got really salty when I was
basically saying that I'm for the the
expansion of technology in the workplace
where it makes sense and I guess really
angry emails people telling me that I'm
like anti-human one could argue that I
replaced myself Microsoft I mean I was
an automation developer my job was to
create automation to minimize the work
force I mean that literally was my job
oh I argued that yeah so for automation
because I believe that the creation of
the automation is a new job in itself
and maintaining the automation is a job
for every job that's killed there's
another job created yeah well I think
what we're think what we're talking
about here is the McDonald's now putting
the self-serve kiosk order
you know kiosk at the at the McDonald's
theocracies commentary dude
yeah you just order your burger and like
I popped out
but anyway know it so this is this is
probably all over the all over the
country but at the McDonald's that's
over by Disneyland which is one that
will stop out every now and then for the
kids you walk in that you can now this
did not replace the cashier the cashier
is still there it's just now if you
don't feel like standing in the line you
can walk up to the little order kiosk
order your food putting your credit card
it spits out a number and then you go to
your table
actually no you pick up the number from
the bottom you type in what number it
was you picked up you go to your table
and then the food comes what I found
really strange this this McDonald's if
you guys are in Southern California norm
Tom Matz on the corner of State College
and ball road that McDonald's right
there is always busy because it's close
to Disneyland and it's in a very highly
populated area yep I walked in and there
must have been 25 people in line
standing there waiting to order not a
single person was using that kiosk I
went this is stupid
I walked up to the kiosk made my order
sat down and my
was at my table before the people that
were standing in line when I got there
had even ordered yet they were still
standing in line so I for the life of me
couldn't figure out why they were why
they didn't want to use the order kiosk
thing but I did not thought it was great
because if the order was wrong I had
myself to blame right because I and I
would enter it wrong or whatever so I
did the order did actually come out
incorrect my wife will my wife was there
for this the order did come out
incorrect I like what the heck and I
looked at the receipt I'm like oh I
pushed the wrong thing so it was totally
on me which was kind of which was funny
you can also order on your cell phone to
there's a McDonald's app we've used that
before where you just literally just
walk in the front doors go through the
drive-through they just hand your order
it's all paid for and ready to go yeah
so anyway I had I thought it was great
um same thing like Starbucks now you can
order your drinks on your phone walk in
it's there what if you pick it up that
one's not technically taking away a job
cuz the same people are making it it's
just no one was standing there taking
your order yes make it more efficient
yeah so the the the concern here is
we're and this is the direct I sort of
want to take it is if you're taking if
you're replacing these low-level jobs
like these minimum wage paying jobs with
a machine people are concerned that the
poverty levels going to get worse and
there's gonna be a bigger gap in society
between poverty and middle class
whatever I don't think that's I think
that's realistic that's probably a
realistic result for things like kiosks
and stuff like that but the question is
you know you sort that people back
they're making the food you just have
one less person taking the order that
person could be back there making the
food as far as I'm concerned McDonald's
is always gonna have enough orders to
have cooks back there running around and
stuff but we do not make the drink
machine though did you see that no the
drink machines like a conveyor belt that
just goes into a circle they just load
like 12 cups and do it it just goes
around and fills them and then bring
some for the next order so you just grab
whatever cups are right there when the
orders over and out the wind so is that
taking a job or is it allowing that
human to do a different job well if you
if you had so many orders coming in that
you basically needed a dedicated person
to fill drinks which I'd imagine in a
place like McDonald's could happen if
you have like multiple Drive there's
multiple windows that yeah I guess you
would be taking away a job but then the
flip side of it is how many people did
it take to develop and maintain that
machine like the company how many people
work for the corporation that developed
the automated fucking drink mechanism
yeah and there is the divide you are
gonna have these these low level minimum
wage college / high school jobs
well that did not have degrees yet or
have not you know they don't they don't
have any of those special skills to go
and work for a company like that they
rely on these low-level jobs now now
you're talking about the argument of
living wage for a minute for jobs like
that that's a whole different argument
I'm not going to touch today and nobody
working at McDonald's was ever intended
to be able to afford a house but the the
fact is you those you're gonna make more
jobs with all the automation and all the
robot designing and all the robot
maintenance and all that stuff but
you're you're creating jobs in a
different in a completely different
market so I don't know I don't know I
don't know honestly it's a hard argument
because I mean there's there's a lot of
data to aggregate on this one because
you have to look at okay the one is is
there a one-to-one ratio between a job
being taken a job being created
elsewhere again like you said is the job
that's being created elsewhere too high
of a ceiling for anybody to use as an
entry-level job if there aren't
entry-level jobs or people gonna be able
to afford education so that they can
then reach and get the higher paying
higher level jobs I mean there's
definitely a problem right there but
there's a problem either way I mean the
problem that we're dealing with right
now here in Washington is that certain
places like boosted the minimum wage if
like $15 now are in restaurant owners
you know that have such thin margins
can't afford to employ people anymore
well so now everybody's like part-time
and they're closing down and stuff like
that and then that's also reducing the
jobs there was also that demand
especially in California to have raised
the minimum wage member and everyone was
like 15 an hour 15 an hour pay us 15 an
hour like the every job paid at least 15
an hour right actually I was I think was
fast-food specifically that's more per
hour than like my friend that works at
it was an EMS yep emergency medical
response was making less than a person
out there flipping burgers demanding
more money so anyway the the answer to
that in California specifically with
these McDonald's and stuff was not to so
in quote-unquote you know have
technology replaced a job but it was
like hey we could have a one-time
expense with maybe some recurring
maintenance cost that can replace this
job overtime to save money it was about
saving money it wasn't necessarily about
efficiency
I think efficiency is a side effect but
you're still gonna have I mean you're
gonna I do you think we're gonna see
like I Robot you know floor sweepers and
stuff running around McDonald's no
that's always going to be human job
that's
that's how many people said that like
five years ago about the people taking
the orders or the window what's gonna
happen when the guys making the food in
the back just put the shit on the
conveyor belt and it just fucking farts
out the side of the building into your
car and then they don't need like person
work in the window or even taking the
order you know how am I gonna yell that
that they made my order wrong yeah
there's gonna be a number call this
number if there's gonna be call a call
centre on the other side just arguably
is even lower it requires less education
to take that call in the process I mean
if any of us have ever called a
technology company Hummer Microsoft
India tech support center you don't know
that Tier one isn't very bright I mean
did you try turning it up and turn it
back on I mean that is the canned
response yeah so so again I mean it's I
guess it depends but like certain things
that have good intentions have happened
that have caused bad things
I don't think automation actually is one
of them I think automation is actually
something that allows us to keep up
supply with demand without automation
that would never happen right yeah a
McDonald's technically could become
encumbered no matter how many people you
had working there the physical space
that they would occupy could arguably be
more than what automation could do if it
was all perfectly efficient yeah right
because you're never gonna have a team
of people like you're never gonna have a
mcdonalds team that trains like a nascar
crew right i mean they're not gonna be
like flawlessly affect effective have
you do you recall anyone complaining
about the self-checkout lines at the
grocery store in the Walmart's and the
lows and all that no but we did have a
problem with our local store where
people were figuring out workarounds to
basically rob the store so they shut the
lanes down like our local store no
longer has self checkout lanes because
like people were just like making off of
shit really yeah see we have the self
checkout lines but there's like people
they're kind of monitoring what's going
on so I mean yeah we have to but for
some reason they weren't doing a very
good job because people were like just
put shit in their pockets like one for
you one for me one for you one for me
and it was so bad that they had to shut
it down yeah well it's kind of like the
Amazon store in Seattle right yeah
exactly like the Amazon store like the
Amazon store you comes Amazon store you
can go in there I'll watch lines this
video but it looks like you can go in
there and walk out and it charges you
all that stuff and be like oh nope I
didn't get this or this or this and it
will just it'll just refund you that's
how he technique well not only that if
you take stuff that it didn't charge you
for it basically just counts it as loss
like
there's no way to return it there's not
even a mechanism to go back to store and
be like hey I didn't buy this you know
15 bucks there's a mechanism to even
return an item to the store you can you
can get your refund but they can't take
it back yeah but then so just to give
you an idea they're moving so much
volume through there that with that
automation and not having to pay the
salary of you know like let's say 20
people to run that store or 15 people to
run that store arguably the loss like if
people walk out and everybody gets a
free item technically they're still
doing okay overall well yeah it's I mean
loss prevention yeah that's all factored
in right every store has a loss
prevention basically not a budget but
they they have a certain loss that they
can sustain before it's so bad that they
basically have like retool the whole
loss prevention process to fix it yeah
to be honest if you're smart enough to
be able to steal from self-checkouts
then you should be allowed to keep it
laughing my ass off so really so
basically the well we just found a thief
in chat I'm just trying to wrap my mind
about that one there there are people
every now and then that speak up that
just make you realize that the world is
so screwed okay just to play devil's
advocate or to myself on that one
because I think I think stealing is is
it's fundamentally wrong on many levels
but but just just to play devil's
advocate there you do have the Amazon
store which is saying that they've got
this mechanism so fuckin figured out
that there's no way that they don't have
a return they'd only have a place for
people to bring back shit that they fuck
up so they do have an overconfidence in
that area so I would argue that if you
go into the Amazon store with your app
and you're not intentionally trying to
do something circumvent the system in a
technological level and you leave with a
bunch of free shit there's cysts there
systems broke and you literally just
help them expose a bug so basically that
guy said is if I'm smart enough to walk
into a Walmart and put this chocobar in
my pocket and just walk out with it then
I should be able to keep it that was the
same voice I had my head when I was
rereading it so that's how stupid it
sounds yeah sound really really stupid
they should have a mechanism at the
Amazon store that's like if you do leave
and you have an item that you didn't pay
for uh-huh they should have like a
little number or an app where you can
just push a button and it's like you get
to keep it but just please tell us what
it was you know so that I can start
fortifying their system and that way you
didn't really get a free item and that
way it was a different exchange right
they got a piece of information to help
them stabilize and find a vulnerability
in their system and you got four
damn packs yeah I mean like those you
time at the voice right there he's like
the guy in in in deoxy it's like a lot
of money yeah money I'll give you 11
billion
eleventy billion dollars you broke my
apartment I broke my apartment the kiosk
in McDonald's is funny cuz remember the
lady walks up to the Carl's jr. kiosk
she's like one large fry and it's like
here's your large fry and she's like
shit there isn't a large fry here and
she started she hits the machine it's
like man you've just assaulted the
machine you're calling the police and
then he hits it again that's like your
account is now zero credits we have
notified the police that you're an unfit
parent your children have been taken
from you yeah it's like oh my god that's
where automation is gonna go if we let
their there has to be a line right you
can automate everything because if every
single job is automated and all you have
left is the people that are making and
maintaining the automation I think this
system just gets too heavy on one side
you have a whole new set of problems so
there's always gonna be a happy balance
I think there's always got to be at
least some human presence somewhere and
I think even the Amazon store does have
human presence if I'm not mistaken
there's people making sure that cell
phones are getting scammed and shit
coming in the door the toad I like money
they're like money or you know there's
at least one person in chat that talks
like that okay stop making fun of me
that's the best the mouth-breather guide
thank you for choosing Carl's jr. fuck
you I'm eating or Fuddruckers those butt
fuckers around that been a few months I
watch it every six like at least once
every six months that's that's one of my
all-time faves every time I watch it I
was like damn that part came true I'm
just waiting for the dust ball my grass
to be dying cuz there's water over
Bronto it's got electrolytes
electrolytes what you want we're gonna
get some water around yours like we lose
water in the toilets what do you want
that for to drink oh yeah you want to
drink toilet drink toilet water you
right the plants growing pledge look to
light Ted plant the crave electrolytes
it's so good a Tecna scope it's a
idiocracy you want to know which was an
idiocy it's done by Mike judge the same
guy that did beat us in my head and came
out king of a hill - yeah it's
definitely yeah king of a know also yeah
it's definitely like one of those movies
like office space where it's just you
have to watch it I love it I love the so
Terry Crews was obviously president
Camacho macchu what I love is like his
teleprompter shit times are tough but
it's on the teleprompter shit it was it
wasn't it wasn't it like shit I know
times are tough and it was like pick up
machine gun or something like that the
machine gun pick up was and people
started like murmuring and questioning
him but then everyone turns on them big
I wanna I wanna it's got it's not
basically an all-star cast everybody in
the movie you will recognize it's like s
you know past SNL actors and stuff like
that I mean it's it's a really well-done
but incredibly cheesy movie and it's
done in the form of a documentary with
like a third person there like narrating
it it's it's it's fucking awesome the
captain in chat says hey Jay
everyone mouth breeds it's a proven
medical fact
I mean I'm breathing through my nose
right now I mean some air might slip in
through my mouth while I'm doing things
with my mouth through your mouth but if
you sound like you're snoring when
you're awake you know that's a mouth
breather yeah I can actually disprove
them because I have a CPAP machine that
seals up to my nose and if I even open
my mouth air just comes blowing out like
a leaf blower and wakes me up so I have
to keep my mouth closed while I breathe
ernight imagine your mouth opens up and
it sounds like one of those gas powered
blowers it's like
like an air raid siren the cats run off
the bad wife wakes up wow so it took me
about a week to learn to keep my fucking
mouth shut like for the first week is
that when I relaxed my mouth just
naturally wants to open up under
pressure but after about a week of using
it your body adapts to it and then you
can kind of do this thing where when you
close your mouth your tongue almost
becomes like a dam to cut the pressure
to your mouth yeah and so now it doesn't
do anymore now I can breathe through my
nose no problem while I'm sleeping but
holy shit man first couple times I open
my mouth there's nothing weird it feels
like you're exhaling infinitely yeah
yeah like even though you're sitting
there breathing and the air is always
coming out of your mouth it is fucking
weird I'm gonna do an Instagram video
tonight guys watch my Instagram I can do
an Instagram video what happens with a
CPAP when you open your mouth it's
fucking hilarious you create a rip in
the space-time time and the time to
remember the time machine yeah yeah yeah
you can't talk to your your past self as
your future self yeah today I almost had
a heart attack getting a latte
William hearses I am a cook and the goal
of all corporate restaurants is to
minimize labor and replace people
anywhere they can some have even
replaced cooking jobs with conveyor
ovens you guys are oh yeah yeah okay
I've seen conveyor ovens but there's
still a human that puts the food on the
comer
I I have seen a fully automated pizza
place in Japan on a TV show where where
it was like a robotic arm put all the
ingredients on the thing the slid and
oven came up to the sign it popped out
the side of the building and it was your
pizza ready and there was like no humans
in the building okay so that I haven't
seen but I do know that like most of the
modern like pizza joints now like I know
I think Pizza Hut's one of them like
they'll they'll they'll make the pizza
on one end they stick it on the conveyor
it just goes through the oven with like
the perfect amount of time and then it
pops out the other right side done but I
think what he's saying is it's cheaper
to have a conveyor system for food like
that and pay a guy next to nothing to
put the food on there versus paying an
actual chef and a sous chef and all that
stuff you know well I mean it's cheaper
to buy even if the minute even if the
machine costs 250 thousand dollars if
you have to pay somebody a $40,000 a
year salary the machine pays for itself
and eventually just becomes pure profit
after that bar needs to use a party horn
with that
imagine putting a kazoo on your seat
back it's like they put the turkey call
and it's on the tailpipe of the car yeah
oh no yeah I seen those before yeah
laughs valve in a turbo yep I saw that
that was hilarious
[Laughter]
yeah I've seen I've seen the pizza
vending machines to actually used one
come to think of it last time I went to
the pile fair there's a pizza vending
machine there I fed a $5 bill in and
through the little window you watch like
this rotating drum come around and like
sprinkle ingredients on it but I'll be
honest it was the nastiest fucking pizza
I've ever eaten in my life
like I would rather have had a frozen
pizza in a microwave than what it
produced but y'all fair
yeah P a fair do you the PL up that's a
weird name Kel it's all that all the
city names if there were you are weird
she's no Kwame Stallings Botsman said
mcdonald's should replace their ovens
with hair dryers oh my god somebody's
been watching my videos I probably
really better view probably probably so
are real are we all about fucked this
cofounder guy and his his $500 a month
stipend bullshit or stipends already
need then you know you know what here
I'm gonna say this because I've lived on
all just just to clarify here
I've lived in well I haven't ever been
like rich rich but I've been well-off
I've been in middle class and I've been
poor is fucking dirt like I've lived in
all three of those arenas and not
necessarily in order like I'm all over
the place but uh but the one thing I'll
tell you is honestly what we need is a
flat tax no one will ever agree with
that I'll never agree with it but but
honestly like any way that I look at it
from like a system as far as having a
fair system is a flat tax but then the
problem that you run into is of course
you have people that don't make enough
money to actually pay the taxes and you
put them into a hole so I so I
understand why flat tax doesn't
necessarily work and the way the system
is built today but if the system was
built correctly a flat tax would have
worked
everybody should have a job that's that
I guess that's where people are scared
about automation taking jobs right is at
the end of the day everybody needs a job
look don't have a job you're effectively
homeless as a business myself as these
look these I love these two gentlemen
behind me but they cost me money they do
I pay half of the tax
for both of these guys and here's the
thing when it comes to bringing on
people the human resource is the most
expensive drain on any company the human
resource is the most expensive and the
reality here is that when it comes time
to hire people it's it's a serious way
that you're seriously weighing the value
of human resource versus like what can i
what tool can I get to do this job or do
I actually need a human to do this job
and it's unfortunate but that that's
that's where we are and so I understand
the companies that are reluctant to hire
and of course if you're a person out
there shopping for job you like I need a
job you like just hire me I'll find
something to do it doesn't work out that
with the companies so I here's here as
somebody who's been sole propping is now
incorporated and all that stuff you know
my solution to the economy is you ready
because it's probably super basic I
think anyone out there that sole prop
will agree with me I'm sure with the
3,000 people watching at least one
person out there is a sole proprietor
get rid of the self-employment tax gone
here and get rid of it a man I would
even be an S corp if it wasn't for the
goddamn self-employment tax so if you
guys don't know what the self-employment
tax is if you are a sole proprietor it
means you are the you are just a person
doing business under your name and under
your social security number
yep you pay an automatic extra fifteen
percent at the end of the year whatever
yours eighty is it 18 I think it can
slide actually about mine I've always
used the term 15 as I think that's the
minimum it's a lot can go as high as 20
I believe yeah
so if you are just doing business for
yourself your your your whatever John
out there washing cars and they pay you
and you in your report to the tax and
you're trying to be on the up-and-up
this is why you here under the table
because they don't want to report the
earnings because they keep their their
tax liability low so if you're out there
as a sole proprietor doing business and
at the end of the year let's say you owe
the government $15,000 because 1099
whatever okay $10,000 the government
goes okay you owe us $10,000 blah blah
blah oh you're a self employer your
self-employment your night escort you're
not c-corp you know LLC area here that
is now $1,500 that you owe us so it's a
fifteen percent minimum extra text
that's for nothing more than the fact
that you don't work for a corporation
that is why I think they do it though
like I have a conspiracy here my
condition I thought and then give me
that go for it where I think we will
stimulate this economy as let more
people go out there and work for
themselves let more people go out there
find creative ways to make money and not
take a hit from the government simply
before the fact that you don't work for
somebody else
screw that that is where this country is
fucked and that is why so many people
are anti corporate in this world not
just because of the fact that the
corporations are out there funneling
millions of dollars into into
politicians because of special interests
it's the fact that miss Mike out there
washing cars or Joe over here trying to
just have a food truck can't do it
without being hit with a 15% tax simply
for the fact that he works for himself
that's bullshit the economy would be
fixed nearly overnight if everybody
could be their own employer and just
find ways to creatively make money that
is where I as somebody who's lived both
working for someone else been a sole
prop and now a corporation that is how
you fix the economy
I completely agree I saw I saw a
wouldn't call may go by about flat tax
is stupid because it punishes the poor
and lets the rich pay less no it doesn't
it 10 percent 10 percent 10 percent it's
actually perfectly fair you're
everybody's paying the exact same tax
but if I make a million dollars a year
I'm paying a hundred thousand in taxes
if you make ten thousand you're paying
one thousand I'm paying out what I'm you
yep so let me is let me code that that's
the obvious one now the one that isn't
obvious is part of the flat tax is also
closing all the loopholes yeah cuz cuz
right now I know somebody who's filthy
rich this shall remain silent the pays
like you know next to nothing like let
less than five percent a year in taxes
you know why because the rich have shit
loads of loopholes it doesn't matter if
they're taxed at the higher rate it
doesn't matter because they have all the
loopholes and all the shelters and
everything like that there needs to be a
flat unavoidable tax yeah now I
understand why it's not gonna happen
though the system doesn't support it our
current system I'm not one of those
people where I just think you just
fucking make a law and everything
changes instantly no the system doesn't
support it because that would that would
there's there's there's no greed there
yeah I mean because our system is pretty
green centric yeah
and the problem is there's no
accountability for the tax dollars I was
gonna tell you I was gonna tell you why
my conspiracy my big conspiracy to the
self-employment tax is because I think
if there's a ton of people that are
self-employed they're just you know
basically one person one company and
they're filing tax returns that puts a
bigger load of tax returns on the IRS
then had they're processing through the
companies you know as far as verifying
the dollars and everything like that so
they just assume that everybody's
fucking raking them over the coals and
that there's overhead so they just tax
you for it basically which is both
because whether you're whether you're
whether you're doing a well it's
probably because we're dealing with
Schedule season stuff but that doesn't
mean anything to them that puts more but
okay look if you have more people
working for themselves
you actually boost the economy too
because you're actually giving CPA is
intact preparers more work to do that
doesn't put more work on the government
or or they or the IRS if I it doesn't
matter at the end of the year everyone
has to file something yeah and it's all
automated now anyway there's not a human
on the IRS looking over each tax return
it's all going through a system the
system all those boxes flop into some
database somewhere and then audits are
triggered based on on thresholds and
suffered and died this is out of whack
when trigger an audit right so it's not
putting any more work on the IRS it's
just it's just a system that continues
to perpetuate you know income greed for
the government it's really I just think
yeah I just think it just makes it
harder for them to look at all the
individual like it like if everybody was
a self-employed person the amount of
returns that were coming in would be so
massive they wouldn't be able to comb
over them and audit at the same rate
that they are right now so it'd be
easier for you to slip things past them
right but how the fuck is that our
problem yeah it's it's your tax system
like like this because I agree with you
100% if everybody could say listen I
can't get a job this industry is fucked
there's no job and they go set their ass
down at the library they find something
they're passionate about they become a
fucking expert in their field or what
the internet fucked a library the
internet go become an expert your feel
that's something you're passionate about
you should be able to make a living off
that without having to basically have
the IRS rip you down and kick you in the
balls until you can fucking overcome
their gravity and start making a living
yeah it's almost like the 15% is there
just to say fuck you don't even try
unless you're 100% sure and it's like
that's that's not very American yeah
well I don't know
I mean I don't know if it would curb
people being creative with their
bookkeeping in their deductions but I'm
it's a whole nother conversation for
another day it is it is anyway 631 I
think it's time to go home
oh it's time to done shut this shit down
no new things and stuff and thanks guys
thanks for hanging out with us today if
we missed your super chat we apologize
but like we said a while back we are
we're focusing on the conversation
keeping the flow going rather than
reading super chats all day so we don't
mean to offend but thank you for
donations nonetheless so you're pretty
you got any YouTube videos coming up or
are you still just doing the Twitter
thing well I did get my new you'll
recognize this the new microphone the
43b I wonder who suggested that one you
see how I showed it is ladies now that
would be a Nick Nick actually suggested
I give this microphone right because
Nick knows audio I know I get to pick
literally anybody else and that would've
been more believable Nick show show how
short it is ladies oh you guys want to
see how short my box okay this is why I
love that mice mic most shotgun mics are
long but look at my mgq sitting around
here I do also I'll show you a
comparison yeah this is still my
favorite mic to date yeah she's small
pro shotgun mic that thing is so genie
yeah good seal on that super you can
replace the capsule too with a wide one
right don't they up to different
capsules for it yeah so of course they
don't ship it where they gotta pay
another $300 for the other one but yeah
that's what makes a professional right I
like about that capsule and that's why I
recommended it for your space is that is
a hyper-cardioid pick up pattern so it's
it's very very directional so it has a
off axis rejection like like no other so
and I'm excited to try it out and I guys
I think tomorrow tomorrow I think I'm
finally bringing the livestream back so
twitch TV for judge Martin please I'll
be doing morning coffee at some point in
the morning mainly because I figured
some things out now and I think I think
I'll be able to actually get my ass out
of bed in the morning I was having
really bad fatigue issues but I think
I've figured some shit out and as far as
YouTube video fuck I don't know probably
that microphone probably I got a review
a green screen I probably twenty pieces
of technology that need to be reviewed
like two months ago yeah you guys know
yeah I don't I don't review yeah I need
to go on Amazon and order yourself one
of those like the I think it's three
centimeter dead cats like we use on mine
because check out and I forgot to add it
to the cart yeah yeah so you need to
order one of those because you you add
that to that microphone because it will
pick up wind noise like really bad even
with the little foamy one the
comes with oh really and I got the air
conditioner like circulating air so yeah
you're probably right that's gonna fuck
with that yeah so definitely check over
there so but yeah all right guys we're
gonna go and thanks for watching and we
will see you next week I gotta upload
going up tomorrow morning so you guys
make sure you watch that it's about it's
Bab monitors actually it's about like
how hard is it to run an ultra-wide
monitor like how much DP do you need so
we tested some stuff but like you'd know
I have no idea I have people to do all
the work for me now I don't know
anything I know did you just sit on your
ass and be funny roll roll roll it out
go on 54 technology's ruining our jobs
and some people in chat think I'm stupid
taking the flat packs is good but even
explaining good flat tax won't work oh
fuck y'all I love you though bye Oh
