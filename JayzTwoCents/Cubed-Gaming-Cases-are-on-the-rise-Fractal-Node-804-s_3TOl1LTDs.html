you a case review and I haven't actually
done a case review in a while on this
channel I mean to me to be quite honest
it might seem a little bit kind of
contrary to what you've seen recently on
this channel I'm not a whole lot of a
case whore in fact if it holds all of
your computer components it keeps things
nice and cool and it looks good that's
what I think you should go with I don't
have a whole lot of opinions when it
comes to cases but the fractal design
node 804 brings something kind of
interesting to the table and that is
that this is a cube designed micro ATX
computer case so a lot of people are
starting to go towards that cube design
this is the first one that I've seen
that's actually a micro ATX or smaller
and you look at the size of this box
this is this is not a very big box to be
holding something that's a double wide
cube design so let's go and take a look
at this bad boy from our Swedish friends
fractal design
now be honest I'm not one of those guys
who gets all caught up on the type of
packing material that they use to ship a
case I mean come on it's a case it's not
that heavy for the most part this closed
cell foam is going to take the it's
going to absorb any the damage that can
happen during dropping stuff I just
don't get all flustered about packing
material like some other people do I
mean I wouldn't really recommend ever
shipping a case that's got a complete
system in it in its own box like this I
would always recommend double boxing so
if we're if you're even concern about
that always double box and use your own
judgement when it comes to packing it
now when it comes to the actual my hand
is stuck I hate that when these little
these little flaps go down and then you
stick your hand in there and act like a
hook that's scary all right there she is
now in all of her clothes foam packing
goodness static electricity Haven right
now it's one of the things I hate most
about the packaging of cases is they
become just one big giant static
electricity farm if you will so you
definitely should always make sure you
get all the static out of your case
before you start building it that's for
sure
so they got some literature in here and
we can just kind of toss that aside so
here's the cube right here now one of
the things I love already about this
case and I'm going to take my ring off
for this very reason no I'm not going to
marry the case I did not just leave my
wife for this case although I will have
to admit it is a very sexy case one of
the things fractal designs been doing
with like the arc series is using kind
of a simulated brushed aluminum or
brushed metal look and on the 804 they
bring you real brushed metal on the
front so definite Plus on that now
looking at the front here we have some
mesh at the bottom and this is for
letting in fresh air to the front fans
moving around to the left side here we
do have our slot load DVD CD drive we
have our audio jacks our headphones
input output and then we have our power
button there's no reset button just a
power button and then we have two USB
3.0 moving around to the back you can
see that we do have a side by side
design and that's what makes this thing
a cube now the cool thing about this
design is it allows you to keep the
compartments well compartmentalized so
that you can have good control over the
heat your power supply and your hard
drives and all that stuff are completely
separate from the front side of the case
which gives you very good control over
the cooling of this now your power
supply obviously goes over here it's got
nice rubber feet it also has a removable
filter but the filter actually removes
from the bottom we'll get onto that more
onto that in a second and then you have
got your thumb screws here that remove
all of your panels
speaking of panels decide where all of
the bits go has a nice clear window on
there so there's your nice clear window
and it's going to show all of your PC
parts very very easily and it just
slides off like that
now you can kind of get a good idea of
how small this case really is I mean
it's kind of hard to tell on camera the
actual size of this thing but it
actually is quite smaller than it looks
now top panel comes off the same way
here just a couple of thumbscrews and
this thing then slides back and comes
straight up and you can see the whole
top panel is pretty much just one big
giant meshed vent so that's good news
now that we've got all the panels off
we're starting to get a pretty good idea
of what this case is made of and as you
can see the front pops off just as
easily there to expose all of our front
panel connectors and our brushed
aluminum fascia but one thing I want to
show you here as you can see that you do
have easily removable filters they are
designed to remove from the bottom
technically even with the fascia on so
let me go ahead and put that back on so
you could tilt it forward and then you
could pull the front fan filters out
this way for easy cleaning because we
look at the bottom of the case I'm kind
of greeted with my first WTF moment and
from that this is why when it comes to
the filters now I understand the power
supply filter why it comes out the way
that it does because it's easier to come
out the front and tilt your PC up than
it is to get it to move all the way out
the back especially if your PC is near a
wall or something like that I can
actually put that back in there we go
so that makes sense tilt it you know
pull it forward if you would just tilt
it back get to the filter but the thing
I don't understand is knowing that I
don't understand why the actual side
foor of the motherboard is meant to come
out of the rear knowing that it's
difficult to actually get long piece or
fan filters like this out and actually
fits in there very very tight I mean
look how long this filter is you'd have
to pull that quite a ways away from the
wall in order to get that filter all the
way out it's not it's kind of a moot
point though if you're not using any
bottom mounted fans on there so just to
kind of point that out I don't think
that's really too much of a negative I
just I'm curious why they didn't make it
come out the front I think that would
have made a little more sense but once
again that's just my opinion now here's
the inside of the case everything is
sleeved in black it's got black plastic
seating or just bare black wire I think
that's fantastic
here again they go with the white fans
and white bits on the inside I do think
personally I'd kind of like to see this
all black I mean
The Blackout are define are for looks so
good at CES I kind of wish it kept that
going with these other Brandt are these
other cases from the same brand go a fan
controller right here built-in fan
controller with a SATA plug that's a
good plus I'm tired of seeing 4-pin
molex that's definitely on his way out
you get up included 120 millimeter fan
on the CPU side and included 100 n again
20 millimeter fan on this side but it is
also capable of housing a 140 millimeter
on the front we do also have a 120
millimeter intake and that is pretty
much it
now you can't outfit this with more fans
on the top more fans on the front more
fans on both sides but this is where you
start to really come to the conclusion
of there's a lot of give-and-take when
it comes to this case if we take a look
at the top you can see those fan mounts
are completely blocked by the hard drive
cages even so where if you remove one of
the hard drive cages you're still going
to have a little bit of an issue when it
comes to clearance because as you can
see the hard hard drive cage track you
know how well you can see that I'm a try
and show it on camera the hard drive
cage track still interferes with the
mounts for the 120 millimeter fan so
really if you want to use fans on this
side at all it's an all or nothing
you've got to take both cages out if you
want to access even one fan slot so
that's a little bit of a design choice
that I think there was a little bit more
compromise than many of us would be
willing to make once again because this
is on the hard drive power supply side
it's not that big of a deal unless you
need to utilize these top portions here
for additional water cooling because you
could put a 240 millimeter radiator on
both sides of this as well as the front
if you want it but the downside is once
again to use a 240 millimeter right on
this side you'd have to take the hard
drive cages out now I heard a lot of
people kind of complaining about the
fact that they are hanging drives rather
than being horizontally mounted drives I
think I agree with that a little bit but
I'm not entirely too concerned with it
the only the biggest downside for me
that I'm a little sad
though is the fact that I can't put a
120 on this side and still have the
drive cage on there but I think as long
as you have a front intake and you have
your exhaust on here it's not going to
be that big of a deal we are talking
about just hard drives and power supply
if you don't need to utilize any of this
space for water cooling I mean that's
kind of what this case is bringing to
the table here it's a very versatile
cube the only downside to this is it
feels like in order to utilize a lot of
the functions that's built into this
cube you have to make some sacrifices as
well we've got some really cool features
and it's got really nice pass-through
design right here on the floor you can
put floor mounted fans on here if you
wanted up to looks like 80 millimeter
it's got your box of hardware of course
and one of the things that I know people
have been really excited about is the
fact that it does have this different
box out of here it does have these large
velcro straps on here on the bottom that
you can utilize for wire management I
think anything that aids in the
improvement of cable management is going
to be a huge plus regardless of who the
case manufacturer is and I really do
like this case so guys this has been the
note 804 from fractal design pretty much
a first look here on Jane's - since
we're not really a first look I mean
it's been plenty of other people who've
done it besides me but this is my first
time looking at it
getting all hands-on and you know
getting all touchy-feely with this thing
I wonder if they're going to make a
white one it a fractal if you're
watching you guys gonna make a white one
I think white ones will look pretty
badass as well so all right guys I'm
gonna go ahead and get the heck on out
of here tell me what you guys think
about this case down in the description
follow on Twitter Instagram Facebook all
that social media stuff you want to get
a little bit more personal and and talk
about tech and PCs and I guess pretty
much anything else you'd like to talk
about long as it's within reason of
course
unlike that one time all right guys time
to go as always I will see you in the
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
