we are hanging out at CES 2015 bringing
some live coverage and we are at the
EVGA suite here at the Bellagio now if
you remember a couple weeks back I did
the gigabyte water force review and I
had a suggestion for them somebody
already beat them to the punch now
recently I did the review of the 970 SSC
from EVGA we had six phase power
delivery and a overall higher clock than
the standard SC model now what we're
looking at here is the 970 for the wind
plus now what makes this card pretty
nice is the fact that they actually
listen to your feedback it has the same
six six phase power delivery that the
SSC has but it also has higher base
clock higher boost clock as well as look
at that what is on the back of that card
it's almost like they're listening to
the community we've got an EVGA
backplate on this thing with the
lettering that actually faces the right
way so you guys said you wanted back
plates here it is before the wind plus
is giving you back plates now if you
guys want a little more umph and a
little more horsepower
maybe the 970 is not quite for you as I
mentioned at the start of this video I
said somebody should come out with a
graphics card that has a standalone 120
millimeter radiator that you can put in
your case because Maxwell is so power
efficient and why isn't anyone doing
that to give you guys good overclock
slow temps without being too intrusive
in your case well what we've got over
here is the EVGA 980 it's branded as
hydro copper here they're still working
on the name but basically we've got an
all-in-one 120 millimeter water cooler
in here as well as a base plate with a
exhaust style fan on here keeping the
VRMs nice and cool but this right here
because Maxwell is so efficient means
you're going to be able to get pretty
good overclocks but you're also going to
do it at much lower temperatures much
lower noise and this is this is nice to
see I'm glad that somebody finally came
out with this we are going to be doing a
review of this on the channel a little
bit later as well so make sure you stay
tuned for that
the 980 like I said it's branded as
hydro copper right here might end up
having a different name who knows
now kingpin world-renowned overclocker
EVGA sponsored overclocker has his own
custom cards that you guys have seen in
the past and maxwell is no different in
fact what we're looking at right here is
the EVGA gtx 980 classified kingpin
edition
now what makes this card extremely
unique has extra power delivery to 8-pin
plus a 6-pin power but it's got the
evbot on there it but it it's got a
backplate customizable RGB lighting
all-metal cooler on the front here with
a nice gunmetal design but like yeah
like I mentioned RGB lighting you can
customize this to you know basically fit
any aesthetic or custom build that
you're doing this card really is
designed for ln2 and water cooling so if
you guys are willing to you know kind of
rip open the card put a water block on
here in ln2 block you can get even
higher overclocks but what also makes
this card interesting is the fact that
it is designed with a single slot design
it comes shipped with a dual slot
bracket on there but it does also come
with a single slot bracket and the as
you can see here the inclusion of mini
DisplayPort which is really cool because
mini DisplayPort cables are a lot easier
to find than full-size DisplayPort 1.2
but it's got the three mini DisplayPort
on here HDMI and your DVI dual link so
we don't know much about the specs on
this yet this is still kind of an early
phase hopefully we'll learn more about
that in the near future here but the
EVGA GTX 980 classified kingpin it's
definitely gonna be pulling out all the
stops this is going to be the card to
beat when it comes to Maxwell standards
of overclocking now not only is EVGA
known for its legendary graphics cards
its motherboards and power supplies but
we also are starting to break in here to
the peripheral game now earlier in the
year we took a look at the torques x10
mouse from EVGA and now we're gonna
looking at here a prototype of a
keyboard that they're looking at
bringing later in this year and this is
the z10 it's a full mechanical keyboard
Cherry MX red with red backlighting at
the time of making this video but it's
got a slider here which is really nice a
dial for the LED dimmer but you also
have macro keys on here but as you can
see you also have the inclusion of an
LCD screen which is really neat because
you can pair this up with your EVGA
precision and you can get full system
vitals of your graphics card you know
what the current clock is what the
temperatures are VRAM usage it's
actually a very unique approach to the
keyboard
it also has full USB 3.0 pass-through
hub built into it so you're not going to
have USB cables going all over your desk
I wish we saw more keyboard
with full USB 3.0 pastor so I'm happy to
see that just as a reminder this is an
early prototype we're looking at a
little bit later this year but as I
mentioned earlier we took a look at the
x10 and they are freeing a couple new
Mouse to the market here we've got the
x3 which is a more entry-level Mouse
more affordable Mouse and it is an
optical we also have the x5 optical
right here which is very similar to the
x3 but it's got more dpi adjustment is
it RGB yeah RGB control on there and
then if you're more of a laser fan
you've got the x5 laser which is
essentially the same but with a better
optic on there so EVG is really starting
to bring more to the table for that
gaming branded gaming enthusiast design
that gamers want to go along with their
hardware and some peripherals now if we
move over here EVGA is now stepped up
their power supplies we looked at the g2
and the p2 1600 which we know is
powering skunkworks but we now we've got
titanium or the t-series power supplies
so you have a 1600 t2 or titanium rated
Hey hey guys but we've got the GT BGA
1600 t2 titanium rated I guess all we're
waiting for now is that know what's
above titanium diamond rated I don't
know EVGA is is really starting to step
up their game when it comes to power
supplies I've been running skunkworks
off my 1,600 absolutely flawless fully
modular design I really am happy with
what they're doing and not only that
they do have of course their custom
individually sleeved cable kits that you
can get in a variety of colors that will
interchange with any of their full
modular power supplies and the supernova
line so kudos to that we're not having
different power supplies with different
plugs so if you want to step up your
power supply get better Hardware more
demanding hardware you can keep your
cables if you stick with the same series
of power supply so guys this has been
Jays - since CES 2015 taking a look at
what EB GH bringing to the table in 2015
you guys know I have a soft spot for
EVGA I've been buying from these guys
for 10 years yeah it's it's a it's
definitely a bit of a fanboy thing don't

could could be alright guys make sure
you follow for all of our coverage here
