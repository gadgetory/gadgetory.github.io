have teamed up with Intel and Seagate to
bring a video about how to get SSD level
performance but the storage capacities
of a conventional hard drive sounds too
good to be true right well they sent me
their stuff they sponsored today's video
but I am putting those claims to the
test because I'm gonna get to the truth
at roof of this can you actually get
hard drive capacity with SSD speeds and
not break the bank right that's the best
part I don't know let's find out today
we're gonna be talking about one
specific task that it can do and that is
being a system accelerator where it's
not just a storage drive I mean
technically technically it is but who
would who would buy a 16 gigabyte
storage drive you could even put an OS
on that but what if we were to use this
as a massive cache device for a
conventional hard drive or instead of
constantly seeking the hard drive for
your most commonly used programs and
files games and whatnot it actually
accesses it right off of the Intel
opting mod module which is plugged into
m dot 2 which is much faster latency
wise and even SATA SSDs but it does it
for a fraction of the cost I mean the 16
gig comes in right around 50 ish bucks
at the time of making this video and you
can get a four terabyte Seagate
Barracuda for right around 120 bucks I
think I might have your attention by now
I certainly got mine so I decided to
benchmark three different scenarios with
this we benchmarked just the hard drive
I think this is where a lot of people I
think would start off new system
builders this is definitely worth taking
a look at as you definitely should but I
think I'm taking this from the
perspective of I've got a low I've got a
low budget I have a lot of money to
spend I've got an existing hard drive
that already has my OS on it I don't
want to spend a lot more money and start
all over
so we benchmarked just the hard drive
with a clone of the SSD operating system
drive that is inside my test bench so
it's got about a year's worth of
registry and stuff also cloned onto here
it's not a fresh install which I thought
was very important in testing I want to
see how well plug and play is on an
existing system not a fresh install so
all of the inherent slow downs over time
are definitely present on this drive and
then we took it and we installed the
octane memory using the installation
guides which you guys can find links to
down at the description box of this
video where we installed the obtain
got it going and then compared the
results so we took our hard drive when
we did all of our tests twice and the
reason why we did that is believe it or
not regular hard drives also have
built-in cache right you've seen it
before 7200 rpm 64 megabyte cache and so
if you do the same task over and over
and over and over on a hard drive it
does get faster so we we did multiple
tests we did two tests basically of all
of these to see how well it improved and
then we did the exact same thing with
the optin memory installed we did a
baseline test on everything went back
through and did another test to see how
it improved because obtained just like a
cache drive it's going to learn your
behavior it's gonna learn what hard
drives are it's going to learn what
files are accessing what programs you're
launching and it's going to start to
store those on the cache drive rather
than going all the way to the hard drive
to get that information so that's where
a lot of the acceleration comes from and
then what we did just to see how well it
compares to a regular SSD which is quite
a bit more expensive and quite a bit
smaller than a standard hard drive for
instance this guy right now at the time
making this video is about 120 bucks 4
terabytes and for 120 bucks you can only
get about 256 ish 240 gigs worth of SSD
which how big is wildlands 48 gigabytes
right it's like almost a quarter of your
drive after the partition tables and
stuff where you're gonna get one game
and OS and some files on there and not
have much room left yeah so then we
tested it like I said on the SSD
and before I show the benchmarks there's
a couple of requirements you guys have
to know though if you're setting this up
for yourself one
it requires Windows 10 64 bit that's a
requirement can't get around that
it also requires Intel octane memory
motherboards which you're gonna find
basically in the Intel seventh gen
series and KB Lake CPUs so i5 and i7 in
our testing here we use two 7900 X with
an X to 99 yeah definitely not pulling
any punches we want the CPU trying to
grab information as fast as possible so
that the storage is truly our bottleneck
at that point and then you're gonna also
need to go and download some software to
make it all work so 64-bit windows 10
intel seventh gen cpu cable eight CPUs
and an Intel obtain ready motherboard
and of course the module itself as well
as a hard drive to accelerate in our
case the four terabyte Barracuda
so with all of that talking out of the
way how well did it actually perform
so if you're like me when you first
heard about Intel obtained you might
have started to think that that was just
too good to be true I mean how the heck
could this little module speed this guy
up to give you SSD performance with the
massive storage capacity of hard drives
well guys you just saw in those
benchmarks that's exactly what happened
now how did it happen how did it do that
well it's pretty simple I think the best
way to explain how this is really
working is to just do a little bit of a
demonstration so Nick is going to be my
hard drive and right now I'm gonna be
the CPU and this right here is all the
stuff we have stored on our hard drive
so right now Nick I need that one file
in the one folder I need that one file
in a moment we got things that are
waiting to happen here man sitting here
idle memory does it there we go thank
you okay and then the CPU does what it
needs to do with it but let's say we
install the Intel obtain memory so now
I'm obtained you're the hard drive and
I'm talking to the CPU that's over here
he's just offering now the same thing is
gonna happen but what you're gonna
notice is something a little bit
different hey hard drive I'm obtained
now so I'm in between you and the CPU
and I need that one file Oh got one file
I need the file we've work things are
happening here come on found it okay
there we go so I got the file I'm
handing it off to the CPU but I'm gonna
hang on to this because we just used it
chances are we might need it again oh
you know what the CPU needs that file
again but I got this here we go oh oh
wait the CPU needs a needs World of
Warcraft maybe that one we're gonna play
some Wow or do some reading him yeah you
got it that's a big file it's a big foot
there we go that's world of warcraft and
I hand it off to the CPU but i'ma hang
on to this well he wants to play wow
again here we go oh he's playing this
guy played with plays I'm gonna hang on
to this he plays a lot a lot okay we
don't need that one anymore though you
can have that okay thank you so it's it
works a lot like a cache but the thing
is I'm gonna hold on to in my buffer or
cache all of the most frequently
frequently used files and programs so
that instead of going back to you I'm
just gonna keep it and hand it off and
then when something new is
I'll come to you and then I'll hang on
to it and as time goes on I'll learn
behaviors and then some of your
behaviors are disturbing let me just put
that out there but I'll learn your
behaviors and I'll probably seek therapy
at the end of all of it and then what
will happen is as things were used less
frequently I'll kind of push that back
and then I will hang on again until most
frequently use files that in a little
skit and a terrible skit is basically
what's happening retard he tried so hard
so that's why you're getting even better
speeds and his traditional SSD at least
in our testing configuration we did have
a quirk though when we were installing
this that took me a while to get past
but I was able to actually work through
it where I was actually installing the
wrong installer because by following
their links down below and take mine
note of this when I'm about to tell you
they say use the setup octane memory Exe
file the problem is there's several
different installation suites I don't
know what the differences are between
them but I was using the wrong one and
they all have the exact same file name
so I didn't catch it until later but I
did finally get it working and it was
pretty simple at that point reboots it
makes sure that rst is turned on in your
BIOS and then it will ask do you want to
accelerate your system with octane you'd
be like heck yes I do and then it
reboots again and you're good to go and
you get the results that we just saw but
with all that out of the way for about a
hundred and seventy dollars here you're
able to get massive amounts of storage
at the speeds of an SSD not bad at all
now there is also something else you
need to keep in mind though is the op
tain is only going to be able to
accelerate whichever drive has your OS
on it so if you have multiple hard
drives so you have games on one drive
and then you have the OS on OS on
another one it's only going to
accelerate the drive with the OS on it
so keep that in mind so that's it tell
me what you guys think about the intel
octane memory I think for people on a
budget that want mass storage and good
speed it's definitely worth taking a
look at the amount of speed increase in
the amount of time decrease of opening
just random programs and restarts and
and shutting down windows was definitely
tangible like it was extremely tangible
there was no margin about it so again a
huge thank you to both Intel in Seagate
for sponsoring today's video and making
it possible links are in the description
guys places where you can buy and how to
learn more about intel octane check it
out and as always guys I'll see you in
the next one
