whole PC backdrop I have a few of them
actually finally get to have all those
pcs I've been building over the years
actually do something what's up guys
Jase $0.02 here and you might have seen
my 1800 X build featuring this guy right
here you can watch that in this little
card that's going to pop out work I put
together this custom rigid tubing bills
with my dual Titan X Maxwell cards
turned out really really good and
obviously when I moved into the studio
here I planned on building brand new
systems for this place and I'm still
going to do that but I figured a lot of
Czech youtubers myself included it done
a fantastic job at talking about how
good Rison is and most of us have showed
some benchmark numbers in gaming but
very few people actually put their money
where their mouth is and have decided to
use Verizon for their daily workflows to
truly experience it and get literally
the most hands-on experience that you
possibly can it's easy for us to talk
about how good it is for content
creators but it's another thing to
actually turn it into your content
creator workhorse and then you can get a
real good feel of how it really is so
what I'm going to do for the next 30
days is I'm going to use only this 1800
X system for making the videos that you
guys are watching now in fact by the
time you watch this video it will have
already been rendered on this system now
to get this experiment kind of started I
want to I'll be doing some periodical
check-ins as well I'm going to give you
some live demo right now what editing is
like on this rig but I'm also going to
take my 59 60 X test bench over here
which has 32 gigabytes of Dominator
Dominator Platinum from course there's
got to 1080 s on there an X 99 quad
channel I mean you name it it's a pretty
high-end system including a fully custom
360 loop on there but I figured we'll
start this experiment by taking the same
work project that you guys saw on Friday
the whole vlog of putting together the
desks and things I'm going to render
both of them simultaneously on both
these machines now they are not perfect
copies of the OS they OS on the test
bench has got you know it's stuff on
there and this OS is a fresh install and
I did that so that's one thing to
mention but I'm going to just kind of do
a just dry run to see how right off the
bat they actually compare to each other
the nice thing is though both of these
operating systems are pretty bare the
only thing that's on the work bench over
here is
premiere and then some games I do my
benchmarks on and the same thing going
forward the system behind me a brand new
fresh install with some of the benchmark
games you guys saw in the 1800 x review
as well as premiere so they're very
they're very bare-bones there's not a
lot of billet where anything on there
actually but the reason why I'm using
the 59 60 X and not the 1600 K for this
test is they are pretty much the same
CPU one is Ivy bridge-e one is broad
well II they're very minor differences I
do have two 1600 KS that we'll be using
to build additional systems for the
suite here but this one's already put
together they're about the same thing so
I'm gonna let them go now something else
I kind of troubled myself with trying to
figure out how I want to handle is
overclocking you guys know the 1800 X is
not the overclocking monster that we
were hoping it was most people are only
getting 3.9 out of them some people are
getting 4.0 and very people are getting
4.1 that's only a couple hundred
megahertz difference between the two and
it's only about three hundred megahertz
overclock from base so yeah not too sure
how I want to handle that because my 59
60 X is stable all the way up to 4.5 and
obviously having a 500 megahertz
advantage on that chip would probably
push it into the lead but then again
it's another selling point to write
overclocking ability stability that's
something you guys should should
consider so what I think I'm going to do
is I'm going to down clock the 59 60 X
to 4.2 actually I've got a better idea
I'll look clock both of them at 4.0 and
then because that's as far as my 1800
can go and then I will clock my 59 60 X
to pork 4.5 and then we'll see how much
of an improvement that actually was so
anyway let's go ahead and start taking a
look at what it's like working in
premiere with the 1800 X so here's a
timeline from Friday's vlog in fact it's
very very basic it's just dropping drag
of the mp4 files directly off my Sony AX
33 but even even though this has no
adjustment layers or crazy transitions
or color correcting usually if you did
any sort of timeline scrubbing or moving
around the timeline on a system that's
just slow or sluggish then it tends to
be a pretty bad experience where you
would click something on the timeline
and then this would the preview screen
would take time to catch up
but even scrubbing is really fast
we're playing everything back at full
resolution it's not smoking anymore idle
is move this can be real time it's fizzy
it's like it's like you even though the
light bulbs to the mr16 LED it's kind of
fun though so what if we add some sort
of adjustment layer on there like let's
do like a two strip on there something
that's kind of crazy like some sort of
crazy light will do something very
dramatic like that that's the alexa
default logs c to rec 709 obvious it's a
very contrast II Lutz and where's we got
the desk but you can see it has no
problem moving around there do you have
this company at this is a CSS look under
go full time Nick end of next month
ish well so yeah obviously moving around
the timeline is pretty painless that's I
mean when it comes to rendering you can
click render and walk away and do
something else if it takes a while but
the working within the timeline if
that's laggy and jumpy and it's just
terrible then you just sit there and
think my god I hate editing because it
can't keep up with what I'm trying to do
I use a lot of shortcuts and I tend to
move around the timeline a lot and very
quickly yeah the windows but it's have
no problem even playing it back at full
resolution this is actually a 1080p
project though that I upscale to 4k in
my render so that'll be adding some
rendering time as well so the next thing
to do here is going to be the actual
render test where I compare it to the 59
60 I all right so here's the Rison
system you can see right here we're
using the YouTube 2160p
or 4k preset it's a 40 megabit per
second can be BR it's variable bitrate
one-pass this is actually how I do all
my videos if you want to the truth and
then we're not using any maximum render
quality we're not using previews or
anything like that and it's become over
here to the Intel system you can see it
is exactly the same settings here 2160p
get the exact same project here with the
exact same two strip adjustment layer on
there and we've got all the same
settings selected so what I've got to do
now is I've got to try and hit enter at
the exact same time on both of these and
then we are going to run the stop
three two one go and start on the
stopwatch
all right so immediately this one says
26 minutes 25 they're kind of balancing
out it kind of goes up and down when it
first starts they both didn't do that so
that one says 26 Fish minutes over here
on the Intel showing 23 minutes and they
are clocked identical let's keep that in
mind anyway we're just going to let
these go we'll see which one finishes
first this one seems to be about three
minutes slower at the moment but we'll
just let them go and see what happened
oh that's not good
well there's that here we go round two
59 60 X I was my bad actually when I
said the multiplier 240 I had already
reset the defaults on this before I
moved it and I forgot to put the voltage
up so we're trying to run 4.0 at stock
bolts that's not going to work so there
we go again
test render 2160p 4k for YouTube preset
40 megabit we're ready to export so here
we go three two one render and they're
going okay so this one's showing 24
minutes 32 seconds but remember like I
said in the first attempt it's going to
kind of bounce around a little bit
they're just Intel showing about 24
minutes to render and just like before
this one showing approximately 26
minutes to render so what I'm gonna do
is I'm just going to let it go and I'll
show you which one finishes first and
what we're concerned with here is the
gap between the two right well so far
they're maintaining about a three minute
gap between the two of them that's
pretty consistently about three minutes
see it's still showing 21 minutes 42
seconds to go and this one showing
nineteen twelve just hit 90 minutes
since I know it's going to come up I'm
also going to show the GPU usage right
here obviously both of the Titan X's are
being used in this system here but these
are tight necks maxwell cards which are
actually very comparable to the 1080
this is not the TI this is just a
regular 1080 and you can see over here
on the usage it's very very comparable
although it seems to be a little
more inconsistent here on the Intel
system 33% maxing out on GPU 2 and 26%
maxing out on GPU 1 whereas over here in
the AMD system you can see right here
they are utilizing it pretty damn
consistent 37 and 37 yeah
so I just wanted to show that that yes
indeed the GPUs are doing a little bit
of something so we got 13 minutes and 16
seconds left to go in the AMD system and
over here we've got 10 minutes and 25
seconds left to go in the Intel system
so what's interesting about that is the
AMD system actually close the gap
slightly I mean it's still about just
under three minutes apart now that would
just hit 13 minutes and this one's at 10
minutes 12 seconds to go so yes this one
had fallen behind about as much as four
minutes and now it's closed it in to
just under three minutes it's getting
good this graph line on the bottom right
here this is CPU usage so it's sitting
as you can see it tends to hover in the
upper 70s to low 80s
sometimes it dips sometimes it goes up
but obviously it's fluctuating around
pretty similar story over here on the
Intel system splotching around between
the 70s and 80s
all right the Intel system is finishing
up it's got a couple seconds left right
here and it usually takes a few seconds
once it's done for its kind of pop up
and say it's done see I don't consider
it done until that little thing is
finished that makes sense
the AMD system if you're wondering has
got 2 minutes and 30 seconds left over
there so waiting for this say it's done
and that's where the timer is so far the
timer is sitting at 25 28 I'm still
waiting for it to finish so you can see
the timer when it said 23 up there we go
now the AMD Rig is still showing one
minute and 40 seconds left and you can
see down here it actually took 25
minutes and 35 seconds for the Intel rig
to complete and now what we're measuring
here on lap 2 technically is the time
difference between Intel the Intel
system and the AMD system ok the AMD rig
has just finished and just like before
I'm not going to
County has done until the screen a
little window pops off and so far you
can see the difference here is about two
minutes we're crossing the 2-minute mark
right now you can see my reflection so
stuff internet so there we go
2805 so the difference between the two
here was 2 minutes and 30 seconds as you
can see between the Intel system and the
Verizon system so what I did now with
the Intel system was I went ahead and
overclocked it to 4.5 gigahertz since I
know that that's what my 59 60 X was
capable of all the same settings as
before I'm just kind of curious as to
what the difference in the initial speed
is going to be I see it already well as
you can see it didn't really change much
21 minutes so it really came down I
don't know min and a half-ish 4 5 an
extra 500 megahertz for about a minute
and a half now that's actually the first
direct comparison I've actually done
with any of my workflow stuff with Rison
and I think now seeing that 2 minutes
and 30 seconds difference between a
thousand-dollar CPU and a $500 CPU is
obviously worth it I mean that's less
than 10% where it's more like 8 percent
of a difference between the performance
of these two CPUs
for 60% additional costs for Intel it's
really becoming hard to justify that now
the reason I'm even going to be building
the 1600 case systems is because I
already have the parts but we're going
to be obviously building some future
Rises and systems too especially the
rise in 5 being out and F's I got the
1700 X to 1700 system there's a lot to
be done and it's an exciting time for
pcs once again now I hope this answers
at least some of the preliminary
questions people have about how Rison
performs for content creators I think
that's been the thing a lot of people
have been saying it's for content
creators for content creators but not
many people have actually shown a direct
comparison between the two
now obviously something like a 69 50 X
like I'm using and skunkworks just
obliterates both of these CPUs but at
1700 dollars and up it's a pretty poor
bargain I think that goes without saying
now obviously this test isn't is
directly comparable apples to apples as
I would have liked ideally I would had
to tight next Maxwell cards on the test
bench but I don't have
those on air this one's on air one's on
water so that's why have to 1080 s in
there but in terms of direct comparison
the Rison system probably had a little
bit of an edge when it comes to GPU
performance because there's more CUDA
cores in the Titan X Maxwell than there
is in the GT X 1080 but the 1080 has a
speed benefit with a higher base clock
than the Titans do but the clock
performance is a little bit less
important as just the CUDA performance
overall when it comes to premiere that's
a whole different subject though but I
will be using Verizon specifically for
all of my workflow with bringing you
guys videos for the next 30 days so that
will give me a real good experience as
to what it's like now I'm hoping with
BIOS improvements going forward we might
be able to see a little bit better
overclocking I'm also hoping for as the
roof main popping sound that's not scary
but anyway I hope that answers some of
your preliminary questions about how
actually compares to the eight core 16
thread Intel CPUs for content creators
now live streaming is something else I'm
going to be doing in these next 30 days
because I plan on doing some games and
stuff while live streaming so that will
give me a pretty good indication of what
it's like to game render and stream on
the same system when it comes to the
1800 X so yeah I'm looking I'm not
looking forward to that for a long time
so I've done any gaming stream because
my internet at home sucks but obviously
here at the office it is a whole lot
better with that fiber okay I'm going to
go now if you guys have got something
specific you kind of want me to play
with with Rison over the next 30 days
that doesn't include like Linux distros
or VMs or virtual machines because I
don't really do any of that I have no
reason to do any of that with my
workflow but there's something specific
in terms of like content creator wise
that you're interested in let me know
down in the comments or better yet head
on over to twitter at JS two cents and
give me some direction on what you guys
want me to do moving forward with the
rise end stuff anyway guys thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
