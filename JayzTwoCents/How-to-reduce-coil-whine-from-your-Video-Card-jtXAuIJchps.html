ever got a new graphics card or built a
gaming system put it together loaded a
game and then heard this
unfortunately my friends that is called
coil whine and once you've got it you
can't really get rid of it entirely like
some things in life that should probably
be left unnamed I wouldn't know though
fortunately though there are some things
you can do to limit the amount of coil
wine in your graphics card and that's
obviously what we're going to focus on
today with its dual BIOS 10+2 power
phase delivery RGBA CX 3.0 cooler and
factory overclock the EVGA gtx 1070 and
1080 for the win are excellent choices
for gamers who demand the best learn
more by following the link down below
now there's two things that can actually
cause coil whine and usually they kind
of go hand-in-hand
one is when your graphics card is
working under an extreme load and what
happens is the inductors in there and
without getting entirely too technical
the inductors in there get very excited
and start vibrating around and I'm sure
there's a end up as a gift somewhere
they start vibrating around when they
operate at high frequencies which is
specifically related also to extremely
high FPS but your FPS doesn't have to be
very high for those inductors to start
vibrating around like a adult novelty if
you will they can also do it when
they're under high load even if the FPS
is low I think a lot of gamers right now
probably just said just wear headphones
and it won't matter but believe it or
not I personally don't wear headphones
very often when I'm gaming and I don't
want to hear coil whine I think there
are people out there obviously in that
same situation so this video is going to
apply to you what I'm going to do now is
play a couple of different games that
just give you some sound clips so that
you can see exactly what coil whine
sounds like so that you can also help
identify it in your system but it could
sound like it's coming from the graphics
card and be coming from another
component so you want to do the best you
can to identify where the sound is
coming from but I'm also going to use a
gtx 970 and the reason for that is the
970 was reportedly one of the worst
Nvidia graphics cards when it came to
coil whine ever so if this method works
with the 970
chances are it'll work with your
graphics card too but it doesn't work
with all of them and I'll show you that
at the end of this video
now this might be kind of an unpopular
idea but if the reason why you're
getting coil wine is due to FPS run away
or where the graphics card will just go
into this massive 100% utilization and
let FPS go as high as it possibly can
turning on some sort of sync technology
like vsync g-sync free sync or fast sync
found on the new Pascal graphics cards
is a way of reducing that coil line and
the reason why I say it's not a popular
solution is because most enthusiasts
want to see high EP numbers when it
comes to fps they want to see FPS just
go through the roof because it's kind of
a bragging point as well but
unfortunately it's doing several things
like I said it's unnecessarily adding
heat load and noise to your graphics
card your fans are having to ramp up to
deal with that massive FPS if you don't
have a high refresh rate monitor that
can even keep those frames in sync
anyway all you're doing is getting a
mess on your screen where you're going
to start getting tearing images with
fast motions so it's just kind of a bad
situation all around now I don't have
any sort of g-sync or free sync monitor
hooked up to my test bench this is just
a monoprice 4k monitor running in 1080
right now and I want to show you the
difference by just turning on free sync
how much difference and how much reduced
the coil line really was
now the reason why turning on vsync and
some games could be a bad idea
especially with competitive games like
csgo is it could introduce some input
lag because of the way vsync works so
that's why if you have some sort of AG
sync or free sync panel it would be a
much better option than just turning on
vsync because you're not going to get
any input lag because of the amount of
time that's waiting or the graphics card
is waiting for the monitor to be ready
for the next frame especially if you're
dealing with high FPS games like csgo
that can go up into the hundreds of FPS
and your monitor can only draw 60
unfortunately though this method doesn't
always remove all of the coil whine but
it can do a pretty good job of at least
reducing it to the point to where you're
not going to hear it over the sounds of
your game or the graphics card being
closed inside of a sealed case as an
example here of my AMD r9 nano which is
an HB M and unfortunately one of the
noisiest coil whine offenders I have
ever heard here is how it fared both
before and after
and this video probably falls under the
category of duh - a lot of experienced
gamers and PC hardware enthusiasts so
obviously I'm talking to the person who
is listening to this noise not knowing
what it is and wants to know what to do
about it now returning graphics cards
because of coil whine has always been a
debate in the community where some
manufacturers do not see coil whine as
being a reasonable reason to RMA a
product where other manufacturers do so
if you think you have excessive coil
whine the best thing to do would be
probably to contact the manufacturer if
your graphics card if you're still under
warranty and see how they're dealing
with coil whine some cards even of the
exact same category the exact same card
under manufacturers can have varying
levels of coil whine but fortunately
manufacturers are doing a lot of things
to try and reduce that do the inclusion
of better components and better
manufacturing and design to try and
reduce coil whine as best as possible so
hopefully today's video has helped you
and if you have coil whine man I feel
yeah I've so many graphics cards are
plagued with this but fortunately as you
can see there is some things you can do
to try and reduce the levels of coil
whine anyway guys thanks for watching as
always I will see you in the next video
and if you've got a topic you want me to
cover then make sure you guys email me
tweet me message me whatever so that I
can see the topic a lot of these topics
come directly from my inbox and then
eventually make it onto your screen
alright guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
