and if I start to sound a little raspy
or just a little like then I apologize
it's allergies focus on germs but anyway
you guys recall early last week I did a
video about the Acer predator X 34 34
inch ultra wide 21 by 9 IPS 100
megahertz gaming panel and I switched my
entire config to just this one panel so
today we're going to talk about this
panel what it's been like going back
down to a single panel and what this
thing is like for gaming is after all
that's who this thing is being touted
towards a $1300 gaming panel holy hell
this thing is pricey
I want to thank today's sponsor
harrys.com Harry's is the official
raiser of the Movember foundation making
this arrangement very very easy for me
now not only am i passionate about the
Movember foundation bringing awareness
to men's health and testicular cancer
and trust me you save the testes they're
kind of important but it has actually
been a pleasure using the Harry's razor
and I got to tell you right now the
amount of stuff that you get for 15
bucks in there Truman set or their
starter pack is absolutely crazy I mean
you get shaving cream it smells really
good you get a razor handle a spare
razor head the value is absolutely
amazing but anyway look in the
description of this video and you will
see a link make sure that you put in my
promo code two cents in the promo box at
checkout and you can say five dollars
off your first order and considering
everything that you see here only cost
fifteen bucks to begin with you're gonna
get all this for $10 and let me tell you
I challenge anyone to get that kind of a
deal at any sort of big-box brands as
just simply not gonna happen but anyway
guys thanks Harry's comm once again for
sponsoring today's video and bringing
awareness to men's health and their
involvement in the Movember foundation
that to me speaks volumes okay here she
is in all her glory and I have to admit
I have already made a mistake I mounted
this thing on my visa articulating arm
immediately because I liked the monitor
to look like it's floating and such
which means I took off the base which
means the base is included
in this video but I can't tell you at
least before we get started with the
panel quality that the bass is amongst
the highest quality of any monitor I've
ever used solid metal it's got five
degrees of tilt up thirty five degrees
of tilt down and it's got just an
amazing quality too it's got built-in
cable management it's all metal who
could ask for more but anyway I hope the
pictures I put up here suffice because
I've already packed away the base like
in storage yeah that's how sure that's
how sure I was I wasn't taking this
monitor down but obviously that brings
us to point number one which is the fact
that this thing is vase amount to bolon
it's 100 by 100 base amount is pretty
standard and if you guys want know what
arm I'm using with this then click here
on the screen or in the description I'll
put a link to the video as well about
the monoprice arm that I am using to
keep things going right here it's
actually a dual monitor arm which I took
one of the arms off and I'm just using
it for this big guy now there's a lot of
things we could talk about with this
panel and the fact that it's IPS was
kind of a turn-off to me in the
beginning in fact NVIDIA sent me this
panel not Acer and the reason why Nvidia
sent it was because it's got their G
sync technology and I thought to myself
well when they asked me if I want to
check out that Acer panel that
everyone's talking about I thought we
were talking about the 34 40 by 1440 P
144 Hertz gaming panel which is not an
IPS and I was a little disappointed when
I heard it was IPs because typically IPS
panels have slow response time they're
all about color accuracy not so much
about speed but that has all changed
right here now let's let's go ahead and
get some of the specs stuff out of the
way you know some of you guys get
completely like you know wet over specs
and stuff of MIT I kind of do the same
thing but anyway this panel here is a 34
inch diagonal viewable q HD 34 40 by
1440 P curved monitor now the curve is
you know a lot of people like that curve
that's dumb but I will admit it has been
nice to look at it really has been but
anyway it is an IPS panel it's an LED
LCD TFT display but it gives you a
hundred and seventy-eight degrees of
viewing angle from all sides and that's
one of the things that makes IPS really
nice compared to say TN panel is that
you don't get any of that color shift
whatsoever it is
accurate from all of the viewing angles
that you could possibly look at this
thing from now it does feature a 4
millisecond response time now some
people are going to look that and go oh
my god that is so freaking slow and the
only reason they're going to say that is
because there are panels out there like
the Swift which feature 1 millisecond
response time but if you look at the
average response time of IPS panels 4
milliseconds is incredibly fast and in
fact I have not noticed any input like
whatsoever from the 4 milliseconds I
personally feel that anything under 5 is
perfectly fine especially when it comes
to shooters I play like 99% shooters and
I don't have any issues whatsoever I
don't even notice it so that's kind of a
big deal if shooters are not noticeable
in the response time no other game is
going to be noticeable either now when
it comes to the refresh rate the spec
sheet says this is a 60 Hertz panel
although they advertise it as
overclockable to a hundred Hertz that's
actually a big deal now coming down from
144 Hertz panel losing 44 frames per
second through J sync technology even
with that frame pacing and frame
interval you would think that that would
be really noticeable but it's actually
more noticeable going from 60 to 100
than it is going from 100 244 which
means go ahead and cube that typical
internet argument of well the human eye
can only see 24 frames per second anyway
which is why movies are in 24 frames per
second bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
bla
doesn't really matter everyone's eye is
going to perceive frame rates a little
bit differently not happen to feel that
I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to
frame rates and I noticed the stutters
and the slight interval gaps and missed
timings where different frames are
rendering at different intervals
that's where g-sync comes in so you've
got an IPS panel this overclockable to a
hundred Hertz and it's I you know it's
IPS the color accuracy is amazing a
hundred percent srgb is what they they
claim but it looks freakin amazing and I
hope my videos are going to look better
too because I've got a good IPS panel
here now before we talk about gaming
there's a couple other specs to put on
here mostly because they're just comical
for instance the contrast ratio on this
thing is one hundred million to warm
of course that's dynamic you know it's
really realistically going to be a hell
of a lot lower than that once you have
ambient light going on but I digress
it's going to anti-glare coating on the
scree
you're not going to be looking at your
own reflection or backlighting in fact
I've got these soft boxes and some can
lights going there is no reflection
whatsoever on this screen and that's a
huge deal but you're also getting nice
colors with a flat what's technically a
matte screen which tends to make colors
look more washed out but that's not the
case here which is actually really
really good but it's got a 4 port USB
3.0 hub built into it which
unfortunately the cord that comes with
it is too short to reach from where my
monitor is to the PC right next to it by
using a path where the cable doesn't
show so you might have to get a longer
USB 3.0 cable if you want to actually
use that hub one of the things that I
really like about it those effected it's
got this under panel lighting which is
adjustable five different colors and
it's kind of funny because three of
those colors obviously are red green and
blue but then it also has a gold and it
has white so it's kind of unfortunate
that you know you don't you don't get
full RGB support on the color but it's
got some different modes to it just like
keyboards gonna breathing mode and sort
of a nitrite or like sweeping mode and
all that kind of stuff so it's going to
give you really nice exit lighting to
your man cave or your desk or your
computer space or whatever which is a
nice little bonus not necessarily a
selling feature but definitely a nice
bonus but of course the biggest selling
point on this is the fact that it's
overclockable to a hundred Hertz now
here's the thing I find a little bit
confusing you don't do it through a
custom resolution which you typically
would do when you overclock a panel you
actually do it through the settings
which are all handled right here
underneath the monitor and then you just
simply go into the refresh rate of the
panel and set it to a hundred now doing
that was pretty much plug-and-play set
it to a hundred sometimes get the plug
unplug the DP cable and plug it back in
to make it recognize sometimes it could
crash or need a reboot but what's really
weird is it's been so solid for me at
100 Hertz I don't understand why they
don't just ship it at 100 Hertz
I don't know what the circumstances
would be that would make it not work at
100 Hertz of course gaming on a 21 by 9
aspect ratio actually took more
dimension real quick one of the reasons
why we call it 21 by 9 and not 7 by 3 is
the fact that typically the numbers get
bigger as they indicate whether or not
the monitor is wider or larger for
instance if we called 7 by + 3 which do
you think is bigger
four by three seven by three or sixteen
by nine once you kind of think sixteen
by nine is bigger than seven by 3
because just your natural instinct is to
think that the bigger number is better
kind of like what people are going
through right now with x99 and z170 but
anyway 21 by 9 panels are amazing to
game on because they make you feel like
you've got more immersion more more
field of view to play with and it's kind
of like having a surround setup without
dealing with multiple panels obviously
it's not as wide as say three panels but
it's pretty damn wide as you can see
right here compared to my hand this
thing is pretty wide it's not really
picking up on the camera how wide it
really is but you get much more field of
view to play with and that is a big deal
for things like FPS shooters and MMOs
and things like that you can see more of
the ground you can see what's what's
going on in the game you just feel more
visible which is a big deal now one of
the things though to keep in mind is
it's going to depend on whether or not
the gaming developer even includes 21 by
9 aspect ratio in their resolution
settings most of the time it's not a
problem and ultra-wide panels have been
around long enough to where most game
developers have either started coding
for it or patched their games to support
it however there are brand new titles
that still aren't doing that for
instance fallout 4
if you playing fallout 4 and you have an
ultra-wide panel you've probably already
realized that the only way to get 21 by
9 aspect ratio to actually fill the
screen is to go into the ini file and
put in a custom resolution which then
begs the question why do the developers
have fallout 4 simply not add the
feature in there when all you're doing
is going to the ini file and telling it
what resolution to run at couldn't they
have simply made that a drop-down anyway
I guess that's more of a fallout 4
complaint not a panel complaint so I'll
digress again but playing games like FPS
shooters or even the new Star Wars
Battlefront which I've been playing a
bit of the 4 millisecond response time
is not a problem some might think that
that's slow because of the 1 millisecond
panels out there however that has not
bothered me one bit I haven't even
noticed it and 100 megahertz speed on
this again as I said earlier I don't
notice the difference between 100 and
144 it's perfectly smooth for me 60
Hertz can't do it after going to 140 for
60 Hertz just looks even with g-sync
very very choppy to me even though the
frame interval is perfect it just motion
and turning seems very
be to me I'm very used to this it's like
looking at that you know true motion
upscaling that you see on TV panels and
stuff when it comes to editing I've
actually had a very nice time editing on
this I don't have to fill up the screen
with my workflow I can simply put part
of the screen as my workflow and then
have part of the screen to where I can
put my folders and things and it hasn't
been that big of a deal to me going from
the four panels down to this guy has
been very easy it's a very easy
transition but the best thing to do is
go down to your local computer store and
hopefully they've got one on display
make sure you guys go and check it out
that's really the only way you're going
to know if this is something that you
like now the price of this thing is
pretty fucking high at about $1,300 MSRP
you're going to see prices vary it's
going to probably come down quickly
$1,300 is more than a lot of people are
spending on their entire system and I
certainly wouldn't recommend putting a
$1,300 panel like this on a lesser
expensive system because you are going
to need some horsepower to run this
puppy considering 13 or 34 40 by 1440 is
not a whole lot smaller than 4k in fact
you've got almost the horizontal pixels
of 4k and not quite the vertical pixels
of 4k but it's close so it's something
to keep in mind you need some good
graphics to run this thing if you want
high settings I think it's awesome but
again for the price it better be for the
price it better this thing better have
breakfast ready for me in the morning
damn it feel like I'm missing out on
something if it doesn't but there it is
guys tell me what panels you're using
obviously the qHD ultra wide is a very
niche very small percentage of the
gamers that are out there a lot of
people aren't into it I wasn't either
but now that I'm using it gotten used to
it and I'm not sure I could go back to a
16 by 9 I keep spoiling things for me or
at least the company's sending me this
crap is spoiling it for me god I think
it's time to quit quit YouTube just
kidding I'm not quitting but I hope you
guys have enjoyed today's video give me
a shout on Twitter if you guys have any
questions about this panel I'd like to
answer any questions you might have
I know this video was a bit longer but
there was a lot to talk about with this
panel I'm his face it is this is like
the panel that everyone is talking about
right now so I figured I'd give you guys
as much information as I could without
you getting to get hands-on don't even
think about getting hands-on you're not
allowed in here
my space this is off-limits all right
guys I'm gonna turn around play some
games after I edit this video I think
anyway see you guys next time
