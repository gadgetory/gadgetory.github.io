and I have in front of me the successor
to the extremely popular and extremely
successful defying r4 from fractal
design and this is the fractal define r5
this is now one amazingly silent
amazingly water cooling friendly beast
of a case other company is gonna have a
hard time beating this one so don't go
anywhere
EDG a is a CX 2.0 cooler with its three
phase six slot motor 11 swept fan blades
and double ball bearing design offers
reduced power
noise and thermals for the optimum
gaming experience click the link in the
description to learn more okay so the
define R 5 what's different well you
know when it comes to the aesthetics in
the outside of the case it really has
that pretty quite essential define look
to it but there are a lot of changes
both on the outside and the inside that
you don't want to be fooled by you don't
want to look at this and think oh it's
just a slight change of the defined
series no this has been pretty much
completely redefined now we'll go ahead
and start with the front panel the front
panel is where you spend a lot of your
time looking and most people complained
that they didn't want a door that opened
this way now I kind of agree with that
because most people if they have a
window on their panel on this side most
people put their computer on the right
side if you're right-handed the three
tend to put it and that's where the door
opens up incorrectly the opposite
direction but there are actually hinges
here on the side that you can simply
unscrew screw the door on the other side
and it will then open up up to the right
which is absolutely fantastic now taking
a look at the inside here you can see
that they've also increased the air flow
to the front air filter but now we have
a very open louvered filter with a mesh
dust filter that does a fantastic job at
keeping the 140 millimeter fans which
are also compatible with 120 millimeter
fans in the front nice and dust free now
they've also changed the fans a little
bit they're a little bit more sy
a little bit more noise optimized and
you do have room to add another 140
millimeter or 120 millimeter fan in the
front now when it comes to five and a
quarter it our tool is removable for the
little covers on there which is pretty
much normal for fractal and then you
have on the top your headphone jack
microphone jack a reset button power
switch two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 and
then again on the front the simulated
brushed finish on the front this is
plastic it's simulated brushed but that
it looks very fantastic now one way
they've also increased the airflow to
the front is as you can see we have nice
thick louvers nice open air flow so air
can come in and all the way around the
sides of the front of this case getting
nice optimized air flow I mean the
define our four was great at giving you
silence it didn't have the greatest
airflow now they have taken a lot of
time with this case all the way going
down to super silent you know sub silent
rooms I guess if it's even possible
measuring all the different silence and
and different designs of this case to
get it truly noise optimized and that's
what the defined series was about it was
all about silence and noise optimization
I mean in fact their whole campaign was
silence redefined get it redefined and
corny I know so on oh whatever thing on
the front I forgot to mention is it does
have a full length dust filter that
removes from the front all the way back
to the power supply so none of that
really silly half of a filter comes out
the front and the other half comes out
the back nope you can clean the entire
bottom of the PC filter right from the
front it's very easy to get in and out
of there as you can see it just snaps
into place there you go now when it
comes to the side here instead of having
the cover on there which they used to
have that you could cover up the side
fan that had that piece of noise
reduction foam on there and you can see
this the hex cutout they've gone away
with all of that and they've done you
know nice paneling both on the side and
on the top when it comes to removing the
fans slot if you will they found a way
to really integrate it into the case
without making the aesthetics look like
crap either one other thing I do like
about the side panel is they now have
basically a thumb latch locking
mechanism on the back so once you take
out the thumb screws you really don't
even need these in there because now
you've got this latch on the back and
now you can just take off the side panel
and there you go it's absolutely easy to
access so if you didn't even want to put
those thumb screws back on you don't
have to because it actually holds very
very tight it's not going anywhere it
doesn't rattle doesn't move so you could
actually if you go in and out of your
case a lot you don't even have to remove
that or take off those thumb screws or
put them back on just leave them off and
use the latching system as you can see
here on the inside of the side panel we
do have the sound deadening material and
this is what really gives a lot of aid
to the silence of this case it's really
known fractals really known for using
this material in all the defined cases
now taking a look at the inside here you
can see have a nice large motherboard
cut out giving you really easy access to
air coolers and water cooling back
plates and whatnot so you don't have to
worry about there being any issue with
compatibility and ease of installation
the motherboard tray is compatible with
ATX micro ATX mini ITX but EA TX
unfortunately is not supported on this
case like it was on the arc XL the
reason for that is you can see here on
the front where you have the grommets
here for your wire pass-through instead
of being flat it is slightly angled now
that's going to make for a lot easier a
lot cleaner cable management but
unfortunately unfortunately you lose
that V ATX compatibility but that's okay
because e ATX is not a really big player
and the ATX standard when it comes to
motherboards that I mean they're out
there like my z97 classified as an e ATX
but most people are running standard ATX
or smaller motherboards so I don't see
that being a huge issue we've got a
massive rubber cut out here on the
bottom for your power supply cables to
work their way through cable management
on this case is super easy and before we
talk about the hard drive cages and some
of the radiator support its go ahead and
take a look at the back of the case
to see exactly how much room we had back
there now what I do like is you can see
I undid these thumb screws but they
don't come out so you're not going to
lose them and I'll about you guys but I
hate undoing a thumb screw and not
catching it before I get to the last
thread and not the whole frickin side
panel on myself we're gonna leave that
in there because that's just classic but
anyway the screws won't come off the
side panel will attack you that's normal
that's actually a feature fractal design
put that even right in their own manual
but anyway same sound-deadening material
on the back panel behind the motherboard
tray taking a look at the back you can
see we have two again tool lists it's
kind of a coolest thing going on here
you guys notice I have not busted out a
single screwdriver yet we have a tool
list SSD mount removal system here mount
your SSD put the little tabs in there
tighten it down boom SSD is mounted just
that quickly velcro straps here on the
back again for cable management you know
I wasn't planning on building anything
in this case but I'm really starting to
feel like I need to now holy crap this
case has just got it all figured out the
fan controller is a SATA cable thank
goodness for that
I really hate when case manufacturers
give you a molex a 4-pin molex cable to
power things I mean most things are
going SATA now and that is a standard I
like to see but you can see you have
well over an inch of space back here I
would say well let's see I passed a J's
first knuckle so we're going to say
about an inch and a quarter of space on
the back here nice rounded edge so
you're not going to cut any of your
wires by routing them around right here
and then now we're going to go ahead and
move on to the bread-and-butter on this
case
okay so disclaimer I started to do a big
portion of this review and I stopped and
I went okay you know what this deserves
a teardown because I was talking about
all the water cooling options and there
was just so freakin many there was no
way I could actually show you without
tearing it all apart so if all of a
sudden the computer just kind of like
disassembled itself really fast on
camera that's why now that define are
five guys it's pretty much just a metal
shell and the reason for that is they're
giving you more radiator support and
more options than most cases on the
market I'm going to say all there are
other cases that are geared specifically
towards water cooling but none of them
are geared specifically towards water
cooling as well as silent PC if you want
it you can choose to have a completely
airtight watertight wall yeah we're not
going to fill it up with water we're not
doing like a mineral PCE in this but you
could have a silent air-cooled PC named
a silent water-cooled PC and not have to
compromise on your radiator support now
let's go ahead and talk about them I've
taken the hard drive cages out here to
prove a space point on this it's nothing
really new when it comes to the hard
drive cages other than they are thumb
screws I already mentioned that come out
without losing them and you can
rearrange these to get maximum space
like you could take the front one and
move it back still have room for a
standard link power supply and room for
a front radiator up to 60 millimeters
plus fans on there and stuff plenty of
room for airflow no problem whatsoever
so we're going to go ahead and set these
aside there's not a whole lot to talk
about with the drive cages typical sleds
you know same thing they've always used
the five and a quarter bay up top comes
out without tools well I guess
technically you need no actually take
that back these were completely thumb
screw list the bottom cage required a
Phillips because those are real screws
on the bottom but everything to this
point that I've taken out with the
exception of the bottom cage is
completely tooless now if we go ahead
and move all of this junk out of the way
we take a look at the raw cage that is
to define our v you can see radiator
support on this thing is freaking
massive all right let's start with the
top if you're running 120 millimeter
fans on the
top you can do a 120 a 240 and a 360
check it out
like we've already showed they have
opened up the entire top of the case for
360 rad support now what they've done is
just like they've done on their Arc
series they've taken the 120s and
they've pushed them instead of being
centered on the kasich everybody does
they've moved them towards the side of
the case away from the motherboards you
could run extra thick like monster ads
60 millimeter ads without any problems
mounting it it'll mount and not
interfere with your motherboard so you
can get extra thick radiators in there
now if you're going to do the 140
millimeter you can do a 140 a 280 or a
420 but unfortunately you're stuck with
55 millimeters of clearance including
the fans that means you can run a fan
which is a 25 millimeter fan and a 30
millimeter rad and go all the way up to
420 now when it comes to the bottom of
the case you can fit a 120 or 240 as
well as the big radiator up top and then
if you want it on the bottom here or on
the front you could fit and open up that
door you could fit on here a 120 a 240
or a 360 millimetre radiator that's just
insane that you could fit on this thing
a 360 on the front a 360 on the top and
a 240 on the bottom now you couldn't fit
them all at the same time there is going
to be some interference on there like
for instance you couldn't run a 240 or
360 on the front here and still have a
240 on the bottom they're going to
interfere right there but you know the
fact that you could do a 120 here and a
240 here and a 420 there you're going to
get much more radiator space than you
need and that's perfect because cards
like the r9 290 and 290x run extremely
hot the 780 s and the 780 Ti is and
Titans although they're not as hot as
202 9s and 290x they are still pretty
warm but you could take care of all of
that in this case and because of the
increased airflow on the sides you get
an awful lot of airflow through the
front so the front radiator and fans are
not choking the rest of the case you're
actually getting the air that it needs
now cable management on this thing is
fantastic the angled motherboard tray
all of the radiators support the tool
lists the extremely toolless options and
the only reason they didn't put tool
list screws on the
bottom I'm pretty convinced of is
because if you had the screw sticking
out with the thumb head on there it's
going to interfere with the filter other
than that this is by far a homerun as
far as I'm concerned when it comes to
fractal design now they don't give you a
whole lot of fans there's no top fan
there's only one front fan so you've got
a one in one intake in the front one
exhaust in the rear but you could fill
this up again with just as many fans as
I mentioned when it comes to radiator so
if you wanted to run a ton of slow rpm
fans on this you could do 140 in the
front 140 or - 140 s on the fret you
could do a 140 or - 120 s on the bottom
arm sorry - 120 s on the bottom you
could do 3 140 s on the top and a 140 on
the rear and run those puppies at like
600 rpm you get tons of airflow little
to no noise so guys that fractal design
r5 as far as I'm concerned is an
absolute winner if I had an award I
would get it right now I've always been
a fan of the fractal design cases I've
in fact I've been running an arc XL on
my test bench for a long time about a
year now and I've just never had any
issues or complaints to fractal design
in fact this case is available in black
white and titanium and they do have a
window side panel available for it as
well so guys tell me what you think
about this case what would you put in
this thing you know I'll be honest I
didn't fill it up with radiators right
now because I don't have enough to fill
it I don't have that many radiators in
my inventory first world problems all
right guys
tell me what you would build in this
thing and as always follow on Twitter if
you guys have any questions tell me
about your PC's on Twitter or Facebook I
love to hear about your guys's PC's
keeping the PC community alive and well
as always guys see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
