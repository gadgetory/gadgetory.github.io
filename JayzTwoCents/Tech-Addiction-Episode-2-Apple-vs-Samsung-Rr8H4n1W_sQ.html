it's tech addiction with jst sense and
we're going to get things started right
away here with some computer news amd's
new Trinity processor the 810 5800 plus
was released and somebody's already
benchmarked it to seven point three
gigahertz it's kind of impressive but
bulldoze are already hit eight point
three three gigahertz and these guys did
it by disabling two cores so it would be
big news but it's I guess it's pretty
good considering the fact that it's an
APU and it's got a built-in graphics
processor inside of it so but to the
guys out there who got Trinity up to
seven point three gigahertz good job now
where's Neil so TDK has set a brand new
world record when it comes to hard
drives they managed to squeeze six
terabytes 6tb I'd have a three and a
half inch drive imagine the amount of
adult content you can keep on that drive
and in high def and if you're not 18 or
21 or whatever you have to be in your
country or your residence say no to
drugs so we're through the grapevine
through the rumor mill through all of
that stuff when it comes to things that
are not yet confirmed but are floating
around everywhere like every single
Apple product that's ever been released
since 2007 asus which is the number one
motherboard manufacturer in the entire
world has reportedly reportedly made an
offer to buy asrock which is the number
three manufacturer in the world this is
big news if it turns out to be confirmed
because that means a big filtering
effect when it comes to the supply chain
for both of those particular
motherboards so it can be good news or
it could be bad news asus may decide to
stay with their own particular
motherboard manufacturing process and
supply chain leaving the other guys who
supply asrock out in the wind but I
don't think they'll do that because asus
is interested in asrock for the fact
that they make a good solid budget
motherboard I don't think they would
want to disrupt that I think they just
want to take on their processes by the
factories and bring in some cash I like
both motherboards in fact I've been
thinking about going Intel and if I do I
was actually looking at getting an
asrock motherboard because they're a lot
cheaper than asus
I do trust asus but they tend to be a
little bit pricey so this could be great
for the consumer if it turns out to be
true this just in gamers want to see
more boobies game studio team ninja who
came out with the popular dead or alive
series has just released dead or alive 5
and they're taking a lot of flack
regarding the anatomical proportions of
some of the women in their game and I
don't know who would really be
complaining I mean the game is already
tailored towards men the entire company
is always tailored towards men can't
really imagine too many men complaining
about size of TNA in those games but
somebody's complaining and what's funny
is when the studio was questioned about
their practice of making these ginormous
Lee anatomically incorrect boobs they
said that that's what the gamers want
they get a lot of comments from gamers
and feedback and apparently gamers want
to see more boobs let's go ahead and
file that one under duh team ninja
studios director yo hai shaam bori
recently told the game blog gamma sutra
that quote we actually got a lot of
feedback from people who were playing it
and saying we want bigger breasts i'm
assuming they mean they want the people
in the game to have bigger breasts
because if you sit there and play games
long enough whether you're male or
female you're gonna end up with some
huge tatas of your own so they said we
want bigger breasts make the characters
more like that he goes on to say it was
quite surprising really mr. sham bori it
was surprising to you that men want to
see bigger breasts you don't get out
much do you so this isn't exactly brand
new news but I finally got around till
checking out the crysis 3 trailer I have
to say it's absolutely amazing I can not
wait to play this game as a fan of the
priceless series if that wasn't evident
right here Crysis one and Crysis 2 I
mean look got big bat boxes I bought
this game back when boxes actually were
you know they use DVD cases hell I've
been playing games since the boxes came
in
no big five min quarter inch floppy
drives and at 16 of them to load a 5
megabyte game but anyway you're not
familiar with crisis it's probably one
of the most cutting-edge games there
ever was especially crisis one most
computers couldn't play it because the
programming on it was just really poor
but the Crytek engine had or the
CryEngine which are now calling
CryEngine 3 has been improved it is less
demanding it gives you some of the best
visuals I've ever seen in any game as
you can see right here the graphics of
it are just intense they're amazing the
gameplay of it is pretty intense to you
where this mechanical yet biomechanical
suit of armor that basically attaches
itself to your nerves and you control it
you can beef up your armor you can run
and jump fast or jump really high you
can go invisible you have amazing
reflexes you have this really cool heads
up display that shows you different
routes you can go and the expected
outcome of different routes you take
when you come to a particular encounter
with an enemy it even shows you where
ammo boxes are on the map and shows you
unique points of interest that the
developers think will enhance your
gameplay so you can choose to take the
most direct firefight route and even
tell you how to sneak around without
even engaging an enemy it's really cool
I suggest you take it out it comes out
februari of 2013 you don't have an exact
release date yet but februari is going
to be an awesome month because it's
Valentine's Day and I'm in love with
this game so crisis will you be my
Valentine that's not that's not gay
isn't so the 2012 digital content expo
in Tokyo Japan Toyota debuted something
they fake is revolutionary what they've
done is they've imprinted and augmented
reality in the backseat of your car they
debuted this and a Prius and what it is
it's in between the headrests of your
front seat there is a clear panel kind
of like a teleprompter and there's an
image that get just gets displayed on
that panel so when you turn around and
look at it you can see right through the
back seat of your car even right through
the people that are sitting in the
backseat of your car what it does is it
basically makes the back half of your
car disappear so you can parallel park
or back up I find
this image right here a little bit
racist and sexist shame on you Toyota
how on earth could you apply that an
Asian woman can't park or back up there
is absolutely no supporting evidence for
that I can I can't even keep a straight
face I mean look at this okay so
semantics which is one of the leading
companies when it comes to internet
security and data solutions has come out
with a brand new ad where they take a
server rack and they push it off the top
floor of an 18-story building smashing
it to the ground and bits basically
showing that your server and your data
and your applications in the cloud are
still online on one of their backup
emergencies severe data solution centers
or whatever they called it I find taking
an item and destroying it to be a very
cheap and cliche way of trying to get
more views this week Tim Cook came out
with a public apology regarding the Iowa
six Maps app you know they got rid of
Google they cut all the google apps from
their phone youtube the maps you got to
go and download a third party map now if
you actually want one that works one
that doesn't put museums in a river ones
that don't think that a farm in dublin
is actually an airport one that can
actually tell you where the apple store
is in sydney in the right location it's
pretty bad when your own Maps app send
you to the wrong location for your
outdoor one that if you live in England
and you want to get to London it doesn't
take you there by way of Canada so Tim
Cook came out with this apology letter
to all of the Apple users apologizing
for the apps not living up to its
standards and I know for a fact Tim
Cook's over there just wishing that
Steve are still around he loves him no
homo romance all that stuff we miss you
too Steve because you know when you were
around at least shit typically worked
and if it didn't at least you came out
and said well you're doing it wrong go
hold it that way wear gloves get a case
would give you one by the part that I
found to be so comical regarding his
letter is his solution to the problem
while they're working on it is to go to
the Google Maps website in book market
yes so we're going to get rid of man did
it get rid of Google Maps we're going to
give you a shitty map system one that
guides you all over the world to get
across the street and then we're going
to tell you to go and download google
maps Apple has come up with the
brilliant solution to incorporate the
apple store into fixing the math
problems and they are requesting that
every single retail Apple location
dedicate 40 hours they pick a couple of
employees and dedicate 40 hours to
examining your map system and pointing
out any errors that you might see now
how can you talk about Apple without
talking about the samsung 1 billion
dollar loss to the patent infringement
apparently Samsung has filed a juror
misconduct claim against the judgment
and is moving to have the judgment
thrown out and a new trial why because
the juror foreman was his name has some
funky name here Belvin Hogan being
accused of juror misconduct and juror
tainting and having an alternative
agenda against Samsung that's a pretty
big claim from Samsung but turns out the
facts are back in 1993 mr. Hogan was
sued by seagate yeah seagate the hard
drive hard drive manufacturer because
this guy was in technology did something
came up with something and got sued by a
seagate and Seagate sued him for patent
infringement okay so what does seagate
have to do with Samsung well it turns
out the lawyer who is heading up that
lawsuit against mr. Hogan in 1993 is
married to one of the partners that
currently represents Samsung in this
Apple lawsuit oh snap it's about to get
a little ugly upon that Samsung battle
there and because of this whole thing
going on I can't keep my iphone or my
galaxy s3 in the same pocket you should
see the things I have to listen to all
day long for those two hey oh hi what's
up how much I was checking out the Sun
do you really have to do you're retarded
hmm you're fat you're tiny you're
freakishly tall you don't have 4g I
don't need 4g cuz my big brother has 4g
no one likes you because you break if
you fall down put it I'm not touching
you stop that I'm not touching you stop
I'm not touching you I'm not touching
you cut it out I'm not your dad I'm not
touching you okay so just a couple of
weird things I want to talk about before
we get out of here today there is a new
thing out there called like a hug fest
and what it is put it on and it's not
some wireless communicator in there that
connects to facebook and anytime
somebody likes a status update a photo a
video share anything you put up there
somebody clicks that like button it if
lates inward to simulate you got a hug
so I say we all find this model's face
book right here and we all just mash the
like button and see if we can't squeeze
them to death like a catch a package or
a boa constrictor alright guys now we're
going to end this like we do every
single week and we're going to talk
about technologies dumbass of the Week
now i'm not going to display any names
or any pictures on this one because I
thought about it and I don't want to get
myself in any trouble when it comes to
disclosing a person's information but
i'll tell you the premise of the story
so in wisconsin there's a man who broke
into a house and he stole a bunch of
jewelry a bunch of electronics and he
gets away he runs away out of the house
and a couple of days later knock knock
knock it's the Popo open up we know
you're in there they arrest him and they
have all of the information that need
regarding who he is and knew exactly
where he lived why because when he broke
into this house he went on the family
computer to check his facebook status
and when he left he forgot to log out
so moral of the story is don't be a
dumbass seriously because I was just
stupid alright guys so that's all for
this week's October fifth edition of
tech addiction there's something you
want to talk about next week put it down
in the comments link me to an article
i'll check it out we'll talk about it
put up some funny images see if you
can't make a little bit of fun of it and
i hope you check me out next week see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
