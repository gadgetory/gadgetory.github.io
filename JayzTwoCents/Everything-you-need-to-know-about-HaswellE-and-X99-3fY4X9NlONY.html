rolling we're speeding on both by the
way for editing Jay later this is this
is the video with JJ and this is your
intro alright we're already oh I'm sorry
where do you want me to look that's
gonna be the ignore this cam yeah this
is my year old camera okay that's for
our nice little yep yeah yeah immersion
eyes are all burning now with the help
it's easier for a guy like Paul to say
sit up straight he's not carrying the
brain though yeah I'm carrying your work
out oh man this is me hey what's up guys
Jase two cents here and if you can't
tell I have a very awesome guest today
jayjay from Asus hey soos you know it's
one of those things our business how do
you say Asus Asus well I say awesome
guys nobody wears never talked about x99
and Intel's new haswell-e refresh
actually it's not a brand new platform
don't go away
all right JJ first of all thank you for
making the trip down here to talk about
Intel's brand new platform haswell-e
and of course x99 the much-anticipated
platform all of us enthusiasts have been
waiting for I know some about it but you
know a whole lot more than me so my
first question to you is gonna be what
are the three SKUs that are coming out
for haswell-e
and how do they kind of compare to X I
mean it well for one you know like you
said this is actually an entirely new
chipset it's an entirely new CPU
architecture so we're pretty much moving
over with into the Haswell architecture
but we're moving it to a higher core
higher cache a higher PCI Express
enabled part and what we're gonna have
in terms of the CPUs that are gonna be
available at the launch are going to be
the 59 60 X so the Extreme Edition part
we're then gonna have eight core 16
threads that's correct
eight core 16 threads 20 Meg's of cash
on that CPU is an absolute beast of a
process single and easy then yeah for
anybody that's looking to be able to
throw a content creation application in
there or you know very high-end GPU
based configuration platform this thing
is just gonna just chew these things out
it's just it's a it's truly a beastly
processor and bc platform when you talk
about the secondary CPU still extremely
high-end it's going to be the k part
actually all three parts this generation
are all unlock so they're all
overclockable and they're all featuring
that haswell-e based architecture and
that's an important point because just
like the has well incorporated the fiber
or the essentially that integrated
voltage regulation technology built in
the cpu right we also now have that this
for this generation which is different
than the previous Sandy Bridge er the
Ivy bridge-e processors so that's going
to be another aspect in terms of the
change and then you're gonna have the
entry level the 5820k part so the main
difference between the top two parts so
the K in the extreme to the entry level
k part is going to be the number of PCI
Express lanes right as well as the cache
so the 2k parts will feature 15
megabytes of cache which is still still
massive yeah I mean you're still almost
looking almost double the cache of what
a current high-end 49 70 K has with 8
Meg's right you're going over 15 and
then the extreme having 20 Meg's right
but the other big differential will be
in the PCI Express Lanes the PCI Express
Lanes on the entry level part will be 2
eight lanes versus the two hire in skew
so we'll have 40 let me separate they're
kind of explained real quick with those
lanes mean in terms of haswell-e versus
kind of the Z series yeah so how is it
compared to say a forty nine seventy or
4790k so that's actually it's a great
question to ask because traditionally
when a lot of people kind of factor the
platform they only look at it from the
number of course right but actually one
of the biggest advantages that the
higher end platforms offer is more PCI
Express Lanes how that ultimately
translates to use when you look at
traditionally a motherboard and you look
at all the slots that are on the
motherboard as well as the number of
connections right so the number of SATA
ports the number of USB ports even
add-on ports such as wireless or
secondary LAN all those have to be
hooked into a PCI Express line and so
they have to be fed ultimately by the
lanes that are provided by the CPU now
in z-9 we're like plx and stuff comes in
correct and when you look at something
like a z97 based motherboard the cpu can
only provide 16 lanes right so that
works pretty good for most standard
users and even to a degree most
enthusiasts right but once you start to
trend it into an area where you get to
really high-end boards you're looking at
maybe 3-way 4-way GPU configurations
content creation configurations where
maybe you're running like two GPUs and
maybe then like a raid card and then
like to capture cards right I mean all
kinds of no term utilize those lands
exactly you you run generally on some
form of z97 series board you'll
eventually run into a point where
certain things will have to be
conditionally under operation so what I
mean by that is maybe the secondary port
turns off if you're using like all the
SATA ports right you get some type of
permutation that depending on how you're
configuring your system it changes what
may be usable and what's not usable now
there's this kind of gray area where
some other boards as you noted will
feature some form of what's called a
multiplexing chip it's a PL X it's not
true PCI Express Lanes it's pretty much
kind of like expanding them out kind of
like in the same way a hub does but
there are some disadvantages to it in
the long term in terms of what you have
a little bit from latency as well as
also just from that you can't actively
still drive all those lanes and unison
and that's really where this platform is
going to give you just much more
flexibility that's so many more lanes
it's so much more cores got so much more
cache what I love about this has Willie
refresh or keep going to refresh I want
to say it's refreshed it's a whole new
platform but it's you know the X
relaunch 2x 99 is the fact that the
entry-level CPU is still a hex core yeah
I mean the entry-level series skews on
both sandy II and IV II we're four cores
correct where they really the benefit
over the Z series came into it being a
quad channel capable chip but now along
with the PCI Express Lanes exactly and
but now with it being a hex you're
always buying into now gonna be a
platform that's gonna offer you more
cores and more cash so I think Intel
will paid attention to that this
generation a lot of feedback they
collected is they want to make sure that
if you bought into this platform you
felt that you were getting the kind of
the most future proofing and you really
had guaranteed level of improvement over
the current platforms that were
available in the marketplace so whether
it's like you said cores whether it's
cash whether it's PCI Express Lanes and
all those ways you're going to get an
improvement and of course the other
really big one that we haven't even
talked about is the inclusion of ddr4
this is the first platform that's gonna
be offering ddr4 as compared to all the
other current chipsets that are
currently out in the marketplace only
support ddr3 okay before we start
talking about ddr4 I know my audience
has probably already asked themselves
we've talked about it let's talk about
overclock ability of these chips sure
because has well what has well first
launched you know the overclocking on
them there was a lot of issues with
temperature there was a lot you know
because it was a whole new architecture
overclocking was kind of a challenge for
many enthusiasts on as well z-series
since it kind of incorporates a lot of
that same structure tell me what it's
been like working with haswell-e in the
overclocking so overclocking is actually
quite solid on the platform so in terms
of what you're gonna be looking at in
terms of what you can actually
realistically achieve you know the base
parts you're looking at about three
gigahertz in terms of the operating
frequency what you can get in the real
world in terms of overclocking with you
know reasonable air cooling solution so
like a high performance you know close
the water cooling solution like a you
know like an H 100 or something in that
class but most people are you know for
especially I think for this type of
platform but even if you were dropped
down to like a you know like an H 80
type kind of cooler you would still be
looking at 4 gigahertz plus easily right
easily so clearly the thermals are good
you have to be able to use an all-in-one
cooler so we show the H 80 which is a
single 140 millimeter
push-pull option so in the past I know
they'd run fairly fairly warm to where a
lot of people on the x-series the
enthusiast platform would also probably
want to incorporate custom water cooling
or full custom loops but the fact that
you're able to achieve these over clocks
you're mentioning on an all-in-one
cooling solution of thing is fantastic
ya know it's it's extremely cool that
you're gonna be able to reach you know
4.2 to 4.6 gigahertz on you know
realistic cooling solutions now that
doesn't mean that you know there aren't
certain factors to taking consideration
just like it has well there is a wide
variance and the CPU and the voltage
that is required to get to that CPU so
nominally most users will probably be
somewhere within a target range of about
probably 43 to maybe about 45 in terms
of doing frequencies use yes well
actually that would be even on the X
part so that would probably be your
worst case scenario because it has the
most amount of course so it's the most
complex on overclock that number
surprised me because I honestly thought
with the 3.0 base clock on that right
that they were they were saying okay
well due to the due to the
infrastructure to complexity right yeah
maybe it just overclocking wasn't gonna
be a huge portion of it I know they
advertised you know that the haswell-e
was a it was towards an enthusiast and
overclockers and I thought well because
of the base course our clock is so much
lower than the other two SKUs maybe it
couldn't achieve those those you know
for 4.0 plus numbers but you're saying
they even in the worst case scenario
they were reaching for you yeah even a
worst case scenario overall from what
we're seeing from the current set of
CPUs which are going to be indicative of
retail mass production CPUs right pretty
much everybody's gonna be targeting
somewhere between at a minimum four to
4.2 gigahertz the majority sample is
probably closer to maybe 60 to 70% are
gonna be in that like I said 43 about 45
could you imagine for 25 gigahertz on 16
threads is insane I can't get my mind
around that and it does it makes me
smile because when you get to use that
type of system and you gets it the two
through something at my performance it's
pretty monster and it's awesome for
multi-threaded applications like editors
and but also to live streamers yeah it's
huge because if you got to do gaming and
rendering on the same machine like I do
when I when I fire up my twitch stream
because I don't like to do streaming
boxes and stuff I just keep it simple
yep use something like xsplit dxtory you
know you're pulling the DirectX the fact
you basically essentially have to the
performance of to eight core or eight
thread processors like a z97 granite
doesn't just slice in half right but
just theoretically that those threads
can be diversified to where you're not
going to get framedrops in your game
nearly as much when you're doing live
streaming yeah I think I I'm gonna tell
you right now I'm I couldn't decide what
core I wanted go away tonight I was
pretty set on the fact that I was going
to just go with the 59 30k because well
you know they probably overclock better
but you came in here today JJ and you've
flipped my plans upside down and you're
costing me more money well so continuing
actually on that point you know one of
the great advantages to though from if
we talk about total frequency is that
the K part versus the X part because it
actually has less course we'll get a
little bit more overclocking so you're
gonna maybe look at an additional you
know 100 200 megahertz so overall
effectively you look at the best cpu-z
both on K and on the X part you're gonna
probably be somewhere within the range
of about four point six to four point
eight gigahertz but overall as a whole
you know that's gonna be in a much lower
subset in terms of achievable CPUs
probably right maybe ten percent of CPUs
are gonna be in the you know four seven
two four eight range and very low are
gonna be beyond that the best overall
weight weighted high-performance CPUs
are gonna be CPUs that can actually run
46 across all eight cores and I always
exceed threats I would much I personally
much rather have a slower overclocking
CPU though with those 16 threads yeah
cuz you're talking four extra threads
over the hexa core and 200 megahertz
it's very it's very difficult to notice
unless you're doing synthetic
benchmarking and day to day used anyway
on a for Corey yeah once once you can
get from that three gigahertz the you
know let's say for point to four point
four right the difference between that
4.4 to 4.6 is far lower but you know
there's a lot of knobs and switches in
this platform in general as well so when
we talk about how you can kind of tune
the platform for even better performance
it's not just gonna come from pure
frequency there's gonna be the cash
ratio or exactly there's the ddr4 aspect
of it there's also even going to be the
per core overclocking you know a lot of
users always just kind of treat the
platform from a singular frequency
perspective but a lot of what you have
available to you here is how you can
tune it you can tune me
to have just four cores operate at 4.6
4.7 gigahertz and then maybe have all
eight cores actually operate at let's
say four point three four point two
right even giving yourself that much
better performance so as you go from it
let's say maybe playing game two premier
to handbrake to whatever defecation
control them in it exactly exactly and
it gives you much more flexibility so
all the way around I think it's an
exciting platform for enthusiasts for
overclockers and there's a great level
of performance and you know thermals are
gonna be something that you have to
always still keep in mind depending on
what your cooling solution is the bid
ranges play around a little bit with
that they're quite variable you know
like you said I think wrapping that up
you know you're talking about probably
vids from about one point two
seventy-five to a little bit beyond
maybe you know one point three five to
one point three seven five but even if
you can thermally keep it in check one
thing that you do want to keep in mind
is going to be the current it's gonna be
coming through the system that is a big
factor as well right I'm talking about
all this eight core sixteenth red stuff
is giving you an eye twitch because it's
right there okay so the other two
aspects of this launch obviously ddr4
and x99 so what kind of improvements
have we really seen with ddr4 over ddr3
in terms of performance well in terms of
performance the great thing is that from
a stock perspective ddr4 is already
going to be providing you better
performance at lower voltage so you're
gonna get better thermals and lower
power by 2 volts you're saying correct
1.2 volts is the default along with 2133
so when we compare that to pretty much
what the equivalent or the standard is
on the dr3 side ddr3 is looking at
generally 1.5 at 1600 so that's come
dims as 1.65 yeah yeah that's correct so
all the way around that's a great
improvement but really where we get a
lot more leg room is gonna be in what
the frequency can be afforded now I mean
some people are looking initially a ddr4
and looking at taking a look at the
timings and thinking wow the timing
seemed really tie but you have to keep
in mind that the frequency is high and
the voltage is very low that it's
achieving that at and actually it scales
actually exceedingly well so that if you
go ahead and drive a little bit more
voltage to it or you want to increase
frequency it's got a leg room we're
seeing 2133 modules 2400 modules reach
26 2800 frequency you know with Corsair
the system right here that we're running
this are 2800 dims and we're already
getting a vengeance
yeah these are the new Vengeance xlx
locomotives really yeah nice of the air
coolers won't be an interview yeah you
know it's fantastic so sorry all the way
around though from a frequency
perspective there's just a lot more
legroom built into the platform I mean
at launch you're gonna be seeing kits
pretty much from about 21 33 to about
3,200 and you know even as a year
year-and-a-half go by that number is
only going to continue to scale up
significantly beyond that right now ddr3
we're about at the end road where we're
hitting kind of a wall where 300 where
excuse me 3000 you know 30 31 32 hundred
it's possible but it gets very very very
complex on being able to achieve that
consistent are you finding though that
you know overclocking these CPUs you can
still maintain those high frequencies of
RAM for sure it is actually definitely
possible on most of these actually CPUs
are not gonna have an issue running the
memory dividers at 2400 2600 even 2800
but as always this is an extremely
important point that you bring up as the
platform as a whole everything affects
everything right right so the higher you
drive CPU frequency
the harder it will be also to drive high
memory frequency only the best of the
best of the CPUs can do everything well
so that means if some CPUs may do that
Silicon lottery would yeah some CPUs may
do 46 at 2800 and a high cash ratio of
4.6 other CPUs might only do let's say
4.6 but the memory divider maybe is not
as strong and it can only do 2400 and
the cash ratio is at 4 gigahertz so this
is always a little bit of permutation
and there's always like you said that
lottery effect but the great consistency
as far as what we're seeing is that it's
still extremely consistently high across
all the CPUs and if you're also not
going to be overclocking although all
the parts by default all overclockable
so I would say over them yeah well at
least you for you know the 4 gigahertz
marker right but is easy to achieve
those yes yes very actually very easy
even at that marker though there
shouldn't generally be any issues
running fairly high aggressive ddr4
frequencies right an exampie profile
full of full compatibility yeah there is
a new XMP profile spec though but of
course we've worked with with all the
memory partners and especially with
Coursera to make sure that you got great
interoperability
compatibility so you can drop it in
there you can go ahead and able the X
and P and you can be rock and rollin
yeah but yeah you have I have to assume
too that even though the worst
performing my worst performing I mean
the lower range of overclocking ability
of these chips it's gonna outperform the
z97 series just hands-down in every way
possible yeah well I mean the great
thing that you have overall if we just
kind of recap on all these points is
that one architectural e right we've
gone ahead and incorporated that letters
latest generation of the core right and
that's very important because those are
instruction sets right so that's the IPC
performance historically you know the
higher cores they usually use older
generational IPC right so you get the
cores and you get the cash
but sometimes the the newer generation
processor features better efficiency and
better architecture but this way around
we pretty much get everything we could
really want we get the cores we get the
cache the Express Lanes
the overclocking capability the tuning
to it all and ddr4 it is truly the
absolute best enthusiast platform now
it's not an entry level platform this is
not gonna be something to work out of
simply yeah this is not for the users
that are interested in building you know
an $800 gaming rig right this is really
for users that are looking to build you
know really top-line high-performance
systems but also that are probably
targeting a long-term value proposition
oh yeah you build this type of system
and you've got you're thinking I'm not
gonna upgrade from year to year or even
in two years you're probably targeting
you know three to five year I've cycles
I get a lot of people ask me questions
you know they're still in x58 is it
worth going to X I mean I never I always
told them no hold off and even then
unless you really have a need for all of
the added benefit in performance of X 99
and haswell-e
it still may not make sense to upgrade
for you depending on what your usage
cases are yeah because you have your use
cases you're just doing general browsing
and gaming you may not see much of an
improvement in terms of daily driving at
these days that's a great point and that
actually probably is gonna cover into
some of the other content pieces that we
talked about but from our perspective
also as a motherboard vendor we also try
to look at the total experience so
sometimes you don't always upgrade
purely from performance you might
upgrade for other aspects of
functionality usability right so like on
X 58 maybe you're missing USB 3 maybe
you don't have SATA 6g
maybe the fan control functionality is
limited and you wish your system was
quieter right so you know I think what a
user should always do first and foremost
and you've done a great job with the
content that you've provided to your
viewers is try to look at what's your
realistic usage everyday right what do
you want out of your system and some of
those things are definitely gonna be
performance oriented some of those
things may be usability oriented and
then figure out okay is that something
that I need to transition over to a
platform for and then also in that same
vein which platforms enable those
experiences right it might not be that I
have to jump all the way over to X 99 to
do it right I can jump over to you know
z97 right you know it just depends right
you know balance those things out and
this is where you know what I'm sure
will get some users say well it doesn't
make any sense I have z97 there's no
point every user is always gonna be in
respective camp to what makes sense to
them and this is just kind of rounding
out that entire portfolio right just
like you've got three monitors most
people would say there's no reason for a
GTX 780 Ti part right right well if
you're only running a 1080p panel then
there probably isn't right but if you're
somebody that has this then of course it
makes sense you need higher-end
components to be able to enable the
experience you want there's there's
there's a usage scaling that's involved
with Hardware scaling I mean yeah
everyone's situation is different
well there you have it guys x99
haswell-e there's a lot of information
now this video is a little longer than
the norm but the information very very
quality information hey uh Jerry that's
gonna have to go into now choake just
twice jjjj Jerry to measure names like
John alright guys I know this video has
been a little longer than the norm from
my channel but there was a lot of
amazing information here as brought to
us by JJ thank you very much for a
couple on a plane coming all the way
down here bringing your hardware that I
don't whatever so guys uh x99 amazing
platform the eight cores bringing more
than I thought was gonna be achievable
on the table and I just can't what you
guys are gonna see some x99 stuff on
this channel in the future guaranteed so
guys thanks for watching as always make
sure you go check out PC DIY as well
they have a channel over there plug your
