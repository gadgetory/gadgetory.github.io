what's up tech nerds Jays two cents here
and I've got it videos that I think it's
going to be kind of important now
recently we talked about the new launch
of KB Lake and the upcoming launch of
Rison and what those two CPUs have in
common is they're going to require
Windows 10 to have full support from
Microsoft and I really got me thinking
what the heck does that mean what does
that mean full support what happens if
you try and install an older operating
system like 8.1 on something like KB
light guys I would try Windows 7 but I
don't actually have an ISO for that so
sorry like we talked about in Tech Talk
I'm actually bootleg stuff so sorry I
did a decent amount of research going
into this video because I was curious as
to if anyone has actually tried this and
believe it or not I was having hard time
finding any concrete information of
what's going to happen if you try
installing an old OS on kb lake so
here's what we're going to do I've got
my i-5 7600 K back here running at 5
gigs the same machine I talked about
before and it has got a GTX 1080 gaming
extra MSI and I'm gonna do two things
I'm just going to do a Cinebench run and
I'm going to do a Metro last light run
in DirectX 11 the problem is there's
there's no way to really do this test
and see definitively what it means when
Microsoft says it's not supported it's
not support it doesn't mean it won't
work it just means we're not going to
support it like they have a problem
they're gonna be like oh well not our
problem but what happens when you try it
now I'm using Cinebench because I
consider a stress test to be a pretty
good indicator of whether or not a piece
of hardware is solid now this doesn't
mean it's hitting all of the different
tasks that a CPU has to do which means
it's probably missing some of the errors
that might pop up if we end up doing
this on an OS it's not supported because
remember the operating system basically
scans your system when it's installing
it and then it gets everything ready
ready and says oh here's the hardware
you have here's the ini files and all
the things we're going to load to make
that Hardware talk to the software so
that's where the problem could possibly
lie now obviously this is going to work
because it's supported its Windows 10
but remember this is the baseline in
case you curious and I 570 600 K at 5
gigahertz is giving me an 830 score on
Cinebench r15 so you guys can do your
own test to kind of
it actually beat out a 4770k its top
speeds that's cool
non hyper-threaded CP ba hyper-threaded
cpu i like that the reason why I'm using
Metro 2033 last lights benchmark is
because it's a pretty stressful dx11
benchmark if I want to compare this any
kind of performance difference or any
difference whatsoever means trying to
see what happens before and after I have
to at least have something that's
comparable in both OS so I can't use a
dx12 benchmark because then I can't run
it in Windows 8.1 yeah well just let
this test continue into it we get but
also what am I doing here is I'm taking
the exact same SSD that Windows 10 is on
right here
a savage 960 and we're going to end up
putting Windows 8.1 on here loading up
all the same stuff and the first thing
we're going to test though is whether or
not updates will even work because
Microsoft says it's not supported when
it does its update it's all based on
hardware and stuff so who knows we may
not even get as far as being able to do
this test that's kind of the point of
this video so the average framerate was
exactly 100 and 60 fps a 10-minute ease
pretty badass why am I not using a 7700
K you might ask I've got bigger plans
for this guy set aside all right let's
get Windows 8.1 loaded on here at least
try it let's see what happens
installation is done reboot time this is
now the moment of truth what happens
when we get into the desktop I think
it's going to explode
I think being thinking getting devices
ready this is when it would see what CPU
is in there thinking and black screen
for a little while been sitting like
this for a couple minutes now hmm well
we'll give it a little more time
it's been several minutes now it's just
up Lucas we got a blue screen here
watchdog violation that's what we got
that's funny that right when I hit
record this popped up well let it reboot
and see what happens but watchdog
violation well I don't know this time we
got a little bit farther ok now we're
checking for updates this might be the
part where it comes back with like donno
what CPU you're using I think it's weird
that we blue screen during the
installation process but then again it
is still running the five gigahertz
overclock so we might have had a funky
thing happen there but once again we
wait during all of like the doomsdayers
online with their articles saying that
this wasn't going to work this was the
part where they thought that we would
see the most incompatibility would be
during the updates where it's trying to
apply updates
there's no ini files or such available
for that do we just restart no there we
go
okay updates are done so clearly it was
able to update itself and instead of our
apps no don't do that the Microsoft
ecosystem the most unfriendly ecosystem
there is you know what they say the only
thing I use good for is downloading
other browsers so far everything's
working just fine like you would never
know you were on a processor that's not
supported with a certain operating
system but I'm going to install my
drivers and I'll reserve my opinions to
the end so this is like the third lockup
that I've experienced so far since that
blue screen I showed you I don't know if
it's relate related to the overclock or
know the truth because overclock is in
rock solid in my Windows 10 environment
I've been using that fight there goes
fine news I've been using that 5
gigahertz overclock all along in fact I
even bumped up the voltage a little bit
since some of the other crash is
thinking it might have been OC related
but now I'm not so sure because some of
the article said that random crashes and
freezes could be a side effect of the
quote unquote non-supported CPU and it
seems to happen every time I'm
installing something so I'm going to
pull the overclock back just a tad 24.9
at least to see if I can get through the
installation
now it does actually recognize KB Lake
it says right up here Core i5 7600 K KB
lake at 3.8 gigahertz that's the turbo
clock or whatever it's currently running
at 4.9 4 gigahertz so I've got my 5 gig
overclock going right now where to start
up Cinebench here and this is to me
going to be kind of the real telltale
sign on whether or not there's any sort
of stability issues at least now I I'm
not testing for differences in
performance right now I am checking for
differences in stability now we've
already seen several crashes as I
mentioned I still can't I still don't
know what caused that I mean the
watchdog error usually is related to
like an overclock but I've been running
that same overclock without any problems
the whole time I've been running the KB
Lake system over here you guys to see
I've left the system up so don't know
what that one's all about but I expect
performance here to be pretty much the
same I don't expect there to be any
differences here now I can't think of
any testing scenario I could do that
would hit all the different types of
instructions sets that the CPU would go
through to check for any sort of
compatibility issues that will say this
updated fine nothing said oh oh this
isn't compatible nothing at all so if
you were out there buying a hardware and
just throwing it together and you didn't
know that Microsoft is only supporting
Windows 10 then you might not think
there was ever a problem so we got a 822
so 8 points difference I mean it's a
little bit of a performance difference
there can't call that CPU support
related in any way shape or form Metro
last light
I don't expect there to be any real
performance difference same cards no
overclock on the card the first time
there's no overclock on it this time I
expect it to be pretty much the same as
we got the first test on Windows 10 was
160 FPS I guess we'll just have to see
exactly what we get this time around 157
FPS so 3 FPS different 150 7.07 so less
just under 3 FPS differently so what
does it mean then when Microsoft says
that they're only going to support
Windows 10 with KB Lake well do you
remember that video I did where I tried
to do the unofficial 3-way SLI of GTX
1080
when Nvidia said they're only supporting
two-way SLI remember how I saw weird
crashes or games that would even load or
really just bizarre behavior that's a
perfect example of something that's only
supported where that means nobody's
checking for
coding for or fixing issues found in any
sort of test environment or particular
hardware environment that's outside the
realm of what's supportive so if I
started having weird issues with KB Lake
and Windows 8.1 any of those bugs
submitted are not going to be looked at
by anybody if I even called up Windows
tech support mo K I'm having this weird
problem and they see that I'm using KB
Lake on an OS that's not supported
they'll be like well than sorry we can't
help you that's um support it that's
basically what that means it doesn't
mean it won't necessarily the work as
you see it worked fine at least for the
small test configuration that I did here
are the test scenarios that I just used
but obviously there's nothing I could do
here right now that would test every
single iteration of use case for the CPU
MSOs that's just impossible for one
person to do would take a long time to
do that but AMD might be a different
story
at least KB Lake is built on skylake
which is supported by Windows now and
8.1 doesn't mean the future Windows is
it going to start putting a mess pushing
out a message to you saying hey your CPU
is not supported on this OS update to
Windows 10 you start seeing that crap
all over again
or even worse locking down your OS and
having it not work at all anymore
because you're using an unsupported CPU
that would be an extreme dick move of
Microsoft but let's not put that past
that Microsoft makes dick moves all the
time but AMD's Rison is built on an
entirely new CPU architecture something
that Windows has never seen on the older
OSS so if the drivers in such needed for
the OS to work with the CPU is not even
existing in the older OS is like 8.1 and
older then it may not work for install
at all that's something I will be
testing when Rison comes out anyway guys
there you go it works fine for me if you
guys have tried this comment down below
and let me know if you had any weird
issues and what they were I'm surprised
that I didn't couldn't find a single
video or anybody talking about actually
doing this online so I figured what the
heck I would do it myself there was an
easy enough test sound off in the
comments guys hit like if this video
helped you hit just like if you thought
it's less and if you got stuck then give
me a suggestion is what you think would
have made it better anyway time to go
guys thanks for watching as always I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
