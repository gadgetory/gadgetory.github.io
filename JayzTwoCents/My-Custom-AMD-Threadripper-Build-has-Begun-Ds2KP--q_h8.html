video but I'm going to do it anyway
okay so cooter reached out to me quite a
while ago wanting me to take a look at
this case actually long before Computex
even I've been putting it off and
putting it off and finally they dropped
it off and I and I told them I don't
know if I can get to it anytime soon but
I you know I thought would be a cool
video is at least trying to put it
together because I've been searching for
the chassis for my thread ripper build
okay I'm building myself an epic thread
Ripper system and I just when I do these
custom builds I picking out the CPU
picking up the water cooling stuff the
GPU is that stuff's easy but when it
comes to chassis that is the hardest
part for me and this thing right here is
pretty cool because it's all flat packed
and you've got whoa it's got rods like
I'm like a basher right there oh okay so
we don't want to damage anything right
because guys I only keep doing these I'm
like anything that includes even a semi
unboxing because you guys can laugh at
me okay that's fine that's fine but I
don't want to damage any of this got
five millimeter tempered glass side
panels all made from aluminum lynnium
whoa look at this we just make a big
foam case some assembly is required
here's the Cougar fans although they're
very cool and they're Cougar II yellow
or orange I don't think I'm going to use
these fan cooker make some good fans but
I don't want an orange theme and that's
part of what puts me off about this case
is obviously it's got this NS set to
come out last it's got this big orange
piece on here now I could have it
anodized but I can also just paint it
the one thing that kind of concerns me
about this case too is a lot like the
Terry Crews project with that tau to
point O case it's completely open and
that's going to make some things like
cable management you complete and utter
nightmare oh I think these are the side
panels the glass now yes they are
careful with those
I like have this fan right here gets its
own like what makes this fan more
special than the other two okay I think
we have to take the glass out next
don't jinx me like that probably shut up
oh man it's underneath okay I can take
this whole thing out at the 1d there we
go
safe and sound away from me look at that
I mean that's essentially the chassis
right there I think it looks a lot like
Reinhardt helmet
oh that's pokey they got me in the eye
we almost made it oh my god I feel like
this was a bad idea
the drive you this is actually the this
bottom here okay
these are feet they got rubbers I'm
stupid okay okay stupid okay step one I
have to meet you put it together that's
the point
ah he's come apart d1a what's d1a and
this just feel like quality though tell
you that much all the parts feel very
highly like the anodizing is very high
quality
I don't see any blemishes really okay I
need to go upside down you just I owe
you tea yes wow I saw this stuff Wow
we had a bet there's an extension cord
taped down and basically the first
person to trip over it owes the other
person an Arnold Palmer
so I have to buy Tempe today and then
reveling in that my thumb got caught in
there because that like pushed apart and
then it clamped down I quit I'm feeling
the slide panel is going to add like all
of its rigidity you know what I mean oh
there we go so you can control it looks
like the link there there there and
that's the torque force so tighten it up
so here's what it looks like so far I'm
going to say that it's actually kind of
flimsy without the glass in there like
kind of scary flimsy once the glass is
in then it sort of ties it all together
it's definitely unique now I think this
might be the case that I use for all
potassium qualities or the case that I
use for the thread grip or build it's
going to have lots of air flow which
means the radiators are going to be
completely efficient it's efficient as
they can possibly get the chassis isn't
going to hold back any of the cooling a
little bit more dust will be able to
make its way in there but it looks like
if I put the fans on the top up here
that I could fit about a 45 millimeter
rad on the top a 360 mil rad because
it's got three 120 millimeter fan slots
and two on the front and it looks like I
could fit maybe even a thicker than 45
to 40 on the front and thing that
concerns me is if I'm going to do SLI in
here like to 1080p is or something then
I'm going to have a single loop for all
this not dual loop which would be kind
of nice in terms of maintenance but it
also means that we're going to dump in a
lot of heat into this loop to 1080p is
that you know we're going to be
overclocked and an overclocked thread
Ripper that's base TDP is like 180 watts
so we're me talking quite a bit of heat
but fortunately with it wide open like
this would be efficient to cool so
anyway you guys tell me what you think
the Cougar case so it's really narrow
which is nice like I'm used to skunk
works which is really really wide but if
you guys take a look right here down the
front look at that look how narrow that
is so the only thing that I think
concerns me a little bit though it's
just
cable management on this it's definitely
going to be tough now as you can see
right here you can actually mount
storage on the back of this as well if
you want the only thing it kind of sucks
though is you have to take the
motherboard out to access these screws
so I think it'd be nice to have SS DS
mounted on the back rather than this mid
plate right here that you guys saw me
install this is where hard drives and
SSDs are intended to go kind of facing
out so you can see them but you know if
that was out then it would be easier to
actually route my tubing and stuff
through here
but you know it'd be an easy system to
build in though because there's so many
accessible sides I like when they put
the power supply because it's low and
it's centralized in the chassis so this
is giving it a lot of ballast weight so
it doesn't really want like feel like
it's tippy at all
again that flex though until the panels
on the front that flex is just something
you have to deal with the zenith extreme
board though is kind of nice because it
doesn't have a standard i/o shield
that's built in so of course that it's
perfect for something like this it
doesn't have a place for you to put that
i/o shield on the low LEDs right there
so you'd be able to read it it's got a
fan right there to cool the vrm which
again is open environment without it
being a chassis so again cooling on this
would be pretty efficient and the
footprint is really small it's not a
huge case so I know maybe this is maybe
this is the case this right here though
like I've already said I'm going to
remove this and I'm going to change the
color either through anodizing or
painting not powder coating though this
is aluminum so we can anodized it and
Nick had suggested that we go with
something that sort of matches the VRMs
up here more of a gunmetal look which i
think would be kind of cool because then
we'll have the two-tone like the
motherboard and I'm kind of thinking
going with a white as the accent color
but again I'm not I'm not positive on
that yet I don't think I'm going to go
with some kind of a nano fluid just
because of I don't want to deal with
changing colors or anything although I
that problem really doesn't exist on the
green like the green on skunkworks is
still extremely vibrant and looks really
good the blue and the system that built
with the glass tubing that's well over a
year old is still nice and vibrant it
just seems to be the Reds that are a
problem so I have to do some custom
stuff like covering up the logos here on
the ax 200 iso we get rid of that red
and yeah I think it's going to be a
pretty cool build we have to come up
with some neat accent lighting of some
sorts maybe I'll hold a little contest
for naming this system I don't know if
you guys if you guys can think of a cool
name for my thread gripper build based
on this chassis and this sort of look
then put your comments down below I'm
honestly thinking like it otherwise like
Reinhardt keeps coming to hand there to
mine but I know there's already
Reinhardt seam develops and stuff too I
don't want to do that I just look like I
swear it looks like a Reinhardt helmet
to me
you know but I mean I don't even play
overwatch so that wouldn't really be
applicable to me I don't think now I'm
not going to actually put the glass on
though to show you how much it doesn't
flex because I'm leaving even that
protected inside of its foam until we're
ready to use it so I'm not putting that
on for now but the glass obviously
follows the shape of this case anyway
time to go if you guys can think of a
cool name based on this aesthetic let me
know down in the comments maybe if you
guys come up with a good name as a
collective we'll use it or I'll come up
with my own I don't know
you guys will see an update to this in
the next couple of weeks so wait some
water cooling parts become available
specifically for you know thread refer
and then we can get started tell me what
you guys think as always appreciate your
views thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
