James - sends 290x review I don't have a
lot of slate so anyway what's up guys
Jase $0.02 here and this is a long
overdue video you guys have seen this
being teased in other videos you guys
have seen it on the test bench you guys
have seen it on the shelf you guys have
all been like when the hell are you
gonna finally give us the Sapphire 290x
try x8 gigabyte video I even talked
about a PDX lamp back in February the
new EVGA silent series power supplies
offer excellent silence and efficiency
through their new EVGA Eco mode
technology and also features a
seven-year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more now we're going to spend a
lot of time going over the specs of the
card because the card is not new in fact
the card is technically becoming aged as
in videos released their newer
generation cards this is still sitting
on the Hawaii chipset or the Hawaii bass
die and GPU which we have been waiting
for the long-awaited 390x refresh so who
knows when that's coming but with the
launch of Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC and
that kind of kind of be like the new
benchmark that everyone's using I
figured why don't we go ahead and take
the sapphire 8 gigabyte the Tri X and we
see how an aging card like this that's
now available for about 300 bucks give
or take depending on the time of the
season and where you buy it and let's
see how it performs on a brand new
triple-a title like GTA 5 which has
arguably one of the best-looking
graphics of any PC game period now just
a quick overview of the card it does
have a 1050 megahertz GPU clock and a
thirteen hundred and seventy-five
megahertz Ram clock of course that is
times four so you get effective whatever
that number is times four I don't feel
like doing math right now but what makes
this card unique is the fact that this
is the Tri x8 gigabyte this is an all
custom PCB designed by sapphire it's got
eight gigabytes of vram so that makes it
ideal for high resolution gaming a
little disclaimer here guys
unfortunately we are not going to
doing any 1440p or 4k gaming on this
card today because we found out that
this card does not play well with my
Acer xB 280 HK I'll never remember that
number I don't know why the xB 280 HK
which is the one millisecond 4k panel
from Acer and so unfortunately I don't
know if it's a problem with the card or
it's a problem with the monitor
basically the monitor will just cycle
display on and off where you get a black
screen in an image a black screen and an
image but windows actually perceives it
as a disconnect because you even hear
the disconnect sound so anyway we're not
going to be doing anything like that now
when it comes to power this thing does
require 2 8 pin PCI Express power and it
does have a recommended power
requirement of I'm sorry look at the
boxes I never remember this stuff but it
does recommend a 750 watt power supply
or higher I mean the 8 pins by
themselves are 150 watts each and then
you've got I believe a 75 watt that
comes in through the PCI Express and not
to mention this is a card that's kind of
designed for overclocking so anyway as
you guys can see on the back
unfortunately I am going to being
Sapphire slightly for the fact that it
does not have a backplate but kudos to
them for getting all eight gigabytes on
the front side of the card there are no
chips on the back now connectivity on
the card is the same as any other 290x
you get two DVI
a DisplayPort 1.2 as well as your HDMI
so it's got a massive cooler runs the
entire length of the card the card has a
lot of heft to it and of course you've
got the three fans on this is not the
vapor-x
because they decided to go ahead and cut
some cost off the card by getting rid of
the vapor chamber and going with a
straight-up heat pipe design in order to
keep the cost down so much as possible
on the card now they do say that the
vapor X obviously performs better than
this in terms of cooling but the cooling
on this really isn't all that bad I'm
not going to lie I played around the
card already so it does a pretty
fantastic job of cooling it does also
have the Eber button and stuff up here
on the top they've got a nice sapphire
button that actually lights up when it's
on other than that that's the only
lights on the card there's no glowing
logos there's no glowing fans or
anything like that so it's a very
low-key card in terms of glowing effects
however the orange might not work for
some people I mean if you've got a very
specific aesthetic build it's very
unlikely that orange just can it be that
that that color scheme I mean fact
Orange is quite niche more niche than
the yellow that I'm doing so that may be
one subjective dislike about this card
is the fact that it does have orange all
over it which is going to make it so
that it could be a color clash which
with many systems and many people who'd
be using this card would likely be AMD
fans who would like to do a red and
black build and this card is just not
going to fit in so I do feel they kind
of missed an opportunity to make this
card red and black which would have just
been like quite essential AMD you know
aesthetic so alright enough of that
let's go ahead and turn around get into
some GTA 5 and let's see how this card
is performing remember this card is a
lot cheaper than things like the 980 and
especially the tight necks which are
kind of like the new standards in terms
of toppdogg high-end gaming so let's see
if that holds true now because this is a
fresh install here on the test bed I'm
not gonna be able to pick up in the
middle of the game so I am gonna have to
play the initial like startup mission so
yeah that's gonna it's gonna kind of
stink a little bit since it's not like
the full world so we'll just kind of do
some excerpts of that and then we will
go ahead and get into the lo Santos and
we'll see how it does I tell you to say
it's a Los Santos Los Santos just like
here in Los Angeles they say Los Angeles
Los Angeles means the Angels but
sometimes or more like the Angels of
Death hmm that's LA yeah so the game
crashed and I do want to point this out
and I wasn't sure if I wanted to point
this out because it was happening a bit
in the you know a little bit ago even at
stock speeds but I've played about 15
hours on my
a nvidia system not a single crash
however on the AMD card I get crashes
quite often so I'm not entirely too sure
what that's about I'm running the latest
drivers and yeah so if you guys are
having an AMD card or if you guys are
having crashes let me know what your
graphics cards are down in the comments
I'm curious if you guys are getting more
crashes on AMD or Nvidia now Rockstar
did use Nvidia cards to optimize this
game in fact they use nine 80s so I'm
not sure entirely on if this is some
sort of a optimization of Nvidia cards
over AMD we do know that that has taken
place on AMD side as well so I'm curious
as to what the general consensus
consensus is down below so let me know
if you're getting crashes tell me how
often you crash and what card you're
using please well this is crowdsourcing
alright here we go and it crashed again
see this is highly highly annoying third
time's a charm right now even though
I've already played this game quite a
few times at eleven hundred and fifty
megahertz not sure if it's the overclock
I've backed down to 1,100 that's only a
50 megahertz overclock we know sorry
sapphire but we know that two 90s and
290 exes are for overclocking the
Hawaii GPU just does not have a lot of
headroom so 50 megahertz could be enough
to destabilize this card right now well
let's go ahead and see how well this
goes I'd like to play the game
without the crashing of the games so far
we're gonna call this a splash screen
benchmark deep deep now if you guys
don't know I've been live-streaming this
game while only once so far but over on
my twitch channel and I you guys keep
telling me Trevor's the best Trevor's
the best crazy son of a bitch well I
finally unlocked Trevor and you guys are
right Trevor is a crazy bastard Hey look
at that we actually have a game playing
amazing
now for the resolution right now we are
at 1080p 144 Hertz monitor though and
all settings are 100% maxed out as far
as they will go so I figured would do a
1080p test even though it's an 8
gigabyte card because a lot of games are
calling for higher G RAM amounts now so
even this game right now is sitting up
near 4 gigabytes of needed be Ram at
1080p I think she just pooped her pants
it's possible get in the closet
come on come on get in there shoot your
butt all right that'll do so yeah I will
just show a minute or two of this and
then we will we'll get into the main
world I'll get through the the intro
here without making this into an
incredibly long video we'll get through
the prologue and then we'll get into the
real world with some Franklin some thug
action and we'll see how that goes so
you can see the FPS is doing pretty good
here though I don't call 80s and 90s and
hundreds even at 1080p slouch not at all
now this guy here you have to ask
himself did he wake up this morning and
say I'm going to be a hero
these guys have fully automatic weapons
and I'm going to hold what appears to be
some sort of a low caliber handgun or
small caliber handgun to this guy's head
I mean there you go problem solved how
Michael says I don't have to do that I'm
kind of curious as to what Michaels
alternative was all right we'll get
through all this we'll get maybe to the
battle scene and we'll see how how
things go oh we have a snitch on our
hands
oh dear I do not condone this behavior
I'm just saying
I feel incredibly dirty right now I
would never do this in real life this is
this is terrible behavior we're gonna go
on a little nature walk
I believe that guy in the back seats
Trevor right but we just long hair and
stuff
let me try really crazy sombitch
yeah well my share just got a little
bigger coin they're shooting at us why
that is so incredibly rude didn't see
that coming yeah the grab the 1990 ex is
like screaming over there this guy's
gonna be a hero today huh where all
these cops coming from I've never seen
this many cops in a small town
all right so now we're in Los Santos and
you can see that our fps has taken a
little bit of a hit oh yeah bye-bye cat
that was a slowest cat ever
and apparently Franklin has some anger
issues
I like this first mission here for
Franklin where he's a repo man that was
a nice Hollywood turn B so much of an
FPS hit we took here in the city I saw a
benchmark that shows that the 290x was
getting 90 FPS in 1440p I'm really
curious as to what those settings work
as you can see in 1080p maxed out for
getting 40s
oh he did
yeah so as you guys can see here the FPS
is not great but I do have all the
settings completely maxed out but I
would think a card like a tooth the 290
X 8 gig would be able to handle GTA 5 at
least 60 FPS while completely maxed
there's blood all over the front of my
car I love it
wha
don't jump alright so we just got away
that's cool that's a big truck all right
so let's see if we can get the settings
to cooperate here so I mean everything's
on very high right now so let's go to
the normal alright so everything's on
normal okay so restarted that mission
all the way over again but now look at
the FPS um 131 kill the cat because if I
did the first time and you know it's
funny about this is the game doesn't
really look all that much different so
you can see the FPS has jumped up quite
a bit so unless you're running like an
SLI setup or you know I don't know maybe
I guess you would have to run an SLI set
up for so unless you're running like an
SLI setup or crossfire setup then you're
going to definitely want to leave the
settings at normal ground textures are a
bit softer but as you can see the FPS is
much more playable I mean that 40 FPS
was pretty ugly but it doesn't really
look all that different though to be
honest and the FPS is now much much
better so
but we do get quite a bit of FPS
fluctuation though all the way down to
the 60s and all the way up to the
hundreds that's kind of crazy so there
you go guys I just wanted to kind of
give you some performance numbers here
for the 290x try x8 gigabyte from
sapphire performs really really well at
normal settings GTA 5 though is kind of
like the new level and standard of
high-end graphics processing for games
so I think it did very very well
especially at normal but the FPS at
everything at very high even though it's
an 8 gigabyte card it you can tell that
the horsepower on the card is just
starting to feel a little bit aged but
nothing says putting another one of
these cards in if you already own a 290x
wouldn't absolutely just exponentially
increase your gaming performance but to
put things into perspective I run my
three 980 s I don't have my Titans in my
system yet I run my 3 980 s overclocked
at 1440p resolution and I only get about
130 fps now I say of course only 130 but
you would think with 3 980 s it would
scale better but the SLI driver from
video just launched well the day of the
game launch obviously but all three
cards are not being utilized properly
both or two are being utilized to full
potential and one is fluctuating between
50 and 100 constantly so maybe drivers
for the game will improve the 290x
performance over time
clearly Nvidia got a head start on the
driver optimization since Rockstar
worked with this game in accordance or
in an accompaniment in accordance or
whatever the right word would be sorry
guys words are hard whatever the right
word would be for you know they worked
with Nvidia to develop the game so of
course in video would have a jump start
on that I wish the card was red like I
said I know I always am like red red red
red sucks but it being like one of the
best performing AMD cards on the market
I think making it red would have made a
statement and the orange is I think what
feels to me like it could be a limiting
factor on some of the sales but what do
I know
I mean sapphire hasn't told me how many
of they've sold but they do perform
extreme
me well in temperature state in the 70s
the entire time they get a little bit
noisy but coil wine and stuff was
completely non-existent it performed
absolutely well so there you go guys JC
scents taking a look at the Sapphire
290x and some gta5 I don't know what
else to say well like I asked earlier if
you guys are getting crashes let me know
what card you're using down below I'm
kind of interested to see since it's a
brand new game some bugs are kind of
expected but other than that fun game
great card and as always guys thanks for
