my good friend barnacle ease barnacle
ease nerdgasm and as you can tell we are
not in my usual set nope I'm over here
in the infamous internet-famous nerdgasm
man cave nerd cave what do you call it
bear cave right so where's the man cave
now it's the nerd cave it isn't okay so
anyway earlier today we asked for your
guys's questions at hashtag ask Jays two
cents and hash tag ask barnacle ease so
today we're gonna be covering Jays two
cents questions here on my channel if
you guys want to know what he was asked
head on over to his channel you'll find
his link right down here and then you
can see what kind of questions he was
asked all we asked was that you guys
kind of keep it fun light-hearted and
silly not like you know Jay I have you
know 20 Lane CPU how many processors and
GPUs cut yeah we don't we don't we don't
want to get really technical this is all
about fun and if you're wondering what
we're wearing I'm actually rocking one
of Jerry's shirts here that says this
shirt is for poor people it mine says
what does I read it I think women can
relate to me because I actually have
breasts myself true story so Zane dark
on Twitter says Jay will you clean
Jerry's old system to show us what
happens if you don't take care of your
loop no because I don't want to get
gangrene
I wouldn't wish that on anybody I'm
bored on Twitter says and he must have
been bored with this question who has
the better toilet Jay or Jerry we've
sampled each other's toilets yeah it's
kind of a weird thing to say well I'm
gonna say you have the better toilets I
think I actually do have the better do
you have two buttons on yours that's
strange
yeah yeah he has the poop button and the
P button yeah I have very sophisticated
toilets you can tell from my poop now
post you know it's pretty important to
have a good toilet yeah that printer
just made a crazy noise
Master General YouTube says Jay have you
ever been offered three cents to keep
your two cents I think he's implying
that maybe somebody wouldn't want my I
just call you a c√®lle maybe that too
but I would totally take three cents hey
pal me too
okay so Jon grochow says on Twitter
which one of you is the peanut butter
which one of you is the jelly I think
clearly
Jerry is the jelly isn't it obvious cuz
I gots the protein black dragon on
YouTube says Jay what EVGA knows send
you four nine eighty kingpin three four
skunkworks two want to give away they
don't love you anymore who says I don't
have kingpins on the way can I have one
for free and I'm not paying the shipping
no court quark dreams says have you ever
had an erotic erotic dream about each
other
hmm well it's kind of hard not to with
those luxurious man boobs it's true it's
true I've envisioned you as like this
lava lamp of a man I've said I'm more
like a pair of a man but on my fantasy
you're not
governor or Talib I think the only
people asking questions are like
Europeans by the way he says do you
think road biking is fun good exercise I
want to get into it it's a lot of fun
it's a lot of exercise and you should
get into it I wouldn't know I don't even
have anything silly to say about it yeah
he has a bike but it's sitting in the
garage where he parked it when you got
home it's a very very nice mountain bike
that is seen I don't know a couple miles
of a mountain and it's in it's very long
lifetime onion asks Jay mind sending me
a graphics card why yes I do mind
okay so Marvin on Twitter disturbingly
asks would you lick Jerry's butthole for
10 million dollars and with Jerry lick
yours for ten million ten million
dollars is a lot of money I mean you'd
buy a lot of Listerine yeah
down wins with the funniest question of
the evening so far llama on Twitter asks
who the are you I don't know
grandma are you JS two cents okay this
one's for both of us we can jointly
answer this absolutely okay so if a B
and Z on Twitter says to both of us what
would your motivation to start your
YouTube channels a there might be a
little disappointed considering we both
told these stories before yeah neither
one of them had very climactic or
majestic like no yours was like on a
dare and I just wanted to test out a
little like video camera thing and you
did it Mike Mouse review right yeah I
just did it to prove to someone it would
never work this was never intended to
start out as any kind of career path
accidental success all the way dawn of
all-time says have you two had the
tingling time what's tingling time chip
guy says if you two did a porno who
would be the taker and who would be the
giver doesn't really matter
Pete Pete says I know Gerry has some
stalker fans mainly Canadians but do you
have any stalker fans no actually if
you'd like to apply to be my stalker you
can go ahead and follow me on Twitter
Jays two cents or Facebook jst says he's
very stackable Luke Richardson says are
you really a dickhole kiss it depends on
who you ask don't ask the wife she's
probably seen it once it dries so Dakota
more asked have you ever thought about
going to prison if so please share yeah
I think about it about three or four
times a day it's more than me okay but
last but not least video gamer bro says
what's your five women that are on your
free pass list
okay so Everett there I've always had a
thing for Jennifer Aniston she's a bit
older now but still still still
I don't know Jennifer Lawrence I guess
kind of well she's already got her nudie
pics out there she's got a little bit
easy there um I cannot remember her name
but she was one of the female doctors on
house she has eyes
I know exactly I got she's on tain I
only need one I only need a spot for one
and a that's her yeah she can also have
four and five I'm liking this list this
is a good list she could have four or
five yeah oh wow so she feels like the
last three nice she's hot well I'm not
allowed to have a list
so James Warner on Twitter says if you
had to either kill barnacle YZ or
replace the GPUs in your main PC where
the gtx titan black what would you do
