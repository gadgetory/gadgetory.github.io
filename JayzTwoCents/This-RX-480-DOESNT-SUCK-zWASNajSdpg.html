custom rx for a review for you today
this time from XFX now be honest when
they asked me if I wanted to check out
one of their new rx 480 custom cards I
was a little bit leery I'm especially
after the experience we've had with the
last custom card which turned out to be
quite the letdown so I didn't I was in I
wanted to do it but I was kind of
worried like I want to set myself up for
for disappointment
and then they promised me that there was
actually something unique on this card
that nobody else is doing and that got
my interests up just a little bit so
what did think you know I'll be honest
I'm a kind of impressed by its
proportions I know right all right let
me show you something here I kind of
like the thin ones but this one is about
form-factor
yeah but mine can fit in tight spaces
with girth you could open tight spaces
it's like a master key whether you like
thick or thin the ITX lineup from
fractal design is sure to have something
that tickles your fancy remember it's
not the size that matters it's all about
how you use it
not instead leave the girl don't
thinness Gareth even scared is no
contest no there's contents obscured so
what's really interesting about this one
is the fact that there's no custom name
in there everyone's throwing like gaming
g1 gaming we've got our uber Edition and
we've got our extreme extreme extreme
edition but this one here is just it's
just our ad on our X 480 but it's pretty
unique because they have put their own
custom spin on this were they they've
heard us they have heard us reviewers
and they've heard you consumers say
stuff like I want your card but I don't
want to do a red theme I'm doing blue I
understand that the designers of the
manufacturers have their favorite colors
and they kind of want there to be eight
a specific color associated with their
line of product the problem is everyone
starts stepping on everyone's toes and
those colors no longer mean anything so
I get mad when my manufacturers will
shove that color down your throat
well now XFX wants you to shove it down
your own throat because they've got
removable replaceable LED fans with
different colors that you can install
yourself so what we're gonna be doing
today is I'm not going to be spending
hours upon hours benchmarking this card
and
putting it through the paces of all the
different benchmarks I'm not going to do
that because I want to focus on today I
want to focus on this cooler I want to
see how cool it can keep this card
because that was the point of contention
with the last are X 480 I looked yet and
then obviously we're gonna check out
this whole fan swap thing it has been a
long time since I have done any kind of
unboxing this gonna be fun I want to
point out that I'm an idiot
I'm sure you guys already pointed it out
too it's the gt-r they call it the gt-r
it's it's not the double dissipation or
black edition or it's just GTR someone's
really really into Nissan's or Nissen
wherever you're from anyway to see a
gigabyte model and it is a twelve
hundred and eighty eight megahertz boo
score so it's not incredibly fast
compared to the stock one which is
twelve hundred sixty-six maybe we'll do
a little bit of overclocking on this to
see how it handles it but anyway let's
go ahead and let's get this bad boy out
of the box
I have already torn the box do you see
why I don't do unboxings this is why I
don't do in boxes and it was already
open on this side oh look box in the box
box ception another box in a box in a
box warranty card that's important fill
those up wow it's actually pretty
weighty you know in the pictures I
thought it was gonna be much lighter
than it is not been nothing in there
they told me with all that cardboard
thinking there were some Mel's cool in
there yeah I'm surprised it's actually
pretty weighty in the pictures it looked
like it was gonna be pretty lightweight
like I just thought I was gonna be
fairly Hollow and plasticky I mean Oh
get me wrong the plot the shroud is
plastic but it doesn't have a cheap feel
to it which i think is kind of important
I think you guys know what I'm talking
about when I say some brands really
cheap out on the components of their AMD
cards and then it just feels flimsy and
cheap but not this guy obviously that's
because it has a backplate it's got a
embossed XFX in there polish XFX against
a matte finish here it's kind of nice
it's not gaudy even the sticker is like
I don't know well the camera picks up
it's sort of a gunmetal gray it's not
just a bright white but in-your-face we
got eight pin power on here obviously so
that we can get a little bit of a
cleaner power distribution there we're
not pulling too much from PCIe
and then we've got our BIOS switch right
here unfortunately XFX has not labeled
the PCD on which direction is which by
us so I guess we'll just gonna bust
we're gonna play guess the BIOS
okay so fans with this card are equipped
as smarts on technology blah blah what
that means is this the fans gonna ramp
up and slow down based on load so here
are the colors that come available you
can buy these separately obviously we've
got white blue and red
you've got white here which has a clear
blade so that the light can shine
through and we'll go ahead and stick
those on the card first guys and you see
how easy it is to change your your
graphics card color there make sure it's
obviously lined up the right way it is
keyed so you can't just stick it in the
wrong way unlike human beings you can
stick it in the wrong way with a human
being don't ask me how I know there's
that and then same thing over here make
sure the key is lined up so there's no
point in talking about this anymore
let's get this on the test bench let's
see what they look like lit up and then
we'll do our temperature testing okay
what I want to do here is I want to see
how this thing performs both temperature
and then we'll do a little bit of
overclocking here I'm going to do 3dmark
fire strike because it's a pretty heavy
load on the GPU during the GPU test and
I want to see if we get any fluctuation
of core clock and I'm curious as to what
the the actual load is in terms of TDP
remember AMD does show wattage on MSI
it's not as accurate as if you had like
I say a voltage meter hooked up to it
but at least it'll give you an idea and
we've already seen like with the water
cooling and with the g1 gaming how much
the rx for you can actually pull in
terms of wattage wow what I'm noticing
already right off the bat is it's only
pulling 102 watts all the way down to 98
Watts
that's pretty cool look at this look at
the temperature it's only at 55 56 of
course it take time to ramp up the fans
aren't even going yet there they goes
like what are they going to turn on okay
that's GPU load right there and you can
see our core clock has not fluctuated
even one mega hurt during that test now
obviously these tests aren't very long
but they are a heavy load during that
test we'll do like a valley or a heaven
loop for like 10 minutes to see what
happens over time
but so far I am I'm worried to say this
but I might actually be a little bit
excited about the performance we're
seeing here because our X 480
performance has been hit and miss so far
look at that 90 our 98 watts what the
you can see the voltage goes up to about
1.0 five six ish volts
during the combined test a CPU still at
100%
ninety-three Watts currently being
pulled from this from the card 51 C and
100% fan or 100% GPU load of course it's
a combined test so the the cards not
running full tilt let's see what the
score was
I'm curious at stock at stock it at a
graphics score of thirteen thousand four
hundred and sixty seven I'm pretty sure
that's higher than the other cards I had
benchmarked in fact I'll put up a chart
here somewhere on the screen during
editing I'm pretty sure that's higher
than any of the other four ATS out of
the box
definitely so before I do any
overclocking I'm gonna let Heaven run
for a while we'll just let it loop and
I'll keep the stuff up on the screen and
I'll time-lapse this so you guys here's
what want you guys to do while this is
happening keep an eye on the megahertz
we want to see if this fluctuates at all
and obviously keep an eye on the
temperature
the temperature is pretty much equalized
it's not going any higher it's looped I
don't know four or five times something
like that 60 see how in the hell are
these guys keeping an Rx 480 at 60 see
look at the wattage it was in the 80s
the entire time you guys saw during that
sped up footage it never moved even one
mega hurt off of twelve hundred and
eighty-eight that's that's exciting okay
so you know we gotta do next right we
got to overclock this beast what so
guess who was hit with an auto update
while in the middle of trying to get
some work done
piece of okay what you guys have
just witnessed was a successful fire
strike benchmark run at fourteen hundred
and seventy-five megahertz I want to
point out that the temperatures never
exceeded I think sixty-four C and that
megahertz never fluctuated even 114 75
the entire time none of the other rx
cards were doing that they would still
fluctuate a little bit even the
water-cooled card so let's see what the
score was here fifteen thousand one
hundred and seven graphic score and I'll
put up on the screen here how that
compared to other graphics cards in the
same range you could see where this card
overclocked is sitting when it comes to
the other cards on my benchmark sheet
that are near it now here's the thing we
had a max temperature high of 64 max
Watts pulled was a peak of 149 watts
we sat an average in the 133 range
that's 30 watts less than my
water-cooled card was pulling how in the
hell are they doing this so obviously
XFX have stumbled across some sort of
magic formula when it comes to the rx
480 it's a custom PCB it's really long
in fact it's about the same length as a
GTX 1080 it's definitely not taking
advantage of the small form factor that
the reference 480 is but that's fine if
you ask me because they they're giving
you everything you kind of want with
this card amazing cooling 64 C while
overclocked 60 C
while not overclocked amazingly power
efficient only 133 average watts while
overclocked that far and down into the
80s and 90s and about a hundred under
full load in games when not overclocked
that's even less than reference so how
they've done that I don't know now there
are two small gripes I have here now I'm
going to say that they're pretty
superficial considering the level of
performance that you're actually getting
with this card but nonetheless I'm going
to bring them up because I find myself
asking one when it comes to the
removable fans that they could have
centered the stickers just a little bit
better they do wobble around quite a bit
because they're off-center and that's
just super annoying but it's kind of
reason why I state superficials because
when the case or the card is in your
case typically it's pointing down you're
not going to see that anyway and the fan
colors get more or less act as like an
ambient aluminum.aluminum up ambient
lighting I don't know where the hell
that came from it's going to act more
like ambient lighting but if you have
some cases with horizontal motherboards
which are kind of becoming more normal
these days with some of the more Cube
style cases if you look at that it's
really annoying and it gives it sort of
a cheap feel so XFX I think you guys
need to do a better job at centering
those stickers there some of them are
way off center and they're just it's
crazy looking anyway when it comes to
removable fans really need idea the only
reason you'd really change these though
is to change the LED color now we live
in a world of RGB and I have to kind of
wonder why this isn't something that
could have been done on an RGB level
meaning the user doesn't have to spend
more money to change out their LED color
unless that's the answer right there
spend more money and obviously you guys
are in the business of making money but
I have to wonder why this couldn't be
done on an RGB level allowing the user
that then to customize it on the fly
without having to change it out I even
though it could be done on the fly with
this taking it off while the card is
running I still think this is something
could've been done on an RGB level but
that's just me anyway guys there you go
there has been your review of the XFX RX
4 80
gt-r nissan edition miss an additional
roof every time that I hear GTR I think
of that so I can't help it
alright guys it's time to go thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
