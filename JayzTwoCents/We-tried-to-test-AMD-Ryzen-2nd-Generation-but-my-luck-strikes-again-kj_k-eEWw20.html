bet you were expecting a video this
morning about rise and second generation
and I was expecting to have a video
ready to go for you guys to watch this
morning as you can see I have all my
testing stuff out here here's my 2600 X
my 2700 X multiple multiple motherboards
old gen new gen but in typical fashion
of when a new launch happens I am having
problems not a problem with AMD and not
a problem with Asus but a problem that
reared its ugly head out of nowhere that
completely obliterated my ability of
getting a video out for you with results
on time I think you guys should expect
that by now
ms:i brings ultra-thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz 1080p
panel nvidia graphics and 8th gen intel
cpus make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more and how to preorder by
following the link in the description
below series why I'm making this video
rather than just powering forward is
because when I explain to you the
problem and I show you what's happening
here you'll understand why I wasn't able
to get these results out on time and I
owe it to AMD with all of their hard
work going into the Rison platform since
last year to give them a review that is
reminiscent of what the view the buyer
is gonna actually get so I first have to
show you the problem so here is what
we're experiencing right here here's my
test bench it's setup it's got the 2700
X in there it's got a GTX Titan X Peaks
I want to try and see if bottlenecking
is a thing obviously the RAM they sent
the motherboard and my RM 850 X power
supply from Corsair so when it powered
on do you see how it instantly turned
off now that is typically indicative of
a circuit protect it's built into the
power supply to keep you from killing
your stuff that immediately triggered a
red flag in my mind like oh crap
it could be a bad motherboard could be a
bad CPU could be a bad power supply
knowing I've used this power supply and
other builds I didn't start there so
here is what I basically did so as you
can see when I push power now nothing
happens it's in a protected state
although we are still getting power to
the motherboard 12 volt is not actually
going so the only way you can get it
back is to power cycle it and then wait
for the power to turn off as you can see
turn it back on test it again and same
exact result you can see the fan spins
for a second lights up so on what I
would normally do in this case is start
removing things from the system removing
USB seeing if that solves anything
wait for the light power to turn off
because until the power actually drains
out of the caps the board will not reset
powers went off to the power supply now
for like 10 seconds that's how much
power these caps actually retain there
we go so now I can turn it back on
check it again same exact result process
of elimination I would move over here
to the mother or the mrs. Anton
motherboard this is a graphics card so
now I'm gonna go ahead and wait for this
to turn off
I need even if I push the power button
it doesn't drain the caps because the
power button does nothing when it's in
this state
take out the graphics card power back up
give it power same result so now this is
where I typically would go crap we're
drilling down to just the CPU now
starting to get really worried going
crap please don't tell me I got a bad
CPU don't don't tell me that because if
I say I got a bad CPU from AMD
everyone's gonna say AMD J says AMD
sucks jeiza Intel shill and that's not
the case here I want to give you guys a
true video about the performance of
these parts so the next thing I did was
I went ahead and unplugged my 12 volt
power from the CPU kind of like when I
did that video about my where I
accidentally blew up my dad's computer
unplugging the 12 volt power and having
the computer then power on tells me that
the CPU was bad or at least the power
delivery to the CPU and that was what we
experienced in the other video in fact
I'll put a link here you guys can go and
check it out so I check this out without
the CPU plugged in same exact result so
that immediately told me we weren't
dealing with a bad CPU now I'd already
swapped out the motherboard I have two
of these motherboards I was sent one by
Asus and sent one with the AMD package
the same unboxing you guys saw the other
guys do have all the same parts so now I
went okay what the heck could it
possibly be switched out the motherboard
it made no difference whatsoever check
this out you ready
unplug the SATA cable from my SSD power
it back on and check that out
ok alright so now the power of deduction
or deducing or whatever we want to call
it would probably tell you that this
SATA cable could possibly be bad so I
swapped the SATA cable over to this one
here and we actually ended up with the
same result with this plugged into the
SSD let me demonstrate
and there we go thinking that it was now
the power I unplug the power cable plug
this back in wait for this to reset also
knowing it wasn't my graphics card I'm
gonna go ahead and plug that back in now
give it some power because now we want
some video right we want to make sure
we're actually getting video this is all
the kind of stuff you go through when
you're troubleshooting any sort of
system that gives you this sort of a
failed boot now I get a lot of people
arriving email saying my computer will
click on for a split second and click
off and as you can see it could be many
different things
ok so thinking is probably a bad SATA
cable we went ahead and plug everything
back in thinking we're up and running
and there's the same problem here is now
where things got really interesting so
the SSD is not actually fully
operational unless both of these are
plugged in you can plug in your SATA
data connector or you can plug in your
SATA power independently but it doesn't
really do anything as long as both are
not plugged in so I'm going to show you
right now is with this unplugged how
we're actually going to get a video
signal oh you know what helps when we
actually plug in VGA cables how's that
and there it is what we're doing here is
this a process of elimination so
obviously we've drilled past the CPU we
drilled past well normally I would try
the memory as well but I didn't
obviously so we went drill past the CPU
we drove past the GPU we started
unplugging things we unplugged all of
our USBs and as you can see we are now
sitting here currently inside of the
BIOS check this out you ready
you got both of those in frame Nick yeah
Oh what just happened there so now and I
know that there was power going through
the SSD cuz it's warm it's actually a
little bit warm right now this Drive is
now dead which is why you don't have a
video today because what we determined
is this power cable with no phrase
anywhere no loose pins anywhere no
pinched wires all of the connectors are
perfectly intact as you can see none of
these wires have any terrible bends on
them like that been bent over really
badly everything looks perfectly fine
there is no damage anywhere on this
cable so now if I switch over to another
power cable here and this is where I
start to get concerns that maybe my
power supply was going bad so my next
step was actually gonna be to try a
different power supply but I'm glad I
didn't because the power supply is
actually fine as I will demonstrate
right now there we go so you can see new
power cable plugged in SATA data cable
still plugged in and we are now
currently booting and we will make it to
the BIOS this like I said killed my
drive so if I take this drive right here
which is my my 500 gigabyte evo 850 or
850 Evo it works fine it will detect
however my 250 gigabyte Drive
oh no keyboard detected geez so if I go
over here to boot check it out see how
my boot options and my boot priorities
and boot override is completely grayed
out this drive does not detect any
longer so if I plug in my other drive
now you will see that this Drive will
indeed detect showing that both the
power cable and the SATA data cable are
perfectly fine so what that actually did
was it took this this drive right here
is a risin OS install this is the drive
we use we do Rison testing because we
don't want to be overlapping intel
drivers and Rison drivers and chipset
drivers and stacking that stuff when we
go back and forth between systems
because that can cause all sorts of
weird funky problems that's not fair to
either manufac
sure when it comes to doing performance
testing I don't have a backup
Rison OS drive and considering the fact
that I would have to then reinstall all
my games of stuff because I'm an idiot
that put all the draw at the games on
the same install as this because again
the game installs you know based on the
OS and I want to keep everything simple
I never cloned this drive again or party
or did an image of it so now that means
I have to reinstall windows 10 have to
reinstall the two major updates have to
reinstall all the security patches have
to reinstall all the games all the
drivers and there's no way in heck that
that was gonna actually be done in time
so you can see right here how it's
saying reboot and select pop proper boot
device that is because this drive has no
OS on it so if we reboot you'll see this
Evo drive shows up see there it is right
there
Samsung SSD Evo 500g so this Drive
unfortunately now is about as good as a
doorstop and it's even too short for
that so it's good for nothing now
unfortunately this course there power
supply cable killed it I'm lucky didn't
killed that drive because I did try a
boot with this one
but I think the repeated testing
eventually just took its toll on the SSD
but the reason why I don't test this
stuff way in advance because I've been
doing this for almost six years now and
I have learned that there are always
last-second UEFI updates BIOS updates I
think there's even a AMD storage update
that had to go live at the last second
and in fact one of the tools that was
sent over by AMD that's part of Rison 2
and some of the stuff that's built for
that was updated yesterday yesterday
meaning a lot of the testing we would
have done up until now would have to be
redone so I no longer will bust ass to
try and get this stuff done early to
accommodate a 6 a.m. launch I will wait
until quite honestly the last minute and
be late that way I have the most
up-to-date possible drivers and software
and BIOS and all that stuff so there you
go guys that is why you don't have a
rise into video from me on launch I
guess technically you do but as you can
see all the hardware works fine it was
corsair that killed me this time i was
all ready to take my notes i was all
ready to do my testing so this is a good
opportunity now for me to reach out to
you guys because something else i
screwed up on
was I was gonna take my 1600 X and
compare it to the 2600 X and the 1700 X
compared to the 2700 X seeing how resin
one versus risin two generational
improvements came about we checked our
inventory and saw the yo we the 1600 X
the problem is we never updated the
inventory and I used that 1600 X and my
daughter's build so I have a 1700 X and
no 1600 X so now I've got to buy that
which means now I can do my side to side
comparison board I want you guys to help
me with this what kind of testing do you
think we should do what I planned on
doing was testing things like Cinebench
Geekbench doing blender stuff like that
to compare old gen and new jet if I just
give you a new gen number doesn't really
give you anything to compare I mean
obviously if you want to buy a new CPU
and stuff go with the latest and
greatest if if you can afford it
but I wanted I wanted to kind of talk to
people who are considering upgrading
from rising 1 to risin to kind of like
the old Phenom 1 and phenom 2 era where
people were really concerned of whether
or not they should update so I was kind
of wanting to go that route of course
has a new game testing check for things
like bottlenecking extreme high FPS
1080p gaming on like 200 hertz panels
which exist now to see if we actually
are getting any bottleneck improvements
or any any sort of improvements in total
max FPS so that's why I need you guys to
chime in tell me what you want to see
and now I have time to hopefully do that
so I'm gonna get started now
reinstalling this OS and all the drivers
and all the updates and all the games
and stuff and that's gonna really suck
so don't take pity on me I don't I mean
this is this is my own doing I guess it
still sucks though alright guys we're
gonna go thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
