what's up guys JC cents here we're gonna
do a vlog we haven't done anything like
very impersonal and vlog e but check
this out we've got parts we're gonna
build a computer for where are you Barry
alright so this is Phil I know you guys
have seen him in the vlogs a little bit
you guys know this guy already
so he's we're gonna do he's been editing
since he started for me on his macbook
pro I promised him an editing rig we're
gonna build a right now we're to build a
threat Ripper 1920 X system for him we
saw the server back there that's gonna
ultimately be his editing rig but we're
not doing that yet we still have to get
my rate controller get all the raid
setup and the underage and all that
because that's gonna double as a server
and a workstation so stay tuned for that
so this is a temporary rig for him to
use in the meantime so I figured instead
of me building it part of the things he
had on his resume when he applied here
was that he could build a computer it's
time to test that does that mean I could
go no no all right so you get to help
him if he needs it like you could be the
lifeline which is already comical I find
it so I think I think Phil can handle
this no idea ladder that's cutting this
like how tall are you 5 foot 2 ish are
you trying to squeeze an inch in because
I'm all right 6 4 and if I stand next to
him and that's I level right there right
that's I level theirs and they give me a
hard time for unboxing handles yeah but
this is like a really usable shopping
bag if you go to concept if you go to
Costco
hey does this work you know you're sold
I think that ok we're good yeah what
oh this is the new H 500 from
Coolermaster this is the mesh so the
shortcomings of the other one if you
recall Steve at gamers Nexus his
complete disdain and hatred for that
case rightfully so all the plastic in
the front blocked off all the air flow
but now this is wide open on the front
giving it air plenty of airflow and as
you can see we opted for the white one
the question is how many average people
does it take to build a computer
oh geez gifs X 399 because three is
higher than Q wait is this the board
with the blood on it no no no that's bad
this one here now obviously since this
is blog style we're not sitting here
going over all the parts and the
rationale behind it we'll put a link in
the description below to all the parts
if you guys are wondering but this is
pretty much just grabbed off of the
inventory shelf and I guess it's a
temporary build but the question is
whether or not they can actually build
it might be here next week
wait why if I want to do the cool yeah
oh you got it yeah okay Nick already
tried to mount the motherboard without
the standoffs there's literally two
people trying to put a motherboard or
standoff in a case this is fun this is
yeah this is its co-op it's co-op PC
building did it this idea was a whole
lot better on paper
I think the threads were tapped your
tabs I mean the Fred's ripped we
actually talked about putting the
symbiotes build on his desk but I was
like here in my videos where you could
see it I am installing the motherboard
secure screws into the standoffs that
have been installed by Nick into this
case what's next is cooler so these guys
just showed up these are custom cable
sleeves from n sources customs super
high quality holy crap
more tippy-toe action so if you're new
around here phil is actually the newest
member of our team he is a camera
operator / editor a way better editor
than me that's for damn sure so that's
why if you've noticed any sort of
improvement in our videos over the last
couple of weeks does that little guy
back there he's awesome he like I'm
smart building him a bit no that's
pointing on camera it looks like I'm
pointing at Phil look at me no look at
the lens look at the screen see see oh
you see yeah okay sichting screws you
don't have to do them all you know did
it send the two ends and they wait oh
that's why you're the professional pc
builder forget that sexy grab all three
of those van things and then run them
through the same hole no way I would
have already mounted the thing recruited
in and then been like oh we're gonna run
these cables I don't think this is
enough if you do it the wrong way the
Internet will forever call you a new
yeah well we did the happy face already
there's no such thing as the wrong way
yeah put the whole tube in and call it a
day
okay right now what happens with a mac
user first build PC I can finally right
click so I think the next step is you
take this and then you're just kind of
oh no way I know that's more this is
actually the first motherboard that I've
messed around with with with the Oh be
scared eight DIMM slots like so what we
basically done for him today is we have
not only got him building his own
editing rig I'll be a temporary we've
got him hopping off of his MacBook Pro
and onto a real piece of machinery don't
even think about trying to run away the
dead Joe's pizza did you record what are
you looking for cables cable yeah that
would be in the motherboard about
alright okay so the motherboard watch
that when I asked like oh do we need
anything else in here you're like nah
this is the most disorganized build
table right now just because I'm in
charge of those hidden skills that that
Jay and like you know people that are
good at this YouTube stuff have is that
I was about to just build this cage like
directly behind this PC case and I'm
five foot two so you would never see me
and like you know he always makes a good
point of like being in front of the
camera
having the lighting you know be correct
and all that sort of stuff and it's just
weird because not only am I having to
think about building the computer I'm
having to think about you know being
shorter than the computer and being in
front of the computer as well so you
guys can see me so I was watching this
channel called Jays - since the other
day and then you know he was talking
about cable management and they
mentioned that like you don't want to
attach the SATA cable and then go
wrangle it because then your
break this and then your the
broken oh yeah so that was a really
weird a drive cage because we thought
originally they came out the back the
back side of this but we had to take off
this guy goes here and this guy goes up
there and then in order to take this off
to access the drug cage you actually
have to take this piece and the shroud
off so yeah for those of you guys
building in this case I was just
basically pulling at it from the back
and it wasn't working so yeah we have to
just practically disassemble half of it
but yeah I mean it's cool everything
power 1.0 kilowatts are a sync RGB
graphics card
everyone knows RGB equals more FPS
hashtag thick with 2 C's unfortunately
we can't use these cables at the pace
that arrived today because it's an 8 pin
and a 6 pin and this is dual eight pins
wah wah so now we get to use these
beautiful cables here nine cents of my
money really high feed yourself haven't
seen the backside yet that's not that
bad it's just like you don't have enough
link on some of this stuff to make it
like super tight so yeah the table
however yeah the all the zip tie deaths
if we're still there is okay he's gonna
put this back together and then we're
gonna see if the boots and then he's
gonna clean up his mess isn't he Nick
okay
it took him four hours not even joking
took four hours yeah I got a got caught
up in the
my cable management the re and the RGB
the I want to use a different finger but
that it still looks shaky but underneath
anymore anyway you gotta make sure that
it knows it and do there more control
unbox it oh yeah you got a post sorry
but it doesn't work entirely because you
have known I broke my RGB you wrote your
urgent these you might have taped it
into backwards oh oh yeah wait now we
gotta check your manhood you started
yanking anybody yeah it mostly works
yeah Muslim all right well at least it's
not exploding so we'll figure out why
the rear fan doesn't work and we'll get
the LEDs to work but it's time to go
anyway I guess click now technically he
built the computer Nick helped he's mad
at me I spilled tea on him I don't care
alright guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching we'll see you the next one
 knew it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
