and today we're going to take a look at
a product that's a little bit unique and
a bit different from my channel but the
company was willing to send it to me and
I'm willing to try it out because i'll
try out anything because i'm a review
whore and that's just what I do here
anyway we are taking a look at one
because side watches here from
tokyoflash at singapore company
interestingly enough took you flash
singapore whatever we're going to take a
look at whether or not this watch is as
cool as it is claimed to be and whether
or not it's worth the price for what you
get
now I've been actually wearing this
watch for the last week and let's go
ahead and talk about the construction of
the watch before we get into the actual
review a little bit about this company
they are based out of Singapore it's
called tokyoflash and these watches are
pretty much based on some of the watches
are based on customer input and design
they put out a little contest hey help
us design a watch if they pick your
design they make it they do a limited
run of the watch and then you get an
exclusive you know special edition watch
this is what I have right here this is
the Kasai maru ma are you maru and it's
a very unique design in that it's just a
circular LED a bunch of rings in there
and different dots and lines that point
to different parts of the watch to make
it tell time all of their watches are
very unique and they're all very
different and some takes some getting
used to to read now I can look at this
right now and easily see what time as I
can see it's 1220 p.m. and some people
may look at this and go it's just a
bunch of dots and lines this particular
watch is really easy to read do you have
one dot that points to the outer circle
which is the minute one points at the
inner circle which is the hour so it's
just like reading any analog watch some
of them are really crazy I'll be honest
when I was looking through the catalog
to pick what watch I wanted I chose this
one because it's more contemporary it's
got a stainless steel band it's very
business ease to kind of watch I could
wear to work and not be embarrassed
about with you know flashing LEDs and
matrix looking schemes going on it's no
different than any other stainless steel
band you might see on like a Timex or a
Casio or you know whatever some of the
other brands out there I driving can't
think right now but it's just basic
stainless steel there's no jewelry in
this there's no bling it's a very nice
design it's a satin it looks really good
there's two buttons on here one to turn
on the backlight LCD and then once you
cycle through the menus and you hold
them down to do various settings and
look at the manual to figure that out
we're going to talk about that today but
what I do want to talk about is my
thoughts on this watch this watch
retails for 150 dollars and there's a
couple of things I don't like about this
watch and I'm going to just go ahead and
put it out there because it's be honest
there's more I don't like about this
watch than things that I do and you guys
like the realism on this channel and
it's about to get really real right now
the links they have a lot of playing
them I mean it's expected I guess from a
watch of a stainless steel band like
this remember we're talking about a
hundred and fifty dollar watch so the
links have a lot of a lot of play in
them I feel and when you have this much
playing links if you have armor hair
like I do they pinch the crap out of
your arm when it comes to yank and hairs
and I hate that if you have nice tight
links in there but she said then you
typically aren't going to get your arm
here pulled out on a regular basis which
is happening to me I have a pretty
average size wrist and you can see it's
loot it's fairly loose and it goes
pretty far down my arm so I could take a
link out of this and still be pretty
comfortable so if you have a bigger
wrist chances are it's going to fit when
you push the buttons in and I had miss
js2 since confirmed this it wasn't just
me they grind they're not smooth they're
like I mean it's just really rough and
jagged not smooth at all but let me tell
you what I found to be completely
unacceptable with this watch the glass
is dirty on the underside in fact it's
dirty enough to when light is coming
through it it shines a shadow on the LCD
which just looks like dirt and I've
tried to clean it and I'm gonna do the
best I can to pick it up on the camera
it just looks building so what do I feel
about this watch I think it's cool in
the aspect that its customer designed
and it's a limited edition so I have a
watch here that I know eventually isn't
going to be around anymore but what if a
150 bucks for this watch given the fact
that there is nothing special about this
in terms of jewelry it's just stainless
steel it looks like it's a generic
stainless steel band that they just
stuck their own guts in the glass is
dirty
the backlight LCD is really dim even at
night last night again I got other
people's opinions on this watch before I
did this review to see if it was just me
being picky the backlight LCD when you
push it it's really dim even at night
it's kind of hard to see and then when
you turn on the backlight it illuminates
the dirt that's trapped underneath the
glass um it's not worth 150 bucks guys
might be worth 50 if that so you know I
personally wouldn't recommend this brand
at least not this watch they have a
whole range of watches but this watch
this casar casaya maru for what it is
and what it costs is not a JS x so kind
of disappoints me that I have to do a
negative review I reached out to the
company to try and get a statement from
them there's no response therefore I'm
going entirely on my experience on this
and I would pass this up honestly I
would go out and buy a psycho or timex
for fifty bucks from hot topic and have
a better watch that guy's JS two cents
keeping it real here the Kasai maru pass
it up see you guys next time on JC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
