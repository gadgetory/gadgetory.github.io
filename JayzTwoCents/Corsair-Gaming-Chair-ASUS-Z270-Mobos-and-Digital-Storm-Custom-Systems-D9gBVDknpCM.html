MSI and the new Z 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
what's up guys Jase to censor and
welcome to my hotel room I decided to go
ahead and kind of do a recap of the
things we checked out recently here at
CES 2017 now we're going to talk about
three different companies today we're
going to talk about Corsair new keyboard
they're launching and some other things
we're going to mention kind of briefly a
soos and some of those e 270 lineup
stuff some new panels and some other
things they've got coming out here in
2017 and when we took a look for the
first time at digital storm another
boutique system builder that is kind of
worth talking about so we're gonna kick
things off here with Corsair and the k95
platinum keyboard one of the things that
customers didn't like about the k70 and
k95 RGB was the removal of the U a
built-in USB hub but I'm happy to say
that that has made a comeback now on the
k95 platinum it does have a USB
pass-through it's got a couple of things
on them that are pretty neat it's got a
reversible wrist rest some people like
it more smooth design some people like
it to be a little bit more bumpy
whatever your flavor is now it's
magnetically mounted to the wrist rest
itself and you can flip the pad over
depending on the type of feel that you
want I'm also really happy to see that
they incorporated a wire channel
underneath the keyboard plate so that
you can keep the headphone cord out of
the way of your mouse and other things
on your desk so it makes more sense to
come out right in front of you then
rather than trying to snake it around
your keyboard and stay out of the way of
your mouse so that's a nice neat feature
to see keeping in line with the RGB all
the things we now have new edition RGB
vengeance Ram that is controllable
through Corsair link which is kind of a
big deal so now you can control the
patterns both so you can synchronize the
RAM together per channel or you can
break them out independently and have
them all do different things but
anything Corsair Lee could do with your
cooler and other RGB control devices
from Corsairs lineup can now also carry
over to the RAM itself so you can have
kind of a unified thing going if you
want one thing I wasn't expecting to see
though was a Corsair branded gaming
chair and of course it sticks with the
race car theme I'd like to see someone
kind of tackle the idea of a gaming
chair that was more ergonomic than just
being racecar inspired I think the race
car theme has been done to death I think
it's a little late to try and get into
the whole race car scene or the race car
inspired chairs this late in the game I
would have liked to have seen something
a little bit more innovative now this
chair is being manufactured and designed
in-house by Corsair it's not being
outsourced to another company already
making chairs it's an all steel
construction there's an embossed logo on
the headrest rather than being a stitch
logo so you're not going to be wearing
out the stitching it stitched on the
back it's a very nice design but I'm
personally done with the whole racing
chair thing so I'd liked I would have
really liked to have seen them go with
some sort of a different design now
let's go ahead and talk about a suits
for a minute here admittedly I have not
spent a lot of time covering asu's
products in the past but that's all
going to change in fact I've got the new
Z 270 Maximus 9 formula motherboard at
home I've had it since the launch and I
will be doing a build in that but it's
really nice because it's got an
integrated ek water block on the vrm and
it also doubles as a heatsink so if
you're not running water through it it's
perfectly fine as a heatsink as it ships
but if you decide you want to
incorporate it into a custom water loop
you have the quality of ek water blocks
built into the motherboard which is
really nice to see
Asus also debuted a z2 70 motherboard
with a fully integrated CPU and vrm
block so there's one block that will
actively cool the entire CPU region of
the motherboard the block has integrated
water flow monitoring so you can see
what the actual water flow is it can set
alarms to warn you that the flow has
dropped below a certain threshold that
you can set as the user making sure that
your if your pump fails you're going to
know it
it also has implicit the true Delta
differences between how hot the liquid
is getting as it moves through your CPU
block but it also has leak detection
which is something that's nice to see
because so many people are afraid of
leaking when it comes to the idea of
water coin and you can actually set auto
shutdown so if it's detected a leak
you're not going to destroy your system
now this particular motherboard is not
designed to be used with an air cooler
it ships with everything that you see
here so you are going to want to make
sure you're integrating this into a
custom water loop if you're going to be
using this motherboard I was also very
excited to see in person though for the
first time the new asus 144 hertz g-sync
4k panel so I've always said I did not
adopt 4k personally because I wanted the
high refresh rate to go
with the resolution and we are there now
with 144 Hertz panel and since it takes
so much horsepower to push a hundred and
forty-four frames per second the g-sync
module will actually be extremely
functional and noticeable giving you
very consistent frame rates but one
thing that's kind of interesting to note
on this though is it actually has two
DisplayPort 1.4 ports and an HDMI 2.0 in
the back which typically you don't see
on g-sync panels you would just see a
single input so I'm really excited to
see how all of that kind of plays out
now I also went over to digital storm
and took a look at what they had to
offer and I was really excited to
finally get to see in person something
they had actually debuted last year at
Computex which is now getting a
generational refresh and that is their
aura gaming monitor actually to be fair
it's not even really just a monitor it's
an all-in-one gaming PC and it even
supports water cooling so you've got a
34 inch ultra wide panel that has a
full-size founder's Edition 1080 in it
as well as Broadwell e60 950 X you can
spec it up that high anyway if you want
to and you have the coin to go along
with it and an a IO water-cooled CPU
cooler in there all squished in to a
panel and they're telling me that
thermals are actually not much of an
issue so it's kind of like an iMac but
actually worth buying of course as a
buyer you could spec this out however
you want and the pricing starts at
around $2,000 obviously at that price
point it's not going to be broad well II
69 50 X but you can scale it up to kind
of as big as you want to be I believe
you could even put a Titan X Pascal in
there if you wanted but that's imagine
the amount of desk bass that actually
clears up if you put everything into the
monitor itself and you don't have a big
tower PC taking up any space on your
desk
I think that's actually a really cool
thing you're going to start seeing more
pre-built systems on the channel as we
move forward when it comes to review
because not everyone is comfortable
building their own computer as much as I
try to make everyone comfortable with
DIY that's just not always the case
you're going to be seeing more of this
kind of stuff also as we move forward
and of course if you want a system that
pulls out all the stops you have the
event in three which is just a complete
lead in house design chassis everything
is handled in-house are not just
sourcing case and building in it it's
got so much thought out in there in fact
on the back of this system though
because it's fully water-cooled instead
of having two
run up and down the back of the system
or trying to plumb them up through the
front they actually have a
custom-designed ek water block or water
passageway we'll call it that's built
into the backside of the motherboard
tray that droughts all the water part
needs to go I'm sitting here asking
myself why the heck didn't I think about
that and have something like that made
for skunk works so you can see that this
is the level of enthusiasm digital storm
is bringing to the market made as a
enthusiast brand built by enthusiasts
for enthusiasts and you really can't
deny that if you've ever looked at
pre-built systems digital storm has
probably come up in your search
somewhere so anyway that's what we took
a look at today guys thanks for watching
my CES coverage here we've got a few
more things coming your way and I can't
wait to show you some of the showroom
floor stuff I'm exhausted but this is so
much fun once again a huge thank you to
my sponsors for bringing me here this
year MSI and EVGA who without them this
coverage would not have been possible
anyway guys thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
