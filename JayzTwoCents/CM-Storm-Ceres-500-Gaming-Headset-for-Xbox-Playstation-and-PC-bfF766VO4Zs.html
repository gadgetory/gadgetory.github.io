today we are going to do something
that's extremely rare on my channel and
that is I'm going to show you a product
that caters to both gaming PC's
PC gamers gaming pcs PC gamers and
console gamers at the same time wow that
is that even possible
now when it comes to gaming headphones
you usually have to make a choice a PC
compatible headset or a console
compatible headset but very rarely do
you actually get a product that works on
both platforms turtlebeach is one of
those companies it's really kind of
cornered that market but turtlebeach is
also one of those companies a lot of
people just don't like because they're
cheap and they just aren't comfortable I
have a set of x12 and I personally did I
were there like three times and thought
wow I just wasted sixty bucks so that's
why today we're going to take a look at
Coolermaster CM storm series 500 gaming
headset so we're going to see what comes
inside the box we're going to see how
comfortable it is and this thing works
on all of your gaming platforms it
advertises that it works on PC Xbox 360
and PlayStation 3
now obviously the new consoles are out I
don't have the new consoles to test it
on to make sure it works
so I guess if it works on the old
platforms work on the old one that work
on the new one the new platforms and I
would assume this would too now the cool
thing about this is that it has a
console or PC slider switch on there so
you can tell the headphones what it's
hooked up to which then creates the type
of functionality that has an interactive
devices it's hooked up to as I try and
drop it it has it's a foldable design so
it makes it nice and easy to put away
and carry with you if you're putting
your stuff in a backpack I have not
personally open these and taking a look
at them so we are going to find out
together exactly what comes with it
so when you open it up it is in this
plastic molded you know as you would
expect everything's falling out it
you've got here your series 500 a little
users guide thing talks about the
headphones some of the features little
Quick Start Guide you have three meters
of three and a half inch or three and
half inch and a half millimeter cable
and as you can see right here this is
your little connector that you would use
to plug into your controller on Xbox 360
I don't I think ps3 works the same way I
don't know how to own one and then
you've got nice fairly long lengths of
cable here for your Xbox 360 plugs right
here and the cool part about this is
this is an extension so this is the I
can't even get it all the way out this
is the extension link for your console
because you know they know that you're
going to typically be setting a pretty
good distance away from your console so
you give you lots of length and that
link is on top of the length of cable
that is already on here and I have to
undo this little twisty tie thingy here
there we go oh my goodness this is a
long length table so if you add the
extension to this you got like I know 15
feet or something like that of length so
holy crap and also sitting in here is
the detachable microphone the flexible
detachable microphone pretty cool they
feel pretty solid they are a foam with
cloth on them so they're not leather
which is going to give you more
breathability in for long term play um
they do have a length extensions there
and as you can see this is what they
look like folded up so you have a little
bit of extra room there and in terms of
comfort let's say to get these where I
think my head would be
they're pretty comfortable um they're
not it's like noise cancelling
headphones and I can still have here
just fine but what I like is they don't
stick out or look incredibly weird like
the Corsair 1500s do and then the
microphone you can see just plugs into
the left ear cup just like that and
there it is
so if you're on there want to be like
hey you learn to be college oudy you
stupid noob yeah there's your mic for
that if you're one of those people and
this is kind of interesting the little
control knob here where it gives you
your volume and your console PC slider
as well as your mic mute switch and your
chat volume it has a little clip on
there so you can be like yeah what's up
hmm I'm not getting tangled up in my
cords now it's kinda neat I like that
it's not long enough to reach down to
your hip though so I guess you would
have to clip it to your collar or
something like that okay so just a
clarification that I have to make I just
realized that the headphones like a lot
of other brands do not work unless
they're receiving power through the USB
so you're not going to be able to use
these portable with your iPhones or your
mp3 players to listen to music it's a
little bit of a bummer but then again
since they have big drivers in there and
they want to make sure that the
headphones are getting the power that
they need to give you a nice clear sound
that's just one of the things that you
have to deal with so all in all they're
pretty comfortable they feel pretty
solid the price on them is definitely
right again guys I don't talk about
price when I do these overviews and
reviews because things are always
changing when it comes to price and I
can't change the video once I upload it
so if you wonder how much it cost you're
just going to have to go down to the
link in the description and check them
out guys this has been B cm storm series
500 gaming headset here if you're
looking for something inexpensive but
it's going to give you decent quality
and you can use it in all of your gaming
platforms definitely go and check them
out they were very comfortable more
comfortable in my Corsair 1500s and just
miles ahead of where I feel turtle
beaches on the comparable price range
when it comes
his headphones guys has been chased to
sense if you've enjoyed the review you
know what to do with the video and if
you didn't well you know what you can do
with the video I'm gonna get on out of
here I've got a lot more to do and we'll
see you guys next time
on JC sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
