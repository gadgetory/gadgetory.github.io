kind of in a good mood today because we
had two million subscribers this morning
it would have thought when I started
this channel 1 million let alone two
million I mean a thousand was a
pipedream way back in the day almost 7
years now I've been running this channel
so I'm gonna do another fun experiment
one that actually has some practical use
so it's kind of a stupid thing that by
the end of this video might actually not
be so stupid there's a lot of
inspiration behind what we're about to
do we'll talk about that right after our

in the description below so you guys
know that Little J has built her own
computer on this channel now multiple
times and as her little sister gets
older and is conscious and aware of the
computer she's conscious and aware of
buttons and my youngest daughter is
almost to the age now where I think
she's ready to build her own computer
she's obsessed with computer she really
wants one so that's coming soon but what
we've noticed is over the last year or
so little J will be playing on her
computer and then my youngest will walk
over and then just be like to the power
button now yes you could disable that
power button in the OS by making it do
various things like go to sleep sign out
turn off or do nothing but rather than
make it do nothing because Little J
likes to just put her computer to sleep
which is how that button this program
where she just push it when we're like
get down here dinnertime do your
homework whatever she'll just she'll
push that button it puts a computer to
sleep and off she goes the problem is if
you have someone constantly doing that
to you while you're trying to play on it
it's really super annoying well I also
follow a car channel that I'm a huge fan
of that I've been following since he was
like very early days and that's Chris
fix it he recently talked about how to
install a kill switch to your in your
car now this is something I've installed
a whole bunch in the past cuz I used to
also do car stereo and alarm system
installs very high-end very trick crazy
alarm systems where he had sequences to
start the car designed to just make it
harder for a thief not impossible
there's nothing's impossible so I
thought why not use the same concepts
and then use his video idea as a trigger
for me to install a kill switch into the
computer making it so that you lock out
the power button when you don't want it
but have a hidden switch to make it work
when you do this also has a lot of
practical uses like I said little
sisters and/or children that you don't
want being able to get on the computer
without knowing how to start it up if
you do it right be lesser than tech
savvy people will be fooled by this but
anyone that's got you know any knowledge
whatsoever on how a computer works might
potentially be able to bypass this
that's why we're gonna try and hide this
so here's what we've got we've got some
tools that we need to do this obviously
we've got a toggle switch this is a
momentary switch you don't want to have
a toggle like an on/off because you
forget to toggle it back then the switch
it's not going to work so we have a
momentary switch so this is something
that's got to be pressed in conjunction
with the power button to make the power
button work when this isn't pressed the
power button is bypassed nothing happens
until this is held so our sequence is
gonna be something along the lines of
push push and then let go a system will
do its thing same thing to turn it off
push push it will turn off so we also
have some wire here that I just sort of
stole from excess things I had that
didn't need anymore so we got some wire
we've got some heat-shrink because we
still want to look pretty although this
is just one of our stupid J experiments
we got a lighter and we also have a
screwdriver probably get in our cases we
need it some wire strippers and side
cutters electrical tape drill drill bits
because this is not gonna be case
specific you can do this in any chassis
and how creative you want to be with it
how hidden you want to be and whatever
kind of sequence you want is gonna be a
hundred percent up to you and we decided
to use this case because it's got the
gauge in it the 12-volt gauge I
installed back when I did that challenge
accepted with Jerry like almost two
years ago where we figured since we use
this from an automotive theme might as
well keep it going with this case so
what we're going to be working off of
here is the power switch
would go from your front case button to
your motherboard the one that's labeled
power switch and pretty much every
single case is gonna have one of these
not all cases have reset switches but we
want this to work off of the power
switch so we don't have to take the
front of the case apart or anything like
that we're just gonna work off of the
harness here now if you don't know how
this already works when this plugs into
the motherboard this basically when you
push the power button bridges the 12
volt in the 24 pin to fire up the
motherboard so what we're going to be
doing now is we're going to be putting
an interrupt in this circuit which is
what this button is for so the wiring
that we have here is just for us to
build another harness for us to relocate
that somewhere else so essentially we'll
be teeing off of one of these wires so I
can go ahead and kind of separate this
like this and this is the part that's
gonna be universal to pretty much any
case so we'll give ourselves plenty of
slack here so we can put that back
obviously in the motherboard so you want
to want to do it close to the end of the
terminal or where it terminates you want
to do it more mid harness that way you
can keep it behind the chassis because
if you truly truly are trying to do this
as some sort of a deterrent then you're
gonna want to put this somewhere where
it's a little bit less conspicuous
because here's the problem little J this
this probably would work for her for her
for a couple of times because she's
smart enough to know like oh the power
button isn't working is my power supply
turned on and she's gonna come back here
and look and if she sees a button she
might go let's just say it's right here
she might be like oh what's this that's
weird I don't think she'll have the
forethought to like push this and push
the power button together but the first
time someone sees e do it well then it
doesn't work anymore so this is perfect
for little kids they're gonna be coming
up and pushing buttons on your computer
and it would kind of keep the power
switch from doing anything
also to let's say you have a roommate or
an older brother or a older child that's
smart enough to potentially realize like
oh they wired something in this computer
that's not right that's why we're doing
the black harness that we can run behind
here that blends in and where I'm
thinking I'm gonna put this switch is
actually on the top underneath the fan
filter so that we push down on the fan
filter where we want the switch to be so
that you don't see it at all so you can
see I've already trimmed this wire here
and what we need to do now is we need
essentially attached to leads on to this
that is what the heat shrink is for and
the electrical tape normally I would
solder this but I have my soldering iron
and no solder and we already actually
went to the store once today we don't
want to go again that's how we went to
get this switch if you're running where
I got this switch I would say RadioShack
it's out of business we literally went
to Autozone into the ricer aisle with
all the LEDs bought the cheapest one we
could find that had this demo try me
button stole this out of the package and
then proceeded to throw the LEDs of that
by the way because as soon as I opened
up the package the LEDs fell apart and
didn't work anyway so I paid nine bucks
for this switch alright so all I did
right here was just strip both ends of
the wires the one that's on the power
switch and then the the wire lead that
we're adding like I said normally I
would solder this cut the end that the
excess off and then you have a little
ball solder there but because this is
not a stressed part I'm gonna be moving
or anything it's not like in an engine
bay this will get us by no problem but I
am gonna heat shrink it though because
I'm a huge proponent of using heat
shrink over tape we're available because
tape does get gooey it comes off I just
put that over right there and this is
what the flame is for at the heat shrink
to do its job which is to shrink and as
you can see that wire and going anywhere
so we're gonna do the same thing on this
other one over here look at that what
I'm gonna do now is I'm going to put a
bigger piece of heat shrink over this
and create just a bit of a harness so
that it doesn't pull out I'm gonna do it
on both sides too don't hold the heat
too long you don't want to melt the
insulation that's on the wires
there is our half of our harness so now
we have these two ends that I'm gonna
also sleeve because like I said I want
these to really sort of blend in with
the rest of the wires in the case and
that doesn't matter which end of the
wires it goes to because again this is
interrupted circuit until you push the
momentary switch which gives it a
momentary circuit complete what you want
to do with the sleeve though when you
cut it it's gonna fray at the end so you
want to take the heat and just hit it a
little bit so it kind of melts like that
when it's still kind of pliable you'll
want to sort of straighten it out but
you don't want to melt it to your hand I
did that earlier so we want to go ahead
and get our heat shrink ready for the
next bit we're gonna do right here
because we still have to get our actual
harness sleeve on there and what we were
going to do now is just we don't want to
be fumbling with things because if
you're doing this by yourself obviously
it's gonna be difficult so we're gonna
dude right now is we're gonna go ahead
and put the sleeve on we're going to
push it up as far as we can we're gonna
get ourselves some extra slack that way
we can solder our ends and then we'll
pull it back and solder or heat shrink
over the end of this so we'll kind of
demonstrate that now so we're gonna put
both wires through if I didn't measure
this too too long
should be towards the end when we get up
to the top right here kind of gets a
little bit more difficult as the wire
goes farther down the sleeve there's
more resistance the nice thing is if you
need more slack you just go to the end
where the wires are and you push it you
see how you get that little kind of a
inchworm kind of a look as you do that
you kind of put the wires farther down
as you can see we're all the way down to
here I know hold that up out of the way
something else we can also do I'll
demonstrate that now is you can use a
zip tie to kind of keep it from coming
back while you're working with it cut
the zip tie and then it will stretch
back out so just to demonstrate that you
can kind of push this up out of the way
see how it sort of like crunches down
like that just take the zip tie put this
over the wires
and zip-tie it down there we go like
that make sense then when we're done you
can just cut the zip tie just make sure
you don't cut the wires underneath it so
there's our harness so the idea is
obviously not that you're trying to make
it impossible for someone to turn on
this PC you're just trying to make it
harder right that's how you that's how
you stop a car thief 101 is you don't
stop them from being able you make it
take too long to be worth their time if
I'm gonna go and plug this in right now
and test it for proof of concept so if
this if I did my job right and I did
this correctly pushing the power button
should do nothing with it plugged in and
then once I push my momentary switch it
should bring that power switch to life
and they just had to get creative on
where you gonna put it
nothing it's just you can see it
actually or we could just use the
voltmeter haha okay so nothing haha
defeat kill switch like I said the start
of this video I think I want to hide it
under this so I'm gonna have to do a
couple of things here I was hoping that
the switch was gonna fit through one of
these honeycomb openings perfectly but
it doesn't it's like barely too big now
it's a J video they put a nick in it but
it also pulled up the case like it look
at you guys shot with a bullet that's
okay
that'll work
boom yes so all we did and it was Phil's
idea is we just added some washers to
the bottom of it and I use big flat ones
that'll keep it flat and we can kind of
control that angle now so the harness is
gonna be out of the way I'm gonna put
this fan back up in there which is going
to perfectly block that view of it so
you're not gonna see it that filters
stick enough to where you don't see the
button
not to mention whose first thought is
gonna go to look through the fan filter
to see if there's a button keeping a PC
from starting I mean no one's gonna do
that everyone might now yeah and so
that's what it looks like right unless
you're looking at it straight down then
I mean someone might be like what's that
but they're gonna go like this
that's weird they're not gonna go like
this
oh so anyway guys there you go that is
your lesser than knowledgeable PC friend
deterrent or heck maybe you just want to
protect your extracurricular activities
from your parents or your wife or your
girlfriend I'm not a judge I mean you
guys can do whatever you want I mean
that's your computer but as you can see
it's now flush mounted if you look at it
from this perspective here because we
put the harness and stuff on there you
would never freaking know the only thing
is now this case will forever only work
with this switch so there you go just a
fun little video I've got inspired by
watching Chris fixes video and then
remember what I used to install these on
ignition systems all the time why not
install one on a computer I think it
seems like a practical use case do you
guys have any suggestions for crazy
content you know we like to hear them
hit me up on Twitter comment down below
and as always a huge thank you for 2
million subscribers we will see you guys
in the next movie let me get another
video until we hit 3 million so I guess
were having like a nine-month vacation
that's not asbestos it says worstest so
that's how you do it I mean what is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
