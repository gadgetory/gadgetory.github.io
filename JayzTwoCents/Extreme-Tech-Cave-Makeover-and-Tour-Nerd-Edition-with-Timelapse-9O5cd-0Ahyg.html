kind of tech related because we were in
my man cave officer you know you guys
have always wondered what's in the
closet well as you can see now there is
nothing in the closet except for some
shelves that are going to go in there
because everything on the floor behind
me that's what was in the closet now as
the business has grown so has the amount
of stuff that I have acquired so it
gives a little busy yeah all this stuff
is from the closet this is the trash the
trash bag the closet uh that actually is
my Starbucks and that is all stuff
waiting to be reviewed by the way and
yeah so I got allowed a lot of cables
and spare parts and so I'm going to be
installing some shelves in there and
then we are going to be doing quite a
bit in this room actually hey Jay what
desks are you using that I had to does
really high awkward angle that one
behind me is a gallant it's a corner
desk it's a corner right with extensions
that come all the way out to there and
then an extension that goes out to there
and then that is another gallant but
it's straight a lot so they're put
together it's a whole bunch of
extensions on there but I'm taking all
the tabletops off of those and I'm
putting on the birch colored wood tops
instead of the black the black scratch
is really bad I bought it used to have
some water damage it's really worn out
so I just want to get some brand new
tabletops on there and we are going to
also be painting my office I'm if you
guys can see I have kind of a white yeah
you can see right there I have kind of a
white patch where I do some of my white
wall work the rest of this office as you
can see all around is oh that's the bat
that was in my twenty thousand
subscribers special video where we kind
of reenacted the office space beat down
of the printer and we beat down the
computer yeah so that's the bat for that
I might give that away maybe someday if
I'm ever famous but all of the walls in
here as you can see
they're kind of that gray color and it
makes filming in here a real pain in the
ass when he gets trying to sew the white
balance right so anyway as you can see
this place is a mess
everything's getting gutted out of this
room this weekend I've got a hell of a
job ahead of me
you guys said hey why don't you vlog it
so that's what we'll do we'll block it
homeless man has needs a really serious
haircut whoo look the shells are
together and I bought plastic containers
to start putting all of my stuff in my
little crap yeah it's a it's a little
it's a little untidy
in here let's mijin look they're
together and what are you playing with
right there I go pro we're going to
mount it and take time-lapse photos of
when we're painting the room and when
we're disassembling all of this crap hey
Nick do you want a noir shelf maybe
maybe they don't have room right now
though so I know it's like 10 something
at night not what I'm doing
too long but as you can see we've made
some pretty good progress in the closet
there we've got we got all our crap out
of the closet you guys on Twitter asked
for a time-lapse so coconut monkey
brought over his hero3 which is
connected to a smartphone and it's now
going to be shooting out into the room
while we time-lapse tearing all of it
down and then doing the painting and
stuff tomorrow's okay guys wait they -
big day - of the man cave vlog almost
making the face no I looked on the
camera I got to be like I know right so
okay we got the GoPro still hooked up we
did a little time lapse last night of
tearing down the computers was sanding
on the walls as you can see here kind of
sort of getting all the old previous
patrons and stuff out of there somebody
see how bad these walls were me look
sanding down the corner here we're some
old stucco or whatever it was this
really bad shape uncovered a hole right
there uh yeah so this room is completely
sort of good the desk is still there but
so we are going to be painting in here
now and time-lapse photography of course
but the homeless guy I paid him in
Starbucks and skittles if you can tell I
look like shit blew my eyes
ooh we have been at this now for well we
started 24 hours yesterday we got some
sleep last night started again this
morning and as you can see it's a lot
brighter here you can see we
wall-mounted the my TV I didn't I was
gonna stealth mount it and coconut
monkey will tell you it was a dilemma i
sat there in the store could not make up
my mind well he said there we were both
there yeah I couldn't decide if I wanted
to do a ghost mount you know so the
wires behind the wall was just more work
than I wanted to do so we just got one
of those little little tray things but
as you can see different colored discs
and it's starting to look an awful lot
like an Apple store in here it's not
really the intent but the lighting in
this room and there's so much more room
for activities I'm gonna fall down
member
hi guys here we are day 3 of the tech
cave makeover Hey look you see me right
there holding up my phone huh
sorry about the video quality guys this
entire thing was filmed on my iPhone but
anyway we are done so let's go ahead and
take another quick little crude tour of
the new and improved tech cave and we're
going to start with the closet because
the closet was she saw earlier in the
video you didn't see that before because
it was just far too embarrassing to show
it was like one of those closets you see
on TV open the door and everything just
comes falling out of it yeah literally
things fell on my feet when I would open
the door so let's go ahead and take the
new-and-improved tour of Jays tech cave
the closet you guys can see now
hallelujah
it's uh organized there's all my tools
the top shelf items waiting to be
reviewed quick pause the video see what
Jays got coming up that middle shelf my
frozen CPU box right there some fans in
the back Steph that's going for my build
is in that box and the bottom of got
some product boxes my dumbbells and then
on this side here I can't open the shelf
all the way because my fans in the way
right now but all of my various cables
and things just things I typically use
on a regular basis my Yeti mic is right
there and the way back there my nerf
guns extra light and then yeah software
and other crap right there
so coming around this way here is my
camera as you can see I do have my Nexus
7 HD on the front there that's nothing
more than a monitor for my camera sound
rig that's just my zoom recorder my mic
is in the other room uh TV is
wall-mounted some of you guys were like
yeah you should have hit the wires well
I really really wanted to but I didn't
because I didn't want to permanently put
the holes right there I didn't know you
know what this room holds in the future
so I don't want to permanently do that
shelf up top with just a couple product
boxes in there just kind of randomly put
there early
any reason picking those brand new IKEA
alot desktops same frames from the old
build or the old desk my 900 d which
will be getting changed out my 3 monitor
setup big comfy chair and then another
Galant desk over there with the tech rig
and then here's some shelving I hit I
have over here some headphones and stuff
on there just some coolermaster products
there I'm currently using some fans
light up there in the corner and then my
Gears of War 3 poster Dyson vacuum very
crude shade and then work back back now
let's talk about this carpet for a
second here I will agree it is not the
prettiest looking carpet in the world
but when and by the way this carpet is
not from the 70s guys this carpet was
put in like 2007 I agree with you it is
not the most attractive looking carpet
however this carpet is freaking awesome
when you have kids because you can't see
any of the stains and stuff I'll be
honest with all the water cooling and
stuff into our I do in here I have
spilled plenty of occasions on this
carpet if I had a solid colored like
beige carpet or something this would
look so bad in this room trust me this
looks a million times better so there
you go guys is Jay's new and improved
tech cave as you can see it's not a very
big room that I'm in here it's just a 8
by 10 or a 10 by 12 10 by 12 bedroom
that has been converted into a little
you know tech cadence to do it has a
very like Apple Store feel to it now and
I really like it it's brighter which is
going to be great for my videos the
color correction is going to be awesome
some people wondered why I was painting
this I had a medium color gray like an
18% gray in here which was fine when it
was just me hanging out in here but when
I started wanting to do videos there was
horrible lighting in here and it became
just a major pain in the ass to try and
get all of the the brightness levels up
where they needed to be and it just
became really difficult see now if I
want to do like my b-roll stuff on this
table with these lights it's gonna be
awesome speaking of lights let's take a
look at those real quick so from the
door you can see I've got one light
right there
it's a 3500 k a 23 watt CFL got an LED
light back there's people that's what's
behind here it's just an LED light shine
it up has an up light and then I have
got two more 23 watt 3500 K CFLs right
there and that's a fill light
thirty-five hundred watt CFL right there
are 3500 watt oh my god
23 watt 3500 k light as you can see in
just a cheap can so but with the white
walls I get pretty amazing luminance
illuminance in here now so there we go
guys that has been Jai's tech cave
update the next step date to this room
will be getting rid of the 900 e case
and swapping everything over into that
case labs gunmetal SMA 8 if you guys
want to note that gunmetal case looks
like on here just kind of take a look at
the screen the gunmetal looks amazing
against the white so there you go guys
JC sense man cave cut cable they're
going to call it update 2014 as always
follow on Twitter if you want to talk
and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
