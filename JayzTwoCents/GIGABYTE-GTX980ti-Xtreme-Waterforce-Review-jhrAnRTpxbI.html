I am doing my very first review of 2016
I'm enjoying the experimental type
videos but of course we're still gonna
be doing some product reviews because
one of the points of this channel is
obviously to try and educate you on some
products before you spend a lot of money
building a PC or a graphics card or
whatever hopefully you got to make the
right decision based on the information
I'm going to give you but today we're
gonna be taking a look at gigabytes new
gtx 980ti extreme water force Edition
graphics card is it too little too late
no let's find out once again I want to
give a huge thank you for today's
sponsor lynda.com
I like to learn things you should like
to learn things too and there's nothing
more fun than learning things you care
about at the pace you want to learn them
I've never been the kind of guy who does
the best in a classroom setting so I
like to learn things that I want to
learn about when I want to learn about
them and that's what's great about
lynda.com it got new classes that are
added each and every week thousands of
online tutorials about subject matter
that matters to you get a free trial
membership and start learning something
new today but in the description of this
video you will find a link it's how they
know that I sent you its lynda.com slash
j ly NDA comm /jy
so head on over there right now and
learn something new fill your brains
with knowledge other than some of the
other useless junk we fill our brains
with but something important in there
well here it is right here and obviously
as you can tell this is a single card
with a single radiator something about I
said from the very beginning gigabyte
should have done and I know you guys are
sick of seeing this clip but I'm going
to play it again but I do think gigabyte
is actually onto something here because
I think they just missed the mark what
they should have done was simply offer a
single 90 80 120 millimeter radiator
with much much shorter tubing and let
the buyer mount it in a standard 120
millimeter fan slot in their case just
like the 295x2 and look how successful
that card is but I think if gigabyte
relaunched the water force as a single
card solution the buzz about it would
have been much more positive now in the
Box obviously you get the graphics card
and the attached water cooling radiator
and even a it's like a wristband
it's a little like a gym wristband I
didn't elect you but sometimes I get
really sweaty when I game just taking a
quick tour around the unit you can see
it does have a backplate it's a standard
length unit it's no longer than the
actual length of the PCB which is nice
because they're air-cooled cards that
you guys know adds extra length which
makes some compatibility issues with
small form-factor cases or even some mid
towers although not usually an issue
these days it is something to keep in
mind you've got a window right here on
the front of the card as you can see so
you can see your pump and stuff but most
of the time it's oriented like this and
then you'll have the radiator you know
kind of going up to maybe the back of
the case or you know something like that
yeah all right something like that there
we go so you're not gonna really see it
it does have an illuminated gigabyte
logo right here on the side which is
nice it has RGB features the side of the
window also lights up it has RGB as you
guys know 2016 and CES was like the year
of RGB so that's kind of nice to see I
guess but you can illuminate that and
make colors that you want got your
standard i/o you got your DVI on there
your three display ports and your HDMI
when it comes to specs though it does
require to eight pin PCI Express power
cables and then it has one six pin
axillary coming out the back so that's
kind of weird how instead of utilizing
some space on the PCB here and putting
all three of them together you would
have to have two coming out the top and
one coming out the back which could be
aesthetically a little displeasing you
do also have right here though the
extreme button on the back which is how
you can switch between the different
bios that are on here and then of course
you've got your two sli fingers on the
top because this is four-way SLI
compatible now the base clock on this
thing is a thousand megahertz so
obviously but it's going to push the
overclocks farther to twelve hundred and
sixteen megahertz plus and that's going
to be based on cooling so obviously with
the water cooler on here in GPU boost
2.0 it's going to want to take full
advantage of the lower thermals and push
the overclock farther so I wouldn't be
surprised if we see something up in the
thirteen or fourteen hundred megahertz
range without us even touching a program
like GPU guru that comes with this or
MSI Afterburner or whatever overclocking
utility you like to use the RAM clock is
sitting at 1800 megahertz or technically
1800 and one megahertz giving you 7200
for megahertz effective Ram speed on
this
about 200 megahertz higher than
reference as well so obviously this
thing is pushing higher clocks all
around now when it comes to the RGB
features one thing to keep in mind is
that it only works with their own
proprietary software the GPU guru app so
if you want to do RGB control on this
MSI Afterburner
or EVGA precision is not going to give
you control over that which is kind of
unfortunate because I do not like the
Guru software whatsoever I obviously
have my alternatives that I prefer over
that so if you want to control the RGB
unfortunately you have to use their
software all right so that's enough
yammering on about the specs and blah
blah blah let's go ahead and see how the
seeing performance and we'll do some
final thoughts some subjective and
objective opinions on this card because
after all this was one of the first
attempts at water cooling this card with
the modern series cards obviously I
believe ZOTAC did it back in the 500
series but we've come a long way since
then so let's see where we are today and
whether or not this is one you guys
should even consider spending your money
on when it rains it pours I tell
you so one of the problems with having
open and test bench like I have here are
they just dropped a cable behind the
desk the fan is pretty exposed and I had
it all set up
I was booting up the system and
unfortunately I broke a fan blade off as
you guys can sort of see hopefully this
is very stiff tubing you guys can sort
of see right there I broke a fan blade
off with my finger which is why I now
have a band-aid on because these are
very sharp blades and holy hell did it
literally slice the absolute crap out of
my finger that's a first I've never done
that before so as you guys know when
mistakes happen I like to leave them in
so unfortunately I'm gonna have to now
expand which got me to thinking this
might be a perfect opportunity to see
exactly how you could change a fan on
this if you wanted to so I guess let's
go ahead and do that finger really hurts
it the edge of that fan just dug in and
then BAM and then the blade broke off
and went flying somewhere I still
haven't found it but blood literally
wept out of my finger
be careful guys seriously I have never
cut myself on a fan before something bit
me so I figure this is actually a
perfect opportunity to do this
considering so many people have asked me
if you can change the fan on these units
because this one as you guys can see
here just like on the other radiators
we've taken a look at on these
all-in-one cards like this a comb
all-in-one card because it's all one
unit on a card is they are wired into
here not into the motherboard or
something so if you did damage your fan
like this I guess this is a good example
of what you would have to go through if
there's just a few perimeter screws
there's two on the bottom maybe two on
the top appears to be it's now just as I
feared on the inside of this and there's
fingerprints all over it so now I have
the fingerprints of whoever installed
this thing so just as I feared it is not
using a standard fan plug if you will as
you can see this is very different yeah
so that powers it appears the pump and
the fan so unfortunately the only way
you can get this fan off is you pretty
much have to cut the thing that's
unfortunate
so they never anticipated this fan ever
having to be switched right so obviously
I can't change the fan out on that
without having to cut it out because
it's literally wired in to the pump the
pump also shares the same harness that
comes with the fan now this is pretty
much the identical fan right here and
this as you can see is on the devil card
the devil water cooled card from power
color which is clearly a 390x not a you
know 980ti
but it looks like they've sourced the
same fan only they have gone with a
standard three-pin solution so if
gigabyte had done something like this
then that would have clearly solved the
issue where you could just unbolt it the
fan kind of coiled up the cable zip-tied
it and then just plugged it in and been
up and running so obviously if the fan
gets damaged with the msi unit you're
stuck with having to go through an RMA
whereas on if they had just gone with a
unit like this or you know a function
like this where the 3-pin just plugs
into the card like so then it would have
solved our issue so we're gonna have to
do for the sake of this video now is I'm
gonna have to plug another fan into here
I'm gonna cut this fan out I'll probably
rewire it myself later
and then we are going to just move
forward with using a different fan which
is going to skew some of the cooling
slightly but I don't think it's going to
be that much different overall because
what I care most about on this obviously
is performance and cooling is well at me
it kind of sucks I'm I'm sort of stuck
between a rock and a hard place here
unfortunately my finger took the brunt
of it oh well let's move forward okay so
I got the new fan installed and just to
kind of show you guys what I did here as
you can see I literally just cut the fan
cable and and pulled it out of the out
of the cooler and the fan that I used
here is actually just an ek fan but it's
not the Vardar I don't want to give
their give any sort of cooling advantage
by changing the fan so actually chose a
fan as you guys can see that is very
similar in design it's not glossy but
it's got very similar fan blades same
number of fan blades and it's also a
lower rpm fan this is a 1600 rpm fan
versus I don't actually know how fast
this one is does it even say on here it
doesn't even say it just says model
number it's a power logic fan and the
does not say the RPM on here so anyway
it does say it's a 2 ball bearing fan
though anyway let's go ahead and plug
this thing again hopefully I don't cut
my finger off this time and we get some
actual numbers
I've had a lot of time to spend with
this card now actually the first part of
this video that you saw was done quite a
while ago but anyway I'm very
disappointed that I broke the fan but
these things happen I guess but at least
to give you guys a pretty good idea of
what to expect if you did something
similar and you need needed to change
out the fan I'm kind of disappointed
that the doesn't have a standard plug
like all the other water coolers that I
tested did where you could have
literally just plugged another fan into
it three pin fan and then been up and
running so that's a little bit
unfortunate but in terms of performance
it really didn't surprise me meaning the
980ti I feel like has really been tapped
where these companies and the custom
aftermarket air cooling and the water
cooling we've already talked about water
cooling doesn't really increase your max
overclocks it really just gives you the
best temperature for your max overclocks
so it really performed where I thought
it would it was matching the type next
in quite a few tests this is a custom
PCB not a reference PCB as say the 980ti
hybrid so that's a little bit of a plus
this thing overclocked really really
good out of the box it went straight to
14 17 just like I thought it might and I
think the only card that overclocked
farther out of the box was the kingpin
from EVGA but this thing I actually
achieved 15 22 on the core which seems
to be pretty much the norm all of my
980ti is I've ever had come through here
all sat right around 15 20 before they
started failing and the overclocked
testing regardless of what the voltage
was this one gives you plus 87 on the
voltage and a 130 percent additional
re-enacts testing technically an extra
30% power target above
so 130 percent which is higher than some
other cards now the only time I think
you'd see the true full potential of
this card is if you went something above
and beyond the water-cooling and then
what with some like exotic cooling of
some sort but if you did do a custom
bios on this thing then you could
technically push the voltage even
farther but the additional power target
is nice which probably is why it
overclocked all the way to 14 17
automatically of course I want to see
how far this card would go and given
this card being what it is I don't know
why you're even given the option of
going to extreme mode you should just do
it all the time anyway just let it go
there by itself and one thing you might
notice compared to other hybrid coolers
we've looked at here is this one has no
fan on it to offer additional cooling to
the PCB but unlike the other options
this is the only one that comes with a
full cover block built onto it although
it'd be transfer of heat pipe it still
is giving you full contact cooling for
the VRMs the RAM as well as the GPU so
this is going to give you the best total
cooling for an all-in-one cooling unit
unfortunately they chose to use a very
short and terrible option of fep tubing
fpp tubing doesn't look good in fact
this is the only cooler I had that I've
tested on this test bench where the 120
radiator did not have a left tubing to
meet the front of the case where I had
been mounting them to do my hybrid
testing so keep that in mind the tubing
is a little short and one of the things
that really stinks about fep tubing it's
very stiff and no matter how you twist
it and bend it it kind of wants to do
its own thing and just sort of like flop
around on itself the rubber tubing
options that you find on pretty much all
of the other custom cooling units are
definitely more desirable than that the
last thing is I feel like the cooler and
the shroud are kind of cheap looking I
mean the shroud is just plastic as I got
as I showed you guys when I took it
apart it's just a flimsy plastic with a
big giant window with a case sticker
literally stuck in the front of it and I
think that gigabyte could have done a
much better job with the aesthetic now
there are g/b colors are red by default
and obviously you can change that
through GPU guru like I said I didn't
mess with any of that it didn't matter
to me but you guys can change the colors
through guru like I said so there you go
guys that is the gigabyte 980ti extreme
water forces is this too little too late
this was something I said 13 months ago
they needed to do almost 14 months ago
unfortunately everyone else beat them to
that single 120 unit cooling for the
top-end GPUs
when they were kind of the first ones to
revise that idea with the three-way
water force which as you guys saw I
didn't really enjoy or appreciate now of
course other cooling companies in the
past like ZOTAC have done all-in-one
water cooling units on like say the 580
but then that was dropped through the
600 series and the 700 series and
brought back late into the 900 series so
this is it's nice to see again because
we're able to really utilize things like
the efficient Maxwell architecture
getting great performance very low
temperatures this thing maxed out at 47
degrees C which is pretty much exactly
what skunkworks graphics cards are doing
with the same overclocks as well as
being on that giant massive loop so you
can see that the radiators are more than
enough a single 120 to keep these guys
cool but you tell me is this too late do
you guys like this design tell me in the
comments or tell me on Twitter anyway
guys time to go thanks for watching my
review of the gigabyte 980ti
extreme water force tell me what you
think as always guys thanks for watching
and I shall see you in the next video
now you got to bear with me here I'm
gonna probably be moving here in the
very near future so it's gonna be very
hectic I'm gonna do the best I can to
keep my schedule alive I'm gonna do also
the best I can to get things pre
uploaded far into the future so that
it's kind of seamless but it's gonna be
a crazy next few weeks anyway thanks for
watching see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
