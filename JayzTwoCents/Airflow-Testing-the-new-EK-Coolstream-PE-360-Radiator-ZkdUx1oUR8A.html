watching Jase - since I am Jay if we've
never met before that's who I am and you
are used now that we've got that out of
the way let's go ahead and talk about
what today's topic is and that is the EK
cool stream PE triple radiator you guys
asked me for some more water cooling
reviews so that's exactly what we're
gonna do today and we're gonna give it
you guessed it the old j's two cents you
got to do it with the fists it doesn't
have the fist it's not J's two cents
it's just your two cents the fists makes
it J's yeah now one of the things I've
said in previous EK videos is that I
love their packaging like they've got so
much color and stuff going on and if
you'd like to play with the boxes and
the packages and stuff then you're
certainly going to like this nice I
can't get out of the sleeving
it doesn't want to come out ah it would
actually help if you open the box but
anyway when you take it out of the
sleeve then it just turns into a boring
white box and then all the fun is gone
then until you open it up where in this
case we're going to find that brand new
cool stream radiator now to make sure
that you don't lose any of the contents
in there they've got a ziplock baggie
with all the screws on there which
include pass-through screws for mounting
your fans as well as short screws for
mounting it to your case and they're
taped right on there so you don't lose
it and inside the fancy bubble wrapping
here which you know you've got a top it
something I'm really pop
okay so once you realize that you really
suck at popping bubble wrap you can go
ahead and take the radiator out of the
packaging and you'll see that you have a
very minimalistic design here which is
exactly what they were going for with
this radiator
it's very square actually has aluminum
plating on here to give it this nice
appeal and this nice look to it it has
brass and tanks and 90% copper core on
here as well as copper fins so you have
a nice mixture here of metals that give
it the aluminum doesn't touch the water
so you don't worry about any of the
corrosion issues that come along with
aluminum but you do have brass and
copper on here which are very good
conductors of heat and gives you very
good heat dissipation now one of the
things that they do also offer here is
what they call their double stacked fin
design basically what it is to split fin
they're not the first company to offer
this but there are not very many
companies out there that are offering
this where instead of having a single
piece of metal that zigzags all the way
across between the different rows of the
core you have two sets that are
basically opposing where their points
touch which gives you a massive surface
area but also very low hydraulic
retention which they call it where you
don't need super high static pressure
fans or high speed fans to push air
through this in fact if I just breathe
right now I can feel my breath it's kind
of gross actually you can feel the air
on the other side just barely blowing so
what we're going to go ahead and do here
is I'm just going to show you some of
the other features of this radiator and
I'm going to put fans on here and I'm
put some paper on the other side there
100 no 100 god that'd be incredibly slow
fans there 1000 rpm fans that I'm going
to hook up on the fan controller and
we're going to see at what rpm do we
start to see the paper move on this so
you can see whether or not this split
fin or this stacked fin design is really
all it's cracked up to be
now they do advertise that this radiator
is only for 120 millimeter fans so I
don't think they have a 140 version as
of yet this is the triple as I mentioned
one to three fans on there you've got
your you know your fittings here that
are mounted through this really
nice-looking nickel-plated threading
basically I know it's kind of a new
I'll just say it's a nipple but other
than that it's very minimalistic and it
looks very very good which is exactly
what they're going for with this
radiator design it says right on their
website but this is this is intended for
a minimalistic yet stylish look so the
powder coating on here is really really
good it's very satiny dust it's kind of
a dusted finish
unfortunately it picks up like dirt and
things really easy so you kind of not
want to handle it a whole lot when you
put it in your build and then you know
wipe it clean when you're done it looks
like when I look at the screws on here
the screw holes might slightly just
barely line up with the edge of the
radiator rows on here which I would have
liked them to have maybe made it so that
it didn't even have a chance of
protruding into the tube if you
accidentally screw down in there too far
but you do have at least a quarter inch
before you get there so if you've miss
measured the screws by that far if
you're not using their included screws
then you really did it wrong so I'm just
going to go ahead and say that so but I
mean as you can see we can we can kind
of see through there not too bad and
considering the amount of fins that are
actually on this thing it's actually
quite impressive
one thing that they also do advertise is
the fact that this is apparently
best-in-class for 40 millimeter thick
radiators so it is a 40 millimeter thick
rat so enough talking about this let's
just go ahead and put some fans on here
and see how this thing performs at low
rpm fans which inevitably means that you
can have a very silent system without
sacrificing any performance of your
radiator all right so for this air test
here are the parts that we're using I'm
using three of my phobia NBD eel oops
these are the noise blocker fans there
are 1000 rpm fans of course we've got
the radiator that we're talking about
because it would just be dumb to do a
review about one radiator and then do it
about another so obviously we're looking
at the cool stream PE here still from ek
I've got three pieces of paper they're
taped on here and as you can see they're
just sort of dangling on there see whew
just so you guys can see there's no
shenanigans
they are completely just dangling there
now you guys may be saying why are they
kind of off to the side slightly well I
didn't put them in the very center of
the fan because we all know the center
of the fan is sort of the dead zone so
I've got them slightly off to the
so that the air coming through the
radiator is hitting directly on the
piece of paper so what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to go ahead and flip
this a little bit sideways so you guys
could see the paper and we're going to
go ahead and flip on my fan controller
here so you guys can see just how much
air is actually coming through this
radiator without it making any sound
this thing is completely silent
okay so just one last little thing I'm
going to do just for fun as I've got
this little piece of paper here that
I've set in front of the radiator so
that you guys can see how the fact that
this thing is truly moving air for quite
a ways in front of it so check it out
yeah it's moving that much air guys at a
thousand rpm through this radiator so
that's pretty damn awesome I can only
assume that the cooling of it's going to
be just as good so guys this has been
the ek LC solution cool stream PE I
don't really know the PE stands for
you're gonna have to go look that one up
they link to the product is down in the
description make sure you guys go and
check them out and give ek a big thank
you for sending me this to check out for
you guys so if you're looking for a
radiator make sure you go and check that
out I think it blew all the way off the
table yes it did guys this thing moves a
ton of air considering the fact that
it's high density it's got high fin
density on there so good job ek on that
one I've just got to say keeps the noise
down you can use low speed fans which
means less dust less noise and it's a
win-win all around so guys it's been
Jays two cents here taking a look at
this ek radiator you know where to go
head on over to Twitter give me a follow
if you want to chat and talk to some
tech and head on over to the website
because that's just a pretty awesome
place to be so I'm gonna get out of here
guys and as always I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
