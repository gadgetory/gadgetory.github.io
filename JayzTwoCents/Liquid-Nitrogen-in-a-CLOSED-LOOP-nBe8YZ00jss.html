made it all the way to Computex 2018 in
Taipei Taiwan this morning I'm really
tired
so if this video comes across as less
than coherent I apologize but I digress
the show must go on
this year's coverage of Computex 2018 is
sponsored by EVGA check out everything
EVGA has to offer for your PC needs at
EVGA calm so it makes sense that we head
on over to EVGA to see what they are
showing this year we headed over to
their game arena where Vince kingpin
himself is showing off a brainchild of
his something he has been working on for
about seven years do you guys remember
when I did my ln2 video last year and
Vince came to my studio and kind of
showed me hands-on how to had to deal
with the ln2 and how to how to
pre-freeze the pot and to deal with the
crystals and the condensation and there
was one thing I learned in that video is
that there is a very specific range of
temperature that you have to maintain
based on the frequency you're trying to
achieve and the voltage you're trying to
achieve it at if you over cool the CPU
or you don't cool it enough it's just as
bad either way so keeping it within that
very specific temperature range is
extremely important now the rate at
which you pour the ln2 or the radio
which you let it boil off determines the
temperature and it's very easy to get
out of range which is why Vince himself
I say Vince himself because this is he
is the world champion of overclocking
year after year after year is fierce
competition and guys are constantly
being innovative and that's why this is
exciting because he developed a hybrid
closed-loop lnto system now the reason
why it's called a hybrid is because it
doesn't actually loop it doesn't go it
doesn't multiple make multiple passes
across the block for the CPU and the GPU
it actually gets there's a return tank
and a supply tank so you have one tank
feeding the blocks and some actuators
and some valves that are controlled by a
custom software that was written
in-house as well as a controller that
was built in a PCB controller that was
built in-house all custom for this
system and then the ln2 that actually
passed us through and isn't you know
completely used the liquid gets captured
back in the return tank and it can
actually be used again so it makes it a
very a fish
Loup but what it also allows to happen
here is the software and the valves are
able to actually a much more efficiently
and much more quickly control the
temperatures based on the temperature
probe or the shape figure what it's
called this is the this is the tired
part of me but you know it
gamers Nexus was actually there Steve
was there and he did a video on this as
well so you guys could go and check out
his coverage for another perspective of
this because I'm probably gonna say
something wrong due to my tired
tiredness but it again it doesn't matter
because this is cool either way the
temperature probes in there are gonna
allow it to more quickly more accurately
control the temperatures between a
specific specifications nearly as much
as going from liquid to gas as it does
in a pot it actually is three to five
times more efficient at cooling and
quicker at giving you that temperature
change than if you were just pouring ln2
into a pot so this is a very neat system
it's got a custom-built distribution
block that's taking ln2 from the supply
tank and dividing it amongst the CPU and
the GPU and they each have their own
valve to control the flow rate and then
of course they meet back in a return
line and go to the return tank in fact
if you're watching the EVGA livestream
then you probably saw this being
demonstrated because there they were
demonstrating how this works and they
were playing some Fortnight but the cool
thing is you can determine the
temperature you wanted to run it in fact
when they were doing gaming they had it
running at a very conservative 40 C
which is right around where water
cooling Coquet you on this and at that
type of temperature a tank like this
would last you about a week but if
you're doing will clock world-class
overclocking attempts then Vince can
actually burn through one of these
massive tanks which I think was 160
liters is what I think they said it
holds in approximately two to three days
so yeah I'm not exactly the most
practical use for home use but if you're
out there trying to break World Records
then this is neat because you can
capture your unused ln2 and get a very
consistent control over the cooling
environment that you guys are that
you're trying to establish with this
level of cooling so I thought this would
be a cool first video to show you how
far Ellen to an exotic cooling has
actually come and what kingpin has been
up to and this is why the guy is
notorious for just breaking and
shattering world records as I said guys
gamers Nexus also did a video on this
won't you guys head on over and check
out their channel because you might
actually learn something versus my
incoherent rambling of being overtired
but anyway I digress thanks for watching
today's video guys we're gonna be doing
some cool stuff here at Computex trying
to give you a first look more of a point
of view first-person point of view of
vlog style experience here at Computex
2018 anyway thanks for watching guys and
as always we will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
