can feel it I feel like old time I'm
just like it is up guys like a miniskirt
no it looks like Jason from Friday the
13th I've gotten all Forest Whitaker I
what's up guys James $0.02 here and
today we're going to talk about how to
bling out your corsair dominator memory
using cable mods new memory modding kit
cable mods pretty neat company what we
doing some more stuff with that moving
forward in the future here and they
pretty much started out doing sleeping
and extensions and cables set three
different power supplies but now they're
branching out into a lot of different
accessories and we're going to kind of
kick off our coverage of cable mod here
by talking about the memory mod kit
which we just talked about sort of at
whatever you know so why did these even
exist well I'll tell you because you
like to mod stuff slides called cable
mod today it's memory mod if you have
ever taken a look at the corsair
dominator memory you would notice inside
that there are LEDs they light up but
for whatever reason of course they're
never actually made the standard kit you
know so that light is actually visible
because the way you look at it typically
it's completely blocked by the metal
cover sure it says Dominator on them but
yeah there's a light up or anything like
that now they have the special edition
Ram we took a look at that last year and
then they've got a new special edition
which of course they light up but it's
got a sort of a burnt blue look sort of
like a tailpipe effect second kind of an
automotive thing but those are limited
edition and they're really expensive so
that's why stuff like this exists cable
mod has sent me two kits here we've got
the white one and the black one and yes
this video is obviously sponsored by
cable mod so yeah there's that thanks
for the hook-up guys we're going to take
a look at the white ones here today
because I think that's going to match
the what do you think I think it's going
to match this better we've got sort of a
white and black we're going to go ahead
we're going to power this off and we are
going to show you how to install this
it's really simple and we're going to
show you how to use the built-in
lighting of the Dominator by using these
kits and make them look really cool so
for those of you that aren't familiar
this is what the Dominator platinum
looks like out of the box it's not a
special edition or anything just on
standard Dominator platinum we've got a
silver shroud on here it says Dominator
ddr4 and then obviously we've got our
heatsink on the slide right there so
we're going to be doing today is we're
gonna be replacing this shroud with one
of the replacement pieces that come in
the kit and then we've been putting a
transparent piece of plastic in there so
that we can actually see the light
that's already built into the RAM again
I don't like Corsair didn't make that
default but I guess it's okay because
then we wouldn't be making today's video
so here's what you get in the kit this
is the black one this is the white one
it's pretty obvious black and white they
have the same inserts right here for the
colors and you get a white or clear
technically because the LEDs are white
in here so clear is white green blue red
and orange which is kind of neat so what
you're going to do though is you're
going to start and you also get an allen
key which is very important because you
need an allen key to get these tiny
little allen heads removed from the ram
holding on the shroud now what you'll do
is you actually take and remove all four
of these allen keys they just sort of
pinch together like that there's two
halves but because this is Jay's $0.02 I
have got one already disassembled here
so that you can see exactly how this
goes so what you can do is you're gonna
pick your color what color do should we
do next you know green that was a really
fast answer some of the fanboy to use
okay so we're going to take out our
little green inserts here while I'm
taking another black kit that's because
I'm stupid that's why so this piece
right here normally sits just like that
which is kind of interesting because
it's just right on top of the LED and
the light would transfer through this
piece but because that's solid normally
you don't see that at all so what we're
going to do here is we are going to keep
this piece right up put the silver one
away and we're gonna take our white
shroud and we're going to take the green
and you can see how these holes sort of
line up with the indentations on these
little light bars we'll call the light
bars you just slide that in there
you just slider in just like that take
this little light bar right there
slide it on top so you get a light
sammich so once you've got your light
sandwich there you're just going to line
it back up with your memory module
slider on in there and that's what it
ends up looking like and they just put
your screws back in and I guess you
repeat it for however many many memory
modules you've got so we do for today's
videos I'm going to do a few of these
different colors will do green we'll do
the orange the red and the blue we won't
do the white you guys know what white
looks like so you can see what each of
these kind of look like
okay so they're installed and as you can
see they're very subtle on the light
part of that is because we have studio
lights right now shining on this so you
can't even see it in this camera angle
we'll be sure to show you some close-ups
in the dark but it's very subtle which
is kind of nice we live in a day and age
where everything is just bright RGB and
in-your-face and very flamboyant colors
just cycling and going all crazy this is
kind of neat because you choose the
color you want it's static and it's just
a subtle glow obviously the darker the
case the more this is going to be seen
so it's up to you to kind of balance
your lighting how you want them to be
but the reason why they're subtle is
because the light is being diffused
inside the light bar that you have to
reinstall from the original you know
Dominator light bar and that's being
diffused again as the light is going
through the color insert so that's why
it's kind of dim but I like I think my
favorite color though it's actually the
white with the orange it kind of makes
me want to do another white and orange
build all I've never done a white in
orange I did gunmetal and orange but
makes me kind of want to do orange again
also to be careful with the little color
inserts as you take them out of the
package I kind of squeezed one and it
snapped in the middle and the other half
went flying somewhere I don't know where
it went now you can still use this even
though it broke you just lay them in the
cut them back together lay them in the
groove and then it gets held in place by
the light bar anyway and you don't even
see the middle where it's snaps so you
could still use it you just want to be
mindful of that be careful with it
obviously I manhandled this one just a
little bit too much also to the
installation is very straightforward
it's for tiny little allen heads again
they include the allen key I went ahead
and used my I fix it because I was
getting kind of frustrated with using
the key I've got big fat fingers and
these are tiny little screws and those
things never go together very well the
other thing I want to mention too was on
some of the the new tops the powder
coating was a little bit built up in the
hole so the screws didn't want to fit
through that hole so you just had to
kind of remit out a little bit use your
imagination and then it worked fine the
second time you know once I took it
apart put it back together it went
together no problem so I mean there is
that but it's a it's a neat thing it's a
mod and okay might as well at least make
your computer own which is the whole
point of taking things like this and
applying them as you can kind of add
some unique touches
to your system however you want them to
be anyway once again huge thank you to
keep them watch for sending these out
for me to take a look at I'm going to
probably put these back to white so I
think I'm going to leave all of these
with white with the clear insert because
it just would look best I think on this
test bench but that said guys I'm going
to go check out their stuff in a link
down the description below you guys can
see everything they have to offer and
let me know if you guys have any
particular products from them you will
want me to take a look at we'll be
looking at some more moving forward and
as always thanks for watching hope you
guys have a good weekend
if you're watching this when a video
went alive otherwise I hope you had a
good weekend but that said time to go
and as always I will see you in the next
one don't break it like I did don't do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
