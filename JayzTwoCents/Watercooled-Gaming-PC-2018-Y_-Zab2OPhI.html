marketing for fractal design probably
otherwise known as fractal Josh my
current system is a few years old quite
a few years old got a 4770k and it's one
of those systems kinda like most people
have where you kind of keep building off
of it you know you have this and yeah
adds more harddrive space you have great
ramp and you know it's kind of starting
to show its limits now for me mostly
with storage what we're also doing here
is Josh's first time getting his hands
dirty with rigid tubing I'll let you
guys take that joke wherever you want to
leave that but he's never bent rigid
tube or anything before so we just keep
going with the J it's good so we're
gonna bend the shaft a little bit here
no we're gonna we're going to put a link
to all these parts in the description
below so rather than spend a bunch of
time calling out parts we're gonna have
this be a fun video where you just kind
of come along for Josh's first time
playing with his tube now to be fair
obviously I used to run my own system
integration business boutique system
builder so I've done a lot of this stuff
I just back in my day you didn't have no
damn rigid tubing so this be my first
experience with that so maybe show
people why it's not as I guess scary as
people think it is this requires a lot
of heat a little bit of patience and
basically I screw up it's on you because
you didn't teach me well well on that
note let's go do you want to be cooler
you want to be more desirable well
you're in luck because right now you can
own your very own J's two cents wag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below now one thing about this
motherboard it is frickin hefty a six
terabyte geez why is that not big enough
not big
i neva know they made up black what kind
it is how you use it so my current PC is
pretty much my catch-all PC a game on it
I stream on Twitch I edit video I do a
lot of work you know duties on there and
honestly the 4770k is no slouch but the
issue I'm having now is I can start to
see where it's kind of bottleneck in my
performance and how much I can get done
on a daily basis now one thing I know
I'm gonna get trolled on is I've got
four sticks of RAM I'll be upgrading
that for later on but you know Ram
prices so let me go ahead just like see
the processor and everything right now
I'm already yeah okay
see the processor and then you could
take off the heatsinks do these two yeah
you might have to take that off on the
side I can't member though that's
wanting to strip this one yeah so it's
actually started happening on mine where
they tighten this screw down and the
metal soft so the moment you even try
and we had a proper size yeah it starts
stripping we had the right size Phillips
in there it's just the metal so soft it
just immediately rounds out so what
you're replacing this piece with is this
heatsink here okay and then it has its
own thermal pad so you'll need the
manual for that one to see which ones
are this people would be cringing just
watching me put this thermal pad on here
I did not get a mani-pedi today
we welcome everybody yeah oh yeah that's
your home yeah guys really got Lani not
possible
yeah graceful fuck Jay here's where Jay
cuts his finger open you put a little
blood in there so you know what it's
kind of looking forward to it this build
is having more of a showpiece my current
one is more of a workhorse it's not
ready for primetime so to speak but with
that kind of comes a concern of the
hardline rigid to me it's a look I've
always liked I've never personally got a
hardline to bill before I've done plenty
of standard I guess softube
liquid-cooled builds and you know what
makes me a little bit nervous is just
the rigidity of it no pun intended but
you know if I need to swap out Hardware
exchange something just I'm gonna have
to drain the whole system there's no
bending a tube out of a way to get to it
thermal paste is on Jay so you can pick
it up flip it over by that like hold it
swap bam hits the ground
this whole setup right now weighs so
much I mean actually bench test any of
this stuff so banking that it's all good
out of the box
we believe in our hardware partners did
this part come off separate from this
part Jay focus Jay it's so day one all
we get is motherboard block installed so
we now have the RGB mono block on as
well as the CPU installed to cover back
on unit and now I'll be reinstalling
some more cosmetic enhancements you
can't IPO porn forget it look I ripped
that one in half - that's gonna be more
- even trigger people yeah more even
trigger yeah Nessa they'll trigger more
even the bestest of them all work sir so
I'm gonna try and do some fine motor
movements and you have like 16 coffees
in you okay so now now you gotta go
through moving 50 mm screws to convert
this yes
okay Johnny NASCAR you know all those
screws are different so for this bill
rush you using a 360 slim radit for the
top and a 240 thick red for the front
wanted to be sure that they were gonna
be in the film them just want to make
sure I just want to make sure we were
gonna have any interference with two
360s you could make it work
but we didn't actually need to do that
we have a thicker red you know Jay
thinks he's all that but honestly he's
been at this for about an hour and a
half so really let me get the front
ready cuz then we can see I was trying
to think of like which way I want to
worry at the fans on here true because
he had the cable coming off huh
no not gonna clear the dim dot to you
well then we'll leave that out and I can
put it back under the shield down there
cuz the thing is that's taller than the
most rambhai liked a little bit yeah I
did it's well yeah to me I see the it's
pretty tall the dim dot to is like
slightly too tall now obviously if you
guys have seen like the G scale tried
and Z before they're very tall and very
sharp RAM sticks we wanted to mount it
to the dim tube because we thought it'd
be easier to access if he ever needed to
change it for some reason but then we
realized even if we got it to mount like
on the dim dot too and clear the
radiator that it would still been a
really you know big pain in the ass to
get out because of where the power
cables are and where the 24-pin and all
that is so we're just going with this so
in all honesty when you see like a lot
of builds like this where they go a
little bit over the top or whatever
what you're seeing is like the price you
pay for that a lot of this stuff is not
the most user-friendly you know like
obviously like skunk works you have
little bit more because it's like it's
such a physically large size of it yeah
but it's like okay if you had to get
into that one back there tear something
now it's like most times you're looking
at drain your system and then start
undoing the liquid clean stuff you did
before
yeah you have a problem yeah it's one of
those days I Monday
got it we're gonna come in on this side
because the thing with parallel is you
have two tubes that go in between them
so it's it divides the flow between each
card evenly but then the outlet has to
be on the opposite side and when I'm
looking at right here that kind of sucks
is that it doesn't line up like straight
with either of these so we're gonna have
like a cockeyed Bend Cayuse Nick okay
yeah you know while we're going through
the build you kind of have in your
mind's eye what it's gonna look like and
once you get everything is simple and
you're getting ready to do the tubing
you start realizing a few millimeters
here versus a few millimeters there how
much of a difference that can make and
how much more difficult it becomes to
get the tubing bends done or to route
the cables in that particular area and I
know a few times does like I just want
to be done with this part I just want
this Bend to work out perfectly so we
can move on to the next thing it feels
like it was kind of a bit of an anchor
holding you back but once you get past
it I mean you're just excited for the
next step now we need to mount the
reservoir okay and then that just what
screws into the fan the bracket here
yeah you know it's a sleeving on these
things I have a promo code for those I
thought he said it would sleep well so
this is a manual pump right there's no
PWM this blue wire right here is just
rpm circuit so this tells the
motherboard hey it's spinning like a fan
yeah I never use these so you can leave
it on if you want and we can sleeve it
but I recommend snip the blue wire under
here get rid of it cut the blue you
won't explode that's the red wire okay
that's a yellow one
I'll hold this part that's been helpful
yeah thank you sir
now she's helpful to be a satisfying
click you ready okay well it was sad
yeah you kind of oversold that Jay
teamwork makes the dream work
jinx do a tester fitter so the two like
trouble areas is gonna be obviously
getting from here to here mm-hmm
from there to the red and then from here
to here that's probably going to stop
here at least for this part of this
video it's gonna be a 1:1 part video
don't worry
so yeah yeah I'm gonna let you do you
can figure out the loop all on your own
yeah okay yeah
oh good I'll be your spirit animal
my little bunny he's gonna hop around I
got you the little bunny look look at
this little bunny okay day two obviously
the part you guys are here for josh is
gonna be doing his first rigid two
bended thingy in his computer I'm gonna
try working with Jay you know I'm sure a
lot of people really look forward to
that and think that'd be a dream gig
obviously Jays really good to work with
he's good at coaching you and kind of
like what he does why he does it it's
not so much about you have to do it this
way it's more like a in my experience
I've learned this this seems to shortcut
this or make things easier and I suggest
you go that route and you know I learned
a lot by watching him obviously he has a
comfort level with this stuff that kind
of gives you more of a sense of calm
when you're driving into a project like
this you know as opposed to trying to do
something like this at home for the
first time you know props that people
feel like they can do that I would be
too busy freaking out about messing up
tubing but we decided that there was one
change we should do honestly we weren't
sure how much room we were gonna have
with two 360s I mean obviously we knew
the case supported it yeah but after
looking at it and thinking that the 240
felt a little empty in the front and I
was worried about air flow because we
had three exhaust fans on top and an 140
in the back so we decided to take
another EK cool stream se which is the
slim addition it's the exact same one we
had on top I had just happen to have one
here in studio so we are gonna have
balanced air flow now we're gonna take
the 140 out of the back of the case
we're gonna have a 360 in the front 360
on the top and nice balanced air flow
same exact rad same fans so I mean the
air flows will be the same between the
two the other thing we did is obviously
the tiny little reservoir tube that
comes with the EK pump top reservoir
combo was not big enough so we swapped
it for a 250 millimeter reservoir and
you can see now we've got this nice big
chunk of cooling here alright so we got
some things to do now we are gonna get
everything back in and start planning
our loop because that's always the most
complicated part
so that would work
so if you want it to bend here you need
to heat up a little bit farther back and
it's gonna curve so that's the mistake
people make is they they eat where they
want the bend to be and then when it
bends the radius is tighter and then it
doesn't lie anywhere they think the
middle of their Brenda is gonna be it's
already starting to bend because it's so
thin so now lift it off the heat a
little higher and then just kind of keep
rotating it around start to try them in
a ninety slowly so you're almost there
good now so now put it down the table
and then flip it over the other way so
you can put the straightedge on here and
then yeah blowing it to cool off and
keep it there for a little while needs
to be shortened up a little bit
so you know now that the system is done
obviously there's that sense of
nervousness when you first hit the power
button I think everybody gets that no
matter how expensive or big or grand
your build is like oh gosh will it boot
and once you hit that you know you have
a few more blocks of like okay is
everything gonna load rise gonna
recognize all the hardware so you're
ready for this yeah we should do it okay
here we go three two one
well there's that obviously we have the
RGB reservoir in there as well
RGB Ram RGB motherboard
there are RGB blocks on the graphics
cards as well first boot usually takes a
while but it's a lot of micro bubbles in
there itself to work their way out
however you know it might take even
longer J it's for me to ship this thing
home well the monitor is doing stuff
okay and now we're done peace out video
over we're just done we're good turning
wait guys I want to thank Josh for
allowing me to kind of help him with his
build here I basically did most of the
bends only because this turned out to be
a somewhat complicated ish type of build
in terms of the bending there was a
couple of double 90s that can be quite a
pain in the ass but we use fittings
everywhere applicable just to make it
simpler plus ek sent over a lot of
fittings for us to use and that made
things easier so what we gotta do now
obviously exhibit OS installed all this
will be off-camera we need to the OS
installed he's got to get his Asus aura
going so that we could stop this RGB
puke madness a rainbow puke well it's
quite majestic you know I'd still like
to tone it down a bit
any final words uh honestly it's you
know I think one of those things like
any project you just happy to have it
done just because you get to use it you
know and more than that yeah big thank
you to the sponsors helped me out you
know basically everybody that's in there
we got a cos kick Danny BJ's got the
pixel pushing power going there HyperX
with the SSDs in the back you know we've
got what toshiba kicked in the one
terabyte in DME you know cuz honestly
one of the things I'm most excited about
for this build believe it or not it was
storage cuz you know it's like I don't
create a ton of content like J does but
the stuff that we do internally when you
work on a marketing team and you have
multiple raw files of stuff and TIFF
images and things like that and
corporate backups it's like it just gets
huge so to be able to have a lot of
storage and fast storage is big you know
in sorts cranked out the cables really
quick
Premal chill is awesome and getting
fluid samples to both on it for the
color matching and also to J and yeah I
already stepped up so I'm pleased I'm
really happy with it I'd like takeaways
from from this build you know obviously
a large part of its plan you always want
to have extras of everything you know
because you have in your mind's eye how
this is gonna work out on a 90 degree
Bend here this fitting over here and
then you get into it you realize up a
few millimeters off okay now to adjust
that we give you this incredibly
complicated Bend or if I just had
another you know extender it would just
fit easy so you know in my mind going
into something like this again I'd order
multiples of what I need you know get a
few extra fittings you know get more
tubing just so you're not putting
yourself up against the wall you have
some breathing room if you do a bend
wrong of a tube breaks or something like
that but you know now that it's done I
mean it's kind of crazy to look at and
realize that it's mine
that it's my system you know it's one of
those things where it's got all the RGB
but I'm not gonna have a run color
spectrum I get to make it in mind I get
to make it you know an all purple build
if that's the accent color I want where
I can mix it up and for me you know it's
a little bit crazy to look at it from
the solid side and see house you know
sleek and minimalist it is it looks like
any other system and then you turn
around to the TG side it's like a holy
crap you know it's kind of like a
complete sleeper from one side on the
other side you know a pure performance
so I love the way it turned out you know
it's always a mixed bag when you're
dealing with J cuz there's alpha male J
and you know he talks about his cars and
how awesome he is and how he shit his
pants on the way home from school hello
Jay so I'm Josh with fractal design
vice-president marking sorry
so I'm Josh with fractals I and the vice
president marketing for North America
Hey so we're looking at you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
