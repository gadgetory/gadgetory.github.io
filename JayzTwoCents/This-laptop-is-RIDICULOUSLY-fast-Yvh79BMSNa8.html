something today that I have not talked
about since CES since my first time
getting hands-on with it a little bit
late to the party but that's how I kind
of like to do things sometimes I'm of
course talking about RTX based laptops
and obviously we were fortunate enough
to have Origin PC send me one and it
even has my name on it so we're we
talking about a lot of things with this
laptop today because like I said this is
my first time getting hands-on with it I
saw it at CES and by it I mean like 16
different models of r-tx based laptops
from a lot of different companies origin
PC was obviously one that was there we
also took a look at their booth and they
had this on showcase as well but we're
gonna we're gonna kind of talk about
some of the physical aspects we're doing
some performance testing temperatures
acoustics all that sort of stuff so
obviously this is not the way they ship
because I don't think they'd sell many
if they sold them with my name on it but
this is part of like one of four or five
different ways you can customize it so
what we're looking at right here is the
evo 16 dash S and the reason why they
call it the evo 16 is because it's a 16
point one inch screen on a fourteen
point nine inch body kind of like me a
big head well I got a big body too but
whatever that's besides the point I
digress so the this is there UV printing
right here so you can do UV printing
with custom designs and logos as they
did right here they put my name on it
and then sort of spice it up a little
bit cuz I don't really have a very
attractive logo so they added this
triangle and stuff you can also get
laser etching you can get hydro dipping
you can get O
metallic paint that's it they're really
known for their really nice glittery
metallic paint on a lot of their cases
so you can get a custom of course
there's an extra fee for that but this
is the UV printing which is kind of nice
so this is not a rap it's not gonna peel
off this is a very well bonded UV
printing that is done on here so this is
a 16 point one inch IPS 1080p 144 Hertz
monitors or panel I should say it's not
really a monitor so that obviously makes
this very geared towards professional
workflows as well as a gaming because
the IPS is going to give you that color
accuracy but obviously the fluid motion
of 144 Hertz it's going to give you
super silky smooth game frame rates but
the cool thing is the fact that it's a
fourteen point nine inch laptop with a
16
1 inch screen it measures point 7 8
inches thick at its thickest point so
it's not even an inch tall and it's only
4.5 pounds so it's extremely portable it
feels very solid in the hands it's not
like creaky I mean flex why's a little
bit of twist in there but not a lot I
mean I don't think it's anything that's
abnormal
so for connections it's got a full size
USB 3.0 we've got 2 USB 3.1 C's a mini
DisplayPort HDMI power cable on the
other side here we've got obviously a
headphone and microphone jack another
USB 3.0 SuperSpeed a card reader and a
LAN jack right there and of course a
Kensington lock they've actually got
this little plug in here so that dirt
and debris doesn't get in there when
you're not using the SD cards that's
kind of nice one of the things I like to
check with laptops and call me an apple
and I'm not really but one of the things
I loved about Mac boats when I used Mac
books was the hinge was always perfect
in terms of being able to lift the lid
but not tilt the whole computer back but
then having it be able to rest in a
position you put it without sagging or
drooping and that's exactly what they've
done right here so the evo 16s you can
see you it'll stay in any position you
put it in without sagging but I can open
and close it with it on the table
without it folding back if you think
about how perfect the tension has to be
to achieve that that's actually pretty
impressive I'm sure we've all tried to
open a laptop lid that folds the whole
computer back or you have to put your
hand there and open it up or you kind of
set it where you want it and then it
just sort of like sags a little bit
hasn't been a problem with laptops in a
while but that's something I have
experienced in the past with dealing
with like cheap working you know lap
books or lap tops well the size of lap
book is I think it was HP probook it's
the one I'm specifically thinking of and
that's the one I had for working it
stuck that it was heavy had a huge bezel
speakers were in the top piece so it
just was heavy and it would kind of
droop back on me or if I picked up the
laptop to move it like this as soon as I
picked it up the screen would just
against the hinge and eventually the
hinge ended up breaking so I don't see
that being something that would happen
with this because I did I did kind of
screw out this a little bit and I'm kind
of flailing it around and as you can see
it it will move a little bit but you've
really got to sort of force it to do
that but if you're just moving it around
like on your desk and stuff as you can
see it's just scaring me you can trust
me guys it's not going to fall
so there is that but I mean in terms of
the the compact format of it being a 16
point 1 inch IPS 144 Hertz display and
only coming in at 4.5 pounds and 0.7
eight inches high just over three
quarters of an inch it definitely gets
the the award in my opinion in terms of
like kind of cramming a lot of stuff
into a small package obviously because
there's a lot of hardware in here it's
an Intel i7 87 58 which is a six core 12
thread processor but this also has an
Nvidia 28 Emacs Q so it's the biggest
laptop GPU that they make which can
generate some heat and although it falls
under the max Q specifications which
determines how loud it can be but you
have this power draw and all that stuff
is going to be it can still generate a
pretty decent amount of heat you know
with those tension cores and all that
sort of stuff so ventilation is
obviously a big fourth eye on this
design so we have some these are
actually speakers right here that down
fire in the front talk about those we've
got lots of ventilation intake on the
bottom we've got some exhaust on the
back and what I like about the exhaust
facing away from you is when there are
some on the sides but I believe these
are intakes is when exhaust kind of
comes up the side and out the back it
tends to sort of still heat up the
chassis and kind of get warm around your
hands the other thing we're going to be
checking is whether or not heat is gonna
be escaping through the keyboard because
that can be uncomfortable too especially
in gaming sessions if you're not using a
map of mouse and a keyboard is heat will
start to build up on the hot spots where
the components are and if that heat
starts coming through the keyboard then
it can get very uncomfortable especially
where your palm rest is so we'll be
looking at that sort of stuff too but
we're testing two different titles here
for the RT X features on the laptop to
see how it performs in a mobile format
battlefield 5 because it uses ray
tracing for reflections and then Metro
Exodus which uses raytrace super global
illumination so two different types of
technologies that are being used with
the RT or the RT course
so obviously D LSS is on on this as well
which is a feature we want to take
advantage of that way those tensor cores
are doing something and not just sitting
there but as you can see right here with
the 2080 and I need to turn some of the
music down here it's not quiet by any
means but I think you're asking a lot
for silence and a 20 80 max Q
and six core 12 thread 8750 cpu so if
you're worried about acoustics we can
just start off by saying wear headphones
honestly but I can tell you that they've
done a really good job at heat
reflection it's a little warm right here
and by a little warm I mean it's
lukewarm it's not uncomfortable by any
means it's cool over here cool to the
touch again a little bit of warmth right
here on the WASD keys but not
uncomfortable by any means I've had some
gaming laptops that actually utilized
the keyboard for ventilation which is
bad obviously so they've done a really
good job here at redirecting the heat
obviously there's gonna have heat pipes
and stuff in here
but heat rejection is really good on the
areas that you touch so here we are
whoa ok that's I've a band-aid on my
finger so I didn't feel that I was
pushing the shoot button that's called a
negligent discharge
I accidentally fired the gun - all right
so in terms of the options here for
video we've got it set to the LSS goes
off what the heck man we want that on
ray tracing is on high our TX is on
obviously so everything's looking pretty
good here quality we were on high let's
go to extreme just cuz I'm curious okay
so with everything maxed out at least on
the extreme on the cool quality 55 FPS
54 it's not terrible but obviously we
don't want to play like that so let's go
back to a realistic setting I think I'm
gonna go back to high like I had it the
LSS is on ray tracing is AA on high so
yeah we're gonna go back to that now one
of the things to keep in mind with the
max q 2080 is the fact that it's not
going to be running the full speed like
the desktop plus it's also not
equivalent spectra spec as the desktop
variant so you can see we're running at
fourteen hundred and ten to fourteen
hundred and fifty-five at a keep
swapping filters because remember this
is a radioactive area so I want to see
if we can overclock this slightly
because we do have MSI Afterburner and
we do have these sliders available
No all right so we're running about 1530
now you can see the CPU runs fairly warm
though high to mid to high 80s but only
the GPU temperatures oh that's pretty
impressive given the fact that like I
said this is just over a quarter of an
inch thick of a laptop if you think
about the actual space inside of it
these temperatures are pretty pretty
good all right yeah no kidding I mean
look at it yeah I mean the core clock
came down slightly the temps are almost
70 on the GPU but I will fight them with
RTX yeah it seems like 69 is probably
over 70 that's probably where the the
temperature control really starts to
kick in the CPU on the other hand it's
like just who cares 90 see 92 see in a
game that's crazy I'm gonna try
something here though I'm gonna prop up
the back of the laptop like with the
charger brick i'ma see if it improves at
all because we only have a few mil at
couple millimeters underneath for it to
grab air you know I mean like this makes
me wonder what a laptop stand improve
temps at all I mean look the GPU temps
came down a couple right and because the
GPU temps came down out of 70 that came
up slightly this seems to be proved a
little bit because look okay so allowing
for more air flow of makes better
temperatures who would have thought the
jackal is a jackal jackal the jackal
jackal
alright dx12 is enabled VXR is enabled
BL SS is enabled dynamic range is on
auto I this is on HDR monitor upscaling
is on auto memory restriction is on and
then we are on max fidelity all right so
now battlefield 5 like I said uses an
entirely different RTX implementation
this is reflections like as you can see
are here in the water and stuff where is
why we using bad feel v like I said is
this is using a whole different way of
abusing this RT course so instead of
using it on global illumination the way
the light bounces and stuff battlefield
5 is using it for just the reflections
so it's a lot easier to run that's why
we're seeing a higher core clock that's
why we're seeing lower temperatures on
both the CPU and the GPU and higher
frame rates as a whole you can see your
hair GPU usage kind of goes between
the 80s and the 90s which makes me
wonder if we might be seeing a little
bit of a CPU bottleneck that could also
be power limit because it is max-q it
could also be temperature there's a lot
of different things it could be as you
can see this is extremely smooth and
responsive Rotterdam is a really good
map to test with because of just all the
shinies temperatures are also keeping
the fans from having to ramp up to max
speed which means it's a little bit less
intrusive but gaming on a laptop is
never going to be a quiet experience so
that's something you need to keep in
mind we are seeing very respectable
frame rates here on a laptop with
real-time ray tracing whether you call
it a gimmick or not you have to admit
that this is a this is pretty impressive
that we are doing this in a thin
form-factor laptop I get more FPS when
I'm dead the irony oh I'm gonna spawn on
sticky monkey is that Nick it's stuck to
me ah get up I'm on fire now he turned
in a hit his front armor as you can see
it battlefield 5 without except for the
fact that I suck on my own laptop is
yeah obviously very very playable so if
we go in and turn off though let's just
turn off the extra feet like the r-tx
stuff because I mean it's only a couple
of games that you can truly take
advantage of it on right so let's go
ahead and turn dx12 off which will turn
off all that extra stuff and let's
compare right we were getting 80s and
70s on RF yes let's see what we get now
it's so obvious now how ugly the game is
with ray tracing off I have to say
although the FPS improved a little bit
the core clock certainly improved we are
seeing it's not as pretty as you would
expect and I think it's for me it's
finally gotten to the point to where I'm
starting to get spoiled by all the extra
eye candy because once you turn it off
it just looks flat it looks brighter yes
yes is the same as it was with r-tx on
so that brings up a good question
does DL SS at 1080 P actually
it does look fixed now but that wasn't
even the point of today's video but it's
something worth mentioning DL SS has
improved enough now with all the data
it's quote sort of collected in their
own deep learning supercomputer to where
it looks better with the LS s on than it
does off although but I can't really say
that though because I have to see you
have to have r-tx on as well to the LSS
and battlefield 5 but I can tell you
this with this setup with max fidelity
on ultra with RT X off in my opinion
looks worse than RT X on medium settings
with DL SS at the same frame rate so
that that's the thing so I sort of
prompted us to kind of send me a check
here what it's like in Metro with RT X
and stuff off so once we turn this off
I'm curious as to what's gonna happen
with our app yes okay look thank you the
FPS now doesn't really look that
different so this is what gaming would
be like you know in Metro Exodus with
those features turned off right if you
just want to play a standard game very
snappy fps and near the hundreds and the
core clocks still coming down but the
FPS is still great
so one thing we didn't talk about though
was professional workflow or on-the-go
editing so basically we took a 14 minute
but just about 14 and 30 was the video
length in 4k and we took the project
file and we rendered it on our desktop
rendering rig upstairs which is a 9900 K
and it has a quick sync enabled so we
did the same thing on this I remember
this is an 87 50 H which is a 6 core 12
thread versus an 8 core 16 thread on the
desktop this rendered the project in 14
minutes and 10 seconds a 14 minute
30-second 4k video rendered in 14
minutes 10 seconds so just under real
time with this laptop put into
perspective the overclocked 9900 K
upstairs which is running about 5
gigahertz with twice as much memory of
32 gigabytes of memory and a full scale
desktop 20 ATT I did it in 10 minutes
and 30 seconds so obviously that was
about 30% new 35% - faster but this is a
laptop versus a full-blown desk
and this was able to render a 4k video
in real time and that was upscaling from
1080p which is a little bit more of a
difficult workflow which means if we
were dealing with 4k native resolution
footage then it would have been even
faster so obviously professional
workflow on this is also pretty damn
impressive so once again a huge thank
you to Origin PC for sending me the
first 20 series r-tx based laptop that
I've gotten a chance to get kind of
hands-on with other than being at a
venue like CES oh it's very lockdown and
we can't talk about things like
temperatures and stuff because we can't
see any of it so obviously we got to get
fully hands-on and immersive with this
so if you guys are interested in
