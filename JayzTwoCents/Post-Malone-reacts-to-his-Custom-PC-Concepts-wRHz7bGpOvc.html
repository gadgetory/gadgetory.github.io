in this video chug off no I can't do
that I'll just hurl foam
[Laughter]
I've had enough foam issues for this
week with what's everyone js2 since here
we've got only one way to introduce post
below and that's to crack a bud got him
out mine's already cracked yeah but I
have mine wasn't all right guys so this
is technically part two of the post
Malone build I know this is taking
forever I know okay stop it
takes time to do perfection so we got
post Malone back we've got something
here to show him this is a prototype
this is a one-off does not exist
anywhere else except one other channel
we'll talk about that in a second but
we're gonna show you the platform we're
gonna build in the custom design we're
gonna make we're gonna take this we're
gonna customize it to fit the beer bongs
and Bentley album yes sir and we're
gonna try and take that crazy just like
you want it barbed wire you wanted
yellow you wanted Bentley I think
there's snakes involved in there
somewhere right so it's like what the
hell are we supposed to do with this I
think we got it
so if you would do me a favor and go
ahead and pull the cover off of this
we'll talk about what this is oh yeah
this this right here this this is the
only working prototype currently this is
the singularity computers chassis I
don't know what exactly what they're
calling it for I know the truth it
doesn't matter because we're calling it
the beer bongs in Bentley Rick got it so
this right here is just a prototype
obviously this is too plain for you but
we're talk about some of the features
and I'm gonna show you what we are going
to be doing custom with this but you
kind of gave us some ideas on our first
meeting you want give me some first
thoughts on what you're seeing here yeah
man I mean it's nice it's nice you can
you can see through it yeah I mean it
kind of looks like I know it's very
transparent obviously but that's gonna
be full of coolant yeah this is this is
it fills up here huh yeah so this what
the idea what this case was was to have
distribution blocks are becoming a thing
now with with water coolers people are
milling their own distribution blocks
they're their use
to kind of transfer fluid from one part
of the case to another but nobody has
ever built a case where the entire
motherboard tray is also an integrated
water cooling block as well so you've
got on the bottom right there that's
where your pump goes that's a reservoir
right above it you've got transfer
plates you've got distribution block
motherboard tray all built into that if
you feel this - this is all metal and
acrylic this is all custom CNC milled oh
yeah but like I said this is not it's
not scream post Malone or beer bongs and
Bentley so why don't I go and pull out
the computer and we show you what we got
in mind let's do it now you said you're
not afraid of coolant so we kind of took
it to the next level obviously with this
guy right here you're not afraid of
anything
that's not sure I think we're all afraid
of something usually it's just Twitter
when drunk but hey we got plenty of
battery you know this pc fox it fucks is
how what it does all right I'll get you
pregnant - sorry no I'm not not
responsible for any pregnancy that comes
from that and clear the bend there's
something for the ladies
check out my fuckin rake ladies SP she
gets all the bitches okay this is just
the early kind of render of what we're
expecting this to look like right here
what we're playing with right here are
some different grill ideas you have a
Bentley right which model no I don't
have a Rolls yeah rolls-royce Wraith I
won't I won't be Bentley okay is that a
rate of their Reynolds got a rape
alright suicide doors yeah it's fucking
sick okay start over that's all I need
is the Internet see that's all I need is
the internet seeing him go rolls and I'm
like noon
well I've got a Nissan so whatever so
you got a cool new Chevy Silverado see
your Raptor this is probably gonna
change a ton but this is what we're
expecting with sort of the the Bentley
grille now the Bentley is a throwback to
your start right because you had that
white Bentley in your first video the
white Iverson is that why the Bentley is
yeah I mean you know I kind of I kinda
you know I'm like I said like a simple
man but I have expensive tastes and I
want to bring it off so literally you're
just that's contrast yeah yeah right ear
bongs in Bud Light is in the bong right
and then the Bentley is just like you've
got that fine taste right but you don't
mind getting dirty right okay so that's
that's we're gonna go with here we're
gonna try different things with this I
mean this looks funny kind of sideways
but this is just early early on examples
so if we like and this is like hand
drawn stuff right here so if we actually
look at some of the 3d renderings you'll
get an idea of what we're kind of
expecting here so this is the back view
right here you can see where the pump is
and the fluid in the reservoir and the
way that wires are gonna be custom cut
the length to match all that color is is
is we can work with the colors this is
sort of a red I'm gonna try really hard
to recreate the Bud Light look in a
fluid that's not I don't know how I'm
gonna do it yet but I'm gonna try now to
for it to look like beer would need foam
but we don't want foam in a water-cooled
PC that's bad so I've got my work cut
out for me on that one fortunately I
know some chemists and I don't mean like
you know Walter why Walter why that's
all right there
sorry eyes I'm like for in so you know
so here's a here's a view like kind of
top-down where you are right now I like
the yellow a lot yeah because that's
like the main color of your album right
at the album art yeah so the album art
that I've seen you share so far looks
like kind of a yellow canvas it's got
barbed wire it looks like a black snake
is that it's a snake yeah yeah so that's
that's sort of the general feel of the
album art okay so we've got yellow and
black and we can change up the parts to
be whatever color you want we could
probably even do a custom cover on the
on the reservoir are assuming the pump
cover where they're protium logo is
that's that little
generally zoom in on that to help that
little logo right there we can do
something custom with that too if you
want a different logo there if you have
an official like you know post Malone
logo I'll send you the the JPEG perfect
this is another view of the back
something kind of basic there we'll talk
about this part in a second that I have
some ideas for it I just recently threw
at them that I think it's gonna work
really well this is what it looks like
without the front grille so without that
that Bentley grille this is the part we
want to incorporate Bentley in there
somehow the idea for me was to make it
look like the front of a Bentley yeah
the only problem is it with it being
inverted like this or up and down it
looks sideways so we're gonna play
around with that I like I like I like
the way that the cross like grille would
look on on the front of it that's so so
what if it didn't necessarily have like
the Bentley so these grilles which are
you like we like this one yeah something
like that but do you think this looks
weird sideways right here's what I like
something like that just I guess just
like the plating like yeah exactly but
we gave it kind of this chrome bezel
yeah and then maybe we could take the
Bentley logo and have it up right top or
bottom yeah that's cool yeah exactly but
like you know subtle and then like I
love the the chrome-plated yeah that's
cool yeah that's cool okay he kind of
incorporated like sort of a star on this
one here kind of like rock star even
though it's not the same album as we
throwback to when you're that's cool
yeah that's cool so this is kind of neat
right here but you liking the black and
yellow
yeah no it's super super sick I love it
look good it it it poops out so there's
another view look so this is one
graphics card you're gonna have to like
I mentioned sort of like this built back
here although minor vertical here's
obviously gonna be horizontal I want to
go back to that rear piece I told you
about that I think it's gonna look
really cool I threw this idea at them
and they basically said yeah we could do
that so I'm gonna ask you what does that
shape sort of look like to you
Tennessee
okay okay I was thinking head of a
guitar yeah let's go like I look like a
guitar neck in the head
so what we're actually thinking about
doing with this is incorporating guitar
strings in that tuner knobs wood trim
and making this look like a Fender so
that's cool is there a particular guitar
brand you like more than other mean
fender tallies okay can't get much quiet
it looks like the tele head anyway
that's what I thought when he sent it
out so look at it in person now this
right here right here so if we switch
places here for a second if we make this
just look like the head of guitar tuner
knob string yeah so now you can tell
there's musical elements to it and
that's a cue me pretty easy I was
concerned that that was gonna be really
hard work and I was talking on the
machine is she's like oh no I he's like
we can do woodworking anything you want
polished what kind of wood with that
guitar be you know like maple or it
sound like important there yeah it's a
maple Windham redwoods
so that was my idea there I like that
that's dope yeah so you can see this is
the platform this is what the chassis
will hopefully look like when we're done
plus the guitar head here I like your
idea of the grille though because that
simplifies it because yeah turning it
sideways look really odd it's like a
sideways you know I think I think with
the whole the whole just if it was all
just one piece you know what I mean like
so so what would do this we have a we
have the grill that goes up right like
you mentioned and then maybe at the top
right here we have the Bentley logo
that's cool but what if on the bottom he
makes one that says post that's cool
yeah that's badass
yeah so we that wouldn't be a promo and
that's a bolt on piece now here's the
next thing
the singularity computers is obviously
the machinist on this like I said
they're a team out of Australia Daniel's
the owner he's he's like the mad
scientist he's out of Australia and then
James is the machinist and he's actually
stateside he does a lot of the work
stateside so we can we can play with
some designs basically they had one
thing that I asked you you can do you
can do awesome and be done in six weeks
or you can literally go there's no limit
to the amount of custom that we can do
on this and be done when it's done let's
say No Limit man but what they ever had
to point out you see the barbed wire on
here
oh shit there's barbed wire that goes a
can see that's dope I like you a lot but
I want to incorporate more barbed wire
I'm thinking if we actually found a way
to like outline a lot of this stuff with
barbed wire
you know you may know cuz like you've
said you can't which what I took away
from the last video was just never too
much barbed wire and then you just
wanted it out there like you used the
word out there yeah that's you know
that's me that's me in a nutshell I like
that a lot I think you know I love this
yeah the whole thing is supercool we
could do more of that that would be
badass even some up here whatever he
could even he could even machine in
barbed wire design on it that's cool he
might even be able to make these grills
barbed wire shapes yeah
there's no limit to that we do and
actually it probably puts a lot more
comfort on them to have more time with
it because that this the reason why I
teamed up with singularity is because
there is there are no better builders in
the world as far as I'm concerned that
team they make everybody look like
amateurs and that's why I teamed up with
them because this I wanted this to be
something that for years the hardware
will be long obsolete before the design
is ever come close to someone else
recreating it so that's that's what
we're gonna do with that's cool oh you
know I got nothing but time patience
just like the album hopefully would be
done before the album I wasn't asking
about I was gonna ask you about that so
I obviously every video I put up right
now has usually 50 or more comments
where is the post Malone bill whereas a
post moment and I dealt with that with
the Terry Crews thing that was expected
what I keep telling people is like look
it's based on an album that hasn't
dropped yet
we can't drop the bill before the album
as far as I'm concerned so it'll be done
but you can't rush perfection just like
this just like this so alright cool man
so now that you've kind of seen the
renders you kind of can see something
physically now manifesting is there any
other ideas you could see like just
think it's it's fine if it seems like
impossible because I mean everything's
based on a boss okay I like it I like it
maybe I think you know like I like what
you said with the beer and the in the
herbs and everything and maybe the
lights lights dude I'm thinking I might
even add a beer tap in there even if it
doesn't actually like even if it doesn't
you should just be beer cold I know
right we have we haven't tested what
happens when you try and cool with beer
I mean hey we can try that
no I'm thinking cuz the radiators are
gonna go top and front right and because
we free up so much room without having
tubes running everywhere because it's
integrated there's only gonna be a
handful you can see on the renders here
if I go back one that's actually got
stuff in it oh you see there's not a lot
of tubes there right right so I actually
think we're the we're the radiator goes
I want to I'm gonna actually get a like
a wooden handle tap I don't want to
incorporate a tap I'm gonna find a bug
like that I wish it good maybe we get a
fill on the top so you just plumbing
into like another keg somewhere but yeah
I think Bud Light tap right let's rock
all right cool guys I know it's taking a
while but trust me when I say that this
is a build that will take a long time
and a lot of effort to top I mean I
don't know else to say right what the
best we actually got someone else here
I'm gonna put you on the spot Jonathan
once you walk up and over here ladies
like you don't remember Mike on put you
off your spot so you guys may or may not
know this gentleman
this is Jonathan Morrison he has a
series called dream desk and he's got
this is the man you go to his setup so
you build a team you don't try and do it
by yourself you build a team of people
who are the best at what they do so
we've talked about when this is done
because you mentioned to me that you
don't have a desk or a set up real I
mean you have a desk but mine store it's
from fries it's from fries it's it's
really sort of an afterthought right
this deserves something nice yeah so
what we're gonna do when we when we
start to get to the end of this project
I'm gonna hand it off to Jonathan and
I'm gonna advise with him on getting
that set up going we're gonna hand it
over to his channel and see what the
final tie-in I like is happy I like that
any now that you've heard this you can
kind of see the render right there we're
sort of working on it you are you
worried do you think you can handle this
no I feel good I see a lot of black
leather yellow anyway
some sort of maybe mini-fridge in there
somehow yeah there you go
I like that it's when of that computer
case actor Phil thought was a fridge
kind of looks like Lona yeah see then
maybe maybe it could be a kegerator that
ties into the chassis you could just
just have that have the have the kegger
built into the desk and this that's
where we'll put the tap yeah so we can
just reach over you see the you see the
client so you know there is no you can't
go too far with this all right guys
we're gonna get out of here thanks for
watching make sure you guys follow I
know it's taking a while it will be
worth it
check out Jonathan's channel link below
and then I don't need to tell you guys
where to find post Malone just go look
at the music charts it's not hard to
find them alright guys it's time to go
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next one
you might bearded although over here
