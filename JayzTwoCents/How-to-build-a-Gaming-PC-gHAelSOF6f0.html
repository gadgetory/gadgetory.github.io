many years since I've done a how to
build a computer guide I don't know
maybe I've gotten a little bit too
complacent and I forget that there are
new PC builders every single day so
today I'm talking to the beginner
he's already chosen their parts and
they're sitting there scratching their
head going how the heck do I put this
all together now also a huge thank you
to Asus for sponsoring today's video as
well as sending out some really cool
stuff for us to include in this how-to
guide not going to call it a build guy
because I'm not telling you what parts
to use this isn't a part lists are
always changing so I want to I want
something that's going to last for a
while will be applicable for a long time
with Rison being out this is the perfect
time to do it now they sent over there
ROG motherboard here this is the
crosshair six hero from obviously Asus
Republic of gamers motherboard we've got
an AMD rise in 1,700 X a pretty decent
CPU that doesn't break the bank but
still gives you some pretty good
overclock ability we've got the ROG
Strix gtx 1070 as an nvidia graphics
card of course pretty good sweet spot
GPU again in my opinion and we've got a
couple of peripherals here to take a
look at we've got the Gladius tube mouse
the successor to their popular Gladius
mouse we took a look at a while back and
their new ROG Claymore it's an RGB
mechanical gaming keyboard so with that
said here's what we're going to do we're
going to build it I'm going to build
this I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing
as I do it and hopefully I won't leave
out anything really important but I
think I think we can do this I think I
think I can build this let's see when it
comes to building a basic PC I like to
have pretty basic toolset I use a multi
bit right here which has got different
sized Phillips and flathead screwdrivers
zip ties to keep our cables nice and
tidy and some side cutters for cutting
our zip ties now for this build today
we're going to also need a USB thumb
drive because we are gonna be updating
the BIOS on our rise in motherboards
something I recommend if you're building
a rise in CPU based computer then
definitely get the latest BIOS from your
motherboard manufacturer and include
that as part of your installation so
we're going to do now is we are going to
go ahead and bench test this we want to
make sure all of the components work
before we get them inside the computer
because that's the worst time to find
out something is not working right so to
do that obviously we need our
motherboard right here
we need our power supply
we need our CPU graphics card our cooler
and in this case I'm using the Celsius s
36 from fractal design just launched and
we need a monitor of course to be able
to see if we're actually posting now AMD
based CPUs have the pins located on the
CPU itself whereas Intel based systems
have the pins located on the motherboard
so you're going to definitely want to
handle the CPU with care but you want to
take note that on the corner of the CPU
is a gold triangle now that gold
triangle is going to align with a
triangle that's located on the socket
itself so open up the retention arm
align the gold triangle on the CPU with
the triangle on the socket and push down
the arm now for our membrane you're
going to open up the retention tabs here
on the motherboard for your RAM sticks
now as you can see we've got four RAM
slots but we only have two sticks of RAM
so we're going to be using two of the
slots on here now if you're using a
different motherboard you want to
consult your manual to determine which
slots are appropriate for how many dims
you're using now in this case we're
going to use both of the gray slots
you're going to align the slot on the
DIMM with the slot on the motherboard
slide it into place and you're going to
push down firmly until you hear a click
and you're going to do that for both of
your RAM sticks so I decided to do
things a little bit difficult sometimes
because I'm just such a stickler for
water cooling I'm using an all-in-one
water cooling loop now if you were using
an air cooler at this point you would
install your air cooler on the
motherboard and you would just leave it
you can install it in the case with your
cooler already installed but I can't do
that with an all one water cooling loop
at least not as easy so we're doing a
temporary installation of the pump to
the motherboard for the sake of just
doing a post I don't actually have to
install the fans on the radiator there's
enough passive cooling on this to allow
me to turn on the system and make sure
that it's all working without any threat
of overheating the system so we're gonna
go ahead and start by removing the
screws that are on the am brand for
bracket right here and this particular
cooler we'll be reusing the backplate
that is on this so with the amount of
different types of coolers there are on
the market I can't possibly include all
of those in this video so it's very
important that you consult the manual
for whatever cooler you are using but
the nice thing about the Celsius is it
does include brackets for risin right
out of the box so that's a plus so we're
going to start by installing this guy
right into place just like so we're
going to do that for all four posts
these are the standoffs that allow our
pump to have something to screw down to
but as you can see like I said here's
our four posts and they retain the
factory backplate so you want to apply
about a pea-sized drop of thermal paste
right in the middle of the CPU my pea is
a little fatter than most and we also
need to remove the bracket that comes
with the cooler that's pre-installed for
Intel we take the AMD bracket pre apply
it to the pump and then we are going to
take our pump and put it into place once
it's in place just take your four thumb
screws install them using the
alternating corner method very similar
to putting a wheel on a car but don't
tighten anything down just yet we want
all four slides where there's just a
little bit of resistance once that's
done we can take our screwdriver and
just give them one little ogre Doug if
you will so it's just slightly snug you
don't want to over tighten this the
threads won't let it go any farther than
it needs to take our pump wire and plug
it in to the pump header or the CPU
header on the motherboard this one
actually has an a IO pump header so
we're plugging it into there next we're
going to take our super-sexy gtx 1070
strix graphics card we're going to make
sure the PCI Express retention clip is
open usually they come close to push
that open and we are going to also make
sure the motherboard is aligned on the
edge of the box so that the retaining
tabs on the bottom of the card can hang
off of the edge align it with the socket
and then push down into you hear a
satisfying click or in this case I have
to push it out there we go so now it's
fully in place it's going to be a little
bit wobbly so you want to be careful
with it because we don't have anything
supporting it on this side but we want
to make sure that it boots up and that
everything is good now depending on
which power supply you're using with
your build you may or may not have
modular cables
the g3 which I'm using here from EVGA
does indeed have a full modular cable
set so I had to locate the 24 pin for
the motherboard the EPS power for the
CPU one PCI Express power for the GPU
this card only has one 8 pin power slot
so we only need one cable and then we
need the power cable to plug the PSU in
to power most modular power supplies are
going to have the cables labeled C we
see we have an NB here which stands for
motherboard and those are going to plug
into the ports on the back of the power
supply that are labeled the same so
we're going to do that for all of our
cables including our CPU PCI Express and
our well that's it in this case only up
those three things we have to power
right now I like to hang on to all the
twist ties that come off with the cable
set because at the end of the day
they're very useful for cable management
especially if you don't have enough zip
ties or any zip ties at all so take your
24 pin cable give it a little bit of a
bend that way it's not putting too much
stress on the socket and you're going to
align this little retention clip with
the retention tab on the 24 pin on the
motherboard
it's only going to fit one way because
it is keyed it's got all these different
shapes you can see there they're squares
and different hexagons or whatever the
shape is you're only going to fit one
way so once you get it lined up it might
take a little bit of force especially
when it's new but go into you hear a
click and then it's in place next we're
going to take our CPU EPS power and some
other boards only require a four pin
some require an eight pin so that's why
this is split just push them together
same thing take those retention tabs
line them up right here with the notch
and push those into place finally take
your PCI Express power cable you'll
notice it's got a little pigtail here
some graphics cards only need a 6 pin
some need an 8 pin so it's kind of a
universal if you will so in this case
we're going to push them together making
sure that the little retention tabs on
there are firmly in place these guys
right here in the back line it up with
the tab on our graphics card and just
like before push it into place if your
power supply on the back has a power
toggle make sure it's in the off
position plug in your power cable and
then plug this into a power source take
your HDMI cable that's plugged into your
monitor plug it into your graphics card
make sure your monitor is turned on we
had a light there so we are turned on
alright here comes the moment of truth
the part where you find out if all your
parts work we're gonna start by flipping
the power switch on the back of the PSU
and we're going to look for any lights
on the motherboard now we are getting a
green light up here on the motherboard
so that's good the motherboards getting
power
now not all motherboards have a start
button like this one does most
motherboards do have surface mounted
buttons now for reset and power so I
could push this start button to start it
but if yours doesn't you could actually
take a screwdriver and locate on the
motherboard or use the manual if it's
not properly labeled and find the pins
that are labeled power button and you
could actually bridge those two together
to turn on the system like I just did
now normally I would just push the start
button but I want to show you that you
could indeed do that now the thing with
with AMD you want to keep in mind is the
first post can sometimes take a while
like nerve-wrecking lee finger biting
I'm telling it it could take a while
sometimes it really makes you wonder if
things are working so we're going to
wait and we're going to wait oh there we
go we've got a blue light there it is
now what happened there is it actually
went through the post cycle three times
what it does is it kind of like checks
everything and then every boots and then
checks everything again and the way the
reason why I know that is over here at
least on this particular motherboard we
have this cue code readout and that
tells us what's happening with the post
we also have a series of LEDs right here
that will go from green to yellow to
white and when it turns white that means
we have a good post so that's why I was
like oh we're good because it actually
turns into a white LED before the
monitor ever came on so cool the ends
tell us we got a new CPU installed
please enter setup to configure your
system we don't actually have a keyboard
mouse hooked up to this so now that we
confirm that everything is working we're
going to undo pretty much everything
that we just did yeah but that's okay
trust me taking it apart now is a lot
easier than if we had everything in the
computer and then figured out that
something wasn't working right now left
some parts that you can actually leave
plugged in here so we're going to go
ahead and leave the memory plugged in if
you had an air cooler you could leave
that on here
but because I'm using an all-in-one
cooler and I don't feel like trying to
install this and finagle this all around
- you know where it's not in my way I'm
going to go ahead and remove the
all-in-one water cooling loop as well
and we don't actually have to undo all
of it actually we just need to undo the
retaining tabs and remove the pump and
the wire itself we're going to also have
to clean off this thermal compound so
I'm just using a paper towel here most
people use coffee filters something
that's non fibrous and some isopropyl
alcohol and we are going to go ahead and
just sort of let that eat away at the
thermal paste we're going to get as much
of that off as possible we want to do
the same thing to the pump surface we
don't want any thermal compound on there
whatsoever so okay case prep this is the
part where we need to get our case ready
to receive our parts now there's no way
I can tell you how to get your case
ready because I don't know what parts
you're using I don't know what case
we're using but I'm using the cooler
master master case maker sick it's one
of their newer cases from the maker line
and it is a full ATX supported case that
means it can support a full sized ATX
motherboard which is what we have right
here but this will also fit ITX and
micro ATX so as long as you know that
your motherboard will fit in your case
then you're good to go now I also know
I'm using a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator in this that's not
going to fit in the top of this case so
I'm going to have to mount it to the
front which means I'm actually going to
have to remove this little cover here
take off the side panel and show you the
insides where we are going to get this
case ready to receive the parts that
I've obviously chosen I'm going to be
using one hard drive here for
demonstration purposes is actually a
Western Digital red it's an AZ drive not
necessarily a desktop drive but it will
work for today and I'm using a patriot
ignite 960 gigabyte SSD so I know that
this can actually mount right here if I
want it to on the qualta floorboard of
the case or I can actually move these
brackets to the back of the motherboard
tray if I want to I also know that I
only need to support one hard drive so I
don't need three here two there
so I'm going to use the manual to
determine how I can outfit this to fit
my hard drive my SSD as well as my 300
the millimeter radiator
so I've been looking at the manual and
looking at the parts that I have the
need to install this is what I came up
with and we'll start at the bottom here
I move the hard drive cage back one slot
now it can go back to slots if we want
it to but I had to make some room here
for the 360 reg which I will be front
mounting now that's not going to cause
us a problem with overheating components
inside the system in fact I did a video
on that you guys can go and check out on
how much the front mounted radiator
actually affects the rest of the system
we've got so much air flow in this case
it's not going to be a problem
the reason why I didn't mount it to the
top is as you can see here we only can
fit either to 140 s or to 120 s we
couldn't fit at 360 so what I did was it
took the fans from the front of the case
and move them to the top since this case
didn't come with any exhaust fans on the
top it only had one on the back so we
put those up here as an exhaust we also
have a 140 exhaust right here in the
back so now we can fit our 360 in the
front also by installing the bracket
that comes with this so that we could
actually you know mount a 360 up front
also to instead of putting the SSD right
here on the on show it shows right there
which would be kind of neat but it would
split up our wiring so I just installed
it right here above our hard drive that
way our state of power and our SATA
cables go the same route to keep things
nice and tidy
it could have also mounted it on the
back of the motherboard tray but at
least having it right there puts it in
the path of airflow so if you're doing a
lot of read rights to your SSD it keeps
the temperature and same thing with your
hard drive fairly low the other thing I
did was I installed our motherboard
standoffs based on an ATX layout because
again it is an ATX motherboard so the
next thing we need to do here is we need
to get our motherboard installed but
before we go just throwing it in there
you need to take out your i/o shield
that's the piece of metal that goes in
the back of the case that sort of acts
as a shroud for all of our USB plugs and
other things that go on to some
motherboards so here it is right here
get this guy out of the way and usually
these get installed with the circles at
the bottom this is all of your audio you
can see right here by looking at the
back of the motherboard it's going to go
just like this
so you're going to snap this guy right
into the back your case right here next
you want to lay your case flat on its
back you want to make sure that any
cables are out of the way just like this
fan cable here was kind of move that guy
up in either because we don't want to
pinch that between the floor of the case
and the motherboard that can cause a
short not to mention we need that cable
so we need some slack so everything is
out of the way we're just going to take
our motherboard we're going to line up
the audio jacks with the holes in this
i/o shield in the back and we are going
to gently push it into place two of the
standoffs in this case have nubs on them
which will hold the motherboard in place
so that we can get them all screwed down
so you're going to screw in one two
three four five six seven eight nine
screws in this motherboard what I like
to do once I have the motherboard in is
connect the front panel connectors you
know that's for your front side USB your
power button power switch or hard drive
blinking light all that stuff and I like
to do it now because if we just get it
out of the way now we don't have a
graphics card in here and all kinds of
stuff in our way it's a lot easier so
I'm going to start by pushing the USB
three right through the bottom grommet
right here because we have more
clearance this way fortunately this case
gives us a lot of options for routing
things much neater options so there's
our front side USB 3.0 and right here
these pins on the very bottom right
corner that's where you would plug in
all of these little guys right there now
this can get pretty annoying trying to
wrangle up all these little wires and
try and you know if you got fat fingers
like I do to try and get them all in
there and so fortunately asus includes
this guy right here and it's black and
not white like some of them are which
really will stand out and in a black
theme this is perfect this is nothing
more than a header that you plug all
those pieces into here it's a lot easier
to work on outside of the case and then
you plug that in on the motherboard you
can see we have one header right there
which is blocked off which means it's
only can go in one way and that's going
to line up on the top right corner right
there so plug that in
and there we go unfortunately most of
that won't be seen once we have
everything in there our graphics card
and PCI Express cables and stuff so it's
a lot easier to work on like that than
trying to get it all on the motherboard
alright so next up I'm going to install
my although a water cooling loop here in
the front of the case like I said
earlier I'm not concerned about hot air
heating up this case got way more than
enough airflow for this but once this is
in the front I'm then going to have the
fans on this side pushing air through
the radiator just kind of doing a little
test fit here to make sure everything
lines up good and it definitely appears
to be so yeah I guess all we got to do
is the fans on the red install one thing
to keep in mind though when you're using
a IO coolers especially when I'm out
into the front is you don't want the
tubes to accidentally push up into the
fans that are going to be exhausting air
so if I install this this way you can
see that we get the tubes that push up
towards the top so I would always give
the fans a little bit of a spin just to
see if they're going to interfere now
they're not so that's the way that I'm
going to go ahead and mount it down just
like that because I also don't want them
going the opposite direction and making
contact with the graphics card so there
we are plugged into our a i/o pump
header and the pump is now installed now
the last fan wait to plug in is the rear
exhaust fan fortunately the crosshair
six hero has a chassis fan header right
here on the motherboard nearest to that
fan so we're going to do is plug this in
and then we can just kind of get this
cable sort of up and out of the way I
like to just sort of tuck them between
the fan and the little cover right there
there it just sort of out of the way it
looks a lot neater and there you go
now it's time for everyone's favorite
part the installation of the graphics
card let's face it we love our computers
but it's the graphics card that really
gets us excited now to prepare for the
graphics card installation make sure the
little tab on the PCI Express slot
you're gonna be using is pushed down and
you remove the two IO covers on the back
that line up with the PCI Express slot
you're going to be using take your
graphics card remove the covers for the
display ports and make sure the cover is
taken off we're here where the pins are
go in at a slight angle and you're going
to be inserting
these two tabs into the metal slot right
there just like this and line it up with
the socket and push it until you get a
click now we have to take our two
retaining screws that we took off for
the covers tighten those up on the
graphics card and then that bad boy is
in place all we have left to do now is
install our power supply and do some
cable management now this particular
case has a bracket on the back that you
remove to attach your power supply to
makes it a lot easier that way and a
little bit more space to be able to push
the power supply in now we still have
all of our cables installed earlier from
when we did our test the only additional
power cable we have to plug in because
our fans are getting power through the
pump so we're good there our other fans
on our chassis are getting power from
the motherboard we just need the power
the two hard drives we have the S has
SSD and the hard drive
LS and as well as some integrated case
lighting that exists in this case which
is one SATA plug right here so all I did
was take one additional modular cable
out of the set which is perfect because
we've got three SATA plugs there two of
them are going right on top of each
other and the third one is in the same
region so that's one of the reasons why
I don't separate out hard drives and
SSDs if I don't have to because having
one cable installed definitely makes
things a lot tidier we've also got all
the built-in cable management right here
on the back of this case that's taking
care of all of the front panel
connectors so you can see cable
management on this it's going to look
pretty darn good so what we need to do
right now though if we're going to
orient in this particular case to fan
down we've got a lot of space right here
we've got some dust filter so we're not
going to be too worried about do we got
a dust filter right there so I'm not too
worried about dust in this particular
case even if it was on carpet now if
your case doesn't have one of these
brackets what I'm doing here you would
just do with the power supply already
installed on your case a lot of cases
are actually moving to this type of
mechanism now so there's our bracket
nice and install but before we go
pushing it inside the case we're going
to go ahead and plug in our static cable
that goes right here where it says SATA
you've got SATA and peripheral on this
particular power supply because the
peripheral is different for the the
molex plugs so we're just plug that into
SATA one and this is all the power
cables we're going to need
now there's one other cable in here that
we haven't installed yet moving forward
and that is our front panel HD audio
port that's what's going to allow you to
be able to use the front side headphone
jacks on your case
those are always located on the bottom
left of the motherboard and this is
something I you know admittedly should
have done earlier when the power supply
wasn't in there but I forgot it and you
can see now do as I say not as I do
because now you're getting to see
firsthand why I like to do this so
that's the plug we're trying to get into
right there it's dark dreary it's all by
itself
I don't even personally recommend using
frontside audio if you can avoid it but
you might as well if you have the option
all right there we go that's installed
and there was a good example as to why I
like to do all that before the graphics
card is in there so we're going to do
now is with the fan orienting down we're
going to force all of our cables through
the hole we're going to kind of pull it
out through the backside just like that
we've got our captive screws that are on
the bracket and that's what we're going
to use right there to tighten down our
power supply there's no reason to do
that yet we can kind of leave that loose
because next we have to plug everything
in and manage our cables now most case
companies now are including these
built-in cable management channels and
velcro straps I'm telling you that's a
huge lifesaver compared to what we used
to have to deal with back in the day
especially when they were just flat
panels so undo all of these and just
kind of start taking a look at where
things are so I'm going to go up that's
the grommet I'm going to use where my 24
pin is so we're just going to push that
guy through there so I'm not going to
connect it yet I'm just kind of putting
everything in place on where it needs to
go this is my VGA or my PCI Express
power we'll talk about that one in a
second this is my CPU power and we're
going to push this one up through this
hole back there because we know that's
where the power plug is for the CPU and
then we have here our SATA and I'll go
ahead and plug in our state of power now
because it's easy to access it's right
here when you plug in the SATA power
you're going to see there's a little
notch on one side this line line up with
the notch on the power supply side
and click it in be careful
any sort of lateral movement on that
will snap that right off I'm telling you
every anyone who's ever built a system
long enough or built enough systems has
probably dealt with that being snapped
off I'm going to now plug in this guy
onto my hard drive right there and then
I'm going to plug this little guy to a
pigtail end into my SSB then we can just
kind of take that push that sort of out
of the way look at that nice and neat
now power for our graphics card here
fortunately we've got these pass-through
grommets built in right here for our mid
plate so we can run the cables directly
up through that so it's a lot nicer and
neater looking to come up through the
mid plate if we have the opportunity to
then to come in through the backside
here or around this gap because it just
gets a little bit more difficult the
more turns you have in the cable the
less tidy things are going to look plug
that in give a little bend right there
and there as you can see now it just
goes right through the floor and that
looks a whole lot better so while we're
here we might as well go ahead and plug
in our power for our motherboard our 24
pin there we go that's nice and neat and
out of the way and I think that's all
the cables we have that need to come
through that side so now we can go ahead
and move around to the back and we can
tidy up these cables here for cable
management so we'll push that guy out of
the way that's the PCI Express and then
we can go ahead and this kind of push
all this back there now we've got to
plug in the SATA cables for our storage
drives and we get four of these included
with the crosshair six but if you look
at these two of them have a 90 Bend and
a 180 Bend or technically a straight
piece and two of them have straight
Sada's like that so we're not going to
use one with the bends because we don't
need them we only have two drives so
we're going to go ahead and click these
in place again just like the power cable
you're going to line up the little tab
normally the little metal push part will
go on top so we're just going to click
that in and then we're going to go ahead
and do the same thing on the bottom
you know that will satisfying click and
we're going to just route them through
right here because that's the grommet we
need to plug them into our motherboard
now using your users manual determine
which data ports are appropriate to plug
into for your particular type of hard
drive so we need to plug that in like
that stack those two on top of each
other so they're nice and neat we're
going to go ahead and plug in our CPU
power pins once again right here on the
motherboard push the slack up through
and now we can push our power supply all
the way forward and tighten down the
captive thumb screws now we're going to
do here is we're just going to take a
small zip tie we're going to kind of zip
all these guys together to make them
best friends for life to besties
they go to each other's houses on
Thanksgiving it's not weird take our
sides nipson cut those back and then we
don't really need to zip tie this guy
down right here I mean we could have we
have these loops here if you really
cared that you could have tightened it
down like that and just made it look all
super anal-retentive but I'm actually ok
with this so we have to do next I just
see if it works you think it's gonna
work yep you do what was we first tested
yeah it's true
see he's learning we know it's going to
work because we do the post test as long
as we didn't pinch any wires so for the
crosshair board we're going to navigate
to the Asus website I went to the
product page for the crosshair six hero
I'm going to go to the support driver
and tools I need to tell what OS I have
although it doesn't really matter
because we're going to be doing this at
the BIOS level anyway or the UEFI anyway
click on BIOS and then find whatever the
newest one is look at the date so this
one's only about a week old so we're
going to use this one right here this is
BIOS one one zero seven if you're
watching this in the future that might
have been updated by then it might even
be updated by the time this video makes
it live anyway you're going to download
it and you're going to export it on to
some sort of a flash drive so you're
going to download the archive to the
flash drive and you're going to extract
it to the root of the fresh flash drive
what that means is it's not going to be
in any folder system it's just you want
the cat file right here to be on the
main root of the drive now it's time to
turn it on I took the USB Drive plugged
it into the front USB
right there because we are going to
flash the BIOS make sure the power is
turned on on your power supply and then
push your power button on your case to
make sure that it actually works there
we go this is pretty pretty lights there
now again just like before it's not
going to take nearly as long to boot up
okay you're going to hit delete multiple
times once the monitor starts to turn on
so we can get into our BIOS and once
we're in our BIOS we're going to
navigate over to the tool tab and we're
going go down to the easy flash utility
again if you're not using this
motherboard you can have to look at the
manual to figure out how to do it for
yours if we were connected to the
internet we could grab it from the
internet but it's safer to do it from a
local storage if you can so we're going
to do this now using storage utility or
navigate over to the file this is the
one we downloaded right here the 11:07
and we're going to read that file yes
this is the really important part when
this is happening do not cut power to
your system under any circumstances that
will lead to a very bad situation
potentially a bricked motherboard now
the fusion we take about a minute or two
at the most it will do a series of
restarts let it do it staying until it's
completely done and once it is you'll be
running on the latest bios so here we
are in the BIOS and you can see it took
effect it's at 1 1 0 7 X 64 so our new
BIOS has taken place so we've done so
far effectively as we tested our parts
we built it and now we updated our BIOS
we have the latest compatibility with
Rison but now we need an operating
system without an operating system it's
completely useless so that's up to you
to decide what you're going to use but
for the sake of today's video we're
going to actually be using Windows 10
mostly because it's installable off of a
USB Drive and obviously we didn't
install any sort of optical in here so
we're going to do now is we're going to
remove our USB Drive that we had the
BIOS on and we're going to take the
Windows 10 key or drive and we're going
to plug that in to one of our USB 3
ports on the back of the system and that
we are going to just start it once again
it should automatically recognize that
is a Buddhist bootable ISO or image of a
Windows installation CD so all they
basically done is taken the CD put it on
a USB Drive and we're going to boot from
that now and do our installation now
there's really no reason to do a 32-bit
installation so always 264 where
applicable
and from here forward basically it's
nothing more than just answering the
questions on the screen once you're done
you'll land at the desktop where you
then are going to want to go ahead and
install all of your drivers that come
with your software you can install those
again if you don't have an optical drive
by just going to the manufacturers
website on another computer like we did
for the BIOS downloading the drivers in
installing them that way anyway guys I
hope this build guys has helped anyway
guys I hope that you hear that setre I
said it a lot I got stung by a DM I did
now most of the time windows is able to
install basic drivers like LAN drivers
wireless drivers or whatever may be
present on your motherboard but in case
it doesn't you can actually install the
drivers via USB the same way we did by
setting up the drive with our BIOS just
go over to the manufacturers website
take a USB Drive on another computer
install things like your LAN drivers and
your chipset drivers onto the USB Drive
and then just install them that way
using their own installers instead of
software but that's it it's really easy
it's not hard to build your own computer
especially Rison actually find Rison
systems or AMD based systems as general
to be easier than intel has are a lot
less fragile when it comes to the pins
on the motherboard but by now you guys
are ready to start playing your games
and enjoying your new computer and
looking at it and going you know what I
built that and I'm proud of it thanks
for watching guys again a huge thank you
to Asus for sponsoring this video
without them this would not have been
possible so make sure you guys go to the
links in the description of this video
and you guys will find links to the new
Claymore keyboard the Gladius 2 mouse
the 1070 and their whole lineup of
graphics cards as well as their
motherboards available for Rison and
Intel based systems so they've got you
covered on any type of computer you're
trying to build but that guys it's time
to go thanks for watching hopefully I
helped you build your first computer and
as always I will see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
