haven't done a video like this in about
six years where I'm gonna specifically
talk about power draw it's an argument
we've seen over and over and over
get blah blah blah company because yadda
yadda company is gonna cost you more in
the long run in terms of power
consumption we're gonna talk today
specifically about various graphics
cards and CPUs especially with the way
the CPU market is heating up no pun
intended actually things are kind of
getting cooler as all these four AMD
Intel is gonna get hot but that's
pathetic
we're going to talk about how much money
it may cost you to get one brand over
the other and whether or not that should
even be a factor in your buying
decisions I wasn't buying purchases you
usually purchase your bias
with its aluminum bezel solid
construction and adjustable base the
vast 35 inch ultra wide 100 Hertz VA
panel from mass drop offers performance
at an affordable price learn more about
this drop by following the link in the
description below okay so here's what
we're gonna do if there's a there's a
lot of different ways that you can do
this and the unfortunate thing about
this test verse is the one I did six
years ago was the fact that we had a lot
more simple product stack verses today
for instance when I did this last time I
believe I was running a z77 3,700 K
which IV bridge as you know was kind of
like the top dog and then you had your
i7s which worth hyper-threading you had
your I fives which were not high threes
which were not a couple SKUs of each and
then we had FX which was four core six
core a core no SMT no hyper threading
very basic very easy to compare the
problem now is the on the safety side of
things the battle heating up ever since
verizon launched with the 1800 X and
down the competition has just been
getting fierce with more SKUs filling in
the gaps filling in the price gaps the
performance gaps Intel doing the same
thing until actually having annual
launches once again once again some of
them being less than a year apart has
created some serious confusion in the
marketplace in terms of what the direct
comparisons should be it's something we
struggled with as we've done CPU
comparisons as we've done gaming
comparisons it's we coming to the point
to where we don't know exactly where to
line them up do we do it core four core
because when we do that we have the CPUs
might do this but the pricing structure
more or less does that so it becomes
very difficult to compare so that is why
for the sake of this video we are kind
of doing core four core because that's
the best way that we can determine what
a apples to apples comparison would be
in terms of power draw eight core 16
thread Rison 2,700 X versus a ninety
nine hundred K which is also eight core
16 thread albeit might add much faster
clock and turbo clock for GPU on the
other hand it's a it's a little bit
easier to sort of line those up because
the right
Radeon 7 which is the the best card that
you can get right now from AMD
for mainstream and even productivity you
know being at this is the top price
point the problem is the top price point
for AMD does not meet the top price
point for Nvidia that's lots more or
less against the 2080 whereas the 20
atti costs approximately $400 more and
then obviously gives you you know more
performance that goes along with that so
even though I have a 20 atti sitting on
the table we are going to use 20 80
versus our Radeon 7 and then a 22 Ti for
shits and giggles and then I already
explained to you how we're gonna do the
cpu we're not talking about thread
Ripper we're not talking about X 299 or
any of those because what I just
explained in terms of how difficult it
is to match everything up wasn't even
including the extreme platform the nice
thing about AMD moving forward with
Rison 3 or resin to 3000 series is the
fact that there are more SKUs available
for mainstream meaning you're not having
to then take into account the cost of
motherboards and extra Ram channels and
all that sort of stuff
so here's what you need to figure out is
before you getting determine how much
somebody's gonna cost you to run you
need to know how much power it uses and
how much you're using it so for instance
I reached out on Twitter because I
thought man I've got about five hundred
twenty thousand followers there that's a
huge data set if even a fraction of
those people responds so I put out a
tweet saying hey guys on average how
much do you gain per day how many hours
as expected it was a pretty wide range
but I saw a lot of I don't game at all
anymore I'm too busy which unfortunately
doesn't really help but they don't know
the purpose of this video so that was
still a fair answer to some people
gaming more than 10 hours per day which
definitely could rack up the amount of
costs in terms of you know wattage
pricing and that sort of stuff so this
is gonna be an interesting data set what
I found was the median tend to be
between 3 to 4 hours so for the sake of
calculations today we're using three and
a half hours of gaming time for our
tests the other thing that gets a little
bit convoluted here is trying to
determine CPU power draw because of its
constant fluctuating load when the GPU
kind of tends to do nothing and unless
you're gaming so GPU is a lot easier to
calculate so that's why we're gonna go
ahead and start there now using ji guru
3d we I am going to
our link to our sources as well as you
know putting on-screen their charge and
stuff so you can see these are this is
datasets that we've been getting from
the internet we've looked at a bunch of
different sources and not just our own
because we want to see kind of what the
median is that way we're not just going
off one data set not to mention guru 3d
puts a list of their specs for the
system these the same system on
everything so it keeps it very
consistent so for graphics and with them
being guru 3d I mean kind of makes sense
right that they would have graphics
charts the Radeon seven at three and a
half hours per day using an average of
fifteen cents per kilowatt-hour and yeah
some of you might look at that and go
wow that's expensive if you live here in
Southern California in the summer time
you could go wow I wish I was only
paying fifteen cents per kilowatt-hour
so once again we had to kind of find a
middle ground to call you know fair so
at three and a half hours per day the
Radeon seven is gonna cost you
approximately four dollars and seventy
eight cents per month to run or fifty
seven dollars and thirty four cents per
year compared to a twenty eighty it's
gonna cost you three dollars and sixty
eight cents per month to run and forty
four dollars and ten cents per year or a
difference of $13.24 per year that's
kind of a wash if you think about it
because the Radeon seven although the
HBM two and the Vega architecture and
and all that stuff has been known to be
a bit power-hungry because it uses a lot
of has a lot of heat needs a lot of
cooling and that heats generated
obviously by power draw one of the
things I like to do though when it comes
to cost calculations is kind of average
them over five years because I find that
five years is kind of the the timeframe
when a lot of people will upgrade their
systems yes I know many of you are
running much older systems than that and
the SR people out there that you annual
upgrade so they don't care about the
power cost because they're never gonna
make it back anyway so at $13 times five
years obviously you're talking about
sixty five dollars in cost difference
between the Radeon 7 versus the 28 II
know if you spent that extra sixty five
dollars on a graphics card guess what
you wouldn't have gotten anywhere higher
than a 28 II because the next bump up is
$400 so at this point that's why we're
saying it's kind of a wash it makes no
difference because directly comparable
in price very comparable and performance
in over five years at a $65 power
difference
I still would call that one pretty name
close what about CPUs well the CPUs this
is interesting
Amy's always been known as the space
heater if you're cold in the wintertime
get yourself an AMD CPU to keep you nice
and toasty that's always been the joke
right the AMD heater
well the 99 hundred K we had a hard time
finding a lot of I guess comparable data
sets when it comes to load and all that
sort of stuff because we found a very
wide range of testing in terms of power
draw some people were normalizing by
removing idle wattage and giving us just
load wattage some people were measuring
from the wall some people were
overclocking so what we found here was
we're using techspot here and their
particular charts for blender and you
are blender gooseberry and handbrake
so obviously CPU transcoding and
handbrake and then CPU rendering in
blender blender does use GPU as well but
obviously they're doing CPU tests so the
99 hundred K in handbrake pulled 255
watts system wattage as total system
wattage porn input out there three and a
half hours a day would cost you four
dollars and seven cents a month or 48
dollars and ninety cents per year to run
the 2700 X ironically considerably less
power draw is pulling 209 watts from the
wall for this whole total system or
three dollars and 34 cents a month
$40.00 eight cents a year or a
difference of seven dollars and some
change on math per year now here's the
important part the CPUs are not
comparable in terms of pricing like it
was with the GPU the 2700 X and yes I
know this sounds like an EMV sponsored
product video it's not this is JP J
sponsored this is my stuff we're talking
about this because this is an argument
that I'm tired of seeing people say
without any sort of experience in the
subject matter that cost to run the
system can make a break the difference
in terms of where the value is because
as you can see a difference of seven
dollars and some change per year between
a 2700 X and N and ahead okay does not
make up for the 40% extra cost of a 1920
700 X
this is all I'm doing there this is the
point in today's videos to get you
thinking this way there are certain
things that are okay to consider there
are certain things that are not okay to
consider when it comes to the true value
of a product had these been the same
price even the value would still
technically be with the 2700 X if you're
using that argument but we all know the
9900 K is approximately 10 to 15% faster
depending on the workload in fact in
Cinebench it was a 2038 score versus an
1808 or approximately 12.7% difference
so as you can see right here if you kept
both systems for five years at $7 a year
difference we're talking a difference of
$35 if power cost of AMD or Intel Wow
see see how ingrained we were to believe
AMD's faster in it and I just did that
myself because that was the case it used
to be the case IPC was terrible power
draw was terrible and FX that all
changed with rise n now the other thing
I want to talk about here is that's kind
of not a fair test what I mean by that
is most people are not running their
CPUs at a hundred percent load for three
and a half hours a day because we've
shown on this channel many times gaming
load on CPU and less bottleneck is not a
hundred percent it tends to sit around
forty to sixty percent depending on the
game games that are very GPU bound are
gonna be a lot less intrusive on the CPU
load which means even lower low loads on
the CPU which means an even narrower gap
when it comes to power draws so that's
good news for Intel not so much for AMD
but at the end of the day we still have
a 40% cost difference between the two
the point of this conversation is to
tell you that because you're not at 100%
load it doesn't matter what the power
draw on CPU is gonna be unless we're
comparing something like an i3 to a w31
75 X which obviously would not be a very
fair comparison because we'd be talking
more than a thousand Watts on the CPU
versus like 50 Watts on an i3 so at the
end of the day if you keep your system
for five years
usually the cost savings is not enough
to even bump you up into the next tier
that's been the case as long as we've
had this
battle going on but that's all getting
ready to change because one of the
things we're still waiting to see what
Zen - or technically third-gen risin I
guess I don't know however you want to
call it is improved power drum improved
IPC improved power draw and a lot of
that comes from the fact that it's
running on seven nanometer process and
not 14 + + benefit like Intel still is
even when Intel gets its 10 nanometer
going on desktop we could still see a
better power draw coming from AMD versus
Intel the smaller the process the less
power draw which is something that is
you know kind of been Murphy's Law and
all that stuff for a long time I say
Murphy's Law is that that's not Murphy's
Law huh
Moore's Law I don't start with them but
J what's the whole point of this video
the point of this video is just to say
why what works for you seriously the
most ignorant comment a person can make
is the power draw argument it means no
one's anyone that says that it means
they haven't done the math it means they
haven't actually sat down and thought
about it
so honestly guys at the end of the day
we have to wait and see what's gonna
happen with the next architecture from
AMD if we see these IPC's come up and on
seven nanometer it's matching and
exceeding possibly the nine ninety nine
hundred K is just arbitrarily throwing
it out there the value is already with
AMD in terms of price of the CPU it's
already there in terms of power draw and
you know what are you willing to pay
forty percent more for ten to fifteen
percent more performance plenty of
people do there's nothing wrong with it
it's your choice and that's the whole
point in today's video ignore the power
draw conversation and go right with the
performance conversation and get where
the performance and the dollar amount
makes sense for your wallet alright guys
this is just one of those topics that
it's I'd to do a talking head on because
of the amount of comments I've seen over
the brutal battle that is taking place
amongst the fanboys regarding AMD and
Intel rightfully so I mean it's it's
okay to like what you like but I think
what's happened here is AMD has been the
underdog for so long and they're getting
ready to possibly be top dog I think a
lot of people just can't help the smack
talk makes things kind of interesting I
guess you guys can sound off down below
have all the fights you want I guess
you're going to regardless of what I say
so yeah thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
