here and today we're going to bring you
another video about a graphics card if
finally gotten my hands on EVGA GeForce
GTX 980 SC a CX 2.0 graphics card
underneath oxygen to get through this
video as you guys know back on September
18th Nvidia launched its next-gen
graphics card on the maxwell platform
with the 980 and a 970 now we've already
take a look at the 970 and as you guys
know i'm really fond of EVGA and it's
taken a while to get this card in my
hand but we are taking a look at the a
CX 2.0 version of the GTX 980 now this
is EVGA is custom cooler and obviously
as the name would pretty much indicate
it is version 2.0 of their original ACX
cooler right here now without putting
you guys to sleep I'm not going to bore
you when it comes to a lot of the specs
on this in fact it does feature a
thirteen hundred and 80 megahertz boost
clock in fact in my testing that I have
already performed on this card I was
able to actually reach fourteen hundred
and ninety-four megahertz that's pretty
good
couldn't jump into the into the deep
1500 megahertz range like I was hoping
but still you can't really complain
about being just under 1500 megahertz
now for IO it has one DVI port three
DisplayPort and one HDMI I would have
liked to have seen another DVI but hey I
guess everything starting to move
towards DisplayPort especially with 4k
becoming so much more affordable now one
thing I want to focus on in this video
today is a little bit more about the
cooler itself because that's really what
the star of the show is today we'll talk
about benchmark numbers but we'll put
those up a little bit later now as you
guys may notice the fans clearly look a
little bit different in fact at first
glance you might think that it was
actually pulling air through the card
and exhausting it out the fan but that's
not the case in fact EVGA has decided to
give something a shot here by having
backwards spinning fans and it's
actually going to be more or less
spreading the air out and pushing it you
using the smooth edge of the fan blade
rather than the blade edge of the fan
blade to kind of give it a bit a little
bit better noise signature a little bit
less noise volume and hopefully decent
cooling now when it comes to the heat
pipes and stuff it pretty much features
the exact same thing as the a CX 1.0 but
it does also have a little bit beefier
block that is actually a heatsink on top
of the heat pipes where it goes from
each side of the bait of the heatsink
there in fact on this one if you look
inside will show close up there is no
heatsink on that bridge of heat pipe if
you will now one thing I am disappointed
to see is that they did not include a
backplate now I did inquire about this
with them for this review they did say
that back plates will be available later
but as a separate add-on or separate
purchase that you could install onto
your card they did that with the 600
series in the six 80s and six 70s if you
recall but I I don't really like that
idea because one it means the user then
has to take off the screws and install
it themselves and a lot of people may
not be comfortable with that and -
there's a lot of other brands that are
already including them with their cards
which is a decent selling point it's a
lot nicer and more attractive to look at
a backplate than it is to look at a bare
PCB and not only that the bare PCB tends
to be a pretty because of the rough
texture tends to be a pretty decent dust
magnet where back plates are a lot safer
to wipe with you know an electrostatic
brush or you know electronics brush so I
don't know I'm I wish there was a back
plate on this but you know what can you
do now the a CX 2.0 also features LED
lighting which the ACS 1.0 did not and
it does work with all of your geforce
experience LED controls and it's
actually pretty nice to be able to go in
here and adjust the brightness and
whatnot it would have been awesome if it
was RGB and maybe they could have
included that with their own precision
tuning software but maybe in the future
RGB is kind of the thing now with all
the different builds and RGB keyboards
that would have been a nice feature to
see so hopefully in the future we'll see
something like that I mean even the
little SC logo here on the back lights
up which is really cool so guys let's go
ahead and get this inside and let's see
how the performance numbers actually are
all right so as you guys can see I went
ahead and included a few extra titles I
asked you guys in my skunkworks video
the 3-way performance video what titles
you guys wanted to see me do benchmarks
on and you guys overwhelmingly said
shadow of Mordor so I went ahead and did
that and a huge thanks to Ryan Valley on
Twitter for providing me with that key
huge thank you buddy I was able to
include that in this video because of
that key now I just want to comment real
quick on shadow of Mordor I did not a
couple of things actually I did not use
the HD texture pack because one I want
to do a separate video on the HD texture
pack and sort of round up a few cards
and see how it's kind of hammering those
cards when it comes to VRAM so I didn't
want to just do the nine ATAC X 2.0
performance on it I will include the 982
a CX 2.0 in that video so don't worry we
will circle back to that now this card
has absolutely overkill for 1080p like
Beyond overkill it's not meant for 1080p
it's it's designed to be a little bit
more future-proof when it comes to 4k
becoming more mainstream and affordable
don't want to go ahead and talk about
DSR for a second here now I did turn it
on I did try it in a few games but you
know I wanted to go ahead and do
performance on native resolution I'm
looking at buying a new panel in the
future perhaps a 4k panel just for
benchmarking
and you know I saw some benefit to it
some things looked really really clear
obviously performance was hit hard when
you trick the system into thinking you
have a 4k panel going in fact I don't
know maybe the performance was right
where it would have been with 4k but I
noticed a little bit of glitchyness in
there at least in my setup now I did run
MSAA at max on all of these the new the
new MFA a is not really ready yet when
it comes to the 980 in fact the 970 is
also not ready at the future update
coming to Maxwell cards so what do you
guys think about this card
the a CX 2.0 fantastic cooler it
actually works really really well
temperatures never exceeded 67 degrees
Celsius while overclocked in a room
right now that's sitting at about 80
degrees so it was actually pretty
impressive when it came to keeping
temperatures nice and low so guys this
has been the EVGA GTX 980 SC a CX 2.0 I
think card manufacturers are starting to
want to see who has the longest name at
least it starting to feel that way but
anyway that reverse pretty much is just
a backwards fan seems to work pretty
well and the noise signature of the card
is way different than the a CX 1.0 and
it's actually a lot easier on the ears
it's a lot less choppy sounding and it's
much more smoother more of a kind of a
mellow whirring if you will in fact I
didn't find it at truth intrusive or
obnoxious to listen to whatsoever in
fact I did include ramping up the fan
profile to where the fan would go up to
40 percent in fact on all of these tests
overclocked 68 degrees Celsius ish right
around there bounced around a little bit
between 67 and 68 was all at 40% fan
speed we've reached the point here guys
where you reach your max overclocks on
your card well before you hit your
thermal limit and that's a big deal guys
has been Jays two cents following
Twitter if you have any questions hope
you get my hand on a few more of these
if you guys know what I mean anyways see
on that social media guys and as always
I will see you in the next one oh and
don't forget to subscribe this is a
verse
the one you've ever seen that me that
would be awesome to see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
