decided I don't want one just one
monitor anymore
mostly because the other office I had
was too small and m2 room for all of
them
now I've got more desk base and I let's
do it because everything is down in the
shop so I'm bringing more monitors up
here as you can see because we need
cleaning on the show that your job I'm
going to use my air gotek widescreen
gaming forum edition I have to clean it
up with a little does he's been in a
garage we're going to use that up here
but the problem is I'm not be able to
fit my 24-inch panels here with skunk
works here so I've gotta scoot this down
farther but I'm worried that once I do
that I'm not going to have long enough
cables to reach from there to there I
have 10-foot DisplayPort cables but to
route them neatly enough I'm not so sure
ten-foot long enough mmm seat my
paycheck the past week come oh I'm sure
God I'm gonna go ahead and need you to
come in on Sunday to put in a theater
but bang I didn't get beat it he's
thinking well yeah I do that sometimes
he does a lot that's 34 predator I wish
I have 2 of these because he's kind of
frustrated before this I'm always
frustrated I just like to put my good
foot forward
suiting match it's tough what you're
doing ratchet stuff now let's go back
under the desk open three thoughts to it
there's a couple dirty thoughts going
through my head right now
check out these pipe ending skills
he sent me to go get tools like I know
where they are
gosh I need the slope girls just came to
get some tools top left you lying he's
lying
hell yeah I have the camera buckle thing
down here cuz I need a spring angel face
and my you set top right found it yep
jobs done let's go
this must be what it's like to be a
pincher bug you like hugging arms or the
cloth can't get a date get these huggy
arms hungry nah want coffee that's
probably why I'm like there oh I had an
energy drink this morning oh do I got
you up huh that's all the way you got up
this guy that's spring-loaded it just
wants to be hugged
dangerously it can hold out here I can
see it already
we probably find that eventually I step
on it you still believe that George are
being put everything emotion look they
go back in time and kill ja ja what
happens then everyone Cheers
what kinda will be you think monitor
number two come on down with number
three well Oh
number three whatever additional monitor
number two yeah I can't fathom three
predators
jeez all I can put it on bird flight
over there
I like recess it into the wall
see now you're having fun because if
farty wait where's your trash get in
here up there I got the bag
dang family science I know I know don't
get any bright idea funky party sure
which is Phoenix remember no work or
anything I like it really no for real
like but the bevels is kind of
frustrated with those but I would just
tuck those behind that big monitor cuz
he did kids I need them to be touching
that monitor by the wall okay
yeah when you have that much it's that
wide and is that weight hanging out off
the center point it gets really wobbly
so I mean I have it the wall itself is
kind of giving it some support to but if
I don't have these touching the center
panel then they wobble up okay joshan
the photo desktops will look sweet I can
see it already like one sides gonna be
like the front end of nizzy or the
middles could be front end and then like
you're gonna have different glamour
shots on the other two monitor like this
curve right here it's not like centered
on that corner so likewise it when the
curve is the launcher is really facing
that way put the big Mart is slightly
curved T right yeah but it's not that
it's think if I go exactly where the
middle of that trip that point is he
comes up like here so if you're trying
to set your body like that so that would
be against the wall not and there's a
little bit of wobble see it's not
touching the wall up there mmm my
dilemma because if I have them touching
the wall today over there on the same
like angle is the table opposite because
yeah unless I think this one like
oh the wall like a wobble this you
mm-hmm I mean I dealt with the wobble
before you know I'm just happy that the
arm will go all the way to where the
graphics cards are so they I can run
them along the back and not to worry
about going having enough to go around
down bag and I got you I got you
point that I am i oh it's uh Wow yeah
when you focus dude it's like sometimes
things get whatever right along here
when those times I wish I had just a two
foot cord just has to go from there to
there I might have one at home but
that's what this both is that
DisplayPort yeah yeah I won't have that
yeah I use big boy cables not HD nice
you don't probably a lot of on
Twitter for that again well a lot of
people still thinking your user on 720
well cuz they don't look Dave of
anything yeah they did it's been forever
you able to spine it up keep bringing it
up to stop it's okay I get my shits and
you'll when you get Jay Z comments get
him every day today so yelling me like I
cheat on me out there yo this was a
reality show like he'd have more
commercial breaks in actual show because
as always as dramatic means sometimes
you get a coconut camera sometimes it I
think I need to be invisible so I think
it's like filming silently so I could
get you don't want to comb things I say
nope no okay so it's thinner so it's
gonna seem longer good time yeah I'm
serious I'm sticking with you
what oh yeah you're doing that's
probably a good thing because you're
pretty on edge right now I'm on edge yes
oh yes you are he totes are never seen
on edge sorter like every other minute I
hear that I think I know that
something's gonna go down might be from
yeah look at that look at that was easy
button for you
it has keys up on Days I'll probably die
after this see it's not long enough to
reach over here and still make it over
there I guess but that up here huh you
fine don't worry about it like me he's
every little thing it's gonna be alright
mmm-hmm we have a power the personal
 under the desk transference maybe
it's a good thing I'm here for you one
I'm not I'm like a safety in case you
need something stupid like what could I
possibly do that is stupid
umm I don't want to bring it up now it's
probably gonna make a day of it I'm
talking about what we're going to do
yeah
I'm like the friend who's always
concerned about safety yeah oh my gosh
here we go trying to get the power cable
over here
so you end up like me which was most
beautiful yeah this guy's still like a
danger to self always reading myself
remember kids in a knot it won't ever
come apart I feel like you need a helmet
when you do stuff like this I know right
where am I here they like maybe even
your bicycle helmet would be safe yeah
you follow my eye oh my gosh do you want
me to go grab your safety glasses too no
you sure
wait you're still true enough Filipinas
to be just like his pre-fight his
pre-flight check check I have no my sake
okay when you get control with your mind
control it with my fourth Wittig awry
but it's not a stroke and some serious
up hey we have matching keywords now you
ever k70 yeah oh yeah you off
yeah bottom for Christmas well I cheated
myself give that monitor over there I
didn't turn on you push the power button
look at that
that claw grip good ad si prego
that's not right no big screens one but
it said ones a loop should probably just
that I start getting a line up as best I
can so that when I drag the mouse over
it isn't like skip they only jumped up a
little bit
touchin it looks like there's three
worlds but this is the easier now it's
wrong what I want to do screen capture
and stuff now can capture 1080p screens
that's a lot more that's a lot easier to
capture than say 34 40 or qHD yeah I
think you should do like a 10 things I
hate about my setup a little coffee you
will pick me this let's go get coffee
this polish didn't go in the vlog okay
we're out of here just goodbye soon
