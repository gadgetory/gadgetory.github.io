it needs your help you guys have already
seen the xpg RAM modules that come in
kind of the titanium color and the gold
color while they're playing around with
bringing out some new colors and
unfortunately it's too expensive to come
out with all of these colors so they
want me to ask you my fans what colors
you guys would like to see my personal
opinion on this would be i'd like to see
maybe the red for the AMD fan builds the
green for the nvidia fan builds and
maybe a white for those white belts but
they really want to know what you guys
think what colors would you like to see
added to the line-up if you could choose
any of your top three make sure you put
it down the description or down in the
comments i guarantee they're going to be
looking at this because they really want
to know you guys the enthusiast what it
is you'd like to see with the x PG ram
modules in the heatsinks when it comes
to colors guys Jase two cents here at
CES 2014 82 reaching out to you for what
