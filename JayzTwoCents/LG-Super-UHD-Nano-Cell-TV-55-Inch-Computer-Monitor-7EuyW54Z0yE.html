and two years ago I took a look at the
LG EEG 9600 curved OLED TV man has it
really been that long
and last year I checked out the LG b 6p
oled TV and in both those videos I
talked about some of the most impressive
features that stood out to me the OLED
technology it's pure black levels active
HDR color accuracy size thinness the
mounting options sound quality their
built-in webOS set-up guide blah blah
blah blah blah but there's obviously one
thing missing
and trust me when I say you guys work
really quick to point it out but what
about gaming so that's why LG and I
teamed up again to bring you a video
about LG's new nano sail technology
found in the 55 SJ 85 they supplied the
TV and I'm supplying the opinion now one
of the main reasons I never mentioned
gaming in the previous TV reviews was
because honestly in my opinion that's
not what they were designed for TVs have
always made terrible computer monitors
and I never missed an opportunity to
tease certain friends of mine who
insisted on using TVs as monitors right
Jerry it's not the size that matters if
it simply can't perform just ask my wife
how I ever made two kids is beyond me
but I digress but all that's besides the
point because the problem with TVs has
always been input lag TVs are not
designed with input lag or gaming in
mind although 1080p panels were okay the
introduction of 4k TVs over the past
couple of years have proven that TVs
make absolutely terrible monitors in
fact even some 4k monitors make terrible
monitors and their high input lag are
now even being noticed by console gamers
since consoles now pretty much support
4k sort of via modern ap use now of
course this is all subjective and I
myself am sensitive to input lag I
notice it and trust me that sucks
because I wish I could simply be normal
and not notice even the smallest amounts
of input lag but I can't and that's why
I'm excited to test LG's claims about
the Nano Cell TV being a worthy choice
for gamers or people who like large form
factor PC monitors now just to recap in
case you're new to monitor and panel
technology input lag is the amount of
time it takes for the user to supply an
input or in this case a mouse click or a
keyboard press and for that action to
actually display on the screen obviously
this is important
reaction based games usually things like
first-person shooters but MOBAs mmo's or
any game where a fraction of a second
matters so will input lag in fact if you
want to experience this yourself hook
your pc up to a TV any TV and try using
it as a monitor wiggle the mouse and
you'll see exactly what I mean there's
like a delay between when you do it and
when it actually shows up now we're
gonna come back to gaming in a second
but let me first explain what the
nanotechnology actually is conventional
TVs use what's called a quantum dot
sheet placed between the lighting source
and the LCD or the LCD cell designs to
enhance colors but what LG has done is
placed their nanotechnology right on the
LCD itself which greatly improves things
like color accuracy picture quality and
of course viewing angles in fact LG
wanted to test his technology so what
they came up with was a contest between
two pro soccer players or football
depending on where you live kind of did
aluminium aluminium thing why do we call
it soccer anyway now by having them each
take shots at two separate panels or 18
panel screens each displaying a score
ranging from negative 9 to 9 now one of
those scoreboards use the conventional
LCD technology where the other board was
of course using the new nano cell TVs
they each took turns shooting at the
scoreboards from a sixty degree off
angle axis trying to rack up as many
points as possible before the time runs
out then what they did was they actually
switched hot sides perform the same test
again and then compared the results what
this demonstrated was not only their
freakishly amazing humanly accurate
capability of kicking a ball but also
the amazing off viewing capability of
the Nano cell TV's themselves because
what they found was only one of the
scoreboards favored great scores and
that's because the fine contrast in
colors made the minus symbols nearly
impossible to see on conventional LCD
displays so yeah I needless to say the
viewing angles are pretty awesome but
when it comes to color I actually had a
hard time telling the difference between
the nano cell LCD and the OLED panels
that I'm currently using at home which
was really a pleasant surprise the only
thing that was really different was the
black levels but the colors are
definitely amazing regarding black
levels it's important to remember that
this is still an LCD TV which means it
is of course being backlit so getting
the deep blacks found on OLED is simply
not possible but it's still pretty
decent
seems pretty consistent however there
are some reports out there of it being
sort of blotchy when it comes to black
uniformity but so far uniformity on this
unit seems pretty decent especially when
it comes to the graze the screen is semi
glossy so there's gonna be some levels
of reflection in rooms with lots of
natural light however it's not as bad as
OLED TVs back at home because those guys
are really glossy in fact you can see
some of the reflections right here but
when you actually have a picture going
it's not too bad one of the things I've
always loved about the new LG TVs is
their remote control and that's for
someone who hates using remote control I
mean I cannot describe to you how much I
hate remote controls I mean looking for
the right button at night especially if
it's not backlit it's really hard it
makes me angry and then I break them
because I throw them but LG's remote can
actually be used as a pointer making it
sort of work like a Wii Remote which I
find to be way more intuitive than using
something like tiny little keys and
trying to type now just like the other
LG TVs we took a look at the setup was
extremely easy with their guided setup
wizard' LG's webOS is pretty awesome
that hasn't changed but things like
content consumption are actually pretty
cool with built-in apps like Hulu
Netflix whether Google Play and of
course YouTube now the 55 inch weighs in
at only 40 pounds without the stand and
it stands only 3 pounds with a stand
it's 43 pounds but it has a traditional
base amount which means you no longer
need to use a proprietary wall mount
adapter like I had to do with my eg 9600
that was extra cost which was
unfortunate but even the beasts XP also
featured a standard base amount as well
so it's nice to see them kind of
continuing that trend but it measures
about 2.5 inches wide at its thickest
point near the base which means it's not
the thinnest TV on the market but still
pretty thin especially when wall
mounting alright so now it's time to
talk about gaming and I'm dead serious
when I say that you will have a hard
time finding someone who hates using or
gaming on a TV when hooked up to a PC
more than me
but trust me when I say that that past
month that we've been using this and
testing this out here in the office
testing its performance it's been pretty
damn good I mean sure it's not perfect
after all it's still not a gaming
monitor it has a 60 Hertz refresh rate
when plugged into a PC but the input lag
is greatly reduced when the TV is switch
to game or PC mode will call it PC mode
in fact when game mode is enabled it
even
flashed his black for a moment while it
performs whatever witchcraft is
performing may be honest I don't even
care what it does or how it does it or
even how it achieves it just the fact
that it's doing it not only is the input
lag about 15 milliseconds when in game
mode and trust me that's low compared to
some TVs which are almost a hundred
milliseconds but it also has four four
four color 8-bit so at the end of the
day you would get a game mode with low
input lag amazing viewing angles 444
8-bit color and HDR
which actually makes this a pretty
usable PC monitor and while preparing
for this video we actually used a
conventional LCD TV for a little while
and I just couldn't do it I couldn't do
it wiggling the mouse and stuff movement
was nearly impossible typing was
terrible so it's pretty exciting to see
this because it means that gamers are
finally being considered when things
like this are being developed but you
want to know what the best part is it's
not just the features that I mentioned
it's not the fact that it's a super UHD
4k nano cell tech it's not the reduction
in input lag heck it's not even the
amazing viewing angles or the color or
the accuracy or the blacks it's the fact
that right now at the time of making
this video you get everything that I
mentioned for about $1,000
now go price up a dedicated 4k gaming
monitor with all the viewing angles I
just mentioned the color capability and
compare the price I'm sure it doesn't
have something like g-sync or free sync
but at this price point you're not gonna
find someone like me complaining but
then there's the other side of the coin
right for folks who like a lot of screen
real estate a big panel isn't exactly
what you want I mean you can get a lot
of real estate by just going with like a
big 1080p screen but the larger pixels
just make everything's blown up so you
get a big screen but then you get
everything on the screen being really
big which doesn't mean real estate but a
55 inch 4k panel gives you essentially a
4 by 4 grid of 24 inch 1080p panels
without giving up pixel density which is
really useful when it comes to things
like productivity which brings us back
around to the input lag again because we
actually tried that set up with a
regular 4k LCD panel and the input lag
the mouse movement and typing just made
it a terrible experience but now that
the Nano Cell TV was actually pretty
good anyway guys it's time to get going
thanks for watching today's video be
sure to tell me what you thought of the
Nano cell tech now someone who's pretty
passionate about TV technology I'm happy
to see the direction that companies
like LG are taking the industry 4k
monitors to me just don't make sense
especially when they are usually right
around the 28 to 30 inch range but if
you bump that resolution up to 55 inch
form factor with all of the features you
get with the 55 SJ 85 then it all starts
to make sense well all that said guys
it's time to go again a huge thank you
to LG for sending us out this TV to take
a look at if you guys think there's
anything else we should cover in the
future regarding TV tech for the use of
pcs then make sure you guys let me know
down the comments below there's a lot of
ways you could take a video like this so
it's hard to kind of get everything in
there but like I said I love TV tech but
in a cinema environment watching movies
and things but I hate using them on
computers pleasantly surprised it the
way this one turned out anyway guys time
to go thanks for watching and as always
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
