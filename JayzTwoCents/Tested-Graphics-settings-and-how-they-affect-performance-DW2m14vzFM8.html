send a little nasally it's not my
typical whining self I actually have I'm
getting over a bit of a cold
when Jerry came down and visited me he
he left a present behind then we got it
so with that said we're gonna get
through this as best we can but you guys
know I like to take topics straight from
the audience and I got this random tweet
the other day from tectonic 15 on
Twitter he says hey Jay could you make a
video about how to configure game
settings and also maybe explain what
some are explaining what some of the
terminologies thanks.you
few typos in there but I didn't want to
you know I knew I didn't want a
paraphrase but I think that's a great
idea because you can often increase your
gameplay experience by just decreasing
or manipulating some of the settings
we're gonna go through a couple of games
we're talking about the game settings on
a high level what they do and then how
you can actually get better FPS and
which settings are kind of not important
and which ones really tax your graphics
card so let's do it
[Laughter]
ms:i brings ultra-thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz 1080p
panel nvidia graphics and 8th gen intel
cpus make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more and how to preorder by
following the link in the description
below alright so I'm gonna use rise of
the Tomb Raider here to just sort of
demonstrate some of the general settings
you'll find in most games and then we'll
kind of talk about some other things as
we move forward each game is gonna kind
of have its own list of settings and
that's obviously based on the developers
and a lot of those settings are going to
be specific to the games but there are
quite a few settings that are also
applicable to all games because it is
general type of technology that you can
kind of manipulate to give yourself a
better gaming experience get better FPS
without having to have an image that
looks like crap I'm also using a gtx
1066 gigabyte because i feel like that's
a graphics card that's going to really
more accurately represent kind of the
mid-range of what people are using out
in the real world I'm also using 1080p
for this because it's gonna have a
better impact and showing you what
happens with anti-aliasing we're gonna
spend the time on things that are pretty
much applicable to all games like for
instance anti-aliasing all of your
objects on the screen are being drawn by
millions of different triangles the
problem is no matter how many of those
you make or how much you try and smooth
the edges you always have what's called
stair casing which is where they look
kind of jagged it's like trying to make
a round object in Minecraft so you have
to rely on anti-aliasing to make that
round object look round now there's
different types of anti-aliasing
technology is there's post-processing
and then there's super sampling so right
now with our post process are our
anti-aliasing off you can see we're
getting 157 FPS in this screen and
that's one of the reasons why I'm using
rise of the Tomb Raider because you can
actually see the changes happen in real
time without having to restart the game
and you can get a better sense of what's
actually happening on the screen so
we're getting 150 758 FPS with
anti-aliasing off if I turn it on and
hit apply you can see it dropped down a
little bit down to about a 151 now FXAA
is just applying a slight blur to the
image overall it's not actually actively
processing anything it's just sort of
tricking you into thinking it looks
smoother the problem is the image
overall also looks a little bit blurrier
as well now we have s/m
which is a much newer type of
post-processing a that we've seen over
the last several years where it's
basically just a more enhanced fxaa
it's not a huge impact of performance
you can see the SMA a obviously gave us
a bit more of an impact because we are
down to 135 fps so that was about a 15
FPS hit right there now if we look at
SSA 2x which is super sampling that
means it's going to super sample the
image two times to make it look even
sharper we're basically blowing up the
image smoothing it out and then
shrinking it back down to size now watch
what happens to the 8 to the FPS as soon
as I hit apply to this one we just lost
approximately 45 FPS so we went from 135
FPS down to 90 now if we hit 4x here our
image is going to definitely start to
look more sharp but look we dropped all
the way down to 60fps
so this is why SMA a is my
recommendation in terms of middle-ground
in terms of screen graphics quality and
performance now me think is one of those
things that get asked an awful lot J
should I turn it on should I turn it off
blah blah blah it really depends on a
few different things first of all how
strong is your graphics card if you have
a 60 Hertz panel but you have like a
1080 Ti and you're running 1080p you're
gonna be sending way more than 60 frames
per second to the panel now Hertz can
also be thought of as a frame per second
so if this thing basically does is tell
us a graphics card to wait until the
monitor says it's ready for the next
image before sending it the only problem
with vsync being on in that scenario is
if your graphics card is significantly
faster than your panel then you can
actually introduce input lag into your
game and my recommendation here is if
you're running a g-sync panel with an
Nvidia graphics card turn on g-sync in
the Nvidia control panel and leave vsync
off in your games same thing goes for
AMD if you've an AMD graphics card and a
free sync panel then you're gonna want
to leave free sync on turn vsync off in
your games unfortunately if you have a
free sync panel and an Nvidia graphics
card or an AMD graphics card and a
g-sync panel those are mismatched they
won't talk to each other and you kind of
lost out on that option so you would
want to run v-sync if that's the case so
let's talk about presets presets are
basically a bucket of settings that the
developers have determined like at this
graphics quality and these different
settings is what these settings down
below should be and as you can see we
are at the lowest fps like our lowest
preset as I mentioned right here that
basically means everything that could
possibly be turned on in terms of like
graphical or here we go again graphical
enhancements is off now the second we
switch this to low you can see there was
a dramatic change on the screen look at
that if we go from lowest to low there
is a dramatic change and the reason for
that is when you're on the lowest
settings there are absolutely no shadows
being drawn whatsoever shadows are the
most taxing graphic setting that you can
enable on your system fortunately now
the games have been evolved to the point
to where those graphics settings and
those shadow settings can be split into
different toggles so you can actually
turn on some types of shadows and turn
off others were in the past it was just
shadows yes or no and that was it
so as you can see even in low now versus
lowest there is a very dramatic change
because we have shadow quality turned on
to medium which is off before and level
of deep detail is also set to medium now
if we go up to medium on the preset you
can see we're increasing the overall
depth of a lot of our colors foliage you
could see her hair right here on low and
medium there's no reflection on medium
there's reflection on her hair high very
high and obviously there was a
significant hit to our FPS as well we're
still running 70 FPS or 69 FPS with very
high so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna go back to lowest and turn these
on one of the times you could kind of
see what's happening here now these two
settings right here texture quality and
anisotropic filter they kind of go hand
in hand
texture quality is going to be the
sharpness of the texture being applied
to the objects in this case the rocks or
pants dirt all of this has an image
that's laid on it to say this is dirt
this is a rock this is snow and that's
how you know what you're actually
looking at otherwise it's just a blob of
an object as the tropical tree is going
to be the processing of those images
when they are not being looked at
straight on I will typically set that to
16x it's a fairly low impact on your
graphic settings but it can make a big
impact in terms
Graphics appearance on your screen so
now if we turn up our texture quality
with our anisotropic filter turned up to
16x you'll start to notice things
overall on the screen look a whole lot
better so you can see now it just
finished reloading on the medium and
things look a whole lot sharper and then
if you set it to anything you know
considered high then this game is asking
for at least four gigabytes of vram and
the reason for that is textures are
stored in your frame buffer that is the
amount of VRAM that is on your graphics
card so the more vram the higher
resolution textures and the more
textures that can actually be stored
into that frame buffer ready to be
called by the graphics engine because
it's already there waiting ready to go
so not having enough vram can also lead
to a lot of the stuttering that you
would see in your games now the
stuttering isn't necessarily the
graphics card not being able to keep up
as much as the vram buffer is constantly
saturated so it's having to do a lot of
file swapping in that buffer which is
what's creating the stuttering it can't
draw the images on the screen if it
can't pull the data it needs from the
buffer so that's where a lot of the
stuttering actually comes from now let's
talk about shadows because like I said
shadows are the most taxing thing you
can do on your on your game settings now
you can see right here obviously there's
some depth you can see that we've got
rocks and you've got contour and stuff
going on right here you can also see the
Sun is coming in from the right right
over here so we do have some shadow
obviously being created but this is
still a very flat looking image and the
reason for that is because we have all
of our graphics settings pretty much set
to OFF so what happens if we start to
turn on shadows well you'll notice that
got a whole lot darker right there
because the Sun is over here on the
other side of these rocks which now
means that just like you would expect in
real life this side should be darker
than the other side now this actually
looks pretty good in my opinion this is
actually a very good looking rent image
right here and it's not doing a whole
lot of terrible work to our FPS we're
still getting nearly 100 FPS or almost
40 FPS higher than the refresh rate of
this panel so I could turn on vsync be
locked at 60 and never have a problem
but if you want to know what can really
make the the things look good but also
really hurt your performance obviously
you could turn this up to you know high
very high and what you'll notice here
the difference between off and medium
it's just the whether or not the shadows
even red
but if you look at the difference
between high and very high it's usually
just the edges and the way the edges is
being handled here now ambient occlusion
you'll find this in pretty much any
title within the last five or six plus
years this is basically the way objects
affect neighboring objects in terms of
shadows so ma occlusion on you can see
now we are getting even more depth to
our shadows here so this is just a much
smarter way of creating a very realistic
looking shadow motion blur pretty
obvious a lot of people don't like
motion blur the reason being is it tends
to be a bit ridiculous so as I'm moving
the screen around right here you can see
it looks like I'm just motorboating her
I'm sorry guys that's not on purpose I
swear it doesn't really do too much of a
hit on your graphics card but it's
really a personal taste thing I enjoy
games allow you to actually tune the
motion blur let's talk about
tessellation because that's something
that came out with dx11 a lot of people
still don't really understand it and I
have a really good demonstration for you
on that alright guys so this is heaven
benchmark and this is a free you guys
can actually download this it's heaven
benchmark so you can see we've got this
cobblestone road not a very smooth one
if you ask me in terms of trying to roll
an old hand card or something on there
that's because the tessellation settings
right here are kind of cranked this is
basically what this road would probably
more so look like if it were a real
medieval time type Road but you notice
how the rocks and stuff here look
extremely square and not very realistic
tessellation is just the amount of
angular detail that's being applied to
objects it's actually taking the angles
and the the structure of the object and
just giving you more enhancement to it
now heaven benchmark has a slider here
which allows you to just completely make
this as ridiculous as possible ooh that
is a little low basis
okay you guys get the point so this
video is directly in response to you
guys so this video that's a direct
response to you tectonic 15 I thought it
was a good subject to talk about there's
a lot of ways that you can increase your
graphics performance without having to
necessarily sacrifice in graphics
quality and not have to go out and
necessarily buy a new graphics card but
we all know that's fun we love buying
new graphics cards guys if you have a
topic you want me to touch on please put
it in the comments below or do like
tecktonik did tweet me and if it's a
good one you'll probably see a video
about it thanks for watching guys and as
always I will see you in the next one
I'm gonna do the best I can to not like
sniffle and stuff cuz you know okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
