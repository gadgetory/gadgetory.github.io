it looks like I'm wearing the same
clothes that was in the last video
that's because I am we filmed a couple
videos on the same day because we need
something to put up on Saturday since
Nick and I are going to be on a plane
heading to Taiwan for Computex at the
time you guys are seeing this so we're
just got a little fun little video we're
going to do here today because fidget
spinners or sweet what do we call them a
digit finners you know remember yeah we
kept week we just kept like mutilating
the names we're stupid yeah I I made my
own digit spinner I had to buy my
daughter one she begged and begged and
begged until I finally gave in and give
her one and now all I hear is a little
like spinning of bearings non-stop I
thought to myself into what PC editions
fidget spinners fidget spinner fidget
pin or whatever I don't know there we go
I'm not the first one to use a fan to do
it I may be the first one to show you
how this case this doesn't really need a
tutorial we're just phone and went in
with a with an easy Europe evideo okay
so here's we're going to do here we are
using the sacrificial coolermaster fan
here we've got a razor blade sharp and
then we've got ourselves some little
side snips now the first thing we're
going to do is we need to remove this
wire so you're going to work it through
the little thing my gosh this was easier
then we're just going to go ahead and
snip it we're going to snip it right
there at the hub and now we can just
pull it out there's a lot easier now we
could just call this a fidget spinner
and keep our fingers in the fan blades
and call it done right you do it that
way it spins this way nicely because you
know the shroud is heavier than the
blade so you do it with the blades not
for starters here if you are going to
give me a hard time saying oh my gosh
gee I can't believe you're making a
spinner
if you've ever built a PC and you
haven't sat there spinning a fan like
this in your chair because you're bored
and then we'll call you a liar but
anyway we're not done with this we need
this to be better right because that's
not the way it looks so we're going to
do first is we are going to break off
these little tabs little tabs right here
which are what hold the why
you're in place I mean you don't want
spend this with the wire going round and
round so we're just going to break those
off with our fingers okay
so there's that problem is those are now
kind of sharp right if you if you go to
spin that you can cut yourself so that's
where the razor blade comes in so don't
cut yourself if you do this is entirely
on you I do not accept responsibility
for your injuries and I very well may
bleed by the time we're done with this
because anytime I get near a sharp
object I tend to bleed now we've got all
these fins here now last time I snap
these all off by hand but I want to see
if I can snip these off clean besides
nippers ah haha there we go this one -
there we go this is good never fully
hell well up to em and didn't come off
all the way and loud car out there holy
hell
sorry about subpoenas bro so the guy
with a loud car myself now that still
isn't good enough because we've got all
these little shards and things right
here so again that's where the blade
comes in it's not for Robbie people
we're doing the only there's gonna be a
lot harder to hold now simply because
it's Tallis now spinning we'll call it
so imma try and do this up that was
close
that was really close yeah that's close
so proceed with caution just a little
bit I'm gonna use the side snicker
sexually oh really the worst video I've
done I expect this video to be disliked
and to the ground--and you know what I
really don't care no I don't care
so I guess we can still try and do this
with a blade oh my god I don't want to
move a knuckle okay you're looping up
with you probably easier to do this with
like a file
I guess file this one under stupid feel
the danger are you know you were heed
for me right now really ask that keep
you're hoping blood goes squirting
because you want to be able to for the
dramatic effect of the videos so there
you go
just that easy you can have your very
own I thought I could spin that with
like one hand like you get you get the
idea make sure you vacuum afterwards or
your wife or your mom or your girlfriend
or whatever is going to get pissed with
you whatever worst video ever made guys
do what you want with it
I don't really care I'm on my way to
China so I can't care you know tall I am
in China kill it yeah I could literally
be a building in China what anyway
there's that this is mess snick clean it
