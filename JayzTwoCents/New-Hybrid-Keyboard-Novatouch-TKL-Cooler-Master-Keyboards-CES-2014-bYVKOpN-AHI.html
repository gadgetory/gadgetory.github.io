insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and why
sennheiser the pursuit of perfect sound
and of course by generous viewers like
you so strapped in with j's two cents as
he takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys are watching Jace too
since we're continuing their tour here
of the cooler master suite here at CES
2014 and I am standing with none other
than receive if you guys know anything
about cooler master you know this guy's
name and he's going to talk to us about
some peripherals here that are new for
CES and what to expect with the
peripheral line from cooler master super
Jeep I'm gonna hand you the mic and let
you speak sure so hey guys so one of the
big things that we're doing this year is
we're really focusing on product
education understanding why coolermaster
stands out from our competition and one
of the biggest ways we're doing that is
through our cm University website which
Jana you've covered before and actually
we started creating a pamphlet which
were you know sharing at the show and
we're sharing at all these events that
were attending and it's kind of a
breakdown of each of the courses and the
corresponding products that benefit from
each technology and so the whole theme
of CES for us is work hard play hard
because you know we're working all day
and then like you partying all night so
so so kind of one of the big things also
for 2014 that cooler master's doing is
we're kind of as you said blurring the
lines between coolermaster and CM storm
I think a lot of people really weren't
familiar that where the you know kind of
the same company so now cool and masters
kind of taken something of our old CM
storm line bringing it more and more
into a modern coolermaster a kind of
gaming solution and just kind of
bringing that concept not only to our
peripherals but also our mobile device
mobile products and also our cases power
supplies coolers and things like that so
some of the older things that you'll see
that we're bringing back with a kind of
a new touch is for example our trigger Z
which is a programmable keyboard we have
our Cyrus to which actually is now also
usable on consoles as well as a PC so
it's a 2.2 design back to the trigger
this is just a mechanical keyboard comes
in various which types wrist rest fully
programmable as I
and we also have our havoc FML mouse
which is more of a palm grip design
these are just kind of the older
products that are still kind of seeing
really new fresh light even though
they've been out for a while but the
trigger Z and the Cyrus tool be coming
very soon I think I think one of the
things that people really like about
this keyboard is the wrist rest I mean
my personal feedback was I like a wrist
rest and when I tried the you know the
Quickfire ultimate that that's the most
common thing I've heard from people
who've bought CM storm or coolermaster
keyboards is they like the wrist rest
and only did you add one it's pretty big
what are these are here these le LED
indicators is just a designer is okay
yeah I mean it's got kind of a
rubberized texture to it which it feels
really comfortable is removable I assume
right yeah so what's which options are
available in this keyboard so right now
we do have a mostly brown switch is kind
of the most available we also have blue
and red but because of availability
issues it's just varies on region right
now we do see a lot of brown switch
availability in the u.s. so with the
brown switch we do a white LED which
kind of works with any kind of design
it's a very popular design for us we're
seeing a lot of success on the Quickfire
ultimate and again I am with you on the
wrist rest thing I use an older trigger
which uses more of the two-tone design
and this kind of just kind of cleans it
up with a full black finish rubberized
finish and you know fits a lot of
systems no I forgive me I didn't catch
it did you say it will be available with
a green switch uh this one will not be
available with the green switch right
out the gate it could change ultimately
but right out the gate i do believe
we'll just have it with the brown switch
you know and i think the brown switch is
probably the most liked switch among
gamers honestly browns and blues but
personally i like brown switch i like
the feedback on that and then for
clarification to i'm back lighting color
the brown will get a white LED red and
red blue with blue and those are the
three colors i believe you mentioned it
gets okay so now you know kind of we've
touched on products that are a little
bit older but you know with a new
redesign on them i'm actually introduced
our product manager Carter who's going
to go over all the newer things that
cooler master's gonna be bringing in
2014 some really exciting stuff that we
think will help us you know really catch
the eye of a lot of casual users and the
enthusiasts as well so now there were a
thousand of you in our livestream the
other night and I don't know how many
times I was asked what the thing I'm
most excited about and see
s is and we're going to take a look at
that right now which is a brand new
keyboard switch design so I'm go ahead
let Carter tell us all about that Carter
it's nice to meet you nice meeting you
how's it going I'm going to go over a
couple of new products we have here
they're both tkl keyboards this one is
are going to be our rapid eye and we
have our SI version over here which is
the side print and what it is is an
illuminated tkl board sporting the
cherry switches I did hear a little bit
of talk about the green switch this
particular board will be available in
green switch what's neat about this
specific board is it has a 32-bit ARM
processor on it so what that's going to
allow you to do is it's going to
activate our active light mode which
will actually give you an active beam of
light each keystroke you hit we also
have a trailing mode which will follow
whatever you're typing on which kind of
gives you a neat a very neat effect
again it will follow the same Led
flavors of the switch types of the brown
this is a brown switchboard so it has
the white LED but blue would be blue
green would be green another neat
feature about this is it has a modes
where you can actually change which Keys
you want particularly lit at any given
time so you can actually utilize any
type of profile settings save it there
and it will keep those one of the most
common feedback I heard from people
who've owned CM storm or coolermaster
keyboards are backlit is they want
programmable keys not just the three or
four modes that came available so you
guys have you guys wanted it they heard
you and they listened so make sure you
keep giving feedback to these companies
on what you guys want to see because
clearly you've seen it come to fruition
here now you guys also wanted to see
basically a backlit stealth and that's
kind of what we're looking at here with
the backlit side print key caps yes
that's exactly what it is we took our
stealth edition and essentially
illuminated it so it's a very unique
look it gives you kind of a flat look on
top but does illuminate the keys on the
side print also keeps any sort of we're
away from the legends themselves so kind
of 22 unique looks both have the same
functionality which kind of gives the
user a lot more programmability for
whatever they would suit suit their
needs I promised and teased you guys for
a while now about what my favorite new
tech is here at CES
and that is the Nova touch tkl it's a
brand new switch design well actually
it's not new but it's going to be new to
you guys because it's now being brought
to the market in a gaming format well
I'll go over it a little bit here so
essentially what we've done is we take
in the an electrostatic Japanese switch
type which is one of the smoothest
mechanical switches on the market and
encompassed it in a very small form
factor of a tkl board what this switch
type does is it's a uniform 45 gram
electrostatic so you're gonna have
unified unified a actual weight across
the board itself but the switch type
itself is going to give you a much
smoother feeling than the majority of
the mechanical switch types out there at
the moment we also encompassed a very
unique stem on this particular switch
it's going to allow you to utilize the
backwards compatibility with the cherry
switch the cherry key caps so another
wonderful feature about this is where
they're all connected in an
electrostatic field so we're actually
able to create a thousand Hertz polling
first one first keyboard on the market
to utilize electrostatic switch types as
well as a thousand Hertz polling which
is going to give you the most the
fastest response time of any keyboard on
the market at this current time it's
also rated at 50 million key presses
like other mechanical switches but again
with a much softer smoother feel than
anything else out there you're also
going to have the n key role / which is
very very important for a lot of the
gamers out there and you might see
several different form factors of this
in the near future okay Carter now as a
gamer myself I'm gonna throw some
questions at you that maybe may not be
hard all right number one attention is
there going to be different press gram
weights and such uh currently they are
new release that we're doing now is a 45
uniform but we potentially could
introduce a 55 in the future as well as
a lower weight of a 30 ok guys so 45s to
be about the weight of a red switch
right over the red and brown this is a
tactile but a very smooth tactile switch
so it's going to not give that scratch
here any type of friction at that
tactile point like some of the other
switch types on the market that is
definitely the part that's really hard
to convey to you guys in a video is the
way this feels I mean they call it a
hybrid technology and it really does
feel like it takes the best of both
worlds of both a membrane and a Mackay
switch it feels like the kind of switch
that would appeal to both ends of that
spectrum and both could be plenty happy
with that I mean like you mentioned as
it's moving there's absolutely no
scratching of the switch or the
mechanism inside it is very very smooth
I mean it's not loud either there's no
click there's a slight pump in there
giving you some feedback it's it's
really a unique feeling it's hard to
hard to describe I can't say it feels
like a red or feels like a black because
honestly I think if it felt like any
other cherry switch out there or cherry
switch there'd be no point in this
technology around the office kind of the
joke is it feels like to you know
playing a piano on ivory it's really got
that smooth just kind of flow buttery
feel with the that landing pad that
membrane the silicone injection it kind
of takes away from any of the bottoming
out or that harsh feeling so just very
unique hybrid field now the next
question I know people going to ask is
availability when are we looking at this
coming to market we should see this
probably towards the beginning of q2
okay so there you go guys beginning
beginning of q2 right now it does not
have a 10-key on there we talked about
maybe in the future there will be but
this is going to be a debut items see
how well it does give your feedback what
do you think about this technology I
mean I know you guys this is brand new
to you it's brand new to me you don't
really have anything to kind of go off
of but tell us how you feel about this
this type of new switch technology on
one thing we did mention is that it does
not have backlighting in there so it is
there is a little bit of give and
compromise in there I'm not going to ask
it back Lighting's will be something
available in the future because this is
this is emerging tech now for gamers and
will come across that bridge when we can
so guys Carter thank you very much
pleasure to meet you CES 2014 guys make
sure you follow us and cooler master on
Twitter and Facebook you guys want to
miss any of this exclusive coverage
