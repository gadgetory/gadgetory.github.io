food it's gonna get 3331 I'm screwed so
it takes an entire minute to reboot a
truck that's how is this techno now
these things are supposed to be flying
all right so now that we got the stupid
radio figured out in the truck we were
heading down to Micro Center because now
that all of the cards have been shown
everyone's CPUs this stuffer out -
Intel's tooth Jen coming who knows when
we are going to do what we do every
single year around here and that is
build a cheap budget gaming computer
that doesn't suck you know what guys I
got new merch it's available now Cod me
calm slash tasty sense we got zip up
hoodies we got tri-blend we got a new
logo I digress since 2012 but the rest
logo you guys been asking for that
anyway
well guys little bit uh well kinda stuff
zip up hoodies beanies polos don't take
my word for it cuz obviously I can't do
this Edie so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks that was a bunch of
different ways that you can do this and
a lot of people like to go from the
mindset uh built the cheapest computer
possible take all the parts store buy
lowest price by the top of the lowest
price and then just put it together and
see what happens but we've done that in
the past what we've often found is that
there is a terrible diminishing return I
guess backward summation return where
you spend too little and that you really
sacrifice in areas that you didn't lead
to if you just spent a little more so
our logic here is kind of like sort by
lowest price and then buy like 2 or 3
items up from the low
now we don't have a set price goal that
we're going for here a lot of people
like to do a challenge of like $500 $700
whatever and then don't go a dollar
above that we are just going for save as
much money as possible see what it costs
at the end of the day and then compare
the performance and we are heading down
the Micro Center and I am paying for
this out of my own money because you
think differently versus like august's
take parts off the shelf and it's easy
to add 20 here and add 10 there and add
5 there because that's what she had
those people don't have part shelves to
just go grab parts off of so we're
heading down here and spending our own
money because that makes you really
think differently on where you want to
save 5 save 10 spend 10 and we think we
put together a pretty good list of parts
now what we're also going to do because
we head to Micro Center we often get
pushback from the audience especially
those that don't live near Micro Center
because you can't buy a graphics card
you can't buy CPUs online at Micro
Center that's often because their bundle
deals and their prices are so low below
map or minimum minimum advertised
brightest price in most instances people
are like I can't buy it so that's not
fair so whatever we end up with we're
gonna also show you what it would have
cost us at Newegg
I wonder would have costume and Amazon
at least locally in the region oh man so
let's go and see what we end up with
okay so we're at micro Center here in
Tustin California there's only one micro
Center in California I was get people
like which micro Center in California
there's only one and unfortunately left
to live
fortunate enough to live within about an
hour of it so here are the parts we
ended up with we start with a case this
is like the third time I've gone with a
Corsair carbide series spec go to case
because a case is just a box you put
your parts in of course it's responsible
for air flow but the logic here is
always get the cheapest case you could
stand to look at that has decent air
flows away I always go with that and
this the value for this case I mean here
Micro Center we got it for $59.99 now
yes there are cases that you could get
to like 49 or 44 bucks but those either
had terrible air flow or they included
only one fan or no fans at all
this includes three fans which means we
didn't have to add fans to the case
which meant we were able to keep the
price down because the cheapest fans you
could buy even for like 120 it's gonna
be something like 10 bucks apiece and so
you buy two or three of those now you're
up until like the 60 $70 range which
made this the better buy so when it
comes to are the rest of our parts here
we'll just kind of go through it talk
about the price at the end I went with a
risin 2600 and the reason for this and
people don't be like wait a minute isn't
then two out well yes it is but you
member that video I did where I said
don't buy anything yet please for the
love of God wait
don't buy it's because we knew these
price lashes were coming when I said I
don't mean drop I mean slash horizon
2600 versus the 3400 G was kind of where
I was shopping but the value for the
3400 G comes into the fact that it's an
APU and has a graphics card built into
it still running on Vega graphics so we
decided to do is go with the 2600 which
gives us more cores and doesn't have
functionality that we don't need now to
couple that with a board that has value
with it we went to be 450m even if
you're running as n2 or brand-new 3000
series AMD we still recommend v4 50 if
you're not looking to push over clocks
too far you're not running you know the
high-end SKUs or something like the you
know what 12 core 24 thread still has a
decent enough for +3 digital power
design so you can still overclock on
this have reliability em not to slide
and when you couple the bundle deal of
this motherboard with this processor
micro Center you get 30 bucks off which
made this only cost like 44 dollars the
firm value for 1080p gaming lies with
Polaris so the RX 578 gigabyte at
we got it here for a hundred and forty
nine dollars and ninety nine cents if
you use user benchmarks to compare this
to anything from Nvidia you've got to
spend $200 or more to get the same
performance you're getting out of this
with 1080p gaming and rasterization r-tx
and all that aside at the price point
we're shopping here DXR is not something
you're gonna get to experience if you
just want a good framerate plenty of
frame buffer or eight gig frame buffer
this is where we shopped right here you
could have gotten a 580 for a few bucks
more but again we were going for value
here in terms of storage a two terabyte
Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm drive coupled
with a DX 500 from crucial so the two
terabyte drive is 49 the 580 or 480
gigabyte Drive was $49 the SSD storage
has definitely come down and I'm sorry
but 500 megabytes a second is plenty of
read/write for most people
Ram no not not that ram now Ram was one
of those things where when we were
trying to do our budget builds and stuff
last year was extremely hard because Ram
prices were through the roof we could
not get 16 gigabytes for under a hundred
and like eighty dollars last year so
we've got 16 gigabytes of g-scale ages
3000 megahertz memory which is perfect
present
rise in 2000 series for you ready for
this where is it I can't even fine I'm
not ready for it
$59.99 - 8 gigabyte 3000 megahertz 6 CL
16 for 60 bucks
the sadness came when you drop your
power supplies the sadness came from the
fact that our power supply was 80 bucks
we had a hard time shopping for a power
supply we used to be able to get 500 to
600 watt bronze rated power supplies for
$50 all day long now we went with a
bigger power supply than we need for
this build because we didn't want to
destroy future upgrade ability by having
a power supply that was only enough for
this system which means you can't plop
in a bigger graphics card or a higher
end Zen CPU or something because you'd
be at the ragged edge of where it's safe
faris your power supplies to have a CX
650 M semi modular
stop it it's a bronze rated power supply
which is plenty for this build so what
is our grand total here at micro center
with Tech's
660 dollars and 42 cents and no that's
not the cheapest PC we could build but
like we explained at the beginning this
is the best value we think we could
build without going too expensive and I
think the performance we're gonna get
for this price it's going to be at least
one and a half maybe even closer to 2x
what we were able to get last year and
one other thing you'll also get with
this I didn't even mention is because
there's a AMD promotion right now we
also have the xbox pc gaming pass with
this graphics card so you get access to
like that entire PC library that's
available from Xbox and PC I think for
like three months or something like that
so there is that added value to it
alright so know we got you next we've
got to go and put it together
when it comes to performance all we did
was come in here and put a more
aggressive fan curve we still can't hear
it and the temperatures came down a lot
but we did over turn on the XMP profile
so it's 3,000 megahertz memory with the
CL 16 timing so we know risin
2000-series
likes fast memory and ironically the
3000 megahertz was cheaper than the 2400
megahertz
so of course we went with that let's go
and get in here to do now what we're
caring about here is the magic 60fps and
that's all we get in the menu but as
soon as we load up something we don't
know tightens around there we go do this
is just Arcade Mode rack up as many
points as you can get we are running the
Vulcan API so if a good video you can
see 1080p right there anti-aliasing as
SMA a everything else is kind of stock
motion blur off overall quality though
we are set to ultra this is the first
time we have done any sort of a sensible
minded budget type build where we could
enable ultra in Doom we've done this in
the past but we could not run ultra on
doom because we would start dropping
below that 60fps but what I want to show
you here is that we are running ultra
right now that's the ultra preset we
touch nothing else in there 120 fps
right there we are definitely getting
the job done so Doom is one of those
games that has really withstood the test
of time in terms of beauty it is the
textures are amazing the lighting is
amazing and that's why I will always
test with this game but look at the fps
right here again in Ultra 140 fps we've
never had an experience like this at
this price point and a lot of that has
to do with the fact that we have gotten
massive reduction in pricing on memory
and storage but Jay dooms easy to run
what about games that aren't easy to run
well let's go and run the Far Cry 5
benchmark our max GPU temperature in
that gaming portion right there was 61
but even without overclocking the CPU
you can see this was our CPU usage in
Doom we know Vulcan is really good but a
really good API with low overhead so
that is amazing right there so here's
Far Cry 5 and like I said it's a CPU
intensive title as well and then we're
using the ultra preset with ta-taa
anti-aliasing because that's what we run
all of our benchmark sets we want to see
if we can get 60fps in Far Cry 5 with
every
on ultra for 1080p I wouldn't even feel
comfortable calling this a budget bill
at that point I mean it is because it's
it's low budget I mean a $650 PC with
tax is certainly low budget but it's not
low budget experience at least as it
used to be in the past yeah so minimum
FPS 50 for a minimum of 50 for average
of 60 to maximum of 70 for 60fps plus
ultra far cry 5 with a $600 tower it's
one of the last times we tested dirt
rally we we couldn't go over like medium
settings and that was I think we were
doing like the 2400 G with the APU or
something like that we're gonna go ahead
and go straight to ultra here because
why the heck not so this is another one
of those titles that can be fairly CPU
bound so that's one of the reasons why I
chose not to go to the 3400 gene I know
I said this in beginning a video and I'm
showing you now why I'm reiterating that
choice because we had no intentions of
using an APU for this price point with
the drop and prices of memory the drop
in prices for storage and the jeep the
fact that you can still get at RX 578
Giga Byte at least at Micro Center for
149 dollars is why I had absolutely no
problems with dropping the APU support
for for extra compute threats and as you
can see we're sitting at 3.75 the whole
time
no CPU overclock whatsoever so these
scores that you're seeing will go up if
you do some sort of an overclock but
this and I hate to sound I hate to sound
cliche but this is butter smooth this is
buttery smooth no stuttering no
stumbling at all and we'll have to see
what the FPS fps is at the end of the
run but this this is an amazing time to
be a PC gamer especially if you've been
waiting if you listen to my video I did
a month or two ago whatever month ago
that said wait just wait
you could get the CPU right now for 119
dollars at Micro Center average FPS 81
point seven seven this is it's funny we
could we get to work with the the
highest end hardware in the industry but
I really nerd out over
over this over the average guy going man
I don't have that kind of money to spend
but knowing now that you can get this
level of performance and the GP you
never went harder than 61 then you can
get this level of performance with just
not breaking the bank I mean I'm not
saying $600 isn't a lot of money but I'm
saying compared to what you could spend
for a computer this is a significant
amount of money or significant savings
of money because this computer is still
fully capable of doing things like
Photoshop doing things like premiere
video rendering and I think the six core
twelfth fedra actually do a pretty good
job of it because I use the eight core
16 threat when resident first came out
this is better IPC a little bit but
better IPC than the original 1,800 and
the fact that you could do
live-streaming with this if you wanted
you could set aside two or four cores to
live streaming depending on the titles
that you're playing and it wouldn't be
the highest settings but you'd still be
able to get it done so that my friends
is how how it's performing if I sound
like I'm gonna loss for words it's
because I knew how 570 perform and I
knew how a 2600 performed at the fact
that we're getting this level of
performance at this price price point is
absolutely earth-shattering in my
opinion when it comes to value but I
think this also stresses the very
important point that I've been trying to
make throughout this entire video is
that sometimes the performance increase
you get is exponential versus the
percentage of costs increase if you shop
just a little bit higher than the bottom
dollar price point what tends to happen
with bottom dollar is you become
outdated faster
you become left behind faster when it
comes to various tech or necessity or
bare minimum specs than if you shopped
at something like this I can guarantee
you that this rig right here would be
capable with the CPU running for another
five years and being within spec of any
title that would come out in that time
frame the only thing you might have to
do is in two or three years upgrade the
graphics card because it might fall down
to minimum spec on titles as things move
forward but that's okay because we went
with a little bit larger power supply
because we went with 16 gigabytes of RAM
instead of 8 and because we want the
2612 core or 12 thread CPU versus the
bottom dollar that we kind of gotten it
means the GPU is the
anything we would have to swap out so
this video was kind of not about the
level of performance that you get
necessarily with this price point that
the other half of this video was
triggering your way of thinking into
that sometimes spending a little more
will get you a lot more in the long run
alright guys hope this video has helped
you in terms of budget minded thoughts
here in 2019 if you have some other
specs of the hardware that you think we
should check out we definitely will
would like to do that we are gonna be
checking out the 3200 G and the 3400 G
and how they perform APU wise I don't
expect it to be a huge improvement over
the Vegas stuff because or the 2400 2200
G except for CPU tests because it's
running the same Vega graphics I can
guarantee you there'll be something Navi
based coming up in the future but that
is a long ways away before I'm sure AMD
is ready to talk about any of that and
that's just purely speculation on my
part so guys thanks for watching if you
like this video make sure you hit the
subscribe button if you know someone
that's shopping for PC parts right now
share this video with them even if they
don't go with these parts it might
change the way they think and it might
give them more performance for just a
little bit more money in the long run
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next one so one of the last times we
tested doom 3 so one of the last times
we tested dirt 3 we could everything
went down everything everything it's
like we might know a thing or two about
how the sales of electronics work in
this industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
