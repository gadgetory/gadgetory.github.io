I thought we were gonna get to review
the Lightning card you know that $1600
top-end RTX card they were like oh yeah
we'll send you one this box is empty
because they sent it in here so the
reason why we're checking out the BLD or
build service from NZXT it sounds like a
wrap I swear to god it's because NZXT is
the exclusive supplier for the Lightning
card 4s is that you can't basically get
it anywhere else now there are some
other reviews on the Internet of the
card standalone but for whatever reason
they chose to send this to us for a
specific reason we'll talk about it in
just a second we've already talked about
BLD we've done unboxing this stuff but I
want to take a look at this build
specifically because we did the gold
build and we were like yeah we did
golden NZXT he's like we did it better
so we're gonna look at that today also -
if you guys haven't seen our tour of the
facility of how this boxes the build is
created and boxed and shipped and all
that then go and check that out we'll
put a link in the description below so
I'm not gonna be going into a lot of the
specifics I am gonna tell you though we
are giving this computer away with the
Lightning card and all of that in there
just not in this video so make sure
you're subscribed or you will probably
miss that announcement all right so here
it is setup obviously on the desk so I
went in and changed some of the lighting
now there's two different things you use
to control the Lighting's in this
particular build NZXT scam controls the
crack in and then the hue fans that are
in here and we've also got the lighting
strips that go looks like across the top
the front and the bottom and then we use
MSI mystic light to control the
motherboard the RAM as well as the
graphics card so we've gotta set a
couple of things with the graphics card
but first we're gonna talk about the
specs this is a 9900 K that is running
on an MSI z3 90m eg ace motherboard it's
obviously got the 20 atti
lightning Z graphics card from MSI 32
gigabytes of g.skill tried NZ RGB which
we've also set purple I like the way
that purple and gold looks it's sort of
like a Laker theme well I'm not really
like
man it's the wrong shade of gold it's
got a four terabyte Seagate Barracuda
spinning hard drive as well as a one
terabyte 970 Evo nvme m2 SSD we in terms
of power supply it's got their new II
850 power supply in fact I've got one
over here
we're gonna be doing a video about this
I need to get some equipment first so I
can properly test
OCP basically NZ FC is like hey put our
power supply to the test test the OCP
and I was like I don't want to kill my
software or I don't kill my software of
course but I want to kill my hardware
and they're like well we're so confident
our OCP if anything happens we'll take
care of it and we'd love to better our
product if it happens but we're so
confident it won't happen they're gonna
they want me to test it but I need to
find the right way to test OCP rather
than kind of taking the black wire and
the red wire or the yellow wire in this
case for 12 volt and going now in terms
of the graphics card because this was
the whole focus of why I wanted to do
this video you can see here it's very
similar to their trio it's got this
brace right here which it's not really
leaning on it right now but this uses up
two slots so that the weight of this
card if it sags will be absorbed by this
brace and not the motherboard socket and
the rear of the the case causing sag
it's got a carbon fiber back plate with
a RGB that also shows the right there
I've said this to sort of like kind of a
flickering light which I think it's kind
of nice but it has a heat pipe in there
as well you can kind of see it right
there because my concern with it being a
carbon fiber was like wait a minute
that's gonna reject Heat which could be
bouncing the heat right back at the card
well they've got a heat pipe on here to
move the heat to the end of the card and
and then just allow it to sort of
radiate away plus we have fans blowing
directly on it but the coolest thing
about this pet pun intended cool is the
the OLED screen on the side right here
so we've seen this on their motherboards
but now they've implemented it into the
Lightning's II card and you can go in
here into the software with the dragon
centre and change this information to
what you want so I've got it cycling
right now between the fan speed the core
speed and the temperature so as we're
kind of gaming and doing benchmarks and
stuff you can just kind of look over
glance at it and see holy crap that's
kind of nice to have a you know just a
quick visual reference but then again at
this card costing $1600 for a single
card
it should it should maybe be in color I
don't know I that's it's a little
tangent maybe it should cook me
breakfast too because that's that's
expensive but of course we want to see
how it does it overclocking and stuff so
let's go ahead and let's just start
pushing this and see what happens so I'm
using Valley benchmark to kind of do so
my overclock testing here in windowed
mode so we can have msi afterburner
running to do some of our overclock
testing now it initially boosted up to
1995 but if you guys aren't aware with
GPU boost 3.0 obviously that's an
overclock as the temperature goes up
this is gonna go down so the fan curve
we found is fairly I mean it's only 826
rpm a53 see right now 1980s the
frequency as you can see there so it's
nice that they match it's only at 822
rpm which is which is nice but I mean I
I think our card like this obviously
acoustics are second to performance
obviously first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go ahead and just max out the
fans because like I said and you're
probably gonna hear it now obviously I'm
sorry this is not the quietest card on
the market but obviously we want to keep
it as cool as possible as we're
overclocking it so the boost won't start
to bring down our core clock the core
voltage it's still up for debate whether
or not this does anything this actually
is theoretically moving the slider at
where it adds more voltage at a lower
core speed I guess so the curve moves
down technically so that it goes higher
voltage sooner to keep you from crashing
as you push up the core clocks but
whatever as we brought the temperature
back down though as you can see these
temps start normalizing and that might
even come back up to 1995 so let's go
ahead and increase that power limit now
it only shows 108 but this is already a
much higher TDP TDP card than the
reference that's eight percent above the
RT increased overall TDP of the card so
I don't know exactly the TDP of this
card is so don't look at that and go why
is it only eight when the founders card
is like 22 that that's why it's already
at a hundred it's higher than probably
the founders at 122 so we'll apply that
that tells us by increasing our power
limit that we were not hitting power
limit which is why the core didn't
change we could also check here on our
monitoring and we would be able to see
if we were hitting power limit I wish
there was a light that would turn on
that be my suggestion for MSI's
have a little light that turns on or
something on there that power limit is
happening that it enables or illuminates
that way you can see like oh we're power
limited because with r-tx it's it's more
often than not power limited than
anything temperature or whatever so if
we go and find our power limit its power
percentage yeah look at that so even
though we haven't maxed out we're not
even hitting a hundred this is total
percentage of power draw available to
the card so we're sitting at seventy
nine percent or eighty percent of one
hundred and eight so the card won't
fraud on two hits 108 as you can see
we're hitting into 80 so obviously the
power delivery of this card is extremely
robust and built up as it should be it's
got three PCI Express eight pin power
plugs on there so the amount of power on
this card could theoretically pull more
than 500 Watts if allowed to but I don't
think that it's gonna even get anywhere
near there now for reference here what
we're checking is my speaking of
reference my founders edition card will
actually achieve twenty one thirty
sustained with the fans at one hundred
percent as high as twenty one ninety
that's pretty significant so I want to
see if we can even match that course
because if you can't match the core
speed then what is all this extra stuff
do so that's why you have to hope that
they're doing proper binning of these
cards otherwise oh we just crashed at
plus 150 that was twenty one thirty and
we just crashed right there and see it
recovered sort of okay well let's see if
we can bring it back kudos on the
drivers the driver recovery given what
we just went through with AMD this was a
little welcome sight to see I'm telling
you alright 110 I'm gonna move this up
just to see the placebo wise oh look at
that as soon as I move that up you see
that jumped up so maybe this is doing
something on this particular card if I
slide this back down it goes back down
to 2100 it doesn't one go any higher
it's like when I maxed out all those
other voltages it like freaked it out
didn't it let's bring those down
well I didn't bring down that far that's
my bad all right so I'm trying to get
this to match our founders card
unfortunately we're not able to get it
they're moving the voltage slider really
doesn't do anything I'm watching the
voltage readout it's always at 10:43 is
where it seems to max out power limit
doesn't make a difference because the
increased power limit of the card
already means we're not hitting power
limit so that's what would make this
like out of the box faster than like the
reference card of the founders card plus
110 and plus 1,000 on the memory seems
to be about as far as I can push this
card without it really starting to freak
out and then maxing out the fans because
this will climb rather quickly if you
don't so
I mean although it's a it's a custom
card that's supposedly Bend and yeah
unfortunately we can't get the core
speed to match but that's kind of been
the case as long as NVIDIA has been
having reference or founders Edition
cards which goes back to Pascal Nvidia
kind of keeps the best silicon for
themselves and then everyone else just
kind of sorta has to bend the leftovers
that they get and then come up with
their tiered systems so that's why I'm
seem to be stuck here right around the
20 100-ish range at the end of the day
it's still a great card it's just
obviously this one has a huge price
premium along with it but I want to give
a huge thank you to NZXT though for at
least sending me this system to do this
review with obviously they took the gold
and black that's built into the card and
turned it into sort of a theme very
similar to what I did with the RT X
build they r-tx Titan build now I'm
going to be giving away this system but
not in this video so it's very important
that you be following on social media
and be subscribed to the channel because
that's how you're gonna find out about
that
so NZXT was like hey we want to do
something we'd love for you to take the
system and then give it away so all the
details and stuff on that will be coming
later I will not be answering any of
those questions in this video there will
be obviously a piece for it now if you
guys haven't heard of NZXT SB LD or
build basically the websites called
let's build calm there's a link down the
description below and it's the only SI
that I know of well obviously that you
can buy the Lightning card from if this
is the card you want because they are
the exclusive supplier for the SIS on
the lightning Z it's a very limited
edition card as well so if you want it
you probably are gonna want to act
the other thing is it's the only essay I
know we can go in choose up to believe
it's up to three games that you want to
play the FPS you want to play that and
the price point that you're willing to
spend and it will give you the expected
results in terms of performance and you
can shop by fps you can shop by dollar
amount customise the parts in there and
basically they'll build it and of course
they have their blitz service where if
you order it by 11:00 a.m. Pacific time
you can have it built tested and shipped
same day making it one of the fastest s
eyes that you can order from and they
keep the pricing pretty much at MSRP
that's one of the reasons why I'm a huge
promoter of BLD because of the fact that
during the whole cryptocurrency mining
craze
they didn't jack up the prices of their
cards they kept them at MSRP making si
is a much more enticing option than they
were prior to the cryptocurrency craze
because typically you could build it
cheaper on your own so that's why you're
seeing a lot more si stuff on this
channel because it's a it's a it's a
good service if you're afraid to build
your own computer or you want a warranty
or maybe you're used to building your
own computers and this time you just
don't want to so anyway we're gonna go
guys stay tuned for the giveaway on this
again a huge thank you to MSI NZ and the
NZXT for sponsoring today's video and as
always we will see you guys in the next
one
that is cool though I want that who am
out of breath now
