we're hooked together and we survived
nothing says beta like hitting a
freaking tree in an airplane and nothing
negative happens here
oh god that's up now God set myself on
fire
geez I would like to fix my airplane oh
I just got an airplane if you've been
trying to buy a GTX 1080 then you know
that this is one of the hardest graphics
cards to find well I've got good news
for you because right now mass drop and
msi have teamed up to offer you the gtx
1080 armor eight gigabyte OC edition for

description head on over to mass drop

up it's absolutely free and you can lock
in your purchase of this extremely hard
to get graphics card so don't wait head
on over there right now what's up guys
jays two cents here and i have actually
had several attempts at making this
video so far for you guys on my first
impressions and thoughts on battlefield
one and I just kept feeling and I kept
failing and kept failing at the video
any of the problem was I was trying too
hard to be good and let's face it I'm
not very good at shooters anymore I used
to be very good I'm not anymore
so here's what we're gonna do we're just
gonna play the game we're gonna have
some fun it'll give you some ideas of
what gameplay is like I'll talk a little
bit about the classes and you guys can
just spend the rest of the video
laughing at me because I'm so bad with
that said I'll wait for the math to load
and then we'll go for now oh hey look he
loaded that was quick
now one other thing too is if the screen
looks all weird
obviously with me on the bottom and it's
all super wide well I am running on an
Ultra wide 20 1 by 9 34 inch screen it's
the x34 predator I'm gonna be playing
here as the assault class because it's
kind of an anti-tank class it's got a
lot of destructive properties about it's
got these anti-tank grenades it's got
that 80 rocket guns got grenades lots of
fun stuff but it's got all the usual
classes like other battlefields you got
your medic you got your support class
and you've got your sniper of course but
I wish I could try different guns I'm no
good with the MP 18 I think that's part
of my problem but whatever let's let's
get going here the game is so realistic
looking and sounding i man I love
battlefield except for hardline I didn't
I didn't like hardline a lot at all now
one thing I want you guys to remember is
this this is a an alpha whoa this is an
alpha this is not a release or an early
access so there are bugs there are
glitches and sometimes they're funny and
sometimes are frustrating but you cannot
judge the final game based on what
you're gonna see here again wouldn't
deploy try to get my eighty going on
that little a little personal carrier
there let's go blow this guy up
oh you did
it's that yellow gas that is that is bad
gas and I kind of like me after I eat
burritos thing I went over him I really
want to hit that guy but now he's moving
there's a guy right there he's gonna
shoot me feel it
I need to get my anti-tank grenades out
and when I'm gonna kill this guy this
guy's just rolling up here with a tank
nope kept on going
I need a Moe's guys oh geez ow yeah some
of the snipers in this game are good he
had shouted me oh that was over quickly
I guess we'll move into a new map then
one of the things I think is cool though
is the the map as you just saw right
there
it's it's the actual rendered game you
can see what's happening it's not it's
not like a satellite image like
battlefield 4 but I do like on the fact
that this game doesn't have an abundance
of BS like thermal optics and and heat
sensors and heart rate sensors and all
that weird kind of stuff this this game
it's uh it's realistic as like what it
would have been like in World War 1 I
would have to assume so now I'm in a
fighter plane one of the things that
sucks about the fighter planes is oh my
god nobody's helping here they are like
paper just like in real life I assume
they are paper planes so small arms fire
and all kinds of things actually make
these planes damaged they get damaged
super easily
dog bites are really fun and world war
two plans though this guy's like evasive
maneuvers evasive maneuvers shoot him
down
I have to be careful of all the flak
fire on the ground though is able to
fling the item got him all right let's
go up to this guy over here Oh beer I'm
under attack now
holy moly use my basic maneuvers here
I'm not used to flying with the mouse I
normally fly with joystick so right now
this is very foreign to me I'm getting
kind of dizzy oh dear the plane go I
just do this about the guys on the
ground I'm a fighter plane though I do
my best work is gonna be up on the sky
okay this guy's on my hip my six now
these planes are not very powerful
either you have to keep that in mind I
mean they're they're like little
two-stroke engines are not very fast Oh
God
we made it we make impact Oh so you can
see my plane now my wing is on the left
side is kind of broken apart
there is no repairing bat Oh at least I
both messed up I'm kind of screwed here
though it's alright let's see what I can
do before I die here
see the plan I'm attacking here he has a
tail gunner which kind of sucks so he
shooting at me as I'm shooting at him
now turn this plane though the dealer
these are the tack plane yeah we got him
way I got him got him that's two kills
now three don't you people in there
problem is my plane is kind of a
battered mess at the moment let's go get
this attack plane over here
you guys remember with battlefield 3 and
four days I am a pilot through and
through I always will be a pilot
highlighting is what I love don't crash
into me friendly I got this guy oh now
you crashed into me just like I said not
to you oh man all right let's go I'm
dead okay it's disabled that's good
enough for me
overall hits hits
can't turn very fast and I playing slow
okay we'll kill him
yeah if you did watch a guy it's three
kills whoa it was a big piece of flak
right there do this I've got to be
really selective on where I go now I've
got to kind of I have to kind of assist
my other buddies here where I can and
then get the hell out of there quickly
without crashing into a friendly
don't crash into me slow down there he's
disabled
he did four kills seven - no baby
again
whoa whoa 17% nine eight six Oh No
I could totally bail out but I don't
want to oh yeah I'll give them that you
want to be careful too in the plains
when you turn because when you turn you
present a larger target oh geez now they
would behemoth the behemoths are kind of
cool the giant blimps almost like
gunships
ah man that was my totally my fault his
accident that was gonna turn last-second
I want to kill that guy and that gun guy
oh there's no plane up already do to me
yes there is the behemoth oh my do I hit
him once
yeah the flying is pretty realistic in
the sense that even small arms fire is
going to put little holes in your wings
and stuff that will affect the way they
fly when I first played this before I
even did this video I was kind of mad
like damn it
the plans are way too weak sauce that I
remembered that's how they were back
then I mean they really were like they
were they were they were paper wood and
fabric I mean that's how they were built
and then they in World War one is when
the first time planes were used in
warfare and literally the Bombers the
guys would throw the bombs over the side
of the plane with their hands there was
there was no it would not like today
where they had armor and stuff so it's
really kind of realistic in my mind and
I like it I like it a lot the music
starts to get really intense towards the
end of the game that's always fun it
makes you play a little better like oh
yeah he's coming to movie I like to post
up here on these on these fences here
with my anti-tank rocket all they don't
get sniped I can do some serious damage
with this thing say it's not like I run
around
no kit there got another one good now
I'm getting sniped at as you can see
there's a guy down here right enough ah
man
see you gotta watch out for the snipers
man that guy was way back there in the
hill so yeah anyway guys that's that's
it
that is battlefield one airplane action
show you guys you guys know I'd like to
fly if you've been following my me long
enough and play watch me my old live
streams on battlefield 3 for whatever
flying is my thing on the ground yeah I
can be kind of a bullet sponge to let
other people do stuff that's actually
worthwhile but when it comes to flying
that's my thing that's that's what I do
so anyway guys it's time to get out of
here thanks for watching this mediocre
gameplay of me playing some battlefield
1 I hope you guys enjoyed yeah I'm gonna
play more often I'll probably live
stream this game can't wait to see what
the additional loadouts and stuff are
gonna be but with that said guys I'm
gonna get out of here thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
mediocre geez - since video will keep it
real around here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
