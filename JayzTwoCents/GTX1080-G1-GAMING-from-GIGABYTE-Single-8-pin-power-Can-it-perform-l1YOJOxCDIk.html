going to be playing around with some mic
configurations here and in my new 8040
53b condenser mic which I'm gonna be
using with my camera isn't here yet so
the meantime I'm going to be using my
new audio technica 2035 new Jerry only
has a 20/20 because he can't Ford a 20
35 actually I'm just kidding that guy's
got way more money than I do
today's video is brought to you by
Squarespace com / Jays two cents and if
you remember last year when I was doing
my custom cycle jerseys I needed a way
to sell those and I'm not a web
developer so I actually headed on over
to Squarespace comm and check out some
of their e-commerce stuff and I was
actually able to build an e-commerce
site by just using some simple tools on
their website and I sold my custom
cycling jerseys in no time I literally
set it up overnight and if you guys want
to build your own website right now
regardless of what type of website that
is head on over to Squarespace comm /
Jays two cents use offer code J's J a
y'see and save 10% on your order and if
you sign up for a year you get a domain
absolutely free so it's graphics card
season and we're on the cusp of Andy
launching their new cards and we are now
in the middle of all of the custom a IB
partner cards launching for the GTX 1080
and with that you guys know that means
there's going to be a bunch of custom
cards and custom flavors coming out and
we're gonna be taking a look at pretty
much all of them we've already taken a
look at a few here on this channel and
today we're gonna be looking
specifically at gigabytes g1 gaming now
the g1 gaming line from gigabyte has
always been kind of a fan favorite
amongst not only myself but gamers
because the windforce cooler was really
a big thing back in the day when it
first came out three fans on there tons
of heat pipes keeping things as cool as
possible so that's absolutely no
different here when it comes to the g1
gaming vector g1 gaming is really what
kind of it really sort of replaced the
wind force line if you will used to calm
wind force now that home g1 gaming but
makes this card kind of interesting is
the fact that it is a custom PCB it is
not a founders PCB but what's
interesting about that is whereas
everyone's kind of taken the custom
board partner designs into going with
multiple power connectors this one
really kind of kept it simple it's the
factory length of about
eleven inches it doesn't have a taller
design so it's going to fit in smaller
form factor cases and it has a single 8
pin PCIe power with the factory 180 watt
TDP so it's not really looking at
drawing a whole lot of power
now with that a lot of people would say
that means it's not a very good
overclocker but obviously we're going to
test that in this video because
overclocking is my thing
and I kind of already showed with the
MSI gaming X that the extra power pin
and the etch the tons of extra power
phases really didn't seem to make much
difference when it came to overclocking
so I'm interested to see how it does
with this guy actually I've already done
it I spend a lot of time with this card
already but you know movie magic here
we're pretending like we didn't do it
for the sake of like dramatic effect I'm
going to start off with the elephant in
the room here regarding the cooler is
yes there is orange accenting on it it
seems like this time around orange is
the new red everybody seems to be doing
orange now I've seen some complaints on
the internet saying why is it orange I
don't want to look at orange well unless
you have a case that's holding the card
up like this when you're looking at it
in your case you're not going to see the
orange but instead what you're going to
see here is the glowing RGB gigabyte
logo as well as the fan stop logo now
what that fan stop means is when the
card is running at idle the factory fan
curve on this turns the fans off so it's
a hundred percent silent that
illuminates just to tell you hey your
fans are off but you can also go into
the guru app and you can actually turn
that off if you don't want to see that
or change the RGB color of it of course
it has a backplate you guys know if it
doesn't have a backplate at the price
that these things cost all 1080s for
that matter I think they know that they
would kind of get ripped if they didn't
have a backplate well it has one and it
offers a little bit of rigid support
which also means it is not going to
really sag when you when you put it in
your case now of course card sag has to
do with the weight of the card
fortunately gigabyte has done a very
good job at keeping this thing light
it's really not that heavy
in fact it's a lot lighter than even the
founder's card because the founder's
card has that giant heavy aluminum
shroud on there with the vapor chamber
and all that stuff but gigabyte has
found a way to keep this card cool with
only three copper heat pipes and then
aluminum heatsink array or fan a thin
array on here for that matter with three
very lightweight fans and the shroud is
unfortunately PLAs
stick whereas in the past it had been
metal this shroud is indeed plastic
keeping things as light as possible so
obviously we're doing some cooler tests
on this too to see how well it actually
performs in terms of cooling but don't
let that wait fool you it's one of those
things where sometimes you want to judge
something about how good it is about how
heavy it is
but you can't really do that in this
instance on the back of the card it's
got your same connections as founder's
it's got your DVI d1 HDMI 2.0 and 3
display ports what I like that gigabyte
did was for whatever reason and I don't
know why Nvidia did this is it goes to
display ports with an HDMI in the middle
and then another display board so they
kind of switched that where the three
display ports are next to each other and
then the HDMI is on the bottom I don't
know why Nvidia did that it never made
sense to me I never liked it especially
as someone who used uses three display
ports on their array here having them
separated like that looked really stupid
even though you're not looking at the
back of it it's just one of those things
that makes you wonder why did they do it
so gigabyte has actually corrected that
now one of the things that's really
different this time around regarding the
1080 s is I'm noticing a lack of
physical BIOS switches for changing the
OC presets and such when it comes to the
graphics cards and a lot of companies
seem to be going along with this whole
concept of software-controlled which I
think kind of stinks in a way because
that forces you into using their
software if you want to use the
out-of-the-box profiles now this card
does feature two profiles it has got the
gaming mode which has a base clock of
1695 megahertz and a boost clock of
eighteen hundred and thirty five so it's
roughly a hundred megahertz faster than
founders out of the box at least with
the gaming mode if you switch it to OC
mode it's seventeen hundred and twenty
one base and eighteen hundred and sixty
mega Hertz boost clock now in terms of
the testing methodology with the 1080 I
just want to point out as you guys look
at the graphics charts here coming up is
I am doing all of my testing with the
fastest boost clock settings that the
graphics card ship with so in this case
I'm using the OC mode same thing with
all the other cards you're going to see
in the chart I'm letting them boost up
as far as they'll go
which in all of these cases is beyond
the actual boost clock because of how
GPU boost 3.0 works so I'm not letting
the overclocking ability pass those
boost clocks
influence numbers whatsoever so it
really is going to be indicative of what
you would get out of the box if all the
perimeters allow it to boost up as far
as mine that's up to you
but I can't really slow down the cards
GPU boost just wants to go where it
wants to go so I want to point that out
so with that said and the hours and
hours spent benchmarking this thing
let's go ahead and look at those charts
and let's come back with some final
plots it's kind of a cookie cutter way
we do these reviews around here
now this card went right past the 1800
and 60 megahertz boost and went right up
to 1936 which is pretty amazing
considering how out of the box just
under 2,000 megahertz is kind of a thing
now but anyway I was able to actually
overclock this thing to twenty one
hundred and one megahertz 2101
and that's that's kind of been the
magical number that a lot of people
having a hard time hitting but in terms
of the numbers I don't think anyone's
surprised here considering all ten 80s
are going to pretty much perform very
very similar they're going to overclock
very similar unless you get a really
poor silicon lottery winner so I don't
think anyone expected there to be more
than a 1 or 2 FPS difference between
other 1080s that are clock the same but
what really comes down to attendees is
again the cooler it comes down to noise
it comes down to coil whine sighs wait
yeah does length obviously matters in
some cases but coil whine on the g1
gaming was mostly absent I say mostly
remember I do my testing in an open air
test bench and I do sit only two and a
half feet away from it so in scenes
where FPS goes really high especially in
1080p gaming there is some coil whine
but if you put on something like vsync
or g-sync then you are going to have
that coil whine really reduced because
the FPS is not running out of control
causing the inductors to just go
absolutely insane and vibrate with
excitement like I tend to do when I get
to do graphics card reviews but once
again here we go with twenty one hundred
and one megahertz I know I can go
farther if I can get full control over
the voltage and get it to stop bouncing
around all over the place single eight
pin PCI Express power 180 watts TDP and
we are doing it with eight plus two
foul-up eight I can't even say eight
plus two phase power so ten phase power
for clean delivery and not drawing a lot
of power giving you really low
temperatures the sting only set at 72
see when it bumped up to almost 2,000
megahertz by itself and then setting the
fans to 50% again barely even Otto
whatsoever temperature stayed at 61c
while overclocked yeah I think gigabyte
has done it again the g1 gaming card is
definitely a fan favorite amongst the
audience
definitely a card worth looking at if
you guys are shopping for GTX 1080s so
with that said I'm going to get out of
here thanks for watching guys let me
know what you think about the g1 gaming
GTX 1080 from gigabyte always been a fan
of their cards performs very very well
and it doesn't it's not like a massively
humongous card it's it's no bigger than
founder so it doesn't take a giant PCB
to pull off the numbers like you guys
are seeing so tell me what you think I
don't know if it's available yet at the
time of this video publicly but
hopefully soon and like I said hopefully
pricing is not too out of control but
with that said tell me what you guys
think about this card and I'll see you
guys in the next video as always thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
