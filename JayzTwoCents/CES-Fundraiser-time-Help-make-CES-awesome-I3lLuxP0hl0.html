CES time we are doing our annual
fundraiser once again for the third year
in a row where I am crowdfunding my trip
to CES this January CES is the Consumer
Electronics Show where all the major
companies in the industry bringing you
the latest in technology we're all there
taking a look at it Linus tech of
tomorrow tech syndicate Austin Evans
myself newegg TV I mean everybody is
gonna be there it is a pretty major
event and with that it has some pretty
major costs now guys I have a full-time
job I have to take a week off work to
cover this I lose a week of vacation
time and I incur a massive expense to
stay in Las Vegas for a week to bring
you guys this coverage so I have no
choice but to reach out to you guys for
crowdfunding and I wanted you guys to
feel like you have a direct contribution
towards the success of this convention
registration just opened up and with
that the hotels are booking up fast so
I've got to move fast now I opened up
this tube start campaign earlier today
to Twitter and Facebook and I've got a
report that you guys just shattered the
goal in two hours in fact we have the
fastest goal reached time in all of tube
start in fact they told me that today
that was the fastest goal reached ever
and that's because you guys are freaking
awesome and I have nothing but gratitude
towards you guys that's why I want to
bring you the best possible content ever
in fact some of you guys have even made
a comment like AJ you're right on your
way to having enough money to buy a
Titan z yeah we can earn the Titans now
all dollars earned above the campaign
goal or being reinvested right back into
the channel I mean guys my hardware is
on its last leg my camera is dying it's
overheating constantly and in fact this
mike is actually electrical taped on to
the end of a tripod do you see that you
see that so yeah I could definitely use
some better hardware here if I want to
take things to the next level when it
comes to content for you guys so with
that guys I appreciate all of your
support I understand that not everyone
can contribute that is perfectly okay
just simply watching the videos hitting
like and turning off adblock is actually
a huge help to the channel and if you're
not willing to turn off adblock well hey
that's fine too I understand
ads can actually be pretty damn annoying
sometimes and that there's net speed
issues but depending on where you live
and sometimes the ad won't even play and
I want everyone to enjoy my content so
with that guys I'm gonna get on out of
here head on down to the tube start
campaign link is in the description and
probably annotated right here somewhere
if annotations work I'm going to get the
heck on out of here guys you continue to
be an awesome community and let's make
CES 2015 the best coverage on YouTube
alright guys catch the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
