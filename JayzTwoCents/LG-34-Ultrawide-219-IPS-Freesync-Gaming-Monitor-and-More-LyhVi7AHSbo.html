show here 2015 and guys let's wanna
point out I fix the audio yay so how
about we get a thumbs up for that we're
over here at the LG booth and they are
showing off some of their 21 by nine
full HD ultra wide free sync panels I'll
precincts kind of been something we've
been looking forward to for quite a
while and they've actually got their 34
um 67 panels on display here now these
are not released yet we don't actually
have an ETA on release on this trust me
guys I tried to get that info they
weren't giving it up but you can see
here they got the demo going on where
we're showing free sync on and off and
the difference of tearing and you know
real precise frame times and you guys
know I have 144 hurts panels and you
can't go back to 60 Hertz once you go
with a high refresh rate but I can tell
you right now while actually looking at
free sync in person it's definitely
something to look at because the frame
timings are so precise in terms of
latency between each frame being drawn
that it really does feel like a high
refresh rate monitor even though it's
still locked at 60fps so free sync is
something we've been looking forward to
here in 2015 you can start to expect a
lot more free seat panels this year from
LG and that's of course a good thing we
need competition in the market kandla
g-sync have all the fun so there there
you go guys LG 34 um 67 look for it
later this year
no it wouldn't be the consumer
electronics show if we didn't talk about
4k just a little bit now for kay's
nothing new right we've heard about 4k
for quite a while in fact I first
covered 4k back in 2013 CES now I kind
of want to mention this because there's
this huge kick of 4k when it comes to
computer gaming and console gaming and
all that discussion about whether or not
is good for gaming and yada yada yada
and ultra small screens like the 28 inch
monoprice I took a look at I call that
ultra small because guys here's the
skinny this is where 4k belongs 4k
belongs in your living room in your home
your multimedia Center whatever because
for movies and stuff it is absolutely
phenomenal there's no pixilation
whatsoever even as we push in with the
lens and we look at the screen you can't
even find a pixel with a digital camera
looking at the TV if you guys have ever
taken your camera pushed it in on your
screen or your computer monitor at 1080p
and tried to do any recording you can
see pixels and rainbow colors all over
the place but 4k is designed for large
for Marge formats this is a 75-inch
you've got 100 inch panels right here
ninety four inch panels that is where 4k
is actually really really exciting to
take a look at so I just kind of want to
talk real quick about 4k gaming on
computers and small screens like 28
inches I still personally don't like it
but if you guys want that ultimate home
theater experience then 4k is definitely
where it's at so guys we were taking a
look right here at the Sony 75 inch 4k
Ultra TV I got a look at the name plated
cxb are 75 x 9 40 c I don't know what
they need to come up with some better
nomenclatures for some of their TVs and
stuff but I just want to talk about that
for a moment 4k TVs for movies and
multimedia that's where it's at
I
well another CES is coming to an end
2015 is actually a blast I'm standing
here with sergeant ballistic and we've
had a month tech talk before actually
I'm a fan of his videography and he
makes mine look like crap but anyway I
figured we'd go ahead and kind of talk
about what our favorite moments of CES
2015 was he actually got to spend a lot
more time on the showroom floor than I
did because I was so tied up in meetings
so why don't you go ahead and tell
everyone what your favorite part of the
showroom floor was cuz you saw it all um
I actually really enjoyed Sony going
through there they had some stuff that
everybody's doing a lot of similar stuff
but I like their 4k action cam they have
another camcorder for that's 4k for a
thousand dollars porque for 1k and I can
see a lot of people who are wanting to
get into 4k that being a nice entry
level thing for them right and that's
also obviously with the popularity of
like the Panasonic gh4 they're really
looking at getting into more mainstream
and you know low in entry-level 4k stuff
they even have 4k androids now right
yeah yeah I mean I'm shooting on a note
for and all my stuff to Spokane I just
down sample so now you also spent a real
emphasis on taking a look at smart
watches so what was your favorite
SmartWatch uh I like how the G watch our
i think the most it has more that
traditional form factor of looking like
something like a casio or something like
that so that was my first hands-on with
it here and I like it moto 360 a a
little bit more expensive i think but it
has a little bit more of a premium look
to it i just don't like that little
thing on the bottom so it was nice meaty
you know get hands on with those for the
first time and i'll play with those but
definitely the g watch are did you get
any battery life information on that I
think it has about a three thousand
million power battery life which is you
know matching a lot of smartphones so
right and depending on the notification
setups that you have it will depend on
how long it actually lasts what there
anything else worth mentioning uh
there's a Tesla down there a new Tesla
it has a panasonic screening there 17
inch inch for anyone linux apparently i
thought of that that'll make some people
happy yeah Oh bun 20 like I get a Linux
without mentioning gubu um well I mean I
got to take a look at a lot of the pc
stuff obviously um you know that this
isn't really like groundbreaking event
for anything pc why is this is this is
more or less just kind of like a you
know
a public relations I event for them
computex is office obviously we're all
that is honestly the highlight for me
and I mentioned it on the tech you know
we did the tech with Logan last night
the concept of that kinetic cooler now
no it's not new I know there's been
other companies that have tried this
before and many have failed but this is
the first time that a supergiant like
cooler master's actually gotten involved
in the project and they've done lots and
lots of testing on that and the idea of
the kinetic cooling is actually very
very cool no pun intended in the fact
that it's very low energy very very low
noise in fact it was practically silent
compared to a standard bladed fan around
the showroom floor and stuff really it
was like drone expo over there in the
south hall a lot more VR this year we
saw a lot of virtual reality in their
mom had a VR headset now even smaller
companies you know so I guess that means
that the technology is getting you know
more adoptable by even you know smaller
Chinese companies and stuff like that so
it's well especially with razor
announcing the other open source vr the
idea behind the open source is being
able to do many people can take bear
headset of choice maybe they have
Chinese versions that are cheaper and
they could actually have a firmware for
it and and hack in one of the things I
like that razor said was they really
really wanted the community to hack it
they really wanted the community to see
what could you do with it and the fact
that it's open source you could you
could take software you're riding on OS
vr from razor and actually load it on an
oculus and do whatever you want with it
and especially we had a discussion with
them about the concept of augmented
reality through a VR headset so cameras
that actually showing you what's in
front of you but instead of dealing with
a fully virtual environment you're
actually dealing with a virtual
augmented interactive environment which
that kind of made me excited with you
know oculus is getting a lot more
corporate a few people are here looking
to you know pull out that we're really
really interested because it could be it
could be a stopgap for some people who
you know it might not have the
connections and stuff like that so an
open source more adoptable platform is
definitely great yeah exactly and
there's a lot of boots here that are
showing their own VR stuff and a lot of
them are running the you know the oculus
platform well hey guys has been sergeant
ballistic JC cents here closing out CES
2015 consumer electronics show it is a
lot of fun I am extremely tired I don't
know about you but I think somewhere in
the neighborhood of nearly a hundred
thousand steps for the entire week yours
is probably a lot more
and as always guys just want to go ahead
and thank you for once again the
fundraiser campaign remember we did this
without a single ad or commercial for
the entire week because of the fact that
you guys in your generous support have
actually brought this coverage this year
so it's time for us to go ahead and get
out of here and drive across the desert
get home and try and recover so as
always guys following twitter if you
have any questions sergeant ballistic
you'll find his information down in the
description as well as his Twitter and
all that information and guys we'll see
you in the next one
haha
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
