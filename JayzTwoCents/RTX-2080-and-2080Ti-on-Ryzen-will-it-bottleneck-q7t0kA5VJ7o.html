gonna take a little break from our
overclocking competition with our
friends over at gamers Nexus and Paul
got in there - he's in the top 10 now I
believe he's number 10 he's got a lot
distance to make up but he's in the top
10 nonetheless we're taking a break
because I promised you guys when r-tx
launched that I was going to compare it
to rise N and a lot of you guys have
been like where is the reson video and
we want to see if risin is holding back
this level of graphics arguably the 2080
TI is the fastest single gaming kart
single GPU gaming card that you can buy
right now Titan V excluded not really a
gaming card so we want to see if this
level of performance is being held back
by our 2700 X 16 gigabytes of RAM rig
which is very much more representative
of what you would see in the average
gamer you're more likely to see a system
like this and say our 79 80 XE so is it
bottlenecking
let's find out do you want to be cooler
do you want to be more desirable well
you're in luck because right now you can
own your very own JS to send swag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below so we're gonna do this
very similar to how I did the initial
launch because that was an 8700 K system
with 16 gigabytes of RAM I am going to
be benchmarking the same titles that we
did at launch with a 20 80 and the 20 80
TI now this is the EVGA DG 8 DG 77 case
I almost said 87 that's a whole
different TV looking one I also took the
front panel off so that has open airflow
this is not the most high flow design
and then I'll be leaving the side panel
off too because this is just a box to
hold our parts this is not reminiscent
of what the thermals like so as I
mentioned this is a 2700 X system it is
running out of the box settings just
like I did on my 8700 K I will allow it
to do a
why isn't this going in there does
anybody know how to install a GPU so
it's out-of-the-box settings for the CPU
no overclocking there I will be however
enabling the faster memory because we
know that Rison likes faster memory and
we're not gonna choke it there so we are
going to at the end of the day run all
the benchmarks we are going to compare
the results and then that should
theoretically give us a pretty good
example of whether or not this is slower
than 8700 K we have had two more driver
revisions from Nvidia
ever since we got our test samples which
was on a4 11.5 for driver we've had for
11.6 3 and now for 11.7 oh is out
however the release notes on these none
of them mention anything about improved
performance out of Rison they are simply
game ready drivers with game profiles
for the newest games like Assassin's
Creed and all that stuff so with that
said let's fire it up where's the button
pretty yeah I want RGB puke on this one
okay so we just spent the last couple
hours benchmarking our founders Edition
20 80 and 20 atti with our AMD 2700 X
and 16 gigabytes of with a g.skill flair
X which is rise in optimize memory now
let's talk about a couple things real
quick to make sure it's fair the 8700 K
on the ASUS Maximus board that we used
on our test bench when these first
launched was set to like core
performance mode where it will basically
apply the turbo clock to all the cores
we enabled that same setting on this
asus motherboard which is the new
crosshair 7 i think it is across there 6
whatever the latest one was and it's
doing the same thing for AMD so it is
turbo in all the cores as high as
they'll go which is giving it the same
scenario leverage advantage whatever if
we had done that on intel or not AMD
obviously that would have been a stack
test and we don't want that because my
phone made noise obviously Rison
processors are very very popular
especially with the second iteration
with the 2700 X 2,600 2,600 X and all
that ever since Verizon launched it has
kind of caused a splash in the cpu
market AMD gaining back a ton of wild
market share amongst gamers and
productivity specialists because of its
much improved IPC vs. FX and the fact
that it has just turned into a
multi-threading beast with eight core 16
thread available in the three hundred
dollar range with the 1800 X so it's
very valid to talk about this for gamers
and streamers and all that now the
results were pretty much as I expected
as we move towards a higher frame or the
higher graphics like 1440p 4k we see all
of the while the processing being
offloaded onto the GPU and these scores
are very very comparable what you'll
notice if you look at the charts very
carefully is the synthetic benchmarks
like the synthetic benchmarks like fire
strike times by superposition Metro last
light not so much but because they are
synthetics they are designed to do only
one thing and that is stress your GPU
they are very very close a couple of
percentage points here and they're kind
of given to Intel or AMD back and forth
where it's margin of error there's a lot
of different things that could account
for that you would never notice that in
day to day and most people could stop at
that and say see they are perfectly
matched
but that's not a real-world test and
that's why we test synthetics as well as
gaming titles so we've looked at rise of
the Tomb Raider shadow of the Tomb
Raider and we also looked at Far Cry 5 I
tried to get my wildlands to load but it
was having problems and so we didn't
spend the time to download another 60
gigabytes worth of game but the story is
pretty interesting because rise of the
Tomb Raider is an AMD title it's got the
AMD splash screen it was built in
conjunction with AMD development and so
ad money and all that but we saw that on
Rison 2700 X we got better scores with
the same GPUs than we did on the Intel
8700 K in that title specifically it
really pulled ahead but when we looked
at shadow of the Tomb Raider which is
the most modern title for Tomb Raider we
saw it kind of go the other way that
there was definitely a reduction in
performance when we had the same
graphics cards plugged into our 2700 X
versus our 8700 K now that could be for
a lot of different reasons it could be a
little bit more CPU overhead but as
games evolving moved more forward
forward facing and future proofing I
guess we've seen a lot of studios and
developers really move towards
multi-threading which has kind of
alleviated the bottleneck in a way
because that's a shared workload across
all of the cores something that until
the last few years hadn't really been
leveraged as much as possible but we
look at Far Cry 5 which is a notoriously
heavy CPU title especially when you're
playing the game we were surprised to
see an anomaly here then where I was
getting the exact same score while one
FPS difference back and forth between
1440p and 1080 which would tell me
immediately that there was some sort of
the CPU bottleneck but given the fact
that this was a built-in benchmark and
not the actual gameplay itself I
investigated a little bit further and we
turned on the overlay on MSI Afterburner
and we saw that one core was always
pegged at a hundred percent sometimes it
was stuck on core 9 or core 7 and the
it's supposed to be moved around to
share the workload so that it doesn't
for cooling reasons it wants to not heat
just one core in the die and so it was
surprising to see that there was always
at least one core maxed out even in the
menu and you can see that the GPU was
sitting only in the 50 or 60 percent
usage and the core speed stay high and
temp stayed low because the GPU was not
being leveraged but we looked at the CPU
it was not being pegged entirely there
were lots of course in there in the
single-digit utilization doing nothing
so this is obviously an anomaly with the
far cry title at the end of the day here
would be my recommendation if you were
Eisen and you are considering getting a
twenty eighty or twenty atti as you step
it up to the twenty atti that is
obviously the Bohemia of a graphics card
these were not overclocked these were
out of the box settings for both Intel
and AMD and since we are seeing a little
bit of hole hold back I want to say
bottleneck because it wasn't really
bottlenecking there was definitely a CPU
intervention with how far the GPU could
go if we were to overclock it that would
have only exacerbated our results and
made them that's always a fun word to
say exactly I feel like I'm being dirty
but I'm not like I'm getting around the
parental filter I think I'm on a tangent
right now I should probably be back on
topic but I digress well I haven't I've
been singing enough lately but depending
on the titles that you play like the new
battlefield 5 battlefield 4 titles that
are very much more GPU friendly mmo's
games like World of Warcraft they're
always gonna be CPU bound because
there's just so much of a world to have
to render all those player models have
to be rendered all the data this players
doing this you got 300 people sitting in
one area the CPU has to make sense of
all of that where the graphics card just
sort of handles the pretty post
processing the CPU handles most
everything else but the 20 atti could
potentially be held back by the 2700 X
if you don't overclock your 2700 this is
like I said this is all out-of-the-box
settings with the exception of the one
core enhancement check that I did on the
BIOS but the 20/80 itself though
definitely seems like it had no problems
with the 2700 X and could definitely
hold its own without feeling like it was
being held back it's only good when you
go to the extremely expensive and
over-the-top and overkill 2,800 Ti that
you really start to feel some sort of
restriction in your gaming experience
but this is a topic that we will
investigate more completes we I want to
do more titles when battlefield 5 is out
I wanted to add
I want to add like final fantasy but not
til DL SS is out because once that's a
thing that might help the cpu's because
in the GP doesn't have to handle all of
the post-processing and the anti
aliasing but again features that don't
exist
on our very expensive very shiny paper
weights be honest I mean I still play
games very well but there's features in
there they're not unlocked it's like
Tesla's autonomous driving it's there
it's baked in
you just can't access it it's not
allowed yet that's kind of where we are
with these cards but go ahead and game
freely on either platform that you like
because really unless you're on
something as old as like an FX or a
Celeron or something like that you're
gonna be just fine with the latest and
greatest all right guys thanks for
watching it as always we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
