and we're going to start getting into
some warm months here pretty soon so I
figured this year we'll get things
started a little bit early when it comes
to the cooling videos especially right
now during the warm months for many
people this is when you can get the most
overclocking done so my friends over at
ek have launched a brand new fan called
the bard our bard our vard Vardar
they're from Slovenia I have no idea
what that means honestly if you guys
know please tell me but anyway these
fans are pretty much going to set a new
standard when it comes to static
pressure and water cooling then again
that that's not really all that
surprising given its you know ek which
is a water cooling company with its
improved radiator support and legendary
noise optimization the new define are
five from fractal design is a PC
builders dream come true click the link
in the description to learn more all
right now when it comes to fan reviews
I'm not a big fan do you see what I did
there of specs on the box because often
times companies will put their best
specs in a wide open atmosphere with
zero ambient noise when it comes to
measuring things like sound and static
pressure and air flow I mean really when
it comes to real-world how many times
have we seen fans advertise that they're
super quiet 18 decibels but the moment
you turn them on it's like the loudest
turbine engine you've ever heard so
we're going to go ahead and we're going
to talk about the specs we're going to
put see what they put on the box
and then we are going to go ahead and
test this one ourselves now there's a
whole range of what our fans they have
this is the FT - 120 it's a 1450 rpm 120
millimeter fan it's a high static
pressure fan specifically designed for
static pressure and I've got F 1 F 2 F 3
F 4 and F F 5 now they did send me 14 50
and eighteen hundred and fifty rpm
variants today we're looking at the 1450
I think this is going to be more or less
the sweet spot that people are going to
be spending when it comes to RPMs on
different water cooling and case fans
and whatnot now these are 1450 RPM plus
or minus 10% rated voltage 12-volt DC
and power draw of 0.7 3 watts that's the
first step that I think is really kind
of a telltale of where these fans are
really going to fit in in your systems
and we'll talk about that now this
version here is the PWM they do have a 3
pin and a 4 pin PWM this is a PWM but of
course pulse width modulation fans can
work on 3 pin DC direct output or DC
output like I'm have hugged up here to
the motherboard so we are going to be
testing today and DC that way I can ramp
them up and down when we do our test
air flows advertised at 88.4 m3h instead
of pressure of 14 psi what that is
honestly this must be a metric thing
because normally fans are rated in mmh
to O of static pressure so I really
don't know what 14 PA is if you guys are
like physicists out there watching me
one why the heck are you watching me and
to tell me what that means
whatever loudness 25.6 DBA that seems
believable doesn't seem outrageous
operating pressure okay fine life
expectancy 50,000 rpm or 50,000 hours
50,000 rpm this thing is an airplane now
the physical aspects of this if you guys
are familiar with fans remember the old
gentle typhoons these actually look a
lot like that but there's actually a
side by side photos of these on sites
like overclock net that show these are
quite a bit different but we do have one
two three four five six seven blades and
we do have a vented hub on here which is
nice it's going to keep the different
phases here in the motor cool one of the
things that happens with fan motors over
time is they get hot and they wear out
but this as you can see is vented so as
the air is coming through the fan and
pushing out and pulling in it's going to
also be offering a little bit of cooling
now the downside to that is if you do
want to paint the blades themselves
because as you can see here the black
and gray is was my biggest complaint
about the Typhoon's they were black and
gray and then the naktu is which are
pretty famous or brown and poop tan
color they do allow for an all-black
version I don't know why they didn't
send me that but anyway we're taking a
look at the gray one here if you want to
paint this you've got to remove the
blades from the hub which you know
sometimes is a little bit scary it's not
easy to remove these fan blades I
started to tear the label back to see
how easy the label would come off the
label starts to tear so the moment you
take off the desk cover
yeah you're probably going to end up
need to put a new sticker on there of
some sort so but when it comes to
voltage draw that does say right on here
DC 12 volt 0.06 1 amps that is extremely
low current which means that this you
could daisy chain these things for days
on fan controllers that are capable of
30 watts like most motherboards like my
eyes rock here is capable of at least 24
watts and 1 amp you could daisy chain
well a lot of these I can't do math
really quickly off the top of my head
but point 0 6 1 amps means you could put
quite a few of these together before you
get that one amp
you know max draw on many of the headers
so let's go ahead and do some airflow
test it's been a while since I've done
any sort of you know experiment here on
this channel let's go ahead and do that
now I've got a couple of really ghetto
extensions here plugged into a chassis
header on my asrock motherboard my ex 99
fatality extreme motherboard over there
and as you can see right now I've got it
hooked up to speed fan and speed fans
been configured for this motherboard so
I can now control this header so this is
a PWM fan but it is hooked up right now
to a DC 3 pin output so that's how we're
going to be connect or controlling it
now starting voltage on this I've
noticed is at 50% and as you can see it
started to go for a second there and
then it stopped
55 and starting voltage on this seems to
be a little bit inconsistent see I
didn't touch anything and now it started
if I put this back down to say 50 it'll
keep running if I go below 50 the fan
will stop because it seems that 6 volts
is right around where the starting
voltage is on this so if I go back up to
50% you see the fan does continue to run
now let's go ahead and see how much air
we're actually moving in terms of the
paper test at 50% believe it or not guys
I do have an air flow meter but I don't
really care what the air flow meter is I
kind of want to give you guys a visual
I mean I could show you a number but
that doesn't really equate to how much
air that is that's moving or pressure so
we're going to put this in the corner of
the fan because we know that that is
where the most airflow is coming out the
corners of the fans and let's go ahead
and see if I turn this like that and you
guys get a pretty good representation of
what it looks like so it's going to go
starting voltage of 50 percent what I
will tell you right now is this thing is
extremely quiet right now with my ear
against it I can't even I can't even
hear it I've had 50% so theoretically
this should be right around 700 rpm so
it's going bumpin up to 60% and see how
the paper reacts you see we're starting
to get up off the table a little bit
there
65% still can't hear my mics right here
in fact if you guys are hearing anything
it's probably the 3 gelid fans that are
inside my radiator right there because
they're not being controlled yeah I know
it's kind of a contaminated environment
for this test but this isn't so much
about noise for me as it is for static
pressure but I will say right now there
this is an extremely quiet fan
they sent me a box of these of a feeling
they're going to be going in some
systems so at 65% there's just a faint
hum with my ear against the damn thing
I'm actually taking a risk of cutting my
ear off I guess things I do for this
channel alright 70% now we can hear a
little bit of a hum see if the mic picks
it up
75% incoming now I can hear the fan a
little bit I hear ok the moment I picked
it up off the table all the sound went
away so what we're getting here is a
little bit of vibration from the motor
translate translated into the table and
so we're hearing that if I see if that
might can pick it up and probably not
but the moment it touches the table so
if you were going to mount these things
you definitely are going to want to use
some sort of maybe rubber stand off or
something anti vibration mount then it
wouldn't be an issue at all so anyway
that is 75 percent
eighty percent eighty five ninety now I
can really hear it but again the moment
I pick it up the noise is gone there's
no more vibration 95 and 100 what I've
noticed is that there's really no rpm
difference between 95 and 100
according to speedfan this thing is
running right now fourteen hundred and
twenty seven rpm so pretty much right in
the advertised range 1468 so we're
definitely getting our 1450 that you
paid for and as you can see right here
based on the piece of paper we do have a
pretty good amount of static pressure
coming off the front of the fan now that
may not look all that impressive but
what if I did this what if I took this
piece of paper and put it all the way
out here as you can see the paper is
laying flat but the moment I go in front
of the fan let's say even way out here
what does that tell you what does that
tell you now about the static pressure
of this fan see straight up and down or
that you can tell right when it gets
into the wind tunnel of the fan right
there that see it doesn't matter which
way I hold it that's actually pretty
impressive and the closer we get to the
fan you can see it's it maintains that
amount of pressure way out in front of
it so that's pretty impressive but what
I also have here is a 120 millimeter
radiator because you can't test static
pressure without putting some sort of
resistance on the fan so let's go ahead
and mount this thing up in the radiator
here which happens to be an alpha cool
radiator and let's go ahead and see how
it does when you put some resistance in
front of it alright so here's our little
setup here with the single 120 rad and
one of the Vitara fans on there the
fourteen hundred and fifty rpm let's go
ahead and put our little piece of paper
back on there on the middle of the rad I
want to see how the middle of the
radiator fares on this and let's do once
again our startup voltage of about six
volts alright the fan is turning so you
can see that
Ben is turning and you can see we're not
getting too much happening on the paper
but I do feel air coming through with my
hand there go up to 60 70 80 90 and 100
these fans are extremely quiet those
gelid fans over there and that triple
are way louder than these in fact I can
guarantee you we're three of these fans
are going these are right now at a
hundred percent I'm going to actually
put this thing next to my mic
I don't think eyes can hear that this
thing is freakishly quiet and yet look
how much static pressure we're
maintaining through the radiator now
let's go and take our piece of paper
over here
and do the same thing in front of it
look at this that is pushing through a
radiator now if you were to do push-pull
on this thing that would be even crazier
those gallons right there and stupidly
loud so I can promise you now I mean
they sent me a bunch of these because I
said hey guys you know they ask people
when to do this review I said yeah send
them over if I like them I'll ask for
more so they basically sent me a box of
them said if you don't like any better
send them back well guys you're not
getting them back these this fan right
here holy crap
alright this fan at a hundred percent
right here in front of me I can't even
hear it over those over there and if you
look at the static pressure here
considering it's pushing through a
radiator I think you guys would have to
agree that this is a pretty impressive
fan for what it is so all right well
there you go guys that is the new road
our fan here from ek this specifically
the FT - 120 1450 I imagine the 1850
would probably be a bit louder and a lot
more pressure in fact you know what for
the sake of the video being a bit longer
I'm going to grab one I'll be right back
to cue the transition transition
all right like I said I had no
intentions of actually busting out the
1850 rpm version of this fan because I
personally would have never used in 1850
rpm fan specifically because of the
noise so based on how quiet the 1450 is
I've got to see how 400 more rpm
performs and the noise level on the
motor because this motor is stupidly
quiet but it looks like there's a lot of
phases in the motor it's well cooled
it's well oiled doesn't say what kind of
bearing it is on here I wish it said
what type of bearing it is but it
doesn't actually say I'm sure you guys
could find out on the website so there's
the 1450 we're going to actually do the
swap normally I would have just cut and
then it would have been on but I want to
go ahead and just do this one on camera
so here's an 1850 let's go ahead and do
the standalone tests before we put it on
the rad see what the starting voltage
and all that is now if the motor isn't
super buzzy what tends to happen with
fans that are higher rpm that you slow
them down as you slow down the fan you
get a much more buzzy motor because the
motor is operating on a much lower
voltage than optimal so right now this
is running at 1,000 rpm at 60% let's put
it back to 50 let's take our paper stick
it on the corner alright so there's our
paper right there at 776 rpm this is a
thousand rpm 972 here's 70 percent 1200
rpm 80% 1500 rpm 90% is 1792 RPM 100%
seventeen hundred and seventy-six rpm
it's like we're not quite getting the
1850 but we are within the now we're at
1800 there seems to be a bit more
vibration in this though at this rpm but
as you can see by the paper it's
considerably louder let's listen there's
a bit of a motor hum and but as you can
tell by the paper though I mean look at
this I mean if that doesn't look how
much more that that paper is a move this
back look how much more that papers
pushing out of the way there so let's go
ahead and stick this thing on the
radiator and see how it does all right
so we're mounting up on the rad once
again 1,850 rpms let's put our paper on
there I've pretty much already know what
to expect with this it's going to be the
same level of performance let's go to
starting voltage 50 rpm or 50% let's
drop the plug can certainly feel the air
moving through now moving the paper too
much though 60 we're still at a thousand
rpm here 70% that's 1300 rpm 80 9100 so
yeah as you can see it definitely
delivers when it comes to the static
pressure there's there's no denying that
at all way that I'm just barely holding
on to that paper and let it kind of fly
around in the wind there so noise wise
though yeah play a cooling device well
duh well there we go guys whoa whoa all
right there you go the new Vdara fans
here from ek I don't believe these are a
rebrand honestly I think this is their
own their own fan if you guys are doing
water cooled systems they do come in
black also you should definitely check
these out because in terms of static
pressure noise and performance as long
as a lifespan holds up and the weight of
these fans is also insane there they're
actually way heavier than like my
Corsair fans I think I might have a new
favorite fan and that has nothing to do
with the fact that they've sent me a lot
of water cooling stuff in the past I'm
hard on fans I'm very picky about fans
and the performance of these things
definitely live up to the standard
especially the J standard alright guys
going to get on out of here make sure
you guys follow on Twitter Facebook
Instagram all that fun stuff and you
guys will always know what's coming on
the channel thanks for your continued
views and support it means a lot to me
and my family and just keeps this being
fun this wasn't fun I wouldn't be here
doing this for you every chance I could
get so I'm gonna get out of here I
suggest you guys do that to go play some
games or do something fun send me some
pictures of what you guys are doing with
your computers and stuff and as always
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
