cents and we're back with a little bit
of a tech vlog II bloggy thing that
we're gonna go ahead and do today
because if you're not aware or you live
under a rock or in a barn which would be
really interesting if you have the
Internet in those places Apple unveiled
their brand new iPhones today which is
kind of a milestone for them because
it's the first time they've ever
unveiled two new phones at the same time
so we're gonna go ahead and talk about
that and whether or not these phones are
right for you how they stack up against
some of the other androids that are on
the market and whether or not you should
just skip this generation all together
okay so right off the bat I don't want
this to turn into an iPhone or Apple
versus Android conversation I truly
don't because I I firmly believe that
both phones offer something to the
market that the other doesn't or vice
versa and they definitely have their
places in this market my daily use phone
is an iphone 5 here it is right here
it's a white one or I guess I call it
white but it's really more or less
aluminium with some white glass on it I
do also carry a galaxy s3 for work and I
do regularly keep my eyes on the windows
phone instead of going on with Windows 8
Phone and the sum of the Nokia another
the some of the other manufacturers of
phones out there with that said I'm not
a fanboy either i prefer iPhone because
I like the simplicity of it a lot of
people like Android because they like
the customer custom ability or
customisation abilities of the Android
so getting into this don't turn this
into a fanboy conversation because
that's not what this is about and that
being what is it that Apple's bring into
the industry here in 2013 because as you
know Apple only releases one phone or
one generation of phone per year
speaking of that as I mentioned in the
intro of this video this is the first
time the apple has released two new
phones at the same time and those being
the iphone 5c and the iphone 5s what we
already knew the iphone 5s was going to
be coming we probably really kind of
knew it was going to be called the 5s
too because it's just the nomenclature
and the apple uses it's definitely
generational it's always been a for for
us you know five would be 5s and you've
got 3 3gs so our 3g 3gs is they're not
very creative on their names now a lot
of people believe that the iphone 5c
stands for color a lot of other people
believe that it's got one of those
double meetings where it could mean
color but it could also mean cheap
because what they're doing now is apple
used to take the old phone and they
would just kind of slide it over on the
chart and listed at 99 bucks or whatever
for the 16 gig and that's that that's
the cheap phone but now that they're
doing is they're discontinuing the
iphone five altogether it's not going to
be available anymore I didn't think it
was anything a shock I mean most of this
stuff was already leaked out in the
internet all we got today was
confirmation that the rumors were true
that is a plastic phone now I am happy
to hear that they have included a metal
backing a steel metal backing or plate
glue to the back side of the plastic
phone which gives it more rigidity so
you have to worry about a creaking
cracking or twisting in your hand which
isn't really a problem anymore because
most of the screens are glass now so
that kind of gives rigidity as well but
it also gives it may be a little bit of
weight to it so it doesn't feel cheap
and it's not really diluting what they
feel is you know the apple brand that
once they went to these metal
constructed phones they are worried
about diluting the product by going
plastic but a lot of people want plastic
it's cheaper it's more durable you know
about denting it I've dented the crap
out of this phone before because I
dropped it and I got it replaced but I
got it dented it on the top and then the
phone twisted and it's just I could like
put it on the table and it would rock
because it was so bent from one drop and
here's the thing you have a cell phone
you're going to drop it so plastic is a
lot more bounce friendly as they say so
I do kind of like that aspect of it it
basically has the same processor that's
in the iPhone 5 it's the a6 processor
it's a little bit faster and other than
that it doesn't really have much think
of it as just a plastic iPhone 5 that's
really all they did there's nothing
really incredible about it for 99 bucks
if you're a new customer or you have an
upgrade in this market if you have a lot
of money it's probably a very good
upgrade path for you or a new phone path
but when it comes to the iphone 5s
there's a couple of increment chain
incremental changes on there it looks
exactly like the iphone 5 which we kind
of expected except they've added a new
color which are calling champagne it
kind of looks like a very faded or pale
color gold which is not I mean like I'm
really disappointed with Apple in this
aspect because this phone is aluminum
since they went with an aluminum phone
it means they could have anodized this
any color they could have done blue red
gold yellow green purple you know I very
got black and silver yellow they could
have done any color because aluminum can
be dyed anodized through or died through
anodizing process so cheaply and people
are saying whoa it's going to add to the
manufacturing costs oh duh what you
don't understand is to protect this
aluminum even the black and the clear
this is anodized this is anodized
aluminum
if you know anything about metalworking
you know that even the clear and the
black are anodized fact let's how you
make it black but even the clear as
anodized they could have given you some
real options with color but I think they
felt if they did that they be
undermining the whole point of the 5c a
little bit I don't know disappointed
they didn't go that route especially
since so many third-party manufacturers
or companies that are now taking these
clear cases and they're anodizing them
where you can get the phone customized
to a color of your own choice people are
already doing that and it's obvious that
people want that once again Apple just
didn't feel like going that route for
whatever reason I don't know whatever
probably the biggest change on the phone
with the exception of the camera because
its face it every single generation is
an incremental change to the camera it's
now got I think this at five layers of
glass it's got a 2.8 aperture it's good
supposed to be good with low light it's
got new camera functions built into it
is the change of the home button and now
instead of having a plastic home button
it is a glass sapphire crystal cover
over the button that is on top of a
fingerprint reader so it's no longer a
push button i don't believe i believe
it's simply a sensor and what that means
is a you know they say you'll have to
slide to unlock it anymore you can just
touch it and it'll unlock because it'll
read your fingerprint a couple of things
that like about that one it probably
means that you've got to sorry about
that it probably means that you have to
have your finger like on it just right
or when i unlock my phone I I tend to
hold it like this linos for you see it I
kind of feel like an idiot now holding
my phone like this but when I push the
home screen how do i how can I do this
there I tend to just kind of push with
the edge of my thumb like the edge of my
thumb and I don't want to now have to be
very you know flat thumbed if that makes
any sense a lot of people are like you
know then now they're gonna be able to
read your fingerprints and si ni lai
conspiracy theorists out there when I
was tweeting this I did say that I mean
who knows what happens with that
fingerprint reading is that a security
risk in itself that's when we reading
your fingerprints I don't anything to
worry about with my fingerprints in fact
i'm already fingerprinted i'm already in
the system I've been in the system for
years because of some
the jobs that I've had security
clearance getting on military bases of
God I'm in the system people rusty
shackleford would be terrified if he was
me I am deep in the system there's a lot
of people out there just don't like the
idea of have a fingerprint reader
because even if they don't set it up a
security every time you touch your phone
your finger touches that reader so is
that a good thing is that a bad thing
it's up to you really and how paranoid
you are with your government depending
on where you live but when it comes to
hardware a little bit better camera it's
got the a7 processor in it which is they
say two times faster it's also got the
m7 processor in it which is it handles
the gyro the java scope accelerometer
GPS and all that sort of stuff so that
it take a offloads those tasks off of
the main processor and it's like a
secondary processor that handles all
those tasks which makes your phone more
efficient faster and they claim it
didn't hurt battery life at all for them
to add this other processor in there so
that's kind of a cool thing cool thing
about it being the same size and
dimensions as the iphone 5 it means all
your cases and accessories are going to
fit everything is going to be the same
there it's not like when you went from
the four to the five or the 4s to the
fly via to get all new accessories so at
least you have one more generation there
and when it comes to the rear camera
they did add another led for brighter
more blinding photos in the dark in the
movie theatres and all those gabby girls
taking photos and blending the out
of you but really the only thing that i
think is exciting is the iOS 7 change
and the reason for that is because it's
a whole new staff for iOS 7 I mean if
you guys remember last year they cleaned
house came from the guy's name he
resigned from Apple he was the guy that
was in charge of iOS a lot of people an
apple kind of felt that he might have
been holding things back when it comes
to iOS advancement so he departed from
the company and now you've got other
people running iOS so we got a OS 7
which is supposed to bring 200 new
features maybe good maybe maybe bad oh
no seeing that took a poll today and I
think it said eighty eighty percent or
eighty-one percent of people polled felt
the iOS 7 was a good change for Apple
really what it is is it's I heard there
was a really funny quote on cnet today
where they Apple was claiming that the
this whole operating system iOS 7 is
supposed to make them more android free
be more free of android like breaking
itself apart and the guy that was
talking about this article is like if
you ask me I see an awful lot of Android
inside of iOS 7 because really what
Apple is doing now is catching up to a
lot of the software development changes
that have taken place with the the
google developers and that's perfectly
okay with me because the farther Apple
falls behind the more people are going
to play apples going to play catch up if
they do catch up it means Google is
going to keep pushing ahead and you need
companies like Apple and Google to be
competing for US consumers to have
really cool choices and options in this
market now that brings me to the last
thing I want to talk about here is
Android and Apple and which is right for
you if you're like me and you are a tech
head and you work in a software
development office and you are dealing
with technical issues and IT and
software updates and just constantly
dealing with very complicated things I
like a phone that's very simple I like a
phone that I can just pick up push one
button it's just basic I don't have to
worry about rearranging you know widgets
or setting things up and have a pet I
just honestly I don't want all that an
iphone is perfect for me in that it's
just icons I can just open up Twitter i
can type and off it goes and i know aunt
Goodell and android do all that too but
you guys have all said it yourself
there's a lot more to android and
androids a little bit more complicated
than it comes to iphone and that's okay
there's nothing wrong with that for me
personally i just want the simplicity of
the iDevice this isn't like Apple fanboy
is and this is a hipster ism or anything
like that in fact a lot of people are
shocked to find out that I prefer iphone
/ android just given the my nature of
customizing everything that I don't but
my device I just want to pick it up and
go I don't want to worry about it I
don't want to customize anything and i
want to set anything up I just wanted to
if I could get a feature phone a basic
phone like an old nokia that would allow
me to tweet and do the facebook and
email and all that and still have a nice
interface I would probably ditch
smartphones all together because I'm
just honestly getting tired of it
but if you like to customize the
experience if you want the phone to be
tailored perfectly to you and you want
it to just be an extension of you down
to the font that you use definitely go
with Android there's a lot going for
Android it's definitely farther ahead
than iOS and Apple when it comes to the
software development you know there's
nothing wrong with which what you choose
i hate the android vs iphone fight
because honestly that's probably the
most petty argument there is next to
console vs pc so here's the thing here's
my recommendation to you if you have an
iphone 5 like i do it's a little bit
sucky to think well the phone i have now
is getting taken completely off the
market there's no reason to update
though the iphone 5s unless you want a
fingerprint reader reader a little
better camera skip it altogether don't
even consider a 5c it's a plastic
version of what you already have if you
have an iphone 4s or you have an iphone
4 or you're coming to apple from any
other device then the 5c or the 5s is
all is your only option obviously go for
the 5s if you can afford the extra
hundred bucks it's going to last you a
little bit longer if you're like me
though waiting for the whatever is going
to come out next year is the better
option i would like to see a little bit
bigger screen though we would like to
see a four and a half inch screen maybe
a little bit wider screen when it comes
to the next model iphone so there it is
guys that's my opinion when it comes to
the iphone so in about seven days you
can expect an iOS 7 review we can do
another one of those Apple versus
Android type videos considering its my
where my most popular videos on this
channel with considering this is a PC
channel with nearly a half million views
on that on my iPhone video so guys let
me get on out of here thanks for
listening sorry for this long rambling
rant video about I iPhones and apples
and stuff we'll get back to your
regularly scheduled PC biased opinions
next time take care this can't be right
where am I
laughing I'm not in Lansing hey you
can't make this up that just happened
right now that just happened I'm not in
Michigan I'm in California did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
