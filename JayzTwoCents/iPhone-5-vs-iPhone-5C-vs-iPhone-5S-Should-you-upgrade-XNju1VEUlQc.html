and we're back with a little bit of a
tech vlog e blog e thing that we're
gonna go ahead and do today because if
you're not aware or you live under a
rock or in a barn which would be really
interesting if you have the internet in
those places i po unveiled their brand
new iPhones today which is kind of a
milestone for them because it's the
first time they've ever unveiled two new
phones at the same time so we're gonna
go ahead and talk about that whether or
not these phones are right for you how
they stack up against some of the other
androids that are on the market and
whether or not you should just skip this
generation altogether
okay so right off the bat I don't want
this to turn into an iPhone or Apple
versus Android conversation I truly
don't because I firmly believe that both
phones offer something to the market
that the other doesn't or vice versa and
they definitely have their places in
this market my daily use phone is an
iPhone 5 here it is right here it's a
white one or I guess I call it white but
it's really more or less aluminum with
some white glass on it
I do also carry a galaxy s3 for work and
I do regularly keep my eyes on the
Windows Phone and stuff that's going on
with Windows 8 Phone and the some of the
Nokia and other the some of the other
manufacturers of phones out there but
with that said I'm not a fanboy either I
prefer iPhone because I like the
simplicity of it a lot of people like
Android because they like the custom
custom ability or customization
abilities of the Android so getting into
this don't turn this into a fanboy
conversation because that's not what
this is about
and that being what is it that Apple's
bring into the industry here in 2013
because as you know Apple only releases
one phone or one generation of phone per
year speaking of that as I mentioned in
the intro of this video this is the
first time that Apple has released two
new phones at the same time and those
being the iPhone 5c and the iPhone 5s
what we already knew the iPhone 5s was
going to be coming we probably really
kind of knew it was gonna be called the
5s too because it's just the
nomenclature and the Apple uses is
definitely generational it's always been
a for for us you know five would be 5s
and you got three 3GS
so our 3G 3GS is they're not very
creative on their names now a lot of
people believe that the iPhone 5c stands
for color a lot of other people believe
that it's got one of those double
meetings where it could mean color but
it could also mean cheap because what
they're doing now is Apple used to take
the old phone and they would just kind
of slide it over on the chart and listed
at 99 bucks or whatever for the 16 gig
and that's that that's the cheap phone
but now that they're doing is they're
discontinuing the iPhone 5 altogether
it's not gonna be available anymore I
didn't think it was anything a shock I
mean most of this stuff was already
leaked out in the Internet all we got
today was confirmation that the room
were true that that is a plastic phone
now I am happy to hear that they have
included a metal backing a steel metal
backing or plate glued to the back side
of the plastic phone which gives it more
rigidity so you have to worry about it
creaking cracking or twisting in your
hand which isn't really a problem
anymore because most of the screens are
glass now so that kind of gives it
rigidity as well but it also gives it
maybe a little bit of weight to it so
doesn't feel cheap and it's not really
diluting what they feel is you know the
Apple brand that once they went to these
metal constructed phones they are
worried about diluting the product by
going plastic but a lot of people want
plastic it's cheaper it's more durable
you know I'm about denting it I've
dented the crap out of this phone before
because I dropped it and I got it
replaced but I got it dented in on the
top and then the phone twisted and it
was just I could like put it on the
table and it would rock because it was
so bent from one drop and here's the
thing
you have a cell phone you're gonna drop
it so plastic is a lot more bounce
friendly as they say so I do kind of
like that aspect of it it basically has
the same processor that's in the iPhone
5 it's the a6 processor it's a little
bit faster and other than that it
doesn't really have much think of it
it's just a plastic iPhone 5 that's
really all they did there's nothing
really incredible about it for 99 bucks
if you're a new customer or you have an
upgrade in this market if you have a lot
of money it's probably a very good
upgrade path for you or a new phone path
but when it comes to the iPhone 5s
there's a couple of increment chain
incremental changes on there it looks
exactly like the iPhone 5 which we kind
of expected except they've added a new
color which are calling champagne it
kind of looks like a very faded or pale
color gold which is not I mean like I'm
really disappointed with Apple in this
aspect because this phone is aluminum
since they went with an aluminum phone
it means they could have anodized this
any color they could have done blue red
gold yellow green purple you know a very
got black and silver yellow they could
have done any color because aluminum can
be dyed and anodized through or died
through anodizing process so cheaply and
people are saying oh it's gonna add to
the manufacturing cost I don't know what
you don't understand is to protect this
aluminum even the black and the clear
this is anodized this is an
de lumen uh if you know anything about
metalworking you know that even the
clear and the black are anodized in fact
that's how you make a black but even the
clear is anodized they could have given
you some real options with color but I
think they felt if they did that they'd
be undermining the whole point of the 5c
a little bit I'm a little disappointed
that it didn't go that route especially
since so many third-party manufacturers
or companies that are now taking these
clear cases and they're anodizing them
where you can get the phone customized
to a color of your own choice people are
already doing that and it's obvious that
people want that once again Apple just
didn't feel like going that route for
whatever reason I don't know whatever
probably the biggest change on the phone
with the exception of the camera because
its face it every single generation is
an incremental change to the camera it's
now got I think that's at five layers of
glass it's got a 2.8 aperture it's
supposed to be good with low-light it's
got new camera functions built into it
is the change of the home button and now
instead of having a plastic home button
it is a glass sapphire crystal cover
over the button that is on top of a
fingerprint reader so it's no longer a
push button I don't believe I believe
it's simply a sensor and what that means
is you know they say you don't have to
slide to unlock it anymore you can just
touch it and it'll unlock because it'll
read your fingerprint a couple of things
that like about that one it probably
means that you've got to sorry about
that it probably means that you have to
have your finger like on it just right
or when i unlock my phone I end to hold
it like this you know so you see it I
kind of feel like an idiot now holding
my phone like this but when I push the
home screen how do i how can i do this
there i tend to just kind of push with
the edge of my thumb like the edge of my
thumb and i don't want to now have to be
very you know flat thumbed if that makes
any sense a lot of people are like oh no
no they're gonna be able to read your
fingerprints and spiritually theorists
out there when i was tweeting this i did
say that i mean who knows what happens
with that fingerprint reading is that a
security risk in itself that's when we
reading your fingerprints i don't really
need to worry about with my finger
prints in fact I'm already fingerprinted
I'm already in the system I
in the system for years because of some
of the jobs that I've had security
clearance getting on military bases of
God I'm in the system people rusty
Shackelford would be terrified if he was
me I am deep in the system there's a lot
of people out there just don't like the
idea of have a fingerprint reader
because even if they don't set it up as
security every time you touch your phone
your finger touches that reader so is
that a good thing is that a bad thing
it's up to you really and how paranoid
you are with your government depending
on where you live but when it comes to
hardware a little bit better camera it's
got the a7 processor in it which is they
say 2 times faster it's also got the m7
processor in it which is it handles the
gyro the Java scope accelerometer GPS
and all that sort of stuff so that it
take a offloads those tasks off of the
main processor and it's like a secondary
processor that handles all those tasks
which makes your phone more efficient
faster and they claim it didn't hurt
battery life at all for them to add this
other processor in there so that's kind
of a cool thing cool thing about it
being the same size and dimensions as
the iPhone 5 it means all your cases and
accessories are gonna fit everything's
gonna be the same there it's not like
when you went from the 4 to the 5 or the
4s to the 5 you get all new accessories
so at least you have one more generation
there and when it comes to the rear
camera they did add another LED for
brighter more blinding photos in the
dark and the movie theatres and all
those Gabby girls taking photos and
blinding the out of you but really
the only thing that I think is exciting
is the iOS 7 change and the reason for
that is because it's a whole new staff
for iOS 7 I mean if you guys remember
last year they cleaned house came in
with a guy's name that he resigned from
Apple he was the guy that was in charge
of iOS a lot of people on Apple kind of
felt that he might have been holding
things back when it comes to iOS
advancement so he departed from the
company and now you've got other people
running iOS so he got I Oh s7 which is
supposed to bring 200 new features maybe
good maybe maybe bad I don't know a
scene that took a poll today and I think
it said 80 80 percent or 81 percent of
people polled felt the iOS 7 was a good
change for Apple really what it is is
it's I heard there was a really funny
quote on CNET today where they
Apple was claiming that the this whole
operating system iOS 7 is supposed to
make them more Android free being more
free of Android like breaking itself
apart and the guy that was talking about
this article was like if you asked me I
see an awful lot of Android inside of
iOS 7 because really what Apple is doing
now is catching up to a lot of the
software development changes that have
taken place with the Google developers
and that's perfectly okay with me
because the farther apple falls behind
the more people are gonna play apples
gonna play catch-up
if they do catch up it means Google is
gonna keep pushing ahead and you need
companies like Apple and Google to be
competing for US consumers to have
really cool choices and options in this
market now that brings me to the last
thing I want to talk about here is
Android and Apple and which is right for
you if you're like me and you are a tech
head and you work in a software
development office and you are dealing
with technical issues and IT and
software updates and just constantly
dealing with very complicated things I
like a phone that's very simple I like a
phone that I can just pick up push one
button it's just basic I don't have to
worry about rearranging you know widgets
or setting things up and have a pet I
just honestly I don't want all that and
iPhone is perfect for me in that it's
just icons I can just open up Twitter I
can type and off it goes and I know and
Google and Android do all that too but
do you guys have all set it yourself
there's a lot more to Android and
androids a little bit more complicated
than it comes to iPhone and that's okay
there's nothing wrong with that for me
personally I just want the simplicity of
the iDevice
now this isn't like Apple fanboys and
this is a hipster ism or anything like
that in fact a lot of people are shocked
to find out that I prefer iPhone over
Android just given the my nature of
customizing everything that I don't put
my device I just want to pick it up and
go I don't want to worry about it I
don't want to customize anything and I
want to set anything up I just wanted to
if I could get a feature phone a basic
phone like an old Nokia that would allow
me to tweet and do the Facebook and
email and all that and still have a nice
interface
I would probably ditch some art phones
all
together because I'm just honestly
getting tired of it but if you like to
customize the experience if you want the
phone to be tailored perfectly to you
and you want it to just be an extension
of you down to the font that you use
definitely go with Android there's a lot
going for Android it's definitely
farther ahead than iOS and Apple when it
comes to the software development you
know there's nothing wrong with which
what you choose I hate the Android vs.
iPhone fight because honestly that's
probably the most petty argument there
is next to console versus PC so here's
the thing here's my recommendation to
you if you have an iPhone 5 like I do
it's a little bit sucky to think well
before I have now is getting taken
completely off the market there's no
reason to update though the iPhone 5s
unless you want a fingerprint reader
reader a little better camera skip it
altogether don't even consider a 5c it's
a plastic version of what you already
have if you have an iPhone 4s or you
have an iPhone 4 or you're coming to
Apple from any other device then the 5c
or the 5s is all is your only option
obviously go for the 5s if you can
afford the extra hundred bucks it's
gonna last you a little bit longer if
you're like me though waiting for that
whatever is going to come out next year
is the better option I would like to see
a little bit bigger screen though we'd
like to see a four and a half inch
screen maybe a little bit wider screen
when it comes to the next model iPhone
so there it is guys that's my opinion
when it comes to the iPhone so in about
7 days you can expect an iOS 7 review we
can do another one of those Apple vs.
Android type videos considering it's my
where my most popular videos on this
channel with considering this is a PC
channel with nearly a half million views
on that on my iPhone video so guys when
we get on out of here thanks for
listening sorry for this long rambling
rant video about IAI phones and apples
and stuff we'll get back to your
regularly scheduled PC biased opinions
next time take care
this can't be right where am I
I'm not in Lansing hey you can't make
this up that just happened right now
that just happened I'm not in Michigan
I'm in California</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
