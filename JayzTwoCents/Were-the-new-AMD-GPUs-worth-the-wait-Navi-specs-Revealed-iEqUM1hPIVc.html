we're gonna talk about it now the only
frustrating thing I think on think
honestly about the same D launch is the
fact that they're doing it in such like
segments it's like summit Computex will
actually summit CES summit Computex
summit 83 with availability in july so
it's kind of like come on just just just
pour it out let us have it let us have
all this goodness yeah we're gonna talk
about we're talking about their new
processors the 3950 X has finally been
debuted and we're going to talk about
their new rDNA technology on their
graphics cards and their Navi
architecture has finally been well
unveiled so let's go and talk about it
Coursera is proud to present their new
Hydra X line of custom water cooling
products the new XG 5 series radiators
offer the perfect balance of indents 'ti
and airflow to keep your loop cool and
quiet
the x3 7 water blocks feature full
coverage cooling for GPU while also
maintaining an aesthetically pleasing
design while the XC 7 and XC 9 cpu
blocks keep all your modern cpus nice
and cool to see the complete lineup of
high directs cooling products from
corsair click the link in the
description below alright so we're just
gonna kind of go through processors
quickly because I think there was a
little bit less shown on processors than
the new graphics card which is obviously
well new graphics card family which is
obviously everyone's favorite exciting
thing because we know that the CPU side
has been competitive now for AMD for
several years it's the GPU side of
things that has been kind of like an and
lackluster it's because I've had a hard
time getting the momentum going in my
opinion but the 3900 X we've we've seen
obviously some of the teases and stuff
about it we finally started seeing some
performance figures now as you should
with any company whether it being Intel
Nvidia or AMD you need to take these
figures with a grain of salt you need to
see and wait for independent testing you
need to watch a bunch of different
sources to kind of form a median
performance figure I mean everyone tests
differently so AMD obviously wants to
put their best foot forward so you want
to be leery of that don't get caught up
in hype trains and stuff wait for
independent testing unfortunately that's
not going to be until July but the 3900
X which is the 12 Core 24 thread part
which is designed to compete directly
with Intel 79 20 X which is an X 299
on extreme platform remember the 3100 x
is on main stream running dual channel
RAM and the Intel is running quad
channel Ram
they are boasting a 14% uptick in IPC
versus 2000 series rise in our last
series rise n so which is obviously
based on you know the first gen risin
email is not an 1800 series or 1800 X 27
or X that's the same architecture we're
now seeing Xen - so we're seeing a 14%
IPC uptick which means that it's putting
it pretty much in line directly with
Intel in terms of IPC and we're seeing
faster clocks across the board we still
don't know yet exactly how many cores
boost up to the up to 4.7 or 4 point 6
gigahertz but if all the rumors hold
true this is excellent because the 3100
X with 12 cores 24 threads is showing
that it's come it's trading blows with
the 9900 K which is kind of always been
and I know Lobby right now we're like
we'll wait a minute 900k only has 8
through 8 cores wait a sec the 9900 K
has always been touted as like the
ultimate gaming CPU because of high
IPC's high clocks which means less
bottlenecking
better latency and all those things that
give you a better gaming experience
usually the higher core count CPUs do
not give you as good of a gaming
experience because of multi-threaded
performance and you know leverage CPUs
and all that sort of thing and this is
showing us that it is trading blows
between the 9900 K when it comes to
gaming it depending on the title you
could see a couple percent improvement
of AMD over Intel and vice versa so if
we're seeing it competing with the
ultimate gaming CPU but also if you look
at the multi-threaded performance
against the 79 20x in productivity where
it's beating it pretty much across the
board
well these figures hold up and all the
independent reviewers see the same
experience you're gonna have a thousand
dollar CPU being beaten across the board
by a $499 CPU so that's exciting
especially if the fact that we're seeing
it in productivity outpacing the 79 20x
with half the memory channels well then
that makes it that much better because
you don't have to spend twice as much on
memory and you're still getting a better
overall experience we also saw the 39
50x
being debuted which obviously has 16
cores and 32 threads which is
interesting because that now puts it
directly competing with last gen thread
Ripper on mainstream platform for
significantly less 749 dollars to be
exact
so yeah it's one of those things where
it's like and with the wait till
September for that unfortunately the
3900 X will be available in July I think
July 7th but not only is it running on
the X 570 platform running PCIe gen 4
which we've already talked about giving
you good improvements in IO in terms of
your raid cars and MDOT two drives and
any sort of PCI Express not necessarily
graphics cards but things that can
saturate that type of bandwidth you're
gonna see up to 42 percent faster SSD
performance I mean across the board this
is just insane in terms of what we're
seeing here the fact that we're seeing
the next-gen product in terms of PCI
Express and all that sort of stuff he
launched on an AMD platform we're not
Intel shows that the tides have
certainly shifted now we're gonna on
also to the 3900 X has 17 megabytes of
cache and 40 PCIe lanes with PCI you Gen
4 and all that sort of stuff so that's
pretty mind-boggling you guys have seen
the other guys talking about the
motherboard quality at Computex usually
you would see Intel motherboards having
a better build quality and AMD was kind
of like an even though they may have
shared the same name like Strix &amp;amp; Strix
or you know like a the Auris card versus
our motherboard versus another orest
motherboard they just didn't have the
same quality between them
now we're talking about build quality on
AMD motherboards outpacing and being
better build quality than the Intel
counterparts it's kind of insane but
moving on to graphics because that's
where AMD is always sort of lacks for
quite a long time they brought back the
XT family and they're doing that
obviously with the Navi architecture the
new rDNA basically giving us a new
mainstream graphics card but it's not
higher performance than Radeon 7 which i
think is all gonna be disappointing to a
lot of people because of the fact that
when CES came out and we talked about
around that time the 590 and all that
stuff being the the mainstream card that
was only competing with like a 980 or
something like that
or 92t I think it was a lot of folks
when RTX came out were saying wait for
Nattie wait for Nattie wait for Navi
wait for navigate unfortunately this is
not the Navi everyone was hoping for and
it's looking like AMD is still staying
with that mantra of competing with the
mid-range market so for instance the
5700 XT which I think it's cool that it
brought the XT name back it's kind of a
throwback to the original Radeon days
where everything was XT and all that
it's directly competing with a RT X 2070
and it's got eight gigabytes of gddr5 a
staunch architecture GCN or like a you
know ultimate GCN architecture or
whatever you want to call it so if you
were which is competing with directly
with a 2080 so Nvidia so all by itself
up there in the major leagues in terms
of 28 ET i/o performance and all that
sort of stuff you're not gonna see any
competition coming from AMD
occupying that price point but does it I
mean that's kind of a ridiculous price
point to begin with most people don't
need that type of graphics power now the
new shroud that they're showing and this
is pretty obvious that it's gonna be a
partner card because people are gonna
come out obviously we're partners can
come out with multi fan coolers you know
vapor chambers and heat pipes and all
that sort of stuff sticking with the
gaming lines you're used to from all of
your favorite board partners I like the
way the new strap looks a lot there's a
lot of controversy on the dent the dent
looking weird I just like the fact that
it's something a little bit different
thrown in there I like the sort of
quarter Ori look to it apparently
there's a 50th anniversary edition where
it with Lisa Sue's like signature on and
like gold trim and all that sort of
stuff just totally unnecessary but I
mean if you're a huge fan of a indeed
probably interested in that but the 5700
XT and the 5700 are designed to compete
with the 2070 and the 2060
now they did all the figures here at
1440p gaming which is a lot I saw a lot
of people in the comments section on the
livestream sort of commenting like well
of course we're not doing 1080 because
it just shows that their CPUs suck well
no if you want to truly stress a
graphics card you need to put the load
on the graphics card need to do that
with high resolutions and 1440 makes
sense because 4k gaming is still such a
small adoption rate in the in the
industry I think 1440 was the perfect
sweet spot but I think this was perfect
because at the four hundred and forty
nine dollar price point you're getting a
two hundred twenty five YTD B card using
obviously TSMC s7 nanometer Navi
architecture and it's looking like it's
beating the twenty seven D fairly across
the board with a couple of like shadow
of the Tomb Raider it looks like the
twenty seven he was still beating it but
you're seeing anywhere between a two
percent to a 22 percent FPS game raw FPS
across the board on various titles and
they tested everything from Far Cry to
Tom Clancy to the division Assassin's
Creed Odyssey and a weird title I guess
AMD title right so we saw a huge overall
improvement over the twenty seventy at a
the same price point so that's that
that's one thing worth talking about
but there's another part to this I'm
going to talk about in just a sec if we
look at the 27 or the 5700 which is
compared to the r-tx 2060 it's anywhere
from a two percent to twenty one percent
improvement across the board we'll put
the same charts up that they showed
again wait for independent testing
because we've seen these types of charts
before and then we find their very
unique circumstances where these tend to
make sense both cards are featuring
eight gigabytes of gddr5 hundred
compared to the 2060 2060 only has six
gigs of GDD our six you're getting more
vram and with that you're getting well
better performance across the board but
I can already hear the Nvidia fanboys
out there screaming but it doesn't have
tensor cores and it doesn't have our T
course well I guess this is where you
get to have a fun opportunity to purge
ice because it's one of those things
where if you wanted to compete with
Nvidia aim D didn't have anything until
July of this year because 590 was the
best you could get that didn't come
anywhere near competing with the 2000
series whether it be a 26 year up well
now at the same price point you get that
option do you want raw performance which
is what you can get with obviously with
the the 50 750 700
or do you want the extra features that
could potentially be adopted in the
future more widely but
huge FPS Tex that r-tx in real-time the
XRS or ray-tracing is going to cost you
so this is where if you want the
pretties i guess you go within a video
card if you want the performance just no
matter what then you get the AMD card
because if you go in the nvidia card you
just disable it all the time then
technically get better performance with
AMD card and there's a couple new
functions that we still want to test
here internally because they're cog
they're talking about anti lag which is
supposed to improve the lag between your
monitor and your graphics card when they
said ng lag i immediately thought of
like fast and furious and i'm seen in my
brain like super azure out there on
two-step and they're just really want to
know exactly how that works but yeah
there was zero mention of our of
real-time ray tracing which I found kind
of interesting considering the fact that
navvies architecture is running on the
next generation game consoles and they
specifically mentioned real-time ray
tracing for the consoles and Lisa Sue's
keynote even started with we love the PC
space we love the PC platform that is
where our passion isn't seven she talks
about that but zero mention of ray
tracing there so maybe this is where
we're waiting for potentially a new
flagship card to replace Vega that could
potentially then compete with that
high-end Nvidia price point as well as
give you that real-time ray tracing or
maybe they're doing with a lot of people
think Nvidia should have which is just
okay you made this thing and it works
now improve it internally before you
release it to the public so you get the
frames that people want and the
obviously the real-time ray tracing so I
feel like with the graphics side of
things a lot of folks are disappointed
because they really were expecting in
AMD's Navi to just bring it but where
they're bringing in is where most people
are shopping thrown on the point $200
and $500 is where most people spend
their money most people spend that money
closer to the $200 range and I'm curious
as if we're gonna see a rDNA graphics
card in that two hundred to three
hundred and $59 price point although
we've got a three hundred and forty nine
dollar or a fifty seven hundred so yeah
I still a lot to wait for a lot to learn
but we don't have that much information
yet on exactly when these cards we made
available
yeah so anyway just another piece
talking about some of the news that's
out there you guys probably already
heard this information you're going Jay
this is redundant why are you talking
about it well I've got my audience I'm
still obligated to talk to you about
this sort of stuff this is why we have
this channel so that we can talk about
this sort of stuff
but in July we're gonna obviously be
talking about the new graphics are the
new CPUs and doing some tests on that
and I'll tell you what skunkworks is
currently running a 16 core processor
it's running a 79 60 X and if we see the
16 core 39 50x beating the 79 60 X and
makes me kind of want to switch that
computer back to a and B for the hell of
it considering that's how this channel
started was with an AMD Rig of mine I'm
just curious as to how Intel's gonna
answer so alright guys stand up in the
comments below on how you feel about the
new lineup of CPUs now that we've seen
pricing and what the actual performance
of this according to their chart stacks
up and with these two new graphics cues
from AMD
I am positive there's more graphics
cards coming out in the future you can't
have a family that resides in only two
different SKUs you've got to have more
than that above it and below it I'm
hoping we'll see something come out that
truly compares with the 20 a DTI I'd
love to see some real trying real time
ray tracing stuff come from AMD because
I'm a nerd I love the graphics and so I
want to see that and I want to see it
represented on both sides but ultimately
the buyers are the ones that determine
how these companies sort of shift their
their focus so sound off in the comments
below on what you guys think about the
new leaks hopefully you guys won't hear
anything about this until we actually
have parts in hand that are ready to
show you in the beginning of July
alright guys thanks for watching and as
always was you in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
