don't you guys follow it on Twitter but
we showed that we are going to be moving
into a new studio here very very soon a
much larger space we building it out as
people are calling it jeez check tips
because the perryland copying line is by
making a studio but whatever I did I
digress that's besides the point we
should all copy the Great's right but no
I started taking this system apart
because these are not my components see
these belong to someone else with the
exception of the reservoir I need to get
that back because that's gonna be used
in the AMD build we're doing with the
Radeon 7 build but I thought has anyone
ever actually demonstrated how to take a
computer apart like how to unbilled one
rule the games from the seven kingdoms
with your iron claw Mouse from your iron
throne it has a scroll wheel that looks
like a off-road tyre and buttons on the
side and top to do stuff don't lose grip
while doing stuff with the textured
sides and do it in style with the odd GP
and now comes available in wired and
wireless
learn more at Corsair com I see messages
all the time for people telling me hey I
inherited a PC I was given one by my
friend or whatever and I felt Phil's
even though that feels even provided
computers to his friends who were like
thanks I have a console have no idea
what I'm doing with this so rather than
pick this up from the perspective of I'm
building a new computer from scratch how
about we take it from the perspective of
you received an old computer you want to
upgrade or rebuild or just take the
parts out of and you don't know a damn
thing about computers we're gonna we're
gonna help you now figure out how to
take something apart
we took that panel off already and you
want to take off both side panels your
case is probably gonna have some knobs
you got to turn take the screws out and
this is gonna give you access to all the
wiring on the back and obviously on the
front now we're gonna at least pretend
for the sake of this video that you know
what the components are so I'm not gonna
go into detail on them but I will point
them out this is your heatsink for your
CPU if you have a water cooler or a i/o
it's gonna be very similar
easier to take apart than these usually
this is your graphics card everything's
plugged into the motherboard these
things sticking up is your RAM or your
memory and then you have your power
connectors which is gonna be a 24-pin
usually on the right a CPU power pin
usually a four or eight pin at the top
you're gonna have your PCI Express
hooked up to your graphics card if it
uses it otherwise it may not have power
connected at all
there might be one plug two plugs are
even three plugs and then you have on
the bottom right here your front panel
connectors these are the wires that tell
your reset button your switch or in our
case our kill switch that we're pushing
buttons those plug into the motherboard
and then you're gonna also have usually
which are over here on the right-hand
side your hard drives SATA connectors
which are what your hard drives can
communicate with your motherboard with
and then this thing down here in the
bottom that's usually Bagan square is
your power supply so what I like to do
is kind of unplug the power cables so
one of the last things I do when I build
a computer is actually plug in all of
the power oh and then this big fat flat
guy right here this is our USB 3.0 it's
usually on the right side of the
motherboard or the bottom now if you're
gonna be just updating or upgrading your
system by changing out the graphics card
or the CPU or whatever you wouldn't
really need to unplug any of the stuff
I'm unplugging here you just want to
unplug obviously power from the system
but this is from the perspective of we
are taking this all apart now you're
gonna have at least one maybe two screws
that are holding it into the chassis
itself unplug the power which we already
did and what you're gonna see is in the
back this one happens to be white it's a
little push tab to push it down to
release the lock in the back of the
graphics card to keep it from coming out
it might also be one that you have to
squeeze it might be one you have to kind
of move out of the way it might be one
that slides there's like three or four
different mechanisms for that once you
do that just kind of wiggle it back and
forth and it comes straight out so what
happens is it locks into this little
hook right here that keeps it from
coming out so the next thing I'm gonna
take off here is my RAM I think I'm
gonna remove the CPU cooler with the
motherboard when we take that out so
it's just like the graphics card here a
different shaped tab but we've got these
two tabs that hold either side your
motherboard might only have one little
snap release with one side that doesn't
move at all it's the same
says for both just remove that or push
down the tabs that actually move so
we're gonna push that one down push that
one down and as you do that the RAM kind
of gets unseated so you want to make
sure that doesn't just fall out when I
do the top I like to kind of hold it
with these two fingers so it doesn't
fall out let me push that down so if you
were adding another hard drive you would
need to plug in a SATA cable here but
since we are unbuilding this computer we
are going to unhook these SATA cables
and the way to get these out is to see
these little metal tabs those are what
sort of lock it in place so they don't
accidentally fall out not all SATA
cables have that these actually do so
I'm just kind of grabbing that wire from
behind right here pushing that tab down
and pulling back now this is actually
something that comes in handy as well
speaking of use case let's say you're
gonna reuse all these components but you
got a really old ugly case like here
have an example so here's an example
let's say the components that we're in
here were decent like we have here this
is an fx 8320 not a bad system you could
still game on it but this case is really
ugly so you could do the method we're
using here by showing you how to remove
everything to move it to another case
then you just have to watch our other
video on how to build a computer to know
how to put it all back together so the
next thing I'm gonna do here is since
this fan will allow us to do it or this
cooler I'm gonna go ahead and just take
this fan off because I didn't have this
one it's not wired to the cooler itself
and I just want the room so we can take
the fan out of here
get a little bit extra room and now we
can easily access our screws we're gonna
go ahead and remove our motherboard and
to do that I'm gonna lay it flat but you
can see right here that there are
perimeter screws I'm actually missing
winner there but there are usually going
to be one two three screws on the bottom
potentially one or two right here I
didn't put any there we're gonna have
one in the middle in this case it's a
dimple that just sort of holds on to the
motherboard there's no screw in that one
screw here and then again just mirrored
from the bottom across the top you're
gonna have three of them so just unscrew
these do it with the case flat that way
you don't accidentally drop the
motherboard out of there a lot of
sensitive materials on the surface of
the motherboard capacitors a lot of
solder points
there's even chips and stuff on there so
you don't want to damage it if I having
it fall out and land on something sharp
so obviously you want to keep a hold of
all your screws and stuff you might need
them later some of them are still
sitting on the motherboard here when we
lift it out but come up with it
now I like to kind of grab it by the
cooling tower because that makes a
pretty good handle it's definitely
sturdy enough it's easier than grabbing
it by the heat sinks you don't want to
grab and pull up by the heat sinks now
tell you why a lot of these are just
mounted with spring-loaded screws and
then they have thermal paste or thermal
pads that touch the thing they're
cooling if you pull them up and it's too
heavy
you kind of crack that or it breaks that
bond then it could also affect the
cooling of those parts so I'd much
rather grab it by the cooling tower here
which I know can handle the weight of
the motherboard we're gonna go ahead and
just lift this out so what you might
have to do depending on your case you
might have to sort of lift up kind of at
an angle in this particular chassis I've
got to go sideways and then come
straight up and then there is our
motherboard now we're gonna go ahead and
set this aside because now we have to
remove our power supply and before we
undo all of our wiring here you can see
we have velcro straps to undo because
that's kind of holding things down and
out of the way we're gonna go ahead and
take out our SSD as you can see here we
have a Samsung Drive and this is gonna
unplug just like we did on the
motherboard the power connector they'll
be careful with it it's long and got a
lot of leverage if you were to tweak
this sideways you could snap the power
cable right or connector right off
inside the connector from the SSD so you
don't want to do that when you take it
out hold the SSD firm and then wiggle
side to side and then that will come out
this easily can snap off inside of that
plug then making your SSD not completely
useless but much more prone to shorting
out those and you don't want to deal
with that so set that aside and then
undo any zip ties or velcro that's
holding down any of your cables if the
person who built your computer is even
slightly any sort of a pc enthusiast
it's probably gonna have cable ties and
stuff on there now this case is a little
different when it comes to the power
supply it's got this plate but the power
supply mounts to via these four screws
and then the power supply slides out the
rear your case may not have that it may
just have the screws which means then
the power supply
has to come out from the side of the
case so a perfect example on its old
chassis this power supply would not come
out the rear it would come out the side
because it just mounts directly to the
frame itself so as I pull it here you
can see we've got wires kind of getting
hung up on things all over the place so
don't just yank on it you could break
things especially if you plan on reusing
this case for something else so what I'm
doing now is I'm just gonna sort of undo
this bit of spaghetti so that I can see
what our wires are getting hooked up on
like I have a RGB controller here say
the cable there so our 24 pin is what
was getting caught up now that our
cables on the power supply are free we
can go ahead and pull it out this way if
you're gonna be taking the fans out and
using them in your next build
then you will remove the four plastic
self-tapping screws that screw right
into the plastic chassis of the fan of
the frame of the fan you would remove
all four of these and then your fan will
come out so whether you're going to
reuse this chassis or not it's always
kind of nice to get it sort of prepared
and ready for the next build or that
maybe this is a perfect enclosure for
you to give to a friend or something
there's a lot of that going around
lately which is kind of cool so I just
want to kind of bundle up all the wires
here get them sort of I guess so it's
some logic to it if that makes sense
so that we can put the panel covers back
on on the either side of the chassis
and not pinched wires because then if we
were to cut a wire for let's say the
front power or the reset or something
like that then you're gonna have to kind
of refer to my Killswitch video on how
to sort of repair that harness because
it would be the exact same logic so
basically this chassis is completely
back to normal the exception effected as
a kill switch and as a 12-volt gauge and
it has two fans still in the front of
you don't need those fans so what's left
now is to talk about removing the cooler
and getting the seen CPU out of there
which in this case is an AMD FX 8350 M
design and am3 and am4 are very similar
they're only a few millimeters different
whereas Intel is a perfect square so
these mounts actually are wider which
makes it easier to get to without the
heatsink tower itself getting in the way
so that's one of the reasons why we
removed the fan because if the fan we're
still on here then you can see that we
wouldn't even have a chance of getting
to those particular screws and that's
why I wait until it's out of the case
hopefully you know if you're upgrading
just you're cooler then you could do
this in the case but it's a lot harder
trust me fortunately we have a little
bit of flex on this these are four
Phillips head but also they are a nut I
think they're a ten millimeter if I'm
not mistaken I've already kind of sort
of loosen these up with the screwdriver
and then I can do it by hand but as you
can see I've got this kind of a crazy
angle I have to go into but because
they're spring-loaded they do have a
little bit of flex in them so I can get
the right angle to get the screwdriver
on there and then we can loosen these up
now these are sort of spring-loaded as
you can see so that's gonna hold down
the tension on the cooler so we got good
spread with our thermal paste and stuff
but I don't want you to take the cooler
straight off yet because I'm gonna show
you a common mistake people make with
AMD CPUs which really tends to freak
them out now those coolers been on here
for a long time I'm hoping I can
demonstrate this a lot of people just
grab it and go
yeh I'll get that one didn't do it
they'll pull it up and their CPUs
attached to it and yanked it right out
of the socket now fortunately with AMD
that's not really that big of an issue
because the way AMD works is they're not
LGA which means that the pins are on the
CPU and not on the socket so if you undo
this little lever here and lift it up
it's got kind of a little tab that it
clicks in and listen so you can you push
it out and go up but as you can see
right here it's actually stuck in there
really good okay there we go the pins
are located on the AMD CPU so if this
were an Intel CPU that B flat with a
bunch of little like gold pads which
would touch pins sticking up on the
socket in my opinion this is a much more
beginner friendly setup because this is
a lot easier these pins are actually
fairly strong compared to the LGA pins
found on the socket itself and so this
is a lot easier to deal with so what I
recommend is when you go to take it out
is that it pulling straight up twist it
a little
to break any seal or any sort of bond
that could be there and then you can
pull it up in the CP you should still be
in there so now what you got to do is
you've got to clean your CPU and your
cooler cuz if you're gonna put this
stuff away you don't wanna do a thermal
paste everywhere I get to everywhere
it's gross I hate thermal paste nothing
puts me in a salty mood like thermal
paste and Internet comments now I'm
gonna be using paper towels for this but
a really good material to use is coffee
filters because it's a lot less fibrous
we're also gonna be using 91% isopropyl
alcohol you can get 97 which is probably
a little bit better but grab your cpu
from the edges and then you want to take
where it's wet with the but the alcohol
and as you can see it just sort of eats
right through the thermal paste so you
just want to make sure you get all the
thermal paste off you might want to use
a q-tip if it's kind of kicked up on
there just be careful as you're holding
it that you don't squish any of the pins
because then if you're watching my video
on how to restrain AMD pins so here is
an exploded view of all the components
inside of a computer this is everything
we just removed don't confuse this with
a view of an exploded computer that's a
whole different video we did back in the
day I've blown up plenty of computers on
this channel but that's why we do this
sort of stuff so that you don't make
mistakes and potentially blow up your
stuff now taking it apart salaat easier
than putting it together because all the
components already there there in the
place they go all you have to do is take
it out and put it back in their boxes if
you got it or transfer it to a new
chassis like we sort of demonstrated we
would be doing but I know I hear you
guys like J this is a really weird video
we've you've got two million people
following you we're all smart we know
what we're doing why are you showing us
this well if you saw my messages in my
inbox from my perspective you'd realize
just how many people were watching or
our passers-by asking questions because
they have no idea where to start they
either got me a hand-me-down or a an old
computer from a friend or family member
and they want to mess around with it but
they don't want to ruin it either so
that was sort of the perspective we took
from this video-content but this piece
of content was from the perspective of
working backwards so if you guys found
this video useful you know someone who
could find this video useful once you go
ahead and share it and tag them in this
video maybe they'll learn something
which is the whole point of why I've
been doing this now for almost seven
years and two million subscribers strong
alright guys thanks for watching and as
always well
even the next one and soon it will be
from a whole new studio but I'm thinking
about recreating this set one to one in
the new studio so it looks like nothing
changed then we'd have to actually make
fake windows yeah which would be so
ironic that's beside the point that
perspective we're literally sitting here
waiting to shoot our next scene because
we're hearing this there's more than one
truck going backwards outside there's
someone hammering next door the neighbor
is like sliding furniture across the
floor seen a lot of what are you gonna
do studio with all your current one with
the exception of space noise pollution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
