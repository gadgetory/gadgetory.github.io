bringing it a video review of something
I've never done before I'm gonna review
a chair a chair so today guys we're
gonna be taking a look at the GT Omega
racing Pro XL chair god I'm getting old
I'm really busy right now
so guys today we are talking about a
chair I know what you're thinking you're
thinking it's a chair what is there to
say about a chair coconut monkey plop
this big button one is sitting one right
over there and it does what you're
supposed to do it's but it's not big
your butt is huge
not now GT Omega Racing is kind of
breaking the mold when it comes to
chairs and they said let's take cool
racing simulator seats and let's
basically rig them up to be office
chairs as you can see right here behind
me it's a chair but it is a racing seat
it is confused it's good to both it's a
good at none let's talk about it today I
sincerely apologize for that here it is
right here
it's a racing chair now this is the pro
XL I've got a lot of interesting things
to say about this and the reason why I
have coconut monkey with me go ahead and
say hi you can I've been on the channel
a few times good good over here
let's turn tandem reviews good on over
here it fact I had to enlist the help of
monkey for this guys it's not a racial
term I swear it's just it's just handle
something hall what are you doing it's
fair
now there's a couple of reasons why I
brought coconut monkey in here it's kind
of funny that we're reviewing this on
our knees huh yeah but if we're standing
up you're 6 foot tall right
watch you six-foot or 511 512 512 is
six-foot right before six foot the
reason why I have got coconut in here is
because you are a racing fan you're into
like playing with your mod your car and
modifying it and stuff and you racing
seats and the whole racing drifting
senior into that yeah and who better
than to give an opinion on this then an
average-size now average an American
size probably super-sized by Europe
standards average American size because
I'll be honest with you I think I'm a
little too big for this chair well I'm
pretty big in Japan too so you are a big
deal in Japan yeah imagine me I love the
concept of this chair but to be honest
it's 55 centimeters wide and I've got a
56 centimeter but boy yeah if you want
to get technical about it I've got the
pretty big button and I cannot lie I'm
going to demonstrate how this thing hugs
the curves and it forms to your body and
I appreciate it if you keep your body
why dammit there's not a lot of room B
now this chair is perfect for the person
who is like I wish I had a racing
simulator seat but I don't have the room
me well yeah yeah so you put the two
together and this is what you get now
when it comes to adjustability if you go
ahead and lean the sucker back but don't
lean it against me please I would
reiterate that like oh we're going
lowrider yeah so you can you get low
ride in the semi you can you can ghost
ride the whip play something else right
no ghost ride the whip yeah so you can
gangster lean right I mean you can sit
you can show them how the adjustable
butt angle works okay but I wouldn't do
it yeah with the leaning back you're
going backwards my friend you're going
over see it's got a pretty strong spring
load so you can lean back in that thing
you could be like yeah I probably never
do that next you again
so the arms are adjustable they just up
and down by the little switch they can
angle they can tilt now you're
comfortable in this chair right yeah
okay give your opinion about this chair
what does it feel like if you tied it to
me got it to me baby tell it to me now
is like I'm being cut from behind but
even know what it feels like
shut up all right so go ahead and tell
us what you think about this chair it
feels like a racing chair I mean it
stiff back it mics over there
feels like a racing chair just if that
he's new don't don't don't don't take it
out of it I like how the back actually
like holds me in so so it's outside
lumbar support yeah I guess you know you
never know when the g-forces at your
desk are gonna get ya you never know
what happens because one day you'll be
like playing but it's forces good
posture I said oh yeah and I think
that's one of the things I don't like
about that is that I like to be like
sideways in my chair you know I'll be
all like leg up I came to get my leg up
into fat those are different because I
like I kinda like to be as upright as
possible but comfortable and this this
does that for me you know now let me
show you what happens when I sit in it
excuse me average sized American I found
it random when I sit in said chair with
this look at this well boom whoa when I
sit it's like cranking oh I mean look
where did the chair go where is the
chair but where did it go when you were
sitting in it I could see the sides it I
mean look if I turn around backwards
you're gonna see like that boob payment
off the side watch
do you see that I am a fat super-sized
American so for me this chair is a
little bit on the small side now if it
came to a racing simulator if this thing
was in a racing seat like a racing frame
and I could lean this back you know I
could lean it and I could be sitting
here with the pedals and stuff you
should you should actually scroll down a
little bit it doesn't look too dirty I
want to be all like showing you guys the
tidbits look at this Boop
bare feet I'm sorry so if I was leaning
back like this a little bit you know
this was like a racing sim I could chill
him this guy's look at me I'm huge I'm
like kind of a Gayle when it comes to
the GT Omega racing chair the XL I'm
very happy with the chair I mean like
I'm comfortable in right now I've really
gotten used to it but it really comes
down to one major thing for me and that
is the fact that it sits really tall I'm
tall so one I don't want to be up high I
want to be down I'm a lot more
comfortable in it now than when I first
got it because it seems to have sort of
broken down a little bit and gotten
softer it's very very stiff as she said
very very hard that's what she said
there's no way I can describe this
without it sounding dirty guys I'm going
to apologize right now so but but it
started to conform to my butt a little
bit which means it's pretty much gotten
flat and so she's a get mad at him sent
him the hate mail not me but it still
sits just a tad bit high for my taste my
desk is kind of low and Grenaa I do have
an adjustable desk I like to kind of sit
low and I have very bad posture when I'm
sitting in the chair I mean sometimes
I'm just like at work kind of like this
I can't do that comfortably in this
chair I mean I'm like practically all
the way off the chair me admit but it's
like off the chair right now but it's a
great chair for what it is if you're if
you're after a chair that's comfortable
it's going to grab you it's gonna pretty
much molest your backside and it's just
going to make you feel like you're nice
and in a racing situation you got your
steering wheel in front of you but you
you know you also sitting as your desk
for a long time you want good posture
it's perfect for you if you're a super
sized individual like me just be warned
it may not be the most comfortable thing
in the world for you if you're like
wide-load like I am you guys I'm six
foot four and I'm 219 like eight pounds
I think I'm big-boned very big
abnormally large squishy bones
okay guys when it comes to the style of
the chose a lot of different colors
available red and black blue and black
white white and blue solid black and I
went with the solid black because I
don't like any of those flashy colors
especially in this office so when the
black showed up I was actually
pleasantly surprised by the fact that it
has really nice red stitching in it so
it's got really nice red accent to it
and it's not overbearing and I do
actually like the way that that looks
now when it comes to comfort it's got
quite a bit of bolstering and even
though a big giant butt like mine is
trying to flatten that out the chair is
like no I will hold you nice and tight
tight the chair is actually under a lot
of pressure right now but that's got a
lot of side bolstering it's got a lot of
back boot bolstering and it's even got a
lumbar support pillow that you can put
on there I don't like it because I'm
already big enough for this chair so
when I put it on I'm just like like way
out there but it's also got this nifty
little head pillow so you can just be
like like that and so when it comes to
comfort it it is growing on me I'll be
honest so there it is guys the GT Omega
pro XL did a whole bunch of stuff over
there they for doing this review and
nothing more than doing this review they
gave me a discount code for you guys

code save 5% it's a great chair I just
wish I were smaller not that the chair
was bigger because then if the chair was
bigger average-sized people would be
like this chair is just way too massive

gonna get on out of here say goodbye
