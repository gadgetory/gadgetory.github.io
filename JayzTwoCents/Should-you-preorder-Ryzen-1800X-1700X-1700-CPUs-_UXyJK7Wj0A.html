this is finally the day especially for
AMD fans or those of you just wanted to
see some competition going on in the
whole PC CPU space because today is the
official well pre-order day for rise in
and we've got three SKUs to talk about
with more SKUs promised to be released
in the near future and even though I was
not at the AMD event and I have not been
hands-on with anybody CPUs yet I think
it's a pretty interesting perspective be
able to talk about pre-ordering because
you can actually pre-order this and I'm
being asked a lot on whether or not you
should preorder it some of the kind of
deduce the information here as best I
can to help you make the decision of
whether or not you should pre-order
because this this is pretty interesting
now as of February 22nd you could
pre-order these CPUs from AMD the three
rise in seven CPUs 1800 X 1700 X and a
1700 all three of these are eight core
16 thread of CPUs which is a big big
deal because that puts this directly
competing with the x99 lineup from Intel
because the 1800 X is priced at $499
official for AMD that's Amazon pricing
anyway so $499 for an eight core 16
threads CPU now that one's designed to
kind of compete directly against 260
900k but that's just under half the
price of it and we also have the 1700 X
priced at 399 which is aiming directly
at competing with the Intel 6800 K which
is a 6 core 12 thread CPU so for less
you actually get more cores and more
threads with IPC improvements we'll talk
about a little bit which is instructions
per clock where AMD is always suffered
with that but also rounding up the
bottom of the three is the 1700 at $329
again an 8 core 16 thread CPU but that's
priced more to kind of compete against
the 7700 K which is a 4 core 8 thread
CPU and not even on the x99 line up best
is on mainstream Z 270 I think one of
the coolest things about these new CPUs
is it's kind of a reinvigorated some of
the motherboard manufacturers
over time amv motherboards never seem to
get the same amount of love that the
Intel motherboards did especially with a
lot of the additional features
I mean USB type-c and stuff finally made
its way to AMD motherboards that the
chipset was very old and outdated the
990s X was about 2011 I want to say 2010
around there so we are long in the tooth
when it comes to the current chipset but
motherboard manufacturers like ACS
asrock MSI biostar they're all coming
out with new motherboards and yes we are
going to be seeing a new Asus Republic
of gamers crosshair six hero motherboard
which I will actually be doing a build
with that it's currently on the way I do
have a resin CPU on the way as well but
we'll be doing a separate video and
obviously a full build and benchmark of
that now Andy had promised a 40% IPC or
instructions per clock improvement over
excavator which again is the old we're
gonna call it old because it really is
11 it's like six years old technology on
AMD side they promised this a 40 percent
IPC improvement they say they delivered
52 percent that is a huge improvement
but anyway these are all running the 14
nanometer process eight core 16 threads
as I said now the turbo clocks for these
CPUs respectively are four gigahertz for
the 1800 X three point eight for the
1700 X and 3 point 7 for the 1700 X
interestingly though the amount of TDP
for the 1700 is 65 watts for the other
two are 95 so I'm kind of curious what's
different there and how they're actually
saving an additional almost 30% of power
right there now when it comes to the
benchmarks the 1800 X is beating the
1600 K on Cinebench r15 the 1700 X is
beating the 6800 K and the 1700 is
beating the 7700 K now some of you might
be looking at that saying well be in it
that's not fair why is there an 8 core
CPU vs. a 6 core CPU and another 8 core
versus a 4 core well it's perfectly
relevant because remember these are
price points that we are sort of
comparing here where the 329 dollar
price point is cheaper on the 1700 than
it is for the 7700 K and likewise with
the 6800 K being more expensive than
the 1700 X so that makes these results
very very valid the only other test
though that they offered any benchmarks
on was the single threaded r15 Cinebench
r15 with 1800 X versus the 69 hundred K
which they were the exact same score it
would have been nice if they included
the other two CPUs that we could see if
maybe it was fall off on those two where
may be single core performance isn't as
good on those so we're at the wait for
independent reviews and then handbrake
for K encoding down to 1080p 30fps
settings but 1700 versus the 7700 K and
it did it exactly 10 seconds faster than
the 7700 so with all that said obviously
the performance per dollar is really
good on this so now let's go ahead and
move into the part of the video where we
talk about whether or not you should
preorder this and remember I have not
had any hands-on experience with this
one speaking purely on the information
that's available on the internet which
is the same information you pretty much
have to rely on yourself even though I
will be doing full builds on this I have
not been any had any hands on or even
even a single discussion with AMD so I
am completely in the dark on this just
as you guys are
the issue here is pre-orders have opened
up for this CPU prior to any independent
reviewing or testing having been done so
you're having to really take the full
word of AMD on the performance
comparisons with very limited
benchmarking samples that have been
provided now the specs look really good
on paper the price is very are hard to
argue with but the question is how is it
going to perform in all tasks like live
streaming and video encoding for the
content creator like myself or aspiring
creator like you maybe like I said live
streaming while gaming what's gaming
performance going to be like with the 52
percent IPC improvement I would have to
assume gaming is going to be pretty good
as well so whether or not you should
preorder really depends on your level of
trust with not only AMD Nvidia is guilty
of putting you know best foot forwards -
when it comes to particular mark that
they show in teleport doesn't really
show anything they've been very kind of
hush-hush on any of their marketing
stuff when it comes to desktops see
kind of interesting but I think they've
gotten pretty complacent to that they've
been in the lead for so long but
interestingly enough Intel did put out a
statement today where they were they say
that they are very confident in their
CPUs and their performance and that
anyone wanting more should be excited
for what's coming down the pipeline with
their a 8th gen Intel which is kind of
interesting because the fact that Intel
even responded to this makes it sound
like they are not I wouldn't say rattled
but they're definitely watching that's
what we need in the community and I'm
happy to see that now I would be very
leery of pre-ordering this because one
this is early adoption there is always
going to be growing pains with early
adoptions what x99 first came out and I
got my first x99 CPU the 59 60 X I had
some issues there were some BIOS issues
there were some compatibility issues and
I see no reason why that might not exist
now so if you're okay with the whole
early adopter and having some of the
bleeding edge technology problems that
come along with that and by all means
preorder it but make sure you preorder
it from a retailer that will take it
back from you if you decide to change
your mind now I'm also of the mindset
that a company needs to earn my money
before I pre-order things so personally
I wouldn't pre-order this but that's
just me and that's a subjective way of
thinking I want to see a company earn my
money rather than giving them my money
before I can get my hands on it the
other thing though that about pre-order
is this is probably going to be a very
limited supply of CPUs it's probably a
very high demand and if you want to make
sure you get it without there being a
long wait list which happens with like
smartphones and stuff when they launch
then by all means pre-order it like I
said just make sure whoever you order it
from will take it back if you change
your mind which of course with PC
components especially like CPUs and
stuff that's sometimes hard anyway guys
it's time to go I will be bringing you
full rise in coverage including full
builds and benchmarks and all that stuff
coming up here in the very near future I
just want to put this video out there
because I was asked a
lot today about my opinion on this and
also to people asking why I wasn't there
now honestly AMD messaged me they felt
bad they thought that I wasn't planning
on attending GDC at all so they didn't
send out the invites there but they are
sending me the stuff I need to be able
to do my reviews so no there's no risk
there there's no AMD hates J or any of
that stuff as the internet likes to make
up but with that said guys it's time to
go those are my opinions that's all they
are take them for what they will you can
throw them out the window listen to it
and compare it to what others are saying
and hopefully formulate your best
opinion on what you should do especially
when it comes to the pre-orders that's a
hard one this is a hard one this is this
is new this is all new so we don't have
anything to really go by I hope they do
as well as they say they're going to do
time will tell
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
