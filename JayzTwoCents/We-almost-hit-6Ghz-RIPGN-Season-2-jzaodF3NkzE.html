and no not from YouTube obviously I'm
still making crappy videos here in 2019
for you to enjoy and/or scoff at but I
digress that long-haired beautiful man
in North Carolina that is known as
Stephen Burke with gamers Nexus has
thrown down the gauntlet once again he
has just started rip J version 2 today
we are gonna preemptive strike we're
gonna actually strike we're gonna do
work the opposite you know we're gonna
actually we're gonna we're gonna hit
first
so since the last ripped series of RIP J
rip GN rip J rip GN whatever blah blah
blah we've had new CPUs come out if you
guys recall we're using the 2080
TI's as well as and this we'll talk
about that in a sec this is my D lated
sending that a DX e but since then we've
been is very discolored because I've
done dry ice cooling with acetone which
got in there on the pins it still works
just a little discolored yeah I'm
putting a pin down do it
since then the 9900 K has come out which
we were like let's do another rip series
but that never happened and the 99 ATX e
came out which is basically that guy but
a better bin and soldered so we
shouldn't have to do any D lidding at
least I'm not gonna even try because
again it's soldered I do want to do a
yeah I think we're gonna have to I think
we're gonna have to do a lapping on this
one as you can see it's it's spinning
but we we're gonna go ahead and try this
again now this is just gonna be CPU
we're just doing CPU we're not doing dry
ice today we're doing something else but
we're just doing some CPU testing
because as Steve pointed out in his
video we have a commanding lead on him
on CPU because of the fact that we went
dry ice or exotic cooling severely
sub-zero I think we're running like
negative 7 DC and we were able to push
our CPU all the way to 5.5 on all cores
on all 18 cores and we're getting
amazing physics cores which will bring
in our scores up as a whole he had us
pretty much beat and/or matched on GPUs
again I was using modded V bios he was
doing V bios plus shunt and we're not
doing any of that because the new Titan
r-tx cards came out and Stephen
magically got two of those as well he
has decided to revive this whole series
now we're good we're thinking we want to
try and beat him with 20 ATT eyes we
want to see what he does with the Titan
X cards or tightness yet still do it
tighten our TX cards but wouldn't it be
cool if we could beat him with non Titan
cards those are extremely locked down
which means no AIB support which means
very little XOC support which means mod
is V BIOS or gonna be near impossible to
find although he has build Zoid to his
side who could probably do whatever he
needs
I don't have any of that help
so we got to build it and we got to
install a new OS because I'm dumb and
the OS we use specifically for this got
put in Phil's computer as a scratch
drive and wiped or OS Drive whatever now
we got to got to build a new system so I
guess we should cue the montage because
that's how we do it okay so here it is
like I said we're going just for CPU in
this first part we we know how far we've
gotten on our GPUs we still have those
GPUs nothing's changed I haven't
physically modded the cards I don't want
to physically mob the cards I I don't
even want to mod the titans but it's
gonna depend how this competition goes
because Steve's screwing up my plans man
I want to do the white and gold build
and I got the rest of the parts for that
I got the cables from cable mod the
golden white cables that I ordered I got
the motherboard
I got everything I need to finish the
build but then suddenly he pulls out
this this Pat trick or whatever you want
to call it we've got our 99 ATX e in
here on our X 299 dark motherboard from
EVGA we're running 32 gigabytes of the
g.skill tried at Z 3800 memory remember
we're pushing this to like 4,000 4200
when it comes to the GPU because we're
not doing GPU test I just have a
low-power GPU in here my this is a GTX
960 it's got a single 8 pin if I had a
basic like GT 710 or something I'd be
running that just so I could get video
our pot is in here it's as insulated as
I think I can get so if you can't tell
by now we're obviously going with ln2 I
purchased today my own worthington 10
liter tank with our ln2 and then I've
also got a pour spout
we got thermoses and stuff because I'm
employing everything I learned from
Vince kingpins trip out here to see how
far we can get fun fact 3dmark is
telling us to disable g-sync before we
benchmark this is a free sink panel
now okay so we're in just be running the
custom test here I need to get some LNT
ready to go first because it's already
heating back up we're gonna be running
just a custom test here inside of times
by extreme because again all we care
about is the CPU scores so let me pour
some more in this thermos and then we'll
do it
so our CPU score was in eleven thousand
five sixty four obviously not very fast
because again it's only five gigs the
best we were able to get I believe was
five point five or five point four all
core with the 79 80 XE with dry ice oh
yeah CPU score was a 13,000 to 84 so
clearly we have a lot of room to make up
all right so instead of taking you guys
a long pray boring right above watching
me do this and click things
how about Phil find a way to make it
interesting and post post get it post
and then we we show you guys results
whether or not we could or could not
beat that score all aboard the wind
train dude dude
Oh couldn't get the six we probably
could if we had more time
honestly we're running out of ln2 we've
gone through nearly like probably bout
seven liters of it so far we have a 10
liter jug and as much as I would love
that 6 gigahertz round number I don't
think we've enough L&amp;amp;T to do that and
now mess with the memory so we're gonna
go straight to memory now see what
happens with 5.9 13,000 880 we did be
kingpin and we're not that far off from
number one let's just keep going
whatever look how frost over it is now
I'm gonna go tighter timings we'll go
with that
14:02 for her who would have thought a
couple of bozos like us should go one
day to air gas and be like we want to
buy Owen - okay so we are higher than
the highest now cuz we were 1402 eight
alright we're gonna make it official now
we switched in a twenty atti not
overclocked or anything we just have to
get through the test to make our cpu
score valid we're pretty comfortable
that this can allow us to take pretty
much anything Steve's gonna throw at us
with his water chilled 17 or 1998 Exe
again is all the same hardware to
tighten our TX cards and 99 80 XE he's
doing ice bucket first we had a
gentleman's agreement not to use ln2
because he wanted to get their bauer out
here and kingpin out here and give him
schedules and all that stuff I don't
think it's gonna happen anytime soon so
I just went ahead and broke that
gentleman's agreement cuz he didn't even
warn us that he was gonna be throwing
down the gauntlet again and even titling
it rip Jay and he didn't even fire up
the system he's that confident I applaud
his is how brazen he is though okay it's
okay we're gonna do this right now
1400 1700 it's slightly slower than that
one that was faster than the the world's
first on CPU that's okay since we know
that result is valid we're going to put
that up and I think we're gonna go and
bring the time exam
a bit more see there it is right there
number two Canadian JC cents again every
time I bench from here I'm Canadian it's
weird where does it go there Steve right
there I have to gloat when I can that
dude ain't no slouch he's gonna fire
back he's gonna fire back hard
okay last run this is alt this is the
last of my L into you right here oh we
knew it needed to be at negative 110
we're out we are out we're in but we're
happy though we saw I mean you saw and
there it is
cuz it's warming up now all right so we
gotta let the system warm up now you saw
that we beat the score though without
the upload because I didn't run the
whole test if we have more LNT we'd be
there but that is the nature of the game
so we are number two on CPU as of right
now we'll get it back though now that we
have all the equipment we're gonna set
it up permanently over there so that we
can definitely fight back with Steve
when I put this back to stock so that we
can warm our system up back to a safe
temperature where we can turn it off
clean it up and get the hell out of here
so I'm gonna save these settings because
this is five nine legitness
that's legit net right there so Steve as
you can see we've got more headroom to
go I'd barely had time to play with Ram
and we have exceeded 14,000 fifteen or
fifteen thousand four fourteen thousand
fourteen fourteen thousand 28 that was
the highest we saw without the timings
that we just did which would have passed
if I had been able to keep it at minus
110 so after CES I think the gauntlets
been thrown on both sides now we're
gonna see he's playing with GPU we're
pushing CPU as far as we can and we're
gonna see if we can't keep the lead
without going with the Titans and then
if we have to we've got those in reserve
thanks for watching guys I hope you guys
are ready for season 2
