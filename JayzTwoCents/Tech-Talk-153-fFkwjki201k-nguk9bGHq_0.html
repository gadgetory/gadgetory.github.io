oh I don't care I'm here whatever it's
up guys Jesus another guy dude oh yeah
nobody knows who I am anywhere my
limited edition J's a dickhole shirt the
one that has a little bit too much
spacing between the a and the wine I
like freaks everyone out but people
people find something to complain about
always but but you know we have this
week we have the intro oh no it's going
oh my god
welcome to tech check number 153 I 20 %
1k that what the title is if you're
wondered what is it what the title is
that was Matt keyboard that's the
winning formula is it it is shut up why
are you laughing over there so I'm gonna
be drinking piss water this whole show
because we have a lot of Bud Light
leftover from when Austin was here and
yeah it's so basically I had owned it
correct one two so basically um I had
this bright idea of okay we got post
Malone coming in the studio might as
well the way I guarantee he shows up as
I tell him I've got Bud Light cuz he
loves but life right
it is the redneck of beers J no I think
the Miller High Life er or yeah or Pabst
Pabst just kind of like coolers your
your mind to work coolers I'm with
Yonkers so anyway I was like yeah you
know what if I dangled beer in front of
him he'll come and it worked
the problem was he came he showed up and
within the first what five minutes of
him being here we were out right so Nick
or Brian Brian and Austin's like
personal assistant had to run to the
grocery store and they came back with
like a thirty two back yeah out of
control so so so junior you gonna like
last week someone in chat said make me
mother off all right so anyway okay
yeah I think I we stopped County at like
twelve or fourteen shots that's all I
know you're out of control
I don't know how'd we get home did you
guys did you guys just drive or
did he have his cool card you guys take
an uber or like what though he took is
he brought his rolls-royce here we did
yeah as a wraith and so he drove here
but then when he invited us to come over
I had to go home and change I want to
change cuz I didn't I was I was just
down a bit and so he had to go he
wouldn't go back and take a shower and
take a nap and then so we went home
changed cleaned up and then we drove
back out to Hollywood did you check out
his Wraith what was there oh yeah they
parked it in front of the club of course
they did valet did that someone was
leaning on it
someone was leaning on it and nobody was
saying anything about it and I was
already drunk I was like no one gonna
say anything about this I'll say
something glad and then Brian grabbed me
by the pants he wouldn't let me go fight
the guy that was guys we almost didn't
get Jay back for tech talk the best part
was when the night started I told I told
post Malone I was like hey just make
sure don't get arrested he's like no
promises he's an honest guy right anyway
Tech Talk I don't really have much
anyway topics other than the only thing
about tech about this show is we use it
to bring it to you guys you guys are
watching it on your devices that's it
that's on it's broadcast via a computer
using some open-source software so
that's got to give us some street cred
I'm not seeing a bunch of people
bitching about the audios being out of
whack I mean it sounds like audios
working although I just got a bunch of
notifications on my phone if I turn that
Oh was that yours about to turn on
yelling Nick that's how good my
microphone is it sounds local I thought
it was behind me it's probably just
because I'm gonna say it's a spatial
sound from those godlike headphones
you're wearing or those the audio
Technica's yeah the m50x is I think it's
funny that you're still using like the
old-school audio Technica's why not
they're awesome I mean they are I like
audio technica stuff but it's just it's
just for a tech guy of your stature I
would expect some like Sennheiser you
know SD 800 but I'm not an audiophile
that's true you're not you would even
know where to plug the damn thing like
why does this big connector not go into
the little hole well I know why do my
headphones newbie XLR come on I don't
have hey hey I'm not an audiophile
either I've got some nice headphones I
don't have a single uses XLR sorry the
beer is already engaged I wish I had a
beer because then I can put it on this
coaster
[Laughter]
yeah you know you know I do my best oh
well Jay think thanks for still still
keeping Tech Talk going so I at least
have one one video or twice a month
speaking of that guys this actually our
last show and for a second I was taking
you seriously without without random
 has been lately I was expecting to
be like yeah this is last show so I'm
gonna be tech talk anymore
hey things haven't been random from my
perspective nothing nothing's different
from your perspective I didn't say
different is it random things haven't
been random so let's see here so so Lars
says I'm a pet oh no I'm not a pet oh
I'm a parent there's a difference a lot
more letters involved I was the guy
walking around the grocery store
yesterday with candy hearts and big
giant stuffed unicorns to him and you
have any kids with you right no it was
like a be like just me and I the the
looks I was getting I was you could tell
the people who were being judgey like
trying to figure out and you could tell
the parents like oh that's so cute I
should Millie
yes Fruma it's for my mossad flings
no no what you need to do is roll up
your sleeves on your on your t-shirt and
then like go out and get your white van
with it all and then do a Burnout it
says free candy free candy free Katie oh
my god well I I surprised
Zander yesterday and put a TV a big you
know my old my old 1080p TVs that you
made fun of when you came up and said
you could see the pixels from a mile
away
I put one of those in his bedroom and
put his Wii U in there cuz I never play
with the Wii you were this way chose his
systems I stuck him in there he loves it
oh my god what okay so I'm allergic to
Bud Light I think and what I mean by
that is I think I get drunk super fast
off of it there's something about
because remember I'm the gastric bypass
right so drunk really fast but it's not
the first time I've experienced this
where I could I could drink Bud Light
and there's something about it that just
hits me harder than even like heavier
beers like see I love we tales citrus
ales like have
Blue Moon you know that sort of stuff
right I could drink that I could drink
four or five of those in I feel damn
thing I drink I'm a ghost bud no what's
that I don't know piss to the pistil
water ratios like nine to one ha yeah
excited for me to get drunk off beer I
mean just to even get a slight buzz I
got a chug like four of them in 20
minutes I don't know it's just a Bud
Light thing and my wife if she's
watching I'm sure she remembers plenty
of outings where why is there no percent
number on this cuz it's probably not
really beer Jay's like I don't know I
get so drunk off the Bud Light but he's
only been drinking a three beer bongs
near beer dear beer actually one of the
times the drunkest that I ever got like
that hit me really really hard even
worse than Jager bombs was the first
time I ever did a beer bong and it was
the last time I ever did a beer bong I
took you know arrogant bastard are you
familiar with that beer so arrogant
bastard is like a really bitter beer I
mean it is like ungodly you can't even
drink it most people can't even drink it
so you just beer bong it right but it
comes in like a 24 ounce bottle and it's
like I want to say it's like seven or
eight percent yeah well they flipped one
of those suckers over in the beer bong
and just dumped it down into me when the
gush and I remember it wasn't it didn't
even feel like it was 10 seconds after I
did that beer bong that I instantly just
felt numb like I got shot with a
tranquilizer dart yeah this shows gonna
be a train wreck guys I apologize now so
the people are saying it's 4.2% yes like
it's like nothing that's nothing but but
it's something about the Bud Light
specifically like I've been to plenty of
bars and clubs and stuff where I'm just
like someone will just like order me a
Bud Light or whatever and I drink it the
Bud Light always makes me feel weird
like earlier I was walking around
telling it like I feel weird I feel
funny you look at the ingredients like
it's like alcohol whiskey I love whiskey
but I couldn't I couldn't beer bong
whiskey hell no is it a boilermaker
what's the what's the one where you
dropped the whiskey into the beer or is
it whiskey huh I had a drink once where
it's like you had beer and you dropped a
whiskey it was either whiskey or rum or
something but you dropped it into the
beer and then chugged it next to the
alcoholics expert what drink is that he
doesn't know we're talking about I said
drink
he said he that's what a boilermaker is
yeah how does he not eat so he's the
alcohol expert he doesn't know what a
boilermaker is like the most common like
drink that like you you're never because
it's kind of like Paul he only drinks
they're like froo froo froo free beers
Oh like you can only get at this one
corner market in this hipster town
he's a beer beer snob yeah whiskey bomb
whiskey bomb nope that's that's it Oh
see okay redeemed yeah so so he held it
he got it I don't like him I don't like
try to my also tried have you ever had
an Irish Car Bomb
they're asking about it they're saying
it's thinking about it in chat
yeah I'm realizing we have a lot of
alcoholics in the chat we do
well that means to be expected do you
know how like investigated and and
probably demonetized you're making my
channel with all these Irish Car Bomb
and chats it's it's ok Jay I'm gonna
tell you how to fix it when it says that
your channel has been D monetized you
just go into the dash where you click
the but this is Appeal in two minutes
later it just turns back to monetize
nobody ever checks it I've never seen
that but I've never been you wanted size
before I've had four no no six six of my
videos demonetized three of them were
new ones went right when I upload them
they immediately became d monetized
before they were in processing and I
just went in as an appeal and two
minutes later they went back to public
and I'm like there's no way anybody
could have watched at that period of
time someone's saying it's called a
submarine whiskey shot dropped into a
cup of beer no that sounds too
complicated
drunks whiskey shot yeah I'm drunk in
words in a cup jagerbomb obscene
jägerbomb in chat yeah team Jager Bomb
Jager Bomb is officially my favorite
drinks and I can't really have with more
it's too sweet for me yeah be just you
just plow that sumbitch down or what's
that what summer you do it's a monster
and vodka I don't know what that was
called it's like a variation of the yeah
I mean it is but but that one's actually
pretty good too but I don't know there's
just something about Jager and Red Bull
they're just just like just like cores
hit you the Jager hits me hard you know
do you like the Jager into Vegas I do
like the Eiger in in the Vegas oh we're
from Wisconsin and we went to a Vegas
with a Jager Bomb
Jagr oh yeah my favorite pilot was Chuck
Yeager that's why I like that gagger
bomb when Yeager flew over in the war he
was a jagerbomb
what's Jagger all right speaking of tech
news if there's any is there still a
Tesla Roadster floating around up there
somewhere in there there is it is it
unfortunately its GPS was a little off
so it's not going to be visiting Mars
instead it's going right into the
asteroid belt no no the peds already on
the thing the thing's already dead not
arranged but uh but but it's funny
because they wanted to put it in this
like elliptical orbit or basically go
around earth and then go over and then
start orbiting Mars and instead now it's
it basically did one loop around Earth
and now it's just flying out into the
asteroid field so it it sucks because
we're not gonna see it right I mean
there's no way we're able to see an
object that small but did you hear NASA
actually did have to catalogue it is a
potentially dangerous near or near Earth
orbit object they said that on its
current orbit there is a slight chance
that it'll it'll get through the
asteroid belt flip around and it could
come back and hit earth it's extra na
mcclee small but it was enough that they
had to actually catalogue it you know
there's an astronomically small chance I
could flap my arms and fly should we
catalog that that's true but but let's
say it happens hypothetically speaking
would say it's happens to zealand like
how does it how does the insurance
exchange happen there when the car just
like rear-ends the planet earth at about
180 thousand miles an hour is that like
faster would be going I have no idea but
it's gotta be cooking man I mean it's
it's gonna slingshot around a
planet it's got a game some kind of
inertia from that I'm guessing I'm not a
I'm a earth scientist not a space
scientist they're different they put
Astro in front of it when you're when
you're out there somewhere yeah but
you're still out there when you're here
that was deep dude I'm curious how this
is exactly the car floating around up
there when they are at this flat whoa I
didn't even think about that Jay you
know a lot of Flat Earth theorists say
that's why the missiles go up and then
kind of turn sideways because it'll hit
the roof
[Laughter]
did you see the oh it's it was the meme
it was like the earth was a disk and it
shows the meteor hitting the disc in
limits spinning s flipping a coin what
about the senator that was worried about
Guam tipping over and capsizing but
that's a joke no it's not a joke because
this was this is from a few years back I
guess but apparently there was a there
was a military hearing taking place with
Congress or whatever they were trying to
get approval to like I guess I remember
the exact circumstances they were trying
to increase the population of Guam
there's only like 5,000 soldiers right
better agua naval Marines and Air Force
moment and this congressman was like he
was he sounded drunk right he's like so
the the island is if a quick-moving rose
11 miles miles the narrowest 22 miles
long correct and that and this gent this
general is like I don't have those
figures in front of me but I can get
them if you're interested and he's like
okay but so the so the square mileage of
the island is roughly again the journals
like again I don't have those figures
but we can gather that information if
you if you want and he goes my my
concern here is that if we increase the
population the the island will capsize
the look of the generals face as he
answered literally just like well we
don't anticipate this we don't
anticipate that being a problem but the
fact that these are the people making
decisions uh yeah yeah there are no
forests at least it's an interesting
time I mean nobody can argue that it's
not an interesting time to live yeah I
mean there's always something going on
like did you just hear a jeep IR our
Lord Emperor the FCC that they got net
neutrality thrown in the garbage is now
being investigated for collusion with
one of the giant media empires that
benefits him if net neutral base
entitled rating at a level schedule
was leaked because it was
it was his schedule with subpoenas
because he's a public servant right
Louis schedule was subpoenaed and it was
showed all the meetings of people he was
meeting with prior to the vote and even
the day of the vote he was meeting with
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T and all of them so I
mean it's doesn't collusion collision is
definitely going to be collusion yes
it's I don't think that's gonna come to
any surprise to anybody that he was
collaborating with making money with the
big companies you know yeah the guy that
could never give a good reason as the
wide net neutrality should go away like
every single fact he would always give
immediately was shot down by the
evidence and he would just keep giving
it that was like a chance to say well
because I can't line my pockets with an
open net brutally honest like it's like
so why do you think that neutrality is
hurting America I know because I don't
pay as much taxes cuz I don't I don't
have as much money to spend so this is
the zealous work see I get money from
Sinclair media and then I spend it on
other things that are not Internet
related I'm gonna I'm gonna I know you
can't see me cuz it's delayed I'm gonna
do my best age it I did it's his
impression no justice facial impression
oh okay yeah I'm waiting for it that's
my best impression I get what his face
looks like no I didn't just put my butt
up to the camera I swear oh that would
have been about the same effect I say
although his name is strikingly close to
a pie so it's like you're gonna eat
a pie but what country is that
that's into that the shizer stuff is
that is that Germany is that do we got
any German fans over there in the chat
they can verify that it's benign Molina
yes is two girls one cup like in the PG
section over there oh here comes here
comes the impression here comes here
goes there watch it I don't know if I
did it I don't know if our mine is I
don't see you actually you actually look
like you're about ready to fall asleep
no no what are you laughing at yeah you
were Oh agent pie it doesn't matter the
guy the guy why can't we can't trust a
guy Christina says when does the text
hawk start when you get that out
that's when it starts yeah you just call
me
tits man called tech talk doesn't mean
it's to talk about technology just a
name just the name bro I'm gonna change
the name of this show to just talk talk
yeah yeah I like it
talk talk although I mean hey if they
want tech news I mean I can just click
on random on Sina that they could
just go look at their self like five
hidden Mac OS High Sierra features you
need to know did they talk about Nvidia
turning okay that's a good one
have you looked at that at all No so
there's rumors of Nvidia coming out with
a new card as rumors has it that it's
going to be a cryptocurrency card whole
big big shocker there it's
called the training or whatever like
that supposed to be an homage to that
that guy who just who developed the the
turning machine right for the crypto the
Turing machine the Turing's yeah turning
I thought it was but anyway it's because
he was the guy who cracked you know the
crypto code so yep supposed to be an
homage to him but so Nvidia is no
stranger though to picking scientific
influential people in history right
kepler volta maxwell you know tesla yeah
yeah Volta so there's no that's not new
but this this particular timing of him
of them doing turning or Turing or
whatever it's called do you think
they're gonna come out with a with a
cryptocurrency optimized card that has
that they will have no video display
ports or anything on it yep I think they
I think they absolutely should I don't
think they should necessarily just limit
it to that currency yeah Alan Turing
he'd broke the encryption from what was
it uh was the German Navy I think was
the Germans yeah something like that and
then even though he broke the code we
never let them know we broke the code so
he's still like and our ships in the
 battle and let him die and
dude that guy that guy probably had a
rough time sleeping until I think he
committed suicide correct me if I'm
wrong there but that's got to be a rough
life when you do something that's like
yeah we're gonna just kill off about 50%
of our forces and not tell them about it
yeah upper hand I actually watched a
whole documentary about the German
u-boats and and how long we set ships
out to basically get sunk because we
didn't want a tip that we knew where
they were yeah isn't that crazy like
that's you just think about that you're
like yeah I guess we won the war but
 at what cost right yeah
no better than the Nazis at that point
yeah that nigma machine that's right it
was that it was the Enigma machine that
they cracked the reason for the grip
that's that thing that's like this looks
like kind of a wooden like clicker
clackers like a wooden box with a bunch
of gears and yeah they like it's a based
on they they like reroll the encryption
constantly so it's like every message is
encrypted differently I have no idea
so the and the cool thing was the Turing
machine was completely mechanical yeah
which was neat I mean it was like the
size of a huge room that this machine
was just clunking clunking and clunking
away to crack the if you think about how
smart people have to be the like not
only cracked that stuff but just to
develop it in the first place right cuz
you're like today if you want to write
an algorithm you just sit down you're
like all right won't you just take 50
and bit shifted by two bits and then
multiply it by this number back then
they're like we need 60 for 10 2014 7
you know figured all that out when
I think about my biggest accomplishment
in the last day or so it's the fact that
I put computer inside of a beer I wait I
put a beer inside of a computer and I I
finally installed lights in my computer
noise I'm looking forward to your video
tomorrow is it going yeah it's like I
don't watch much of your videos anymore
you know because they're all just
basically sellout garbage but that one
I'm gonna watch J yeah I know I know you
gave up making YouTube videos I didn't
think you'd give up watching them to
Jesus Christ actually you know what's
cool though I actually got free internet
speed boost to my internet provider
didn't even tell me like I went to the
speed test the other day I went from 250
megabit up to 350 megabit and they never
sent out any notice no information
nothin oh I remember my upload went from
5 to 25 after a car hit a pole they
never say anything after that the
internet provider would be like making
people like acutely aware of that like
look hey we're giving you more for your
money but nope they just him to
flip a switch somewhere that's right an
accident psychotic production says is J
drinking no I take the blood like cans
empty them and then I pour water into
them because I feel more classy drinking
water out of a blood light can't be in
your dinky budded a blood like can you
still drinking water so hey Hobbs
cleared up the Alan Turing committed
suicide because they chemically
castrated him for homosexuality and then
he killed himself Wow go Erica so first
he breaks the encryption wins us the war
and then they they drive in a suicide
rock on well it's gotta be so just
because he was gay
yeah just cause gay we live in a very
different time today oh wow you know the
dude just like you know like sausage
instead of clams I mean I'm just some
design and they they chemically
castrated important lesbians you what
hold that up again that was amazing okay
it's the best coaster ever been actually
you got this I got this from Graham from
Blair best coaster ever
I just gotta flip it over every time I
forget everyone stalls and ro come up
into the room and he'll look down and
you can tell his like cogs are turning
trying to read the words and I'm like no
flip it over
he's grown up so fast man is he is he
now
yes yes well you know what - you got you
got two girls man you're even you're
even up against more opposition than me
cos and ER I think I can actually keep
like a mental edge on oh yeah your two
girls when they get older I do have kids
don't I you do you don't see them that
often but you do yeah they're still
alive I'm too busy I hear sing late
nights at the studio's making videos for
everyone a thumbs down and get their
nose that weren't about I'm so glad I
can work long hours for people to have a
free platform to bitch about I know it's
so funny cuz here people like talk about
like what they do like hey what do you
do for a living you know I work in
Microsoft you know I work in the you
know things we've got these tests and
install these things and every blah blah
blah blah okay Jay what do you do for a
living I don't know I make videos and
people the comments tell me to kill
myself and then I ever once a while you
get somebody on Twitter and then this
guy DDoS attacks me what's a DDoS so you
don't go into that what do you do for a
living well apparently I impersonate
jay-z yeah I live with everyone thinking
I'm a black rapper you know you know it
cracks me up is there is no possible way
that anybody with even like one ounce of
intelligence can draw that conclusion
looking at that Twitter profile you know
it goes like this every time this is not
the J you're looking for well the why
are you pertaining to be G James II I'm
not I make computers well still you just
you just stealing his name no it's J's
plural lowers cases ei because he s was
taken well you should change your name
if you don't want this to happen to
know
should learn to read you should turn to
look learn to look at a picture but
every single time you correct them even
if you're nice about it they get rude
and snippy and like want to flip out on
you in some way so that's why I go to
now is I just retweet does retweet and I
I so I get those messages are those
tweets every single day I don't retweet
all of them
I just retweet some of the good ones but
after that whole Trump versus jay-z
thing then my Twitter was unusable for
days no that was crazy I saw I saw the
one that you retweeted where that lady
just kept on fighting even kept on
fighting like oh my god what is
wrong with this lady yeah seriously it's
like what if my name is Fedor on there's
every gonna be like dude your name is
Doug use does your name you can't do
that nothing nothing is worse than those
that get offended on behalf of someone
else
everyone Saul I still get people tell me
I misspelled barnacle barnacles and
regather it's a it's a channel about
barnacle reproduction on the whole boats
yeah so somebody's like hey barnacles
whatever six pronounced barnacle is he's
like world's notes build a way spelled
barnacles look how barnacles a spell
he's like oh look god damn it I should I
should have probably thought that
through one I actually your name doesn't
even spell out bar nuke leaves it
doesn't it doesn't necessarily it spells
barnacles no that's like but it's like
it's like barnak yoli's bird Nikhil's
barnacles barbecue barnacles would be
would probably doesn't automatically
yeah okay like night you know there's a
cave I say how I want there it's worried
like terrible names out that people have
come up with right I mean geez to censor
okay yeah sort of a sentence of articles
where those a barnacles bit wit but the
I mean but then there's like Logan Paul
uh who that comes up with that kind of
name I know his parents must have been
really any people all keemstar wanted me
to build him up here on that one
keemstar wanted me to build him a robot
themed computer
a robot themed she's done it man she
should have done it no I got too much on
my plate right now anyway dude your
audience would have doubled like all the
internet trolls you would have picked up
like your demographic would have blown
up and like the 12% okay what's keeping
my demographic in that 24 to 36 male
range right now because that's exactly
hey comments on videos or engagement and
nobody it's more comments I'm not gonna
get engaged I want I would rather have a
fraction of the comments and have them
be sensible
because right now you can still make
heads or tails out of them Oh God
Oh what do we started in chat no oh my
god what I recommended some modders for
him to get his PC from and it's on its
own course so well like that guy as you
know is endlessly with me in the
past so with everybody that's what
this whole person that's what this whole
persona is about pretty much everything
Jay are you serious about keen that's an
instant death off go look at Twitter
there you go man twitter is an accurate
record of everything that's happened to
this world well you can see the
interactions anyway nothing that doesn't
delete it off Twitter every gets deleted
you can always go to those like archive
sites that archive everything like three
milliseconds after you post it the
Internet is forever like it's like black
mayor we've been watching black mayor
that shows amazing dude is so good
although there are some hit misses like
oh yeah I watched one episode that was
kinda like me have you watched all of
them mmm I don't know I don't think I've
watched all of them in the latest season
okay I just like all the way through
season three I just started season four
so what's your favorite episode so far
okay guys real quick if you don't know
first of all black mayor is a show on
Netflix so if you have Netflix you have
access to black mirror and the show is
based about based on tech so it's like a
Twilight Zone with tech so this is
related to Tech Talk
so it's kind of like outer limits but
techie it's all tech based and it's kind
of like it guts
each episode its own little mini show so
it's not like there's any you don't have
to watch them in any particular order
for it to make sense but but the
technology is consistent through the
show way darker though it takes you to
like a dark place in humanity so so my
favorite episode would probably the USS
Callister
it was a starship captain and VR okay
basically holding hold on that's episode
1 season 4 I have not watched that one
yet so you've watched more you're gonna
you're gonna love it
okay you watched more than you think
then that's the last episode that I
watched was that one and it was it was
like it was my favorite and then my
second favorite was the one were the the
pedophile guy had to kill the other guy
and they were basically like the text
messages were pitting all the criminals
against each other yeah yeah yeah I was
called shut up that one's called shut up
and dance yeah it was so dark because in
the beginning you're actually kind of
like pulling for the guy like why are
they picking on all these guys and they
don't know spoilers no spoilers I'll
start sorry gonna watch it it's really
just say this this show have you ever
heard of like if you guys are watching
this you've you've probably heard of
people in the news that you just like
like this recent school shooting right
and there's people out there that are
like you know hang this guy publicly you
know quarter him whatever people talk
about like these like I'm back in the
dark days right public executions and
stuff things that today would never
happen because there would be public
outrage but you but but this the sense
of justice and humanity is like I want
to get even so the idea is to be like
terrible and repercussion to these
people as a punishment right to make you
feel better a society like this bad
person just we just watched him get
beheaded we're happy right but that's
what this show kind of takes it down to
to the point to where you're like it
almost talks about things that you've
heard society as a whole mention like
this is this would fix our problems and
you actually see it play out in a very
realistic way and you're like oh god
weird weird like the upvote and
downvote episode that now and like kind
of resonated with me a little no it's
the it's the five point the five star
rating each person has a five star
rating how about that one no the one
where they voted they vote them up oh is
it the five star rating yeah it was the
one Thibault demand vote them down they
have a score and once you get below a
certain score yeah so basically this
it's a total rating of 5.0 all right so
that's perfect and basically like anyone
that was like 4.5 or higher was
considered like the elite class mm-hmm
and then if you were like 4.0 to 4.4
then you were considered desirable and
below that
the lower your rating the lower your
like livelihood was so basically any
time you interact it with someone you
rated that person and it was instant and
and they all have like these implants in
their eyes so you can see who you're
talking to you can see their rating and
stuff so the idea is it literally is
like living as if your entire life was a
YouTube video and everyone you
interacted either got to thumb up or
thumb down and your average was the way
you lived like your life was based upon
your average that was something that
like dropped your vote or dropped your
score down like people would just
immediately look at you and shun you
like you were like some kind of bum or
some garbage person but regardless why
you're dressed or acted but as I was
watching that episode I was kind of like
you know what though you would just be
fake right and we won't just be fake
which it talks about and this funny
thing is like the girl like gives the
guy a 5 right she's like okay Dean gives
a 5 and he looks at her and he like
touches his phone and it's like wah-wah
like a 2.0 yeah and then she was like
cuz she'd finally had enough she's like
what the heck cuz if you got mad and
like yelled or cussed it was like an
immediate like 1 right yeah and she was
like what the hell I gave you a 5 and he
goes yeah I just didn't feel like we had
a meaningful interaction it was like
damn so imagine the internet trolls like
actually could have power right somebody
pointed out in chat to I actually I was
getting war Vil confused a black mayor
I've seen both episodes though I did see
both episodes but Orval did it take on
it where you had a raw number score and
yet not voting down vote you actually
wore a badge and people could walk up
and just poke you in the chest and like
a vote you down vote you in public oh it
was basically a ripoff of the black
mirror episode but I've seen both the
black mirror one with the black mirror
when basically everyone's smartphone
just you rated every person yeah like
taxi rides the the barista the coffee
shop you know all that stuff you just
interacted with them so could you
imagine if we actually lived like that
and here's the thing we're kind of
getting close to that we are because
that's because I've got like a four
point eight nine goober rating and I'm
like yeah yeah I'm a desirable writer
you know and the thing is you you've
used uber uber right yeah so you use
uber and if you see a driver that's got
like a 4.2 you're kind of like Oh what
happened here you know what I mean yeah
so it's like you start judging the
person by their rating before you've
even met them or if you have like a
really
uber score nobody's ever gonna pick you
up like you're basically just
blacklisted so yeah it's totally is it
might be one service but what if every
service starts moving to that model yeah
you're just walking around and and and
the thing is like in that one episode
there's a there's a interaction where
she like yelled something in public and
got mad and everyone driving by and
walking by I was like bear bear bear
bear like just downloading her as they
went by they'd even interact with her it
was like she grabbed my attention as
being a negative person so I'm gonna
download her and that sucked about that
is the premise why she wants to move
into this she wants to move into this
this nice apartment and they're like yes
we you could move in as soon as next
week oh oh this is a problem and she's
like what and it's like well you have to
be a 4.5 to live in this depart in this
and you're only a 4.2 she's like oh
that's not a problem not a problem at
all so there's even like life coaches in
their entire job was to help you get a
better rating like they were giving you
strategies of like where to go and who
to talk to you and what to do to get
desired because the only way you could
pull your score up honestly is there's
more weight given by the person who
votes you versus the vote you're getting
so if you get a 5 from a 5 right if you
get a 5 point a 5 rating from like a
four point nine that pulls you up faster
than if someone that was like a 2.0 gave
you a five so it does wait and Orville
did something similar to that too where
they had like a coach that was like hey
dude you gotta go on TV and like
apologize you gotta mean it and you get
you know to make your score go back up
and you know like coaching them and
it just reminded me like the Logan Paul
stuff like dude you got to go apologize
publicly man you got to say you did it
wrong I don't take your licks I get this
random email I hope he's watching right
now can you tell me how to fix microsoft
c++ runtime library error thanks wait
you don't want to do that Jay I'm
surprised what I love is just the fact
that they'll email me at once and they
can't me go fix this okay thanks bye
I had a guy emailed me about a month ago

gee I want to see you down that Bud
Light lol first I've been able to watch
live I have been watching for years
 that fried my tongue thank
you sir but unfortunately I can't pound
beer part of a whole gastric bypass
thing I had nine years ago if you pound
beer does it just like slowly start
coming up your soffit get some foaming
out of your mouth I can't yeah I
physically can't it's too foamy
it's the carbonation in the and stuff so
I can't well I'm the heaviest I've ever
been right now and I keep thinking about
getting a gastric bypass I'm like yeah
like yeah because I keep thinking about
all the people to get them that like
said I can't think of a single person
that got one it didn't have some weird
after-effects I I don't look at nothing
old Chuck a beer as being a weird after
effect I look at being able to ride my
bike lift my weights and climb stairs
and not have a problem as being a good
side effect sir I thought you had other
problems like digesting certain things
was like dairy or something not dairy I
thought you had other things than just
beer is beer the only thing that you
have a problem well I didn't carbonated
oh okay so it's just carbonation okay so
you came out better than my other buddy
who said that like dairy made him sick
yeah I mean I'm sick you've seen me
drink my coffee and stuff yeah no no I
know you drink a lot of coffee you pray
drink more coffee than anybody I know I
have at least one latte day
sometimes you're seriously like
single-handedly funding the the caramel
macchiato market yeah I do have at least
one latte a day it is a good drink
though the upside-down caramel macchiato
you definitely sold me on that like the
last okay so you know what and turn in a
coffee table so talk suddenly I'm some i
slurring there's technology man they
burned the beams with a big
metal bin that some you can control the
snow machine with an app mm-hmm i
slurring a little bit I'm sorry so um I
was talking about something was it
Oh coffee yeah um I forgot oh so the
reason why I drink them the reason why I
drink the macchiatos is they of the
lattes they have the least amount of
calories of the other ones like the
white chocolate locust and all that
stuff they have like 500 600 calories
the lattes have like 300 still that's
for a venti right that's for the big one
yeah that's like 320 it's a lot but
still it's not bad it's a lot but it's
not compared to like some of the drinks
it's our
bucks that are over a thousand calories
ridiculous yeah I mean in two drinks you
could literally consume your entire
daily and take a fuel like that's that's
nuts
Andrew Murphy and chat says yes you're
slurring a bit there's a little bit a
little bit we like a slur EJ you know
you know why people can't be mad at me
and stuff right now anyway I'm giving
away a lot giving away monitors I'm
giving away a four thousand dollar
computer we're doing the post Malone you
find the parts for him we're really
given to you though the they all were
provided for give away but do you think
that really matters to me I at the end
that doesn't count though that doesn't
count because you're giving away other
people's doesn't matter if you J if
you want to be charitable man you got to
go out and spend at least fifty thousand
dollars of your own money I've already
spent more than that in my own giveaways
I'm pencil toppers okay well what would
go in the back of a pencil yes the ones
are going to the back of a pencil they
will am stylus is cuz nobody uses
pencils anymore
a stylus topper it's a stylist opera how
about Jase two cents pasties they just
look like two pennies let let this go on
record right now if a set of J's two
cents pasties show up in my peel box I
will wear them during one of my morning
coffee episodes and I will block Jerry
from that day forward you have to block
my 75 troll accounts too bitch oh it's
easier for me to block him is for you to
make him why actually not true I
actually have a script they can they can
randomly generate a gmail address and a
YouTube account in under 10 seconds
because I did research to figure out how
to I know how you get any likes on your
videos yeah go look at my subs they're
all like afj three to seven random image
to from Google search funny Jerry has
exactly 75 likes on every video no I
wanted to figure out why in the
these bought channels because I the same
channel five five times I reported the
same exact channel with the same exact
name the unofficial barnacles nerdgasm
channel I poured it they I thought they
weren't deleting it but then I went back
and looked through my email email they
were he Neal
me and me leaving it are you sure it was
well cuz you're I mean you're you're
seeing the same display name on a
different account every time right but
but it's because the literally
has a script that just goes to a bunch
of channels
it creates the Gmail a random gmail
account associated with a random YouTube
account
it just starts cop downloading the
videos and re uploading them to the new
channel or is it all here's a good let's
talk about giveaways for a sec um I just
did one I haven't got a giveaway in
forever but I just did my first giveaway
for like a year Hawkins and Chet says do
these giveaways actually give you more
views over time I doubt they abused your
boost your viewers more or go out buy
even 2% it doesn't matter to me because
of the fact if I'm in a position to be
able to give something like that away to
somebody out there somebody who one day
was like I like this guy he's got a cool
channel subs whatever giveaway rolls
along this guy suddenly got a $4,000
computer that I gave away whether it be
a sponsored computer or not makes no
difference do you think the guy at the
ends gonna be like my own Jaden actually
it's a little less important I don't
care he's got a $4,000 computer isn't
give a it's a it's just about doing
that I mean it does help boost stats a
little bit but giveaways to boost your
stats only works when you're a small
Channel because you'll see the huge the
huge gains it's like those big spikes
the big spikes when you get to a certain
point don't show up in the grand scheme
anymore it just becomes fun to do the
giveaways and see people get excited
about it it depends though it for from
purely marketing perspective just just
from my giveaway of the razor phone is
as long as you do a giveaway in the
context of something that relates
directly to what you do you do attract
an audience of potential people that
want that part not everybody but
potentially want that product because
that's kind of a given up they might
stick around that's a given though I
mean that's why not seeing me giveaway
you know what's a I came to think of
anything because I I'm so streamlined
what we do if I was suddenly giving away
a bike you know because yeah that's not
gonna help you at all as a matter of
fact that would hurt you in the longer I
don't care about that sort of stuff I
just I just like being able to actually
give away things I actually added it up
huh
I wanna see you give away a bike oh I'll
give away your bike you're not using it
I know I'm not your little the old
battery bike I said why not wrote it the
other day well you didn't rode yours
more recently than I did then I am gonna
sell my Santacruz blur though cuz I I'm
so out of shape right now J like I
talked man it's it's like hard to even
admit it to myself out of shape I am
right you know you know who's getting in
crazy good shape right now as my wife
she's doing like three or
she's doing like two workouts a day
right now yes she told me I saw on
Facebook she said she joined two gyms
and I was I got to do a double-take I
was like ooh wait yeah see gym and then
you go to another gym yeah the first
gyms like the first gyms like a CrossFit
like a high intensity thing and then she
goes and works out with me just lifting
in the evenings that's awesome man
yeah she's on it man I told her I'm on
that eat anything I want don't give a
 that you know you you might get
there and look skinny and I'll stared
yeah yeah there you go I'll look at you
from a distance and make you feel
uncomfortable tells me he's not gonna
get uncomfortable cheese with you no no
the reason I haven't been doing much
online lately is cuz my back has been
 killing me it's a level where
medication is almost ineffective now so
you take pain meds and stuff long enough
they stop working they stop working they
straight-up stop working so but the
problem is I can tell now the
deterioration of my back has actually
advanced quite a bit so I need to go see
the the spinal doctor but my insurance
right now is all up and stuck in
limbo because of the S corp stuff you
know you know it's like the whole
business thing I got a CPA that I'm
meeting with on Saturday once I get that
all figured out then because in
Washington state I don't know if you
know this but they with our
insurance thing up here where we weren't
allowed to keep our same insurance plan
they only have three plans that you're
allowed to have as a sole proprietorship
and all three of them aren't aren't
accepted by any of my personal doctors
any of the hospitals I went to and need
the specialist you know it's no
different than California it's stupid
though it's completely stupid so so now
the solution is once I get the CPA and I
do the escort payroll which
you're all too familiar with once I do
that then I'm eligible to get any
insurance I want yeah which is just dumb
I don't understand that like let
I'm paying the same as everybody else
just let me have the insurance plan I
want I don't understand why they
restrict it so heavily for sole
providers you know stressful is right
now we're expanding hiring more people
and trying to find the right people you
know I mean that's
hexade and chat says she didn't join two
gyms she met two gyms with a smiley face
I love everybody in chat this happens
every single time I talk about my back
pain smoke pot smoke pot CBD take CBD
smoke pot smoke pot like lit up so when
we went out with post Malone I got a
contact high they
yeah well here look let me explain
something real quick here J - all these
people exists malone doesn't do pot
anymore like he doesn't smoke at all
when he was with us it's just there were
other people on the patio smoking oh
wait he doesn't know no he's pretty he's
I think he like every now and then does
like he was mentioning like every now
and then he does for like headaches and
things but no he's just he's like off
everything Wow super kudos to
him man mhm me on the other hand people
that talk about I gotta explain
something you guys okay I actually have
to take opiate strength medication for
my back and that's not even working
trust me if only its heart working THC
and CBD ain't gonna do and I'm
saying that from experience because I
did try it for two weeks cuz my doctor
suggested that I try it as an
alternative and I tried it and
unfortunately it was it was it was
almost next to nothing for pain loss I
mean it was slight but it was it was
almost next to nothing now the problem
is the medicine that I'm on which is
opiate based is also becoming largely
ineffective
especially when I'm mobile if I'm
stationary it still works pretty good
but because I refused to take a dose any
larger than I'm currently on but don't
you have a spur done I do I have a spur
that's a base that's never gonna get
better until you get that ground
down and I know because of where it's at
it's not easy but that's never gonna get
better well here's what they told me
this and they're gonna update the
recommendation when I go see the spinal
doctor um the last time I saw this final
doctor was four years ago and he said he
highly recommends that they do not cut
the spur off because it's too close to
the sciatic nerve where it's resting on
it they risk nicking the nerve and they
said that could cause massive paralysis
more pain that I'm in right now so no no
Jason's right I do have to lose weight
guys guys hey no mistake I'm not hey I'm
not promoting this I'm 320 pounds right
now that's the heaviest I've ever been
in my life and I interject on that
please do um everyone's go-to answer
when someone's overweight and claims
about back problems is lose weight lose
weight lose weight that'll fix your back
when I was 494 pounds I had no back
problems I had my back problems started
after I lost all my weight because what
happened was when I got that big I
rearranged my body my spine the angle of
my spine the angle of my upper back my
neck my hips everything was under stress
and it compresses right and so over time
if I'd stayed that big for many more
years it probably would have become a
bad problem with my back or sure bending
over at the waist and stuff wasn't very
that's just that was muscular that
wasn't spine
so it wasn't that big of a deal though I
didn't have any back pain when I lost
all my weight my rearranged again
everything got completely out of whack
that's what my back problems started so
when I see people just go to that go to
like oh you're fat lose weight that'll
fix your that's just ignorance
let's just try ignorance because I've
lost a hundred pounds three times in my
life I was down to 205 at one point I
was working at Microsoft because we did
this mash diet and it actually didn't it
helped my back pain a little bit but it
didn't solve the key problem of that
nerve that bone rubbing up and down on
that nerve that's gonna happen in anyway
but yeah I'm gonna wait now or I will
admit actually losing weight would help
me because I have severe scoliosis too
so particularly with scoliosis weight
can be an issue because your spine is so
curved but but you're right it's not
gonna just fix everything it's not the
holy grail just like some people think
weed is the holy grail somebody in the
chat says you're addicted to opioids of
course I'm addicted to opioids when you
take opioids for seven years
you do have an addiction but the one
thing that I did is I chose never to
take a dose that was high enough that
puts me into any physical risk so I
stopped taking it every year for a week
and when I stopped taking it I just get
like flu-like symptoms but if you that's
why I won't go up anymore that's the
thing as I could fix my pain tomorrow
just by going to the doctor going okay
it's been another year or two let's up
the dose but that would then put me into
a territory where it start getting
dangerous and I don't I don't want to
 with that yeah that's bad so so
know I'm the right at this point up
highest dose I'll ever allow myself to
be on when I started saying when I
started seeing a chiropractor of course
my audience takes the opportunity to
tell me how I'm just and subscribing to
pseudoscience and it's and this
and that after one year of chiropractic
treatment and by the way my chiropractor
is a doctor he has an MD and he just he
was kind of rare it is rare it is rare
but he is an MD but he just he just
chooses to do holistic approaches to
treating treating the problems rather
than masking them through medications
and so what happened was CES last year
Nick was there he'll tell you because of
my back problem in my and my SI joint
dysfunction my sciatic nerve would would
get pinched in or the piriformis muscle
would get inflamed and pinched my
sciatic against my hip and then I would
completely shut down from the waist down
I was practically paralyzed and I would
go from standing to sitting and then
would
be able to move like my legs was just
completely shut off like there was there
was nothing there I couldn't I would if
I went to take steps I would probably I
would practically fall like Nick and my
brother-in-law Frank he used to help me
at CES both of them were just like are
you okay like they had to carry
everything for me because if I had to
stand or sit or lay for any length of
time I got stuck in that position yep
fast forward one year of chiropractic
treatment this CES not a single problem
not one problem with standing on my feet
for hours and hours walking twenty five
thousand steps a day no problems
whatsoever just because of adjustments
no medicine not a single medicine for my
back no adjustment your right but
chiropractors the problem with them is
you don't know which ones you're getting
like a lot of people like I went to
chiropractors for when I got in a car
accident when I was younger they
me up early back I went to another one
when I was at Microsoft and they
me up really bad and did way more damage
I can see I actually got shut down
because he ended up hurting somebody so
bad that they sued him and wiped out his
entire business a year later I can see I
can see that being a thing you know
fortunately this was this was someone
that Jennifer was already seeing and it
was it was coming he came highly
recommended from multiple sources that
we trust and I'm glad I did it because I
was I was like everyone else like no no
chiropractor it's not for me not for me
the only thing I haven't tried that I
should try acupuncture oh I've actually
heard good things about that because it
treats the nerve the nerve itself which
is like the source of the pain so I
thought about it see my back pain is not
gone my back pain just went from being
severe to about a constant three the
thing is instead of it being a three
attend a three es7 a five attend a five
a seven it's like a three or four a
three or four maybe a five here and
there a three or four three so it's so
much more consistent that's what I tell
people I'm never I've never even been
out of pain for the last four years the
four years I'm always in pain it's just
tolerable pain versus intolerable pain
yeah like I can either walk with a limp
going ow ow ow ow or I can just walk and
feel a click in my back and it just
hurts a little bit yeah like a two or
three versus like a six or a seven but
like you said I have the same problem
we're about two or three times a year
all be sitting in a chair and I'll lean
it just a weird angle and I'll feel a
twinge it just feels like a like a
severe pinch
and then the next day yeah Felicia's
like helping me get to the toilet like I
literally can't stand and put any weight
on my leg at all yeah last night last
yesterday I was dead lifting almost 200
pounds which is something I last year I
couldn't even deadlift the bar which is
40 42 pounds or 45 pounds yeah last
night I was doing almost 200 so I mean
that just shows you in the tree like in
a short timeframe going from a problem I
had lived with for years just suddenly
just like oh my god I actually have my
lower strength back yeah well be in a
bed for 22 days in December is what
 me all my core strength
disappeared and in my entire life I've
never had that happen
yeah like it actually kind of scared me
because when I finally started getting
I'm moving around again I noticed that I
was having a lot more severe pain in my
lower in my lower back than I was before
and I realized it was because since I
was in bed for so much time with
pneumonia and and ripping that that
muscle my leg god I just saw I just saw
Nick back there that freaked me out I
see him back there and the pain the pain
is is pretty dramatic in that some
people actually had someone in chap
mentioned near blockers that's another
thing that I've been looking into but
the truth is I don't want to solve it
with we we knew when we started the pain
management that it wasn't an endgame
solution yeah we knew that opioids can't
be an endgame solution because you will
adapt to them no matter what the dose so
you eventually do hit a point where
they're just no longer effective I mean
they're slightly effective but they're
just no longer effective and when you
hit that point you happy it doesn't
matter you don't just switch from like
you know oxycodone to morphine or
oxycontin or fentanyl which is like the
 king of ever you know stay away
from that because that will that
will seriously you up really I'm
throwing paper towels at Nick good but
but but the thing is another thing that
really pisses me off is and everybody
deem demonizes opioids and medication
because of the epidemic I mean there is
an epidemic more people die from that
drug than anything but there are some
people actually there's a lot of people
that can only be treated by that drug
even even in the short term that is the
only thing that actually works so it
kind of pisses me off when people just
say they are you miss what's that Nick
Nick miss the replay where I threw the
parole paper towels at him oh I'm
listening oh yeah Oh a node nerve
blocking brings up other issues yeah no
I've heard of
the side-effects that's the unfortunate
thing with medication is there's no such
thing as a medication that is free well
it's like sports its exports medicine
how much sports medicine is actually
just masking pain so they can keep
playing when they're doing so much
damage like like let's just use the knee
so the knee is a perfect example the do
cortisone shots in the knee when they're
tearing cartilage and stuff mm-hmm and
and massive meniscus tears and things
and so they mask the pain so they can
keep playing but then they're completely
destroying their knee in the meantime so
they're actually destroying their future
in order to play today but you know
because the contracts and multi-million
dollar deals and this and that you know
that's what they do they sacrifice their
bodies for these for this money speaking
of which I know if we have any I don't
know if we have any Tampa Bay Rays fans
but I got approached by a Tampa Bay Rays
player about a BC baseball setup what
about the the float tanks actually the
float tanks do help my back a lot I need
I need to do that more it's one of those
things where it's like you just got a
budget the time to you know drive over
there do the float and get back after
budget about three hours but uh but no
the float tank actually helps a lot if
you guys have never done an Epsom salt
float it's free to Mandy what Oh Bernie
sorry Bernie films I love you too have
you ever done J have you ever done a
deprivation tank float I have not I
don't I don't think I should be lost to
my senses yet all agree that that's a
pretty bad idea it was gonna dylan steve

I'm not gonna get mad at anyone that
doesn't realize this tech talk isn't
about tech because we've been on hiatus
for so long it's so many people who just
don't realize Tech Talk is a show where
we just talk yeah we use we use chance

is one of my Christmas presents for my
wife yeah a lot a lot of people always
think that you're like mad at me you're
being a prick to me or whatever I'm like
guys it just it just just Jay this is
just Jay online this is how Jay is and
plus you're like a hundred times busy
people don't realize how much of a
workaholic you are to like Jay doesn't
know how to stop working
he literally has two people to have
people like pry him off of work with a
crowbar last week alone I don't know
date is Thursday okay there was three
different days last week that I was here
until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning
and I was here till 2:00 in the morning
Sunday night even on the weekend and
then this week actually it's been fairly
normal scheduled but like I said I
wasn't kidding either when I say I make
these videos to get people a platform to
go up there and bitch about but I'm not
gonna change anything I'm happy I'm
happy with where we are we've got a ton
of support the socialblade if you go
look at the social blade numbers they
they don't lie you know I mean the the
trends are there and we're making the
right choices and if you don't want to
tell me I'm your channel failing it's
like you obviously have never taken a
look at the numbers but I'm gonna say
I'm standing you usually are doing here
I'm staying true to my the reason I
started this channel which was to be
able to make entertaining videos about
tech and help people learn something and
become
that's always been my goal and this is
that's why our motto which is not like
public anywhere it's it's on all of our
documentation and stuff when we when we
do our our sponsorship promos and our
sponsorship pitches and stuff is our
entire goal here is to create prosumers
out of consumers consumers consume
prosumers actually teach and so that's
why that's our motto we create prosumers
and that's when we're gonna change so
your contents always been absolutely
solid and consistent like you definitely
ticked the right boxes to become a
professional technology YouTube channel
and part of part of my team you've got a
studio you've got the right equipment
you've got the right people involved
you're gaining the right attention from
the right people yeah that's why that's
why a lot of people ask me to remember
the remember the tweet a while ago where
people were like oh what was it they
said that we should work together
something like that and you said
something to the fact that we picked two
different directions or we have
different directions yeah and it's
absolutely true and the thing is even
back in the day when this was just a
hobby for you we still had pretty
different approaches in pretty different
directions to things like going back and
watch some of the old the older reviews
yeah I did like you know just sit in
your studio back at your house I was I
was watching him with my wife about a
week ago and I'd brought up the keyboard
run you remember the keyboard the
mechanical keyboard review that we did
the first time I came down and saw you
oh yeah yeah well we like we like
tag-team that one yeah we tag-teamed it
but it was interesting because we were
both you could tell that you were
bringing your regular stuff to it I was
just bringing my regular stick and it
was kind of this fusion of two
completely different angles right
unstuff we both had comedy is one of our
angles but your application of it was
completely different than mine like we
we had a lot of differences in how we
did our videos well remember when you
got the tightness yep I mean your
tighten the yours and Adams approach to
doing that tighten video was obviously
well hey different than ours but also to
a shower I mean and fast forward now
Here I am cool and computers with beer
it's a lot of people remind me every day
that it's like oh hey if I had to made
the same decisions you know and I had it
done
you know the sponsorships and got studio
and hired the people I would have been
successful like you but the truth is I
wouldn't have been guys because that's
not what makes you successful it's like
it's Jay's alignment and ability to
execute on that that's just not how I am
I think the only thing that really kind
of irks me is is the con
of some of the viewers that feel
unfortunately this is a very small
minority so guys don't guys don't think
I'm applying this to the whole the whole
fan base I'm not this is a very very
small fraction of a percent of people
that feel that we owe them something
because the viewers allow us to have
this life and I think that that's a
 statement because I agree
first of all yes the the viewers the
each individual viewer obviously has an
individual opinion but those opinions
mix together into a 1.3 million
subscribers create one giant flavor of
feedback right so as each individual
little flavor but then there's like the
overall flavor and that's the one we
have to listen to not the individual guy
saying this and that and this and that
because that one guy can get pissed and
and get on his little soapbox and tell
all of his friends Jay is an asshole
don't follow him and they might they
might as a collective like go off but
they don't affect anything in the grand
scheme of things if the only thing that
turned them off was a difference of
opinion or a difference of style that's
never gonna hurt me in the long run
unless I go out there and make some
really stupid decision like really
stupid right yeah you it's happened on
YouTube before people the Logan Paul for
example he's not into the woods and
start Lee taking pictures of dead bodies
hanging from trees yeah you you've gone
a wrong direction but his channel is big
enough to where that didn't hurt I'm in
fact he ended up growing off of that but
yeah but of my channel the size and I'm
at that could that could tank the
channel because they've digitized so
that's an example but the point I'm
trying to get out here is which came
first the viewer or the channel or the
video so that's obvious and you keep and
you can't have a video without a viewer
which is how we all started every single
one of us started with zero views zero
subscribers every now a single channel
started with a number other than zero
and we work and we work and we work to
try and make decisions and to make a
video and my mindset has always been
what would I watch right to make a video
that make people want to come back and
keep viewing so if we put in tens of
tens of thousands of hours into this as
a hobby and then more so
as a career to make people want to come
back and keep watching our videos do we
owe them do they owe us or the way I see
it it's level playing ground I don't owe
you you don't owe me that's the way I
look at this so the mindset of Jay you
have that studio because we we allow you
to have it as viewers it's complete and
utter that's why when anyone in
anytime someone tells me that my answer
is the same it doesn't matter if it's
one five or 10,000 people that say this
to me at the same time if you feel that
I owe you all of this be in you taking
all of the work and effort and decisions
and choices and the risks that I made to
build this channel then you can unsub
and it won't bother me even if the
numbers went red it won't bother me
because at the end of the day the only
people I'm left with are the people who
believe in decisions I'm making so
that's why I've never been afraid to
speak my opinion so I've never been
afraid to stand up for the my points of
views whether they're popular or
unpopular well you know I spout my point
of view like no matter what and it's
it's burned me
tons of times one of those things where
it's like I don't want to build an
audience of people that don't like me
for who I am so so what I owe the
audience is to be honest true and just
as real as I can be and that's what I
try and do sure we take sponsorships one
thing we don't sponsor is our reviews No
you'll never find a review on this
channel that has been paid for we do not
take money in exchange for a review if
they want to put an ad into a video or
something that's fine but we will never
take money for a review because then the
review is invalid it's it's it's diluted
by the fact that money was on the table
so we can't we can't sell our opinion
it's not something that I do or will
ever do but we are obviously in a
business here to grow I now have other
households and mouths to feed that
matter on the success of this channel
and that's not gonna change but
fortunately the decisions I made with
the with my my scruples got me to this
point to where I don't worry about the
future as much as I used to simply
because I just am like okay as long as I
keep making these micro adjustments and
heading then I think we're going in the
right direction as a whole it's just
it sounds so cliche but honestly the
success is not measured by what we did
to get here the success is measured by
the changes
we made the things that we failed at and
that's that's literally how I run this
thing yeah it's cliche it's cliche as
hell but it's true there's a lot of
people that like to look at what we do
is is different than going to a day job
and we vote that Nate jobs right we're
both you know both an IT - yeah both
have two previous jobs in IT if you
apply that logic that like somehow you
know somebody owes you something because
you produce content that they didn't
even have to pay for that was freeform
or anything apply that to your daily job
like I always got this when people say
that it's not a real job yeah or you
know it's not a real trap it's like
apply to your real job when I worked at
Microsoft I mean I could apply that same
logic and say well if everybody thought
that same way and everybody left
Microsoft Microsoft wouldn't have a
company what a matter is I benefited
from working in Microsoft I they they
paid me I got to learn things I you know
it was it was a mutually beneficial
thing because you'd be stupid to get
into something that wasn't mutually
beneficial and it's no different in this
business absolutely what I kind of feel
is that people look at oh you just make
videos that's not a real job as much as
I used to you though I used to get that
a lot well but now it's now you just
just drink coffee in front of a camera
it's not a real job so what what's a job
it's a thing you do to create income yes
is a telemarketer have more of a job
than us or do we have a look you think
we're like purposefully generate income
it really comes down to quite honestly
people don't think a lot of work goes
into this they think it's just a lot of
money that shows up at the end of the
day for us just getting in front of the
camera and waving our arms yeah there
there are unfortunately youtubers that
do command a huge income for doing just
that but I don't look at I don't look at
the the Logan Paul's or the Tanner foxes
or the pootie pies as them having less
of a job than me even when I worked in
IT but I think that we're a rare breed
to be able to just be so concerned with
our own little bubble that we're not
sitting there projecting and judging
everyone around us you know with 2018 is
this the year of the it really is
I'm 2017 showed that the 2018 is not
gonna be any different and the the hard
worker and the guy who puts his head
down and puts meat on his table and and
is only concerned with you
what he brings society that generations
gone we're the last of the mohicans man
yeah like I was actually laughing when
you did your video on cryptocurrency and
so many people took you seriously when
you said hey just go ask Jerry all your
questions I'm out like I have so many of
my followers just go to war against each
other on different sides of that topic
and I had some of them message me and
just say you know I unfollowed
you because I thought you were smarter
than this bla bla bla bla bla I'm like
I'm not worried the biggest mistake the
biggest mistake I made in that video was
this a very specific sentence I meant to
say but it never I never actually said
it I forgot to the guy in your point
this was to your point to the guy that's
out there and has a half dozen graphics
cards or whatever just sitting around
sure minam I problem is the guys buying
five hundred at a time yeah that's my
mom they're able to get five hundred at
a time well if you're a manufacturer and
you can guarantee five hundred without
the middlemen aren't you gonna sell just
like that yesterday and I've made that
argument publicly on Twitter too it's
like even though I look at the company
and say if I'm gonna squarely place
blame I'm gonna say if companies are for
gaming let's say you create a product
you say what did it specifically for
gaming and you want to defend that is
for gaming but my point is that's never
been the case and video might market it
as a gaming card but they are all too
complacent so is AMD in any other
company you want to sell all your stock
that's your goal yeah and I don't think
they're hurt they think that they're
hurt in the future either because all
this is gonna do is accelerate
technology that's the other thing people
get pretty they kind of they overlook
yeah when they look at cryptocurrency
it's like cryptocurrency is like pushing
the speed of GPUs way past where they
would be if it never existed today like
schedules are getting moved up faster
things are coming out now they're
thinking about making crypto like we
were talking about a little bit was that
before the show we were talking about
the crypto specific cards was that on
the show well I talked about on the show
that turns in video turning right right
the touring-car ring at room which makes
sense because ultimately if in I'll play
devil's advocate to myself because it's
good to have different opinions on
things and it's good to have a lot of
different information if it's in a
respectful way the problem is Internet
often doesn't know how to show show
opinion without respect or with respect
so if you have a card that's designed
for gaming and of course all the
miners are buying it well then you don't
have enough them in the hands of the
gamers so now the games are starting to
suffer the bugs aren't getting fixed the
games aren't getting optimized better
games aren't coming out because those
cards aren't in saturation in the market
to utilize those features I understand
all that from a software developer
perspective so but the right move is
happening and that is you need to have
the card manufacturers creating a morsel
that's more tasty for the crypto miners
that they can sell for around the same
price that the gamers can't buy even
though it's the faster card they can't
buy it because it's just for crypto and
then the crypto guys lose interest
entirely in the lesser cards yeah you
that has to happen but again they have
to be able to manufacture them in pretty
high quantities if they come out with a
crypto card and they start making like
10 of them a day we're back to square
one I mean they really need to start
rifling these things out in crazy
 numbers if Krista if the
dibadeaux
if cryptocurrencies if Chris docker if
Christo is like the butters if crypto is
here to stay then there's no reason why
they couldn't do that and take time to
ramp up and make production but I want
to answer a question but by somebody
else Jay are you hiring interns we don't
and probably will never hire interns
around here
the reason for that is one we do a lot
of NDA stuff early access sometimes
things that never even make it to public
yeah I'm not going to be bringing people
in here and out of here all the time
whether they be college interns or
whatever does that's a tricky thing to
manage - really tricky yeah there's a
there's a high level of access here
there's a huge level of trust just
having a person in here with the amount
of equipment we have the money we have
in hardware yeah
interns are not something I'm interested
in and we'll probably never hire or hire
whatever work experience it's all the
same so the amount of vetting we're
going through just for the person we're
hiring now is is insane
tell me this do you guys have some good
candidates already or yeah yeah so
really well okay so I put out I was
actually on a weekend away with my wife
when I put up that job listing I was
supposed to put it up earlier in the day
I forgot
cuz Bryan Bryan did the the pose but he
did all of the the job stuff right
Bryan's hand only all that not me and so
it's awesome by the way we love Bryan
Bryan is an unsung hero
yeah he literally talked to me when I
was having a rough time for a couple of
hours I don't know if he told you about
that or not but yeah it's hugely hugely
helpful ya know he told me so oh yeah so
I'm on this I'm on this date and we've
gone to see Gabriel Iglesias and at La
Staples Center and then my wife and I
were at the bar in the hotel downstairs
just chilling in the outside patio thing
and I was like crap I forgot to post
this so that's when I put up the tweet
so we went to bed I woke up the next
morning and I'm looking at the responses
and there was no I don't have me emails
but I was looking at the responses and I
was just like oh god I look at all these
people that one there they're trying to
be funny and they're failing and two
it's just like not a single serious
response like a lot of people who were
no offense if you're watching this and
you're in the chat but if you were one
of those people have told me they were
like I really like computers and stuff
and I don't know how to use a camera but
I can learn no we're not hiring training
honestly you had to expect that though
you you you had them in the bathroom I
understand I understand the whole like
I'm gonna put myself out there but you
had to know you weren't gonna get picked
up to be fair I almost did it
I um I I swear to God I almost went and
took my old LinkedIn profile that hasn't
been updated since I was gonna just send
you a link to it and then asked if I
qualified but I resisted but a lot of
those people right yeah or or a lot of
really qualified people that don't even
live in the country I'm not going
through the hassle of hiring
international okay that's insane that's
hard for a big company to do a little
insane so anyway I was gonna kind of
discourage I was like Jesus I was like
well maybe tapping into my audience was
the wrong place to try and find a person
that would match our needs around here
and then I texted Brian the the next day
I was like dude did we did anybody apply
he's like oh my god he's like my inbox
like exploded and I asked him was like
did we get anyone that's good and he was
like dude you got a C so he started
sending me
he started forward in to me resumes and
and the work experience and the the
samples the serious people who applied
applied along with sample work right
obviously we need sample work with this
that's good and we narrowed it down to
our top six and the the bottom line was
I started thinking about it I'm like you
know what as a profession
you're gonna do what the ad listing said
you're gonna contact the person in there
when it says email Brian send your
resume and job history and all that -
you're not gonna go up on Twitter and
start being like I emailed you
hey I applied hey no you're gonna do
what the listing says and you're gonna
let your resumes do your talking and
that's exactly what happened so I
completely underestimated the
professionalism of those people that
were qualified because they did exactly
what this thing said have you actually
conducted an interview yet are you okay
we've we thought up six candidates okay
so did you watch the post Malone
interview the part - I have not watched
part two you know okay that was actually
filmed by one of the people applying a
whole badass you actually got them in
there - yeah there they're doing demo
work we've scheduling them to come in
here and do demos of their work in our
environments you're a really good idea
yeah and then they're all they're all
locals and everything like basically if
you hired them they'd be able to hit all
the hours and everything and that or
they'd have to already be relocating out
here because we're not relocating
someone gotcha gotcha how many how many
people are you hiring again just one or
just one but possibly two okay and it's
basically gonna be for video on cam it's
for post it's for post-production
production and post-production that's
cool yeah that's cool
I just gotta learn how to use my
that's my biggest problem you know I
just went bought a brand new camera
that's even like Fisher price level
Jerry so that one that you were asking
me about settings and stuff yeah
somewhere yeah it's another one that's
just a little bit bigger than this guy
right here the ax fifty three but uh
yeah I finally got to figured out it
just it just took me a while but I can
see what you mean when you talk to me
about shooting everything in manual you
like to control everything right people
don't realize how difficult that
is like like it's you look at the camera
it's like you turn it to green square or
you're taking a video with your cell
phone I don't think you realize just how
much is going on in there as far as
software to try to figure out what it
thinks is the best thing yeah you know
it's like when I because I was
on my camera it's like trying to decide
between shutter speed and what's other
one a habit yeah yeah so when you're
trying to find the balance in there for
what you want to get you want to get
like crisper motion do you want to get
softer motion do you want to get more
light
yeah but you under but you understand
this union but you just have to
understand the settings and it's just
math at that point you know for instance
I don't do the math I just with it
until I get what I want when I mean it's
the math of it no it's it's shudders see
for video it's not only shutter speeds
also framerate so there's there's your
framerate you're right you're you're
whether you're shooting in 20 29.97 or
you're shooting 60 or you know NTSC or
PAL obviously in the US were NTSC so
that's that's 30 fps
all right 29.97 so for 29.97 you want to
try to speed set to 60 which is double
that and then at that point you're going
to then set your aperture so if your
aperture is let's say I say f4 right
okay and you go down to F 2.2 you're
obviously letting in almost half as much
light so it's just knowing like okay if
I go down to F 1.8 and I go up to F 1
4.0 we're dealing with almost twice as
much light so then it's like how do we
how do we bring that light level down
well either you have to deal with like
nd filters or then you've got to deal
with increasing your frame rate or your
shutter speed to a point to where you
you find that middle ground torn out
you're not getting that flickery strobe
light look you know I never understood
the ND filter stuff until I actually had
a camera with it built-in because I got
the three ND filters built into them we
have a we have a visit we have a we
actually have physical nd filters on for
lenses as well as the ones built into
our FS 5 and FS 7 mark 2 and then we
also have circular polarizers that we
use for when we're shooting glass you
guys have to be using just thought wife
senior setup use a fuckload of light I
mean the fact is I'm using a nd filters
indoor your basically create we're not
using ND filter indoors but not outdoors
okay there's an ad we shot with fractal
out in the desert and we did it during
low light and the shooting into the Sun
and all that it's very cinematic I can
show to you most applying what you would
use the nd filters for in the first time
I went out I realized that that's how
you get that depth of field effect it's
impossible to get it without an ND
filter out exactly because if you're
opening up the aperture and you're going
down we're going to lower the aperture
number the more light you're letting in
it and the more depth of field and
Bluenose dropping it down all the way
and it was just literally blown out
white like crying well in a snowstorm
because you're opening up the iris which
means you're letting in all that light
in the sense
getting you know oversaturated or over
oh it was too much light so that's why
the nd filters in theirs who bring down
the light like the ND filters built into
the FS v and FS 7 mark to go from one
quarter all the way up to one 128 so we
can let in one 128 of the light yeah so
obviously a 1/4 means we're it's a it's
a quarter stop right or a quarter of the
light and it just goes from there so
yeah I mean this is all I've never taken
a simple a single classroom this is all
self-taught stuff but the point is to
bring the team to the next level is we I
need somebody who is an expert in this
somebody who this is this is their craft
and and they're not self-taught there or
if they are self-taught but they're an
expert and that's exactly what been
getting some of the people we've been
hiring or looking at or absolutely in
seed I mean it's got to be nice to be
able to have somebody that you can get
enough trust and faith and after they
show you what they can do that you
pretty much just go sit down in front of
the camera and expect them to do the
right thing well like anything else
there's gonna be some time for them to
learn this our style cuz right we're not
I'm not looking to we're not looking to
overnight like change the look and feel
of our videos not buying it by a stretch
I'm looking for more manpower more
manpower to get more things done in the
same amount of time efficiency you know
if I've got somebody that's capable of
editing while we're shooting you know
another video or another part of the
video whatever and we're leapfrogging
our manpower then we get more done in
the same amount of time yes what limits
my my limiting factor here isn't capital
doesn't take a lot of capital to run
this channel it's time time and manpower
is insane I'm curious to see if people
like progressively once you once you
hire somebody on I wonder if they're
gonna like progressively start to notice
any kind of a style change or if the
person is you because you already had a
pretty well one of the interview
questions pop back to follow one like
you look at your stuff with like the B
Road the close-up b-roll and stuff that
you do on the cases with really
beautiful saturation and lighting and
stuff it's like a lot of that looks like
it could go to TV straight to teaming
one of what we shoot in and we basically
shoot in broadcasting format stuff too
anyway so it would translate to TV but
one of the questions we've asked is what
we
change on the channel in our interviews
and and all of them had good suggestions
things that I've even been thinking to
myself were lacking in this area they
picked up on it and we're like this is
what I would change and that to me is
that to me is a sign like okay good we
were we've already got there's already
there's already a vibe happening here
you know what I mean
because I wasn't a layer media just
jumped on the chat you see they said
remote that post production up here to
Seattle Jay I can't afford dran when you
down that cheap man I've ever worked
with we're selling this dream man we're
selling the youtubes I tell everybody
grams cheap cuz he always comes over it
helps me shoot like all the time
for like nothing just to hang out he's
actually actually actually have some
projects I want a higher grand for
though flam down here and have him work
with us there's a couple I just having a
chance to talk to him yeah
he's good at what he does and and I have
to admit I love that Viper video Oh God
oh Jesus beautiful video you've ever had
on your channel I like doesn't yeah I
feel like your video the funny thing is
when you flip between you can tell when
you're switching between my camera and
the red camera yeah like oh just it was
all shot at high frame rate like 240 and
we just sped it up where we needed to to
get real-time yeah but I
I started to understand it at that point
because a lot of people like like think
that you know red is overpriced I
honestly think it is but but just the
style in the way that it shoots other
than the menu system being absolutely
 garbage and it takes two minutes
to turn on yeah it's it's got a lot of
problems but when I saw that video it's
like I understood in that moment like I
understand why people spend all this
money and put it well pain so when I was
when I was at the Brooklyn nine-nine set
for a day with Terry Crews I I didn't
care about the actors I told Terry I was
like look I'm not gonna bother the
actors I don't care he wasn't concerned
we we basically were there with a with a
full access it wasn't like okay stay
over here in the little observers area
no we were full access I was walking
right up into the set all right we'll
sit in there with the directors looking
at the directors monitors you know we
were we were just part of the crew
basically for a whole like 13 hours it
was a coolest experience every didn't
pick up like a Samberg hair and stick it
in your pocket or anything in a wrap he
was around for like five minutes
but anyway so is it if anyone here is a
9:9 fan and okay how caught up on the
show are you I've watched every episode
okay you know the episode where they're
trying to catch the gambler in the
gambling ring and they take him hostage
in the limo
yep that's the episode we watched in
film that's awesome so we were watching
them film all that and the coolest thing
was the way they had that limo set up it
was indoors we'll have lights everything
on they just had black curtains around
it and LED strips above the limo to make
it reflect down the side of the car so
it was Island like a timer so the LEDs
would just like go down the left side
right side left side right side to look
like lights going down the car so that
was a practical effect you wouldn't yeah
it's cool this is not CGI like with a
green screen no it was an actual real
reflection with with like re sky panels
and LEDs and stuff so that's cool but
anyway I spent I told Terry I was like
look I don't care about the actors Adam
cool Andre he's huge dope I like Andre
that's the old guy the captain look but
I'm not gonna even talk to them all I
want to talk to is the production crew I
want to I want to watch the camera
people i want to watch the grips I wanna
watch the lighting guys I don't want to
see what they are doing well that's all
I care about
so he was like okay guys I go up there
and start chatting with him and stuff so
I was just watching them and they have
babies ari I camera which are they use
but they use Ari which is not cheap by
any means obviously no I saw him in NAB
they're actually like more expensive
than red aren't they in some regards in
some regards yes yeah so but Ari's also
much bigger company the red Reds run by
like a company of like 20 people you
know as a small company but anyway they
they never shut the cameras off they
just they just have these massive
v-mount battery setups and they and then
the cameras is on all day because of the
time it takes for it to turn off and
turn on and the profiles they have set
up and everything's matched they just
once it's on it's on and then when they
set it on their tripod it's just on the
camera is always going guess yeah that's
cool
yeah but they also have massive I don't
know what kind of batteries they're
another V mount but they're massive like
might be mount batteries 190 watt hours
and it's it's pretty good size there's
were like five times bigger than mine
you know are these on camera batteries
or they wiring them in remotely their RV
mount so literally snapped right on the
back of the camera well if they're not I
think these were attached to a rail mine
mines on the back of the fs7 it's
it's a backpack and so it mounts to the
fs7 and then it has an adapter cable
that goes from DTaP into the cameras AC
power so the camera thinks it's on AC oh
but it also powers it also powers my
Shogun my Atomos and Shogun inferno so
it's one battery that powers the entire
rig because I've seen a lot of the the
cameras when they put them on the gimbal
mounts and stuff like it NAB they always
have a remote power source because they
don't want to put that extra weight on
the on the camera itself yeah I know
mine's directly mounted to the camera
but the camera is designed with the V
mount backpack in mind so it threads how
much energy your even your FS well your
FS v was actually pretty efficient is
the ff7 is efficient or does it thing
chug electricity it's all about the same
but the biggest thing with the v-mail
was the fact that I can power everything
on it with one battery that's not like
any batteries on the recorder you need
batteries on the monitor and you need
batteries on the camera you know or the
you know cuz EF here we are now in
camera talk guys okay so it's both
passionate about for very different
reasons yeah so when you're running
multiple mics we run two mics on our
cameras so we have the boom mic and then
we have a shotgun like scratch scratch
audio right on the camera and so both of
those are 48 volt phantom power and then
you've got the camera when it's
recording you know eats up when it's
when it's recording and then you've got
obviously the LCD panel and all that
takes power then you've got either an
external monitor in our case we use
Shogun 2 Shogun and ferno's actually as
monitors rather than recorders those eat
power so it's like instead of having
batteries for all this crap and things
but to worry about plugging at the end
of the day we have one battery that
powers the whole the whole rig and it's
on a and it's on a pedestal so it's like
a big like dolly that we roll around the
studio now with the fs7 on it I would
like something small like more compact
that I can actually mount on tripod with
the camera that's what I was similar to
that because I've got yep that's five
that's five no but that's one thing I
don't like I know you don't like that
you're not a huge fan of the Sennheiser
MKE 440 compared to some of your other
more expensive stuff
but I love that mic like it even sounds
better than my ng might be only thing I
don't like about it is the fact that
it's 3.5 millimeter exactly that's my
problem with it too and I'm like is
there anything I can do about that if I
adapt it and into XLR would that do me
any good
as far as no because it says it's its
own it's its own source Collins we
is what do we use I can remember and
you're probably not gonna like this
anyway can suck $1,000 for this
microphone but Sony cuz your mic sounds
good I mean you're out of all the
channels that I've watched your audio
when you nail it not like on the last
video where you totally it up
your audio is actually so good it sounds
like like me on my mic right here so
real quick that our last video the the
pub Jiwon I got messed up yeah so
something suddenly nearby is interfering
so today we fixed it by changing
channels we just nicked it and catch it
even though he had headphones on he
didn't catch it so whatever so I on the
another thing you could use that would
work with your Sony because it's it this
goes through hotshoe it's the Sony XLR
k1 mk1 mk1 em so basically it's a it's a
de dual XLR with its own preamp and it
has a shotgun on it and you can plug
another shotgun into it if you want but
it's $700 but it runs on the hot shoe so
the camera communicates with it and
basically tells the camera as a internal
mic communicate with the external mic
and let that run the audio that's how we
that's how we run our a7s2
oh wow so it's not cheap but it's seven
hundred bucks I mean that's not terrible
terrible and that comes with the shotgun
and yeah in the interface in a second my
camera has that exact same setup just
not with the hot shoe thing my pee pxw
has the exact same thing mounted on the
camera already if it's built into it
then yeah I mean it's identical it's the
same damn thing here give me second
hey panhead deal with that deal with it
deal with it deal with it deal with it
deal with it deal with it deal with it I
like that yeah check this out so exactly
I just said see you're not really doing
yourself any favors by having that and
then running this entire on it that's
that's really redundant and silly it is
and the thing is dole reason I do it is
because when I tried hooking the rode
ntg-2 my ntg-2 sucks it does so I just
need to get a better a better my how
much okay do you have a budget would you
spend money right now
I could spent I could spend my I could
spend money right now if I had what's
your budget I can price send about like
I wouldn't for a Mike I probably won't
spend any more like eight hundred no you
don't need to spend that dude Audio
Technica 40:53 be all day every day I
love that Mike I love that Mike more
than my Sennheiser MKH for 16 which is
$1,000 shotgun mic so it's a foot weight
40:53 give that to me again
4:05 3b I'm gonna buy more of these mics
I have the Audio Technica and they're
super short ya know is that the one that
you run on your little boom that I've
seen when I'm in your that's the one
that's been on the boom my 416 is on
there now but we run that on camera for
the FS 5 now no no I'm sorry that's on
camera for the a7s2 ok yeah no I found
it ok so it's about 600 bucks on Amazon
I absolutely love that microphone yeah I
love the way that Mike says it does it
does it have to be I know the ideally
you want to get it as close as humanly
possible but does it have a decent
pickup at a distance of about 6 feet yes
and it's a hyper-cardioid so it has even
more off access rejection so the reason
why I bought that was because when I was
still doing the home bedroom set up yeah
that was the only mic I was able to
actually use in that little bedroom
you've been to the house that didn't
pick up all the reverb off the walls oh
my gosh cuz the echo is something that
I'm still dealing with today that's the
number one comment you'll see in all my
videos no matter how much I massage the
audio and audition you need to you need
to just do a video and this will help
your live streams too you need to do a
video where you just have me come up
there and literally sound engineer that
room with foam in the right places
because you've heard my audio in the old
setup and that's what I had to do I'd
love to have you back up here again but
you're so goddamn busy like I don't I
don't know I'll tell you the same thing
I tell everyone else I'm busy until you
tell me you want to do something and you
pick a day and it goes on the calendar
and then suddenly I'm not too busy
because it's on the calendar all right
well I'm gonna thank you because I do
need to get you up here to do that cuz
sound is my my number-one nemesis in
this room lighting as a close second is
more important than not then than video
no I agree I completely agree with that
the other thing too is I was fighting
noise when I was shooting 4k on the new
camera I notice that it had more noise
than my other cameras like these yeah
these guys and it's because the internal
processing on these like takes away the
sharpness and you lose a lot of that
noise so I've been working on
post-processing the video to get a
better
result and I've tried some of the noise
what do you use for noise reduction or
do you use active noise reduction at all
straight off camera well if it's
straight off the camera I don't have to
do noise reduction because the FS 5 &amp;amp; 7
especially the seven have a really good
built-in noise reduction but if we come
off the Atomos cuz it's raw then yeah
it's super noisy yeah I mean something
like neat video is needed also
internally to the camera has like its
own noise reduction settings both the FS
5 and the FS 7 have built-in noise
reduction could you tell me what those
settings are called like Auto Street
noise reduction it's because they call
this they referred to this when it came
out this is called the baby FS 5 cuz
it's it's literally got 90% of the
features yeah but they also called the
FS 5 the baby FS 7 and they share
nothing in common that's true
well the FS 7 was the mark 1 versus the
mark 2 or just any of any of them
they're the same sensor and processor in
it oh they are the 7 mark 2 is just a
few small changes PL mount it's a Sony
PL mount and has a variable nd and
little things yeah I did notice though
that it I ran one of the shotgun mic
that shitty shotgun mic off the amp
internally and I loved it when I put it
on auto I could scream bloody murder at
it and it wouldn't clip so unlike my
other two cameras it does do that proper
compressor is really good on that it is
really I could talk cameras all day
because I mean that's that's what keeps
me excited about making these videos is
the gear cuz I always dreamt about
having this kind of gear and now we have
it so I even kind of find it surreal
just like looking at you from a distance
from where you were in your tiny little
room that was maybe half the size of
mine here yeah
like shooting your videos with your
little DSLR like what was it a ok who
 it was it was it was like consumer
green it was a t2i that did that only
did 720p and I can only see about 4 or 5
minutes of video at a time before give
me a little warning indicator for
temperature and then one day it stopped
turning on so that I had to scramble
down to Sammy's camera and I bought a
70d a Canon 70d which I used up until I
bought the FS 5 year before last in your
video quality even what that was like
absolutely amazing yeah it was good but
now that I go back and look at it right
compared to now with God sure it's just
funny how there's there's that
progression of like wow this looks
really good and then it's like oh you
look back you're like oh my god how did
that ever think this looked good but I
mean in many ways I with the other
direction cuz like back when I started
like let's go back what two years to
three years when you were shooting I was
shooting on a Canon 5d Mark 3 man my
second camera was a mark 2 which at the
time were like the best sensor you could
frickin get the wife just texted me and
said we should do spring break in
Seattle cuz the little one has spring
break at the end of March do it get up
here man get up here what's going on
though I have to have that conversation
with her cuz there's so much going on so
I'm taking my mom on a trip to Vegas
just to get her out in a way we've got
things go I've got track day in March I
want to get you down here for the track
day actually I do want to come down for
the track day so if you don't come down
this March for track day your next
opportunity probably won't be till
November what what date what day is it
in March I don't remember
18th I think it is that it's a Sunday I
think it will yeah I'm not gonna be able
do it cuz I'm gonna be over at a Midwest
RepRap festival and the East Coast what
is that
it's 3d printer nerds jeez
already but I've already got all my
plane tickets and everything so that's
something I'm committed to well well you
know I could always uh we can always
start pushing the buttons at old dirt
fish and get a get around to going yeah
I've been telling you I want you yeah
I'm just I'm just trying to get in a
little bit better shape before I bark up
that tree because right now honestly I
don't think I'd fit in their car
honestly anyone asking me how I feel
about any other cameras than what I own
I have no opinion because I only know
about what I own like somebody who's
asked me how I feel about the canon DX 1
or 1 DX ID I have no idea I have not
used it and haven't looked at it don't
care about it I don't form opinions on
things I don't use so I can't answer
that all I know is can and fell way
behind Sony for the longest time on all
all sorts of things but I know Sony is
or Canon has made a big push over the
last 18 months to catch up Sony is in my
opinion is the clear winner for the
consumer-grade cinema camera because I
feel like you're gonna go from Sony and
then you're gonna have to jump all the
way up to like red to get to the next
level like our sony fs7 mark ii and the
way it's out rigged arrows fitted with
our
and the firm wears on it and the the
lenses and stuff that's a that's a
$20,000 rig but that's cheaper than this
just an empty body with no attachments
for a read and look at what we're
getting out of it so it's one of those
things where it's like justifiably I
think the if you're if you're looking
for something that is like
professional-grade but is still
considered a budget and yes I just
called a twenty thousand dollar camera
budget because go look at cinema cameras
you can spend a hundred thousand dollars
on a lens for a ray so this everything
is relative and it's all relative so me
I sweat I actually went backwards
because I was shooting on DSLR is that
the body's alone or 3500 bucks back in
the day and now I'm shooting on sony
handycams and I mean this this one is my
first venture back into I think this
camera was right around 3000 it was like
2028 99 or something it came out just
about one of the price of fs5 buddy yeah
so and it's everything it's the lens I
mean it's fully ready to shoot out of
the box but the reason I went that route
is not necessarily just for quality
which does a good job but the reason I
went with it was just because I'm more
of an ease of use kind of guy whereas
you're more of a professional guy like
if you asked us what equipment we we'd
pick either one of us both creating
YouTube videos it would be wildly
different yeah there might be some
things that are similar but like you you
like that art you like to have artistic
control over everything whereas even
though I like artistic control to a
certain degree I have to be able to
one-man-band it and you got to admit
your would be really hard to
one-man-band at the way that you have it
right now yeah and I could but there
would be a see what we have now when
Nick came on board it added movement to
our videos more movement than I could
have by myself cuz the only ways that
camera could move if it was me is one if
I wasn't on camera if I'm moving the
camera or two it was on a slider which
is just a weird sliding shot if you're
talking that's that's it can be done but
it's not optimal a cameraman allows
there be more movement so that's why we
have more vlog II stuff because it's
vlog ish but still professional-looking
yeah and there's love in our build video
it's like you have a human presence
right you have somebody going back and
forth and everything it's like the
viewer is is traveling back and forth
and observing it from like a human
perspective yeah you don't get that from
a tripod right so sometimes I do it
like I do shoot some of my stuff like
with you know when I have a friend help
me out like you know on the drone shoots
if you guys have ever watched any of my
drone reviews I did up at dirtfish they
were all with the camera laughing Nick
because we have these hand me the paper
towels I said hey I'm not throw there's
open beer cans over here dumbass so we
we that's great sis J that's race it's
races against asses not dumb people jeez
anyway so we have these paper towels and
you guys know the pain and when you go
to tear off a paper towel like at the
bottom oh that won't she turn off
straight like the bottom part always
just like now they're all tearing off
straight wood anyway you go - but do you
- tear them off it goes like halfway
down the perforated line and then just
rips you only get that from cheap paper
towels J you need to up your budget Nick
bottom anyway oh I need to get out of
here 640 I gotta drive home still oh
 we've been going for a while I'm
like you know if you guys want me to do
another more behind the scenes type
video maybe I will I I stopped doing
them because they were our least viewed
videos and the way I look at it is it
people go just just take it or upload it
on your second Channel I'm if I'm gonna
take the time to make a video it's got
to have return for me because I have to
work I have in New York I have such
little time to then make a video that's
gonna go up on some other channel and
then I still have to make another video
for the main channel it's not worth it
to me
and then to put it up on the main
channel if it's only gonna get half of
use a normal video would then that hurts
all sorts of things on the back end that
I don't want to get into but it's it's
one of those things where there has to
be returned a video a video has the sort
of guarantee as a certain amount of
views or higher for it to be worth you
know sponsorships and all sorts of other
things so that's why we try and pick
entertaining content like putting Bud
Light down the into a water-cooled PC
it's entertaining but it's gonna get
probably get a lot of views because
people getting salty and mad about it
but we clean the system out at least the
system's completely cleaned out and it's
running right now so can you clean it
out after that though like honestly we
did oh my god I have a very interesting
method for doing it but we did it we're
all gonna see the video tomorrow guys
goes live tomorrow we're gonna see Jay
do some some ridiculous with water
cooling
that's Jay's dick and I
kept drinking beer in between like when
we were doing things so I progressively
got a little bit more slurry and stuff
as the video went on so we're gonna see
a drunk no not drunk just just that's
loosened up J
Jason asked if I still have that knife
of course I still have this rusty piece
of under my dad's trying to give me
tetanus every day you kidding me never
get that knife ever it's even held under
there with neodymium magnets to finish
my thought about behind the scenes
though it's really boring like when
we're not making videos I'm up here
writing emails I'm doing invoices or
insertion order so I'm having meetings
with Brian about potential sponsors or
pitches and video ideas and it's just
not stuff we can make a video about we
can't do you think more manpower will
free that up a little bit though um like
hypothetically down the road Lucy you
got a good editor you got a good video
guy I mean could you have them
hypothetically be like oh go grab some
of the b-roll the behind the scene what
just you happen to have it yes
leapfrogging as if method we're planning
on using here and what we're hoping and
again this is Brian Brian's doing this
not me I'm I'm following you guys you
guys yes I've heard me say Brian a lot
you don't really know who he is
because I he hasn't been like super
formally introduced he is the guy
practically running the business side of
things around here now and he's so nice
you'd never understand how him and Jake
could ever that's exactly why we get
along to my wing or something like that
but it was absolute opposite so he runs
a lot of the back end around here now
and basically we've had meetings and
meetings and meetings and basically what
we've determined is we are we are in a
mission to free up 2 to 3 hours a day of
my time we are trying to get me back 2
to 3 hours a day and that's what we're
hoping and this this next person is
going to be able to provide yeah because
it is it is I mean I just just speaking
from my own personal perspective when
you start losing that the drive to want
to just create something because you're
so encumbered with other yeah
it hurts man yeah I mean mine was all
like financial and up IRS stuff
and everything like that I won't go down
the list but but when you were
constantly distracted by other things
about the business you kind of lose some
of what you had creating the content
that made the business I don't know if
that's particularly a problem for you
but it was absolutely a big problem for
me so I'm trying to do the same thing
where I just clear just get things
out of the way get my no
so I can just focus on just making
videos that's what I enjoyed doing in
the beginning that's what I want to keep
doing the wife just texted me and said
Brian is the J whisperer or the other
half of my brain no Brian Braun to
introduce more people to Bret Brian's
shy he's sort of skittish he's seen the
cut look I don't even read my own
YouTube comments anymore cuz Brian does
it for me and it sounds crazy right
Brian and I know we need to end this
because it's time to go but I know he's
not watching right now because his his
wife its birthday so they're out doing
their own thing so I can embarrass him
without without him seeing so though
he's shy but he's really nerded out over
the numbers he's he's a he's a
sociologist he's he's into sociology so
that a sociologist makes a better brand
manager than anyone with a marketing
degree because marketers are
bullshitters and sociologists understand
people and that's what you need and
Brian he understands people and so he he
as a sociologist has has really dived in
headfirst and Twitter and YouTube and
all of that not as a user but as a as a
as a you know cat whoa I just dragged
your camera all crazy sorry guys me fix
this whoa what did I do
did you know when you resized the window
it resizes it inside OBS too but you
know um okay so he just try it was
trying to make heads or tails of the
pattern she's looking for patterns
pattern pattern pattern pattern and I
keep telling him Brian there's no
pattern there's no pattern
he's like everything has a
pattern you know everything in life has
patterns I'm like he's like you got
there to kill a guy there's a pattern
you're gonna get arrest you're gonna
okay fine yes you're speaking very
literal but I said when it comes to
YouTube and Twitter and all that it's
you could be doing the same thing in one
week you're up twenty thousand subs
versus the week prior doing the same
thing you can't explain what happened
that week you know he's like look you
know social trends world translate okay
fine that's you That's not me I don't
care about any of that so he looks at
the social blade numbers every day he
looks at the comments he looked at the
Twitter's and he actually compiles a
report for me every week on this
happened with not only my channel he
watches everybody's channels so he's
looking at the landscape he's looking at
what the horizon looks like not for us
but for everybody and he's predicting
these chain
before they happen and we've started
kind of changing course before those
waves of whatever hit us and it's
working because the last six months
we've grown more than before I hired it
and and so and so he gets really nerdy
over that stuff but he's really shy
because he sees all those comments and
he sees the things people say he's like
oh my god did you see the comments on
you got his video let's not do that you
know I mean he doesn't really want to
put himself out there because he just
he's too nice of a person he doesn't
want to deal with the hate you know I
want to see ruined either and unite he's
straight-up social virgin and I'd like
to keep him that way ya know no matter
how much people say that doesn't
bother him online I mean in in bulk and
at the right time it does it absolutely
does you'd have to be stupid to believe
anybody says that they're not affected
by some negativity of course we all are
I think absolutely handle it we handle
it differently and and we can all say it
doesn't bother us it does to some degree
sometimes worse than others like right
now I'm gonna I'm gonna save you for cuz
I'm not I'm not bipolar but I mean I'm
no I'm not not and so drunk though all
the time now so so I'm just pretty level
I'm not kind of like whatever I've read
some pretty nasty comments today and it
was just like huh whatever and has moved
on I didn't even responders moved on and
it's nice but there's other days I'll be
sitting there on the crapper and I'm
like no this guy this guy and
I'll like I'll just I'll just totally
take the bait you know what I mean no no
I can tell - oh yeah and I'm sure you
can tell when I do the same thing with
all too often right I mean it's it's
it's it's one of those things I just
stopped lying to myself though now and I
just I just take it a day at a time it
is what it is gerrae wants to know if I
read the stream comments no sir I do not
like that said don't show Brian Lynas
we'll take him away dude you know me
people tried to steal him at CES like
literally he was getting job offers oh I
believe it I believe it I think I told
you a long time ago that line is even
made me a job offer at one time no
here's that here's the thing and here's
what I love about Brian so I've known
Brian for a decade remember now he's the
guy that pushed me into to go into full
time where like self-employment and
stuff so I've got my I've got my friend
Josh holiday doc who who convinced me to
start a channel
and then I've got Brian who convinced me
to go in at full time and then he's he's
so many people tried to steal him at CES
basically the conversation goes like
someone comes up and this what I love
about having Brian around specially at
places like CES and the party's XYZ guy
comes up to me he's like hey jam with
yada yada I'd really love to collab with
you or talk with you and it's like hey
this is Brian my brand manager I'm gonna
introduce you to him and I'm gonna go
over here to the bar have a nice day and
literally I don't have the conversation
at all and Brian will vet it which is
amazing because I don't have to and so
and so what will happen is Brian will
cook usually come over and be like that
guy just made me a job offer and a my
grill is like yeah it's so it's so sad
and what it is is basically the people
will see like oh Jays $0.02 success Oh
Brian Brian's the back end we want Brian
right and so they'll try to start trying
to hire him as like a contractor or
whatever
Brian's answer to me is always the same
the answer is always no because you're
the only person I believe in like Brian
only works with me and even takes the
risk of working with me because he's
like I believe 100% in what you're doing
he's like I I know you as a person I I
know where you're going I know where
you've been and I believe in the success
that we can bring this channel to and
that's the only reason why I'm even
bothering with any of this YouTube thing
he's like the he's like some random SH
remote Joe Blow guy wanted to come out
for me 200,000 a year can go eff off
because I don't believe in that guy and
that and that's why Brian and I had this
like crazy loyalty to each other
surround yourself with good people you
get a good product right before I go
they ever tell the story about how I
hired him no I don't think he did so he
just showed up one day right as far as
the audience was concerned like suddenly
there was like a Brian and we're like
who the hell is Brian right I think I
was the same way like I just like you're
talking about him on social media I'm
like I don't know there's a guy I put
out a Craigslist ad what am i friend so
no I guess I've known him for years and
years and he was over at the house he
and his wife when we were having dinner
at my house and we were he was here it's
basically dinner consisted of me
complaining like always complain about
busy I am playing had no time for this
no time for family no time I was like
what's the point I'm making a crap ton
of money if you can't even enjoy it
right that typical answer when you're
when you're broke you dream about all
the things you do if you have the money
when you have the money you dream out
all things to do if you had the time and
that's exactly how it goes and so I was
just complaining about this and that and
and was basically my complaints were the
amount of time the amount of time I
spent answering emails having phone
meetings and marketing meetings with
sponsors and this and that and it's just
like we're spending eight hours a day
talking about the things we need to make
videos on but there's no time to make
the videos cuz we're spending eight
hours a day talking about it right I was
like I was back in IT dude so anyway
it's like scrum there's like an all-day
scrum for videos is what it was
and so anyway Howard though hey it's
Chrome so bad that's why I said it I was
looking for a response it's groans go
ahead so anyway we're sitting there and
we're having dinner and he he joke and
he goes I should I should come work for
you I was like huh yeah that'd be great
I was like whatever and he was in still
putting together its charter school for
for foster youth and specializing in
foster youth job placement and career
advancement and getting them ready for
society because foster youth are so much
well foster foster youth are normally
just like you turn eighteen it's like on
your own good luck and they don't have
the tools they need to succeed so his so
his school it was about foster youth and
getting them ready so I was like never
even considered him because I how much
time I need he's spending with that and
there I was he's a looking for a job so
I was like haha you know whatever funny
no actually I I take it back stories
wrong I jokingly said to him like hey
you should come work for me he's like
huh you know and it was just a passing
joke well I'm I got up later and I was
like rinsing my plate off in the kitchen
he comes walking up to me it's like 20
minutes later he goes were you serious
back there in the dining room and I was
like about what hiring you and he's like
yeah I said well I mean if you didn't
have the school or whatever it doesn't
seem like anything go wrong and he goes
he goes well let's do it I said are you
serious he goes yeah said yeah let's do
it and that's literally how it happened
over dinner jokingly was like you should
come work for me he's like okay and the
rest is like the lasts almost seven
months now I've just been absolutely so
yeah absolutely there's something I'll
tell you some things online like on the
back ends that proved to like what he's
been able to achieve working for me that
I couldn't do by myself like period you
know that's awesome so the bottom line
is if you surround yourself with a team
that shares your ideals and your values
which is why I say in 2018 i'ma take
some calculated risks there's some
things we're gonna do some investments
we're gonna make and some chances we're
gonna take that I think are truly the
right thing I don't think you can fail
man honestly I think we can fail but the
thing is when we feel how we handle that
that's that's where our success okay let
me rephrase that you're not gonna fail
catastrophically hope everybody gets
setbacks right everybody even they like
video to video it's always a setback and
things happen that you don't understand
or you don't you don't you didn't
predict yeah but with Brian on your team
he's basically gonna predict everything
down with half a percent so I just sleep
good at night
the burns texted oh this is the Brian he
built the computer for it yes same guy
yeah he's awesome the guy the guy
seriously like a it will jayjay you know
firsthand how hard doesn't talk to me
sometimes I mean and he probably knew
exactly how to talk to you too he does
he does he actually knows and I'm not an
easy person to talk to when it comes to
sensitive things mm-hmm I'm not you know
I tend to get really am I'm a really
emotional person especially around my
friends so yeah surprised guys awesome
you correct you cry when they're out of
your peppermint mocha at Starbucks right
I do I do well roll that intro
let's get you home and then I'm gonna
sit here and procrastinate about
shooting the video and then fry just go
downstairs play video games on my knees
screen all right outros run all right
