where we built this 567 dollar gaming PC
capable of 105 FPS here in resident evil
2 one of the things we used and that was
our X rx 580 and we talked about
overclocking a little bit and how
temperatures had actually reached the
low 80s and a lot of people reached out
to us and said hey you know that card is
kind of known to have bad thermal paste
from the factory so what I thought we'd
do today is kind of a just a quick
exploratory video where we take a look
and do our temps actually improve if we
change the thermal paste on this card as
you could probably hear the fans are
definitely running near full speed and
we're still getting 78 see inside of
Resident Evil 2 right here 79 I've
already seen 81 or 82 in fact if we go
ahead and quit out of here real quick
you'll see that there's definitely going
to be a some Headroom that we could
probably find here

in the description below so the card in
question here is the radio an RX 580 by
power color it's the red dragon variant
which is a more entry-level card
although it has a backplate and a dual
fan cooler if we take a look at MSI
Afterburner here for about the last I
don't know twenty five minutes or so
maybe thirty minutes I was playing
Resident Evil 2 you can see the
temperatures curve up fairly quickly but
then you can see we definitely hit the
70s upper 70s and then here we hit 81
and then as I went to the menu and stuff
start talking you guys it comes down to
like the upper 70 so we hit a max of 82
which in my opinion for a card that is
still it I mean on the warmer side the
RX 580 can get pretty warm if you have
like the reference cooler on there for a
dual cooler heat pipe card like this I
feel like we should definitely be
getting some better temperatures than
that now this video that we're gonna do
right now also is going to apply to
pretty much any graphics card not just
an rx 580 but any graphics card even
those that are using a Founders edition
or reference style cooler you can still
probably get some better temperatures by
changing it out to a better thermal
paste and then even receding the cooler
because a lot of you guys seem to think
that this issue that we were seeing was
directly related to thermal paste with
this card I figured we would at least
see if that was valid or not now we do
have an overclock applied here with a
plus 25 on the core voltage a lot of you
guys said under volt the card under volt
I found that I could not get 1450 stable
without me running about a plus 25 on
here zero volts or zero additional volts
was not stable I haven't tried
necessarily under Vil
tene but for the sake of today's video
and keeping everything consistent
because we need to make sure we're not
introducing any variables that could
skew our results we're leaving all those
settings as they are right there you're
also going to notice we are running 55c
right now at idle because this card does
have a zero rpm idle mode where the fans
don't turn and they offer silence
instead of cooling so it's a bit warm on
the idle that's normal because like I
said we are not actually turning the
fans so with all that out of the way
let's go ahead and break open the card
and see what we find
so given the fact that this card has
four heat pipes and a dual fan with
heatsink on here I was kind of expecting
these temperatures to be better now this
could also technically void your
warranty although it's kind of a gray
area where I guess manufacturers
technically aren't allowed to void your
warranty by taking something apart but
there is a sticker on this particular
card over one of the screw holes so yeah
you don't do this at your own risk
obviously don't say J told me to do this
he's responsible he made me void my
warranty that ain't gonna fly so don't
even try it
there we go well I don't know if I'd go
as far as to say that it was a bad
thermal paste application but that's
what it looks like
nonetheless it's definitely thick I mean
a lot of the thermal paste solution in
the factories is extremely heavy and
very thick so I'm hoping that by s going
with some of the more traditional stuff
I use with water blocks that we might
see a little bit of an improvement here
it's also interesting to see that two
memory chips here have extra sealant
like around them I wonder why these two
chips have a different type of mounting
than these other ones here we got some
in the corner of the actual socket as
well it's also interesting too the way
these sockets are kind of mounted at a
or these these chips are mounted at a 45
degree angle not that it really matters
so just I've never really seen that
before okay so as with any sort of DIY
like this you assume a certain level of
risk and responsibility and because when
you're dealing with GPU dies like this
you are dealing with SMBs that are
exposed and transistors and resistors
that are right here on the surface you
want to be very careful when you go to
clean the thermal paste off you don't
want to use anything that's going to
necessarily be grabbed
be fact a lot of people would probably
even say don't use a paper towel like I
am right now but I've done this so much
I'm comfortable with it you might want
to use maybe a coffee filter or
something like that which is less
fibrous it's not going to leave little
fibers like that's kind of leaving on
there and you want to make sure that you
get all of this off without getting
hooked on any of these and accidentally
pulling them off which is what paper
towels and any sort of cloth can
actually do I've never seen a plate that
mounts down to the pipes like this I'm
curious now if I didn't do these will
that plate come off because if so that's
another layer of transfer right so if
there's thermal paste that goes between
this plate and the heat pipes that could
be a deal a thing to like why is this
screw down like that yeah I've never
seen this before on a air-cooled card
it's almost like maybe they put down
like a solder or a flux and then you
spin then they screw down and then it
hold it yeah that could be it but that's
not popping off I'm not gonna force it
so this is direct die so we want to use
a lot in my opinion because we want to
cover every square millimeter of it and
it is going to squish over to the side
and it's perfectly fine this is non
conductive exotherm from ek which we use
on our water blocks so you guys want to
make sure obviously if you're using any
sort of thermal paste that it's non
conductive although most thermal paste
these days are not conductive any longer
so I mean depending on your graphics
card you may or may not have a ton of
screws or a thermal paste glob that gets
jammed in the card or something but you
may have a million screws that go around
the perimeter and stuff so you just want
to be very careful as you're taking it
apart that you make sure that you got
all the screws out before you go trying
to pry it apart otherwise you could
accidentally damage your card and you
don't want that because then you'll cry
and then we'll be able to play games you
won't be able to play for a night
anymore and then you'll cry not just
because you're a child but because you
can play for a night everything is
awesome everything is cool when you're
part of the ching
okay hopefully we still have video
alright so early everything is running
it's gonna take some time for this
obviously heat up but yeah it's at 33 34
it doesn't really count but we just
fired it on right we just put clean
thermal paste it's as cool as it could
possibly be but just to show that all of
our settings are the same nothing's
changed
same factory fan curve and all that sort
of stuff let's go ahead go back into
Resident Evil 2 same thing same spots no
tomfoolery here or J foolery or whatever
chief alright so as you can see right
now we're we just hit 81 so clearly
there was no change I'm in the exact
same spot too that I was even there's no
change whatsoever to the temperature in
this particular instance that doesn't
mean it wouldn't necessarily be a fix
for you because if you've been running a
graphics card for hard for the last year
or two your thermal paste is probably
nice and hard and kind of thickened up
if that makes sense and you could
benefit from this so I would still
highly recommend it if you're
comfortable with taking your card apart
and replacing the thermal paste we did
this in the past with an old GTX 580
that used to belong to coconut monkey
and we saw it came down like six degrees
in his case but as you can see I'm
sitting 81 right now and we are not
getting it's exactly the same that 81 oh
there's 82 even so but what will affect
your system more than anything else is
obviously the case airflow so I still
stand by what I said in that video where
if you take your case and you open it up
and by opening it up that could also
mean not to take in the side panel off
but also giving better airflow through
the pan through the case because we've
got one intake fan one exhaust fan which
in my opinion is not enough for this
particular amount of heat that this card
can put off I took the side panel off
you can see we've already come down 2
degrees down to 79 and the longer I play
this will actually continue to come down
over time there's 78 and I has
everything to do with the fact that the
card is now able to get fresh air that's
recirculating because a cooler like this
that is exhausting air into the chip the
chassis or the case it's the chassis
responsibility to take the heat out of
the case
and this one is just not doing your job
of it because we have one low RPM 120
millimeter fan right here in the back
and as you can see right here it's
already coming down in temperatures not
as fast as I would like
oh there's 77 per second there just like
it takes a while for the card to heat up
it can take a while for it to cool off
as well and in fact we have ways of
speeding that up around here there we go
well even with like a thousand CFM or
whatever this pan is capable of moving
its stopped at 75
so maybe the more of the store lat Oh 74
improvements alright so maybe the moral
of the story is when you buy a lesser
end graphics card you get what you pay
for and in this instance the cooler is
doing what it's designed to do a
mediocre job but we can still play
without any sort of throttling it's
still 14 hundred fifty megahertz when it
was 82 degrees or 75 in this case with a
box fan plugged into it you can still
play games not a budget PC you kind of
gotta go well what exactly be one out of
it but what we just showed you that like
I said does apply to any graphics card
for the most part so if you've got a
graphics card that was running great and
now it's running really hot and you
haven't changed anything you might want
to start by taking a look at your
thermal paste so there you go this is
one of those videos we did specifically
because of the comments section so I
just felt like we'd do it hopefully this
taught you something hopefully taught
you to not be afraid to service your own
components even though it has a warranty
void sticker so obviously like I said
that one's on you in terms of whether or
not you want to void your warranties to
do this so I'm gonna go guys thanks for
watching and as always we'll see you
next okay so reason we recent we
recently we did a video can you hear me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
