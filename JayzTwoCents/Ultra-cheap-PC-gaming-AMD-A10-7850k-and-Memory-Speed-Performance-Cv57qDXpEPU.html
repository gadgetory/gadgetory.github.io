bringing you another video about PC
building and this time I'm talking
directly to you the guy in the budget
the guy who's got very little money to
spend and you need to get as much
performance as you can out of your
system without going into debt or
selling plasma or selling your body on
the corner now if you recall quite a
while back over a year ago I did a video
about memory speed and how it affects
gaming on PC and of course that was
directed towards somebody who had a CPU
and a GPU not running an APU so today
we're going to be taking a look at how
memory speeds directly affect APU
performance on AMD's Kaveri platform now
speaking about Kaveri let's go ahead and
talk about the specs there in this
system behind me if you recall I built
this thing on live stream on my weekly
podcast Tech Talk with J students and
barnacles every single Thursday at 6
p.m. there abouts
it's usually more like 6:05 sometimes
6:10
anyway it's every Thursday at 6 o'clock
ish Pacific Standard Time or Daylight
Time whatever you guys have to do the
math I'm sorry I can't help you
determine when it's on for you the world
is turning after all and I can't do
anything about that can't stop that I've
tried wasn't pretty so anyway enough
about that the system I'm using is an
AMD a10 78 50 K Kaveri apu in an msi a a
Dax AC mini ITX motherboard so this
isn't even like the most ideal
motherboard I could be using for this
test but it's kind of like a worst-case
scenario as far as I'm concerned has
very little overclocking potential on
this motherboard so your results were
more than likely be much better than
mine I am running 16 gigabytes of 20 400
megahertz r9 gaming Radeon gaming memory
it's actually an AMD branded memory with
an AMD profile in there it's a very very
aggressive Ram it's not entirely too
cheap but then again we're going to be
taking a look specifically at
rhe speeds and not timings and things so
we're going to see how speed affects
overall gaming performance what that
said guys I'm also going to be
benchmarking this today in battlefield
now the reason why I'm using battlefield
for not some of the other games that are
out is one battlefield 4 is very
intensive still in the sense that the
frostbite 3 engine is just kind of not
really Hardware friendly in a lot of
cases so I wanted to kind of throw as
much at this apu as i possibly could
rather than going with something that's
a lot less apu intensive or graphics
intensive as something like c4 you know
something along those lines so that's
why we're using battlefield 4 if you're
using playing other games that are not
as intensive your results are also going
to be a heck of a lot better now in
terms of my overclocks and stuff on this
i'm only running this at 4.3 gigahertz
up from 3.7 so we're talking a 600
megahertz overclock which isn't massive
but it's also no slouch either part of
the problem is the farther you overclock
the CPU in an APU
the lesser of an overclock you can get
in your GPU now when it comes to GPU I
am running the internal GPU at 960
megahertz I couldn't quite get that 1026
that 1026 megahertz to be stable even at
stock speeds and just bumping up the GPU
it wouldn't do over one gigahertz so
unfortunately I can't see how well 1
gigahertz will actually affect the
performance but scaling according to AMD
is really really good as well now when
it comes to ram the first test we're
going to be doing on this is 1600
megahertz because 1333 I don't think
anyone should really be picking up 1333
dim sticks anymore I mean it's so old
1600 or plus or go home bro
I mean seriously Gaiden ran bro now with
all that out of the way let's go ahead
and hop in the test range here in
battlefield 4 I'm not doing multiplayer
for this test because I wanted a static
controlled environment that we could
realistically see what the changes are
without going to different servers that
are going to have all kinds of different
variables that I can't control and those
servers as well so with that said let's
turn around get it some battlefield 4
and see exactly how this thing performs
ok so here we are inside the test range
here for Battlefield 4 now we want to
monitor the FPS obviously so we're going
to type we're gonna push the tilt which
is the button right next to number
one we're going to type perfect overlay
draw dots draw FPS space one and now you
can see whether FPS up there and we're
sitting at 32 frames per second in the
menu okay now for video settings I have
pretty much everything on medium with
all anti-aliasing turned off it's a
custom setting it's all medium except
for the anti-aliasing turned off and I
have no motion blur running but as you
can see right here I do have the mantle
API currently loaded so that is the way
that we are doing things here in the
test bench or the test thing so we'll
just go ahead and kind of start off here
in the helicopter you can see we're
getting what 35 frames per second with
some dips down into the 20s some
stutters but it's actually not too bad
it's actually fairly smooth I'll just
come over here and I'll tack this guy
make some explosions then I'm gonna come
over here and I'm gonna do a u-turn in
my little chopper chopper we're going to
attack that tank once again with a
surface-to-air to surface missile we're
going to blow them up alright so we see
we dip down into the mid 20s but we're
averaging right around 35 to 30 frames
per second and overall though it's
smooth I mean that's the thing it's
still fairly consistent you can see up
there it's just fluctuating 5 fps at the
most there's not there's nothing really
to complain about it I could play with
this that's the thing I could play with
these settings
alright 1600 memory there we got that
now tested we're going to go ahead and
do the same little loop I just did with
the 1866 and see if we got any
improvements ok so now we're back in the
test range here and you can see by
bumping it up from 1600 to 1866 our
averages have jumped from the mid 30s to
the low 40s just by bumping it up what
266 megahertz on the RAM and this Ram is
capable all the way up to 2400 megahertz
so it's going to our little loop again
come over here we'll tack the tank put
some bullets into him come over here and
do our little loop you can see we're
chilling here still in the mid mid 40s
on average now high 30s mid 40s blow
this guy up and then we'll come over
here and we'll do we'll do some trick
flying we okay so I mean already we're
going up to high 30s low 40s
so instead of just doing now 2100 I'm
going to jump straight to 2400 rpm rpm
this is an engine now apparently it is
kind of an engine technically the API
engine anyway we're to go ahead and jump
straight into twenty four hundred
megahertz and see exactly what we're
getting here in battlefield 4 test bench
test rig this thing that whatever okay
so here we are back in the test range
now and as you can see we're getting
it's kind of bouncing around a little
bit but mid 40s low 40s high 30s every
now and then we're going to hop I'll
show you here that the settings are
still all the same I'll medium it's all
exactly the same as it was before we'll
go ahead and hop in our little bird here
and do our same little little looping
run we were doing we'll go ahead and
kill this infidel tank here some rounds
in it come over here and do our little
loop it's all 27 for a second there oh
there's a 51 that was cool
look turn too far go ahead and make an
explosion
and you can see we're sitting here
pretty much in the mid mid 40s to upper
40s oh there's a 50 pretty much because
I got out over the or the water there
that's what I mean you have to admit
that the performance of an APU like
Kaveri is is it's not bad it's really
not okay so why are we doing all this
today well it's just to show you guys
that without a graphics card I am
playing a game like Battlefield 4 near
free fresh rate of the monitor I mean
mid-40s this this is awesome right here
now I was expecting maybe a little bit
more out of the twenty four hundred
megahertz Ram then then we're getting
here you can see there was a little bit
of diminishing returns 2100 was actually
about the same but this this is this is
absolutely phenomenal in terms of the
fact that we're we don't have any
graphics card and we are playing
battlefield 4 at playable play rates
this is this is cool I mean when I did
my Kaveri video last year I only had
1600 megahertz Ram so I didn't get to
take full advantage of it but this this
is absolutely phenomenal in terms of how
playable it is now there's one more
thing I want to show you here hopefully
the video can actually pick up how
smooth this actually is considering its
its lesser than the frame or the fresh
refresh rate of the monitor but now it
got me to thinking most people who are
going to be building on an extreme
budget like this are more than likely
going to have extreme budgets on
monitors and displays and things like
that in fact I know some people coconut
monkey we're still playing on a 720p
monitor so I got to thinking if you're
at an extreme budget you have no
graphics card you only have three four
hundred dollars to spend on an entire
system I mean this this chipper here is
available for what about a hundred and
seventy dollars and it gives you a CPU
of quad-core CPU as well as an APU or
GPU internally that can play a game like
this at sustainable Play rates what
happens if you do it on a lesser
resolution
JTP like I'm doing here and when I did
that I needless to say I nearly a
brick because of how well it actually
performed so we're go ahead and stick
this at 720p right here now it's going
to kind of look like poop on a 1080p
native resolution monitor but at 720p it
looks it looks like a 1080p when it's a
native resolution but look blue the
frame rates we're talking 80s and now
this is just as smooth as playing on any
actual gaming PC you know PC that's
that's built specifically for gaming
this is this is awesome I mean look at
this we are sitting up in the 60s like
pretty much all times here all right so
let's kind of let the helicopter fall
out of the sky here now what's the point
of this if you were on an extreme budget
kaveri apu coupled with some fast ram
without a GPU is by far the most
cost-effective way to start getting into
PC gaming I hide the recommend commit
why is it still flying I thought did we
crash anyway I highly highly recommend
kaveri a 1078 50k I don't have an 8 8 or
an 8 6 so I can't really attest to those
but I can tell you that the 8 1078 50k
right here with some 20 400 megahertz
ram is one hell of a shocker when it
comes to playing games so if I loaded up
something like titanfall this thing
would be sitting at 60 frames per second
with no problem because titanfall is so
undemanding so there you go guys Jase 2
cents here bringing you a video about
very memory speeds ap use and I'm
telling you right now if you were on a
strict budget this needs to be on your
short list so guys let me get the heck
on out of here
hope you guys a follow on Twitter I
enjoy interacting with you guys and
Facebook if you're not into the Twitter
and an Instagram and all that stuff I
like to just kind of do some silly
things but whatever the case may be guys
I will see you in the next one and
thanks hanging out today check it out
kaveri apu
dan this thing is pretty cool Graham you
have to overclock the CPU and the bus
speeds of my process right now just
happened to be making for some really
unconventional RAM speeds but this video
is going to give you an idea of what to
expect now rather than use a live game</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
