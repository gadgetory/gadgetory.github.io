two cents and I've got little midget Jay
right here say hi hi normally I wouldn't
put my child on a video like this
however we are going to be taking a look
today at two products I got myself a
nerd blog subscription and I figured
while I'm at it
my little girl gets so excited every
time she watches Barna Cleese and Gerry
open up his box
Gerry you like Gerry yeah you funny guy
yeah when we went ahead and got her her
very own nerd block jr. Frank Bob and it
has one on top hi
Archer for silly people no hearts are
for poor people
alright guys we're gonna go ahead and
take it a look at what's inside so don't
go away okay guys so nerd block what is
it well if you're a nerd like we are we
like to get little gadgets and toys and
figures and stuff and nerd block is a
subscription-based program to where
every month they will send you a package
and you don't know what's coming it's a
surprise huh we have no idea what's in
here so you get it it shows up and you
take a look inside you love it now the
nerd block jr. is at the time of
recording $13.99 a month and it's
designed for children and they have a
boy version in a girl version now I'm a
little concerned and I'm just gonna say
because it does put the contents of
what's on the box and I think we may
have had a mix-up because the stuff I'm
seeing looks like it might be for a boy
but you like boy toys right princes are
boys boys so it doesn't matter I'll
still like it and plant them your attic
guys princes and princesses or boy toys
you care if you care alright so I guess
we'll see if this turns out to be boy
stuff well then I guess I'm gonna have
to call the company but the nerd block
for adults it's 20 bucks a month but it
also includes a t-shirt every single
month and at the rate that I go through
clothes
I'm really
about that because there's no t-shirts

disappointment guys you got to put a kid
