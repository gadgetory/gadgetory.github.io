house we got the upstairs loft going
with a wife walking up the stairs and
things are finally starting to come
together
with its specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance-free plug-and-play
operation the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
so anyway I've started as you guys can
see I've got the wireless up here for
now at least to some of our devices can
connect I ordered my 16 ports which four
up here and I'm going to start getting
that ready tomorrow so for right now I
still have no actual network in this
house I'm also gonna have to get
extender and do some Bridge Wireless in
this house so that we can have plenty of
coverage all over this house because
there is quite a dead spot from the
master bedroom to the far side of the
house where our you know some of our
wireless devices and stuff aren't going
to work in the baby keeps climbing up in
this rocking chair and get stuck say hi
hey are you proud of yourself yeah I
thought so right dad so you take after
your daddy only only your daddy could
look at someone to be like I like you
yeah I like I like you don't talk to me
but I like you so yeah everything's just
a disaster right now a lot of my tools
and suffer out because you can see been
working on this so I got power ran up
here
Louisville you know pass through here
for my HDMI cables and stuff but here's
the only problem they're not long enough
so one of the things well this isn't
going to reach over to the side of the
TV because unlike regular TV some Reger
TVs this LG and again don't freak out
that it's facedown it's a very soft
ottoman and this is actually safer for
the screen and leaving it exposed you
hear the baby oh my god so the only
inputs are on the side there's none on
the bottom like you would typically see
on TVs so it's got to be able to run all
the way across and I make a 180 turn go
down inside the wall come out and back
up into the front of this hutch so yeah
it's not long enough so I had to go to
Best Buy I got some more cables longer
cables 12-foot cables and I've got up
run
optical so I'm going to do now as I'm
going to fish that's why I left this on
there to simply so I can use this like
almost like a fish tape because I don't
actually have fish tape to pull the
cables back through anyway we'll get
that done Oh another quick update you
guys can see we actually have some
places to sit now so the kitchen nook
table has arrived as well as the dining
room set has arrived but it's still very
barren here the walls neat things and I
want to put a rug under there yeah I was
by Pelican case with my camera gear in
it haven't even started putting together
the office yet
oh man moving is fun but not fun alright
and the new cables are in it really
helps kind of knowing how to do this
stuff yourself it's pretty simple the
way all of this works right here by
taking it all back apart running the
cables through you can kind of see the
hole right there because there was a
stud literally right underneath it wow
this camera picks up inside the dark
there really good so now we got our
12-foot 4k HDMI with ethernet over HDMI
which is kind of neat and there we go so
we got more than enough slack here as
you can see in fact I can pull a little
bit more through find you two little J's
over there grading the pizza we ordered
pizza the other night because of the
fact that we didn't have anything here
yet to cook and no food or anything so
where did you find those Donuts say hi
throw gang signs say mama
dad dad broom broom
she loves cars
boom alright so I'm still working on the
entertainment center but you can see
I've got some backlighting going on the
TV now which looks awesome all the wires
are completely sealed the TV is pretty
much like a floating TV as you can see
looks really really good so I was
confused about something I was Gary to
hook up my my 4 port switch here so that
my Sonos and all this stuff is able to
actually have an internet connection and
this is as you look really good once
it's in there I've always wanted to set
up a really nice entertainment center
this this is just so like IKEA and stuff
I swear see it flickering on camera but
it's only on camera though it's not like
that in real life but then when I went
to hook up the ethernet I realized this
is not an Ethernet jack or an rj45 it is
a phone jack so I look behind here and
this is really common where they used a
cat5 cable but they only use the pin out
for the phone and I left the other wires
just chilling here so this is actually
good because I can head down to Lowe's
or Home Depot I could punch this out or
get a whole new plate in fact I should
get a whole new plate because the
coaxial part as you can see right there
is broken and then they just ran this
through like that so I'm going to redo
this and yeah as you can see I can just
here's the part issue that broke right
there so I can just redo that and then
I'll have either net here which will
solve my problem which is uh that's kind
of nice so the fact that they use the
cat five you know although cat 6e or cat
7 would have been nice but anyway at
least this can be converted that's good
thing alright so things are looking a
little bit cleaner around here a catfish
on anyway I like I really like that
backlighting but instead of mounting
into the walls for the rear so no so I
just ended up getting these speaker
stands designed for the Sonos so these
are back here now as my satellite
surrounds one of these is really cool
about the Sonos is you can actually
control the volume from any Sonos device
Here I am here I can turn it up please
and say no I can pause the volume right
here so it's really neat I oh I really
like the smart function of the Sonos
it's pretty awesome the upstairs loft is
starting to come together a little bit
we haven't done much work in here though
got the couch up here so that the kids
can watch TV and then we're I haven't
even gotten the baby gates up yet so
we're actually using the TV boxes here
as baby gates yeah that's pretty good oh
so this is the current condition of my
office and this is what I'm going to do
some today to tackle some of this try
and get all this crap put together at
least I wait I feel like I I got
something done when it comes to the
business I wanted to get this together
first when we moved in obviously that
didn't happen d coconut monkey has made
his way over to the new pad and is
immediately looking at pictures of nizzy
and trying to play Witcher and farcry
without the internet Oh as you can see
the office is coming together because
that box of cables and stuff but we got
the test bench set up over there which
is still going to be up in here not in
the shop that way I can do simple like
graphics card reviews and stuff up here
and then here is the wraparound which is
really nice thing about IKEA desktop you
probably can't tell until I point this
out but actually reconfigured this desk
I put the longer what used to be that
pullout table that I had underneath the
desk is now the extension leaf on that
side so I made that side longer then I
have skunkworks chilling right there and
then I have the other desk just set up
up here for the test bench would you
like a chair um yeah actually you know
there's a chair right there look no more
nasty ugly carpet huh for now okay wait
for now I'm not gonna do any of that
crazy work up here so I visit ties so
anyway yeah
now that Coco monkeys sitting at the
desk you can get a good sense of just
how big the desk is natural light coming
from that window which is really nice
yay but you notice how we could both be
playing in here at the same time now and
not you know each other bumping into
each other all the time yeah it's gonna
be really nice I just walked into the
wall al so anyway now coconut monkey and
I have to go to a buy a new switch I
ordered a 16 port
10/100/1000 are gigabit switch unmanaged
switch for the house here to go into the
patch panel like I told you guys I was
going to do the United States Post
Office for whatever reason said that in
on tracking today that my home was
undeliverable or incorrect address and I
verified the label and it's exactly
right the mailman or at least the
monkeys that know affect no offense to
the coconut monkey over here but the
actual monkeys at the USPS hires to
drive their trucks are stupid because he
never even came by and what's funny is
the regular mail with the same exact
address was delivered today yeah I don't
know what kind of idiots the USPS has
going over there but now I've got to
spend the time to go and buy another
switch to get this project done because
automatically the USPS will return
anything that has an unlivable status
associated with it
so we going to best pirate want to get
the switch
and yet rj45 connectors
you know best buy my head
I want to go to lose anyway garage door
opener
and then we have traffic
it's all backed up men
Khoda monkey and i got everything that
we needed here's my 16 port gigabit
switch right there again an unmanaged
switch I don't really need a managed
switch nmt okay rj45 connectors new wall
plate baseboard staples the coaxial when
it comes to wiring up it's actually
pretty pretty pretty easy like cat5e it
doesn't really matter what order those
colors go in as long as they're the same
on both ends left to right so if you can
do
orange orange white brown brown white
blue blue white green green white it's
all the same on both ends so we're going
to do now is we are going to before we
take this into the closet and hook this
up I'm literally going to like to side
tape it in there we need to actually get
ends crimped on those wires because of
the fact that that's that's going out
explained with a problem with the way
that those patch panels are put together
are okay so the patch panels here the
nice thing is you know you usually have
some extra slack so you can see we got
lots of cable here to work with
fortunately they're pre-labeled
and two of these which are labeled feed
- and then - I don't know what I don't
know what feed 2 is supposed to mean
feed 1 feet - doesn't really matter
that's why I got a 16 port so I could
fit all 12 of these wires on there
there's 10 being used now but I could
fit all 12 on there and then there won't
be any problems but you can see these
literally just terminate onto here and
then there's nothing past this they
anticipate that you're going to take
another cable and you're going to strip
it and you're going to punch those down
onto here and then extend it off
somewhere else the problem is every time
you have a junction like that you get a
little bit of noise introduced into the
line which can give you some stability
issues so literally what we're going to
be doing now is we are going to be
pulling off or technically cutting off
these one at a time and then we are
going to test them and see make sure
that they work well it's funny about
this here is the kitchen one terminates
into an rj25 which is like a phone line
and that's what I showed earlier on the
blog that you haven't seen was that a
lot of these will will be like this on
this end for Ethernet or cat 5e but then
will terminate - only the four wires
needed for phone line so that's why I
bought those other plates so that we can
change
anyway we're just going to get started
here with the one that I think is gonna
be my bedroom so do we not have bedroom
one p2n - all right well this is the fun
part this is where you get to start
doing like network mapping in the house
because clearly they don't even have
this master bedroom to say they labeled
it here master bedroom two bedroom three
bedroom four okay so bedroom two is
going to be they considering master at
bedroom one so bedroom two should be my
office and that's the one I'm concerned
with the most right now
so let's find bedroom two and go from
there I do have a stripper tool for this
but whatever I'm being kind of lazy at
the moment I've got plenty of slack to
play with so yeah don't worry about that
I'll beckon that later so we gotta do
now is get these in the proper order and
straightened out the hardest part
usually is getting these all to stay in
the proper order
while you slide them into the connector
these are pretty stiff so they might not
be a problem so we can slide this guy on
to make sure these are all in proper
order again because I should have slid
this on first all right and then
obviously the most important part is
having the appropriate tool it's
literally you push that in and then
that's it that's sunk er some cur that
sunk er is now crimped down and we can
push that down stairs either router
looks like it came from Planet Cybercom
it's a Nighthawk x16 I got it because it
was superior wireless skills yeah
alright so let's go see if the office is
on line tonight's not making go that
shows nothing is connected to it at the
moment I think before they do pour maybe
so let's go try to happen to see alright
so we hooked up a couple of the bedrooms
and we're not getting anything so I want
to now check and see what the pinout is
at the side where the wall so now we got
to see exactly what's going on that did
verify that the Internet is going to
them that router and that it works once
you plug a standard cable into it so
guy this is going more in a standard
cat5 a record which McCall here so it is
going it's hard to see is my phone up
there so you see the lake okay yeah so
it's going green green white orange
white blue white blue orange brown brown
white
I gotta hope now that they were
consistent at least on all these plugs
on the way that they did that all right
we got Internet so once we found out hey
he's got here like mine Joe Montana no
so one sweet it's gray gray here get it
alright so once I got those colors right
obviously little J's room is now wired
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm just
going to go ahead and pin out all of
those the same now coconut monkey thinks
I checked two of the rooms and they're
the same now with that same pin out
coconut monkey thinks I should go for
three make sure three rooms are the same
I think two is good enough anyway I'm
going to I'm gonna go ahead and just do
it all with this order and if it ends up
being some of the rooms are not right
then coconut monkey has the right to say
J I told you I don't think it's going to
come down to that okay yeah yeah well I
we get it this computer has not been
online and so long all right so I could
be mounting this with screws and stuff
to this panel but I'm literally just
using 3m like super adhesive tape
because well I'm lazy
I've got to come back in here later
anyways and mount all this up properly
for now I just need everything working
and then I'm going to come and make a
very nice neat insult out installation
which will be a future video so is
enough room to make the bends there so
make nice switch this bitch and I'm just
going to double check all of these
connectors again just to sure but yeah
that is about it it's all done yeah and
that is up actually it's not all done
yet there's two rj25 port plugs in this
house that I've got to change and then
one that's broken behind the
entertainment center I've got to change
that so then that will be done but
anyway the entertainment started center
stuffs working on Wireless right now I'm
exhausted
oh I told you earlier it's been three
weeks non-stop everyday now dealing with
getting into this new house fine
the house and then packing up the old
house and then moving into this house
and still not done in fact I've been in
this place now since Monday today is
Friday and I just got the net work done
you finally have computer now everyone
keeps asking me if I'm gonna miss you

15-minute drive for this guy and he
likes driving so we can scare it no
problem for me anyways we're gonna get
