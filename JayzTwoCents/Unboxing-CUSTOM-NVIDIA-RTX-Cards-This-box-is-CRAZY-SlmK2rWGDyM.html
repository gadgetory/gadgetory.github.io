features genuine Cherry MX witches perky
RGB backlighting USB pass-through for
convenient access and dedicated
multimedia keys with integrated volume
knob making it a great value for gamers
and keyboard enthusiasts alike learn
more about the strafe RGB mark tube by
visiting the link down below okay guys
it's that time I don't do unboxings I am
NOT an unboxing channel I stopped doing
that a long time ago because I thought
there was no there's no substance to it
its stuff it's in a box you take it out
you put it in a computer and oftentimes
you don't care or you might put it on
display in the back of a youtube channel
I don't know but some of this packaging
has changed quite a bit some of the
brands have taken some serious thought
into their packaging so I thought that
this would probably be worth it so we
got three brands here that we're
starting off with we have more that are
currently in the mail so we're waiting
on those to arrive so these are the
three lucky winners I get to be a part
of our unboxing experience yeah I use
the I know my hashtag quoted that
whatever you know tic tac toe whatever
obviously we have the founders of
edition cards here from Nvidia we've got
EVGA cards right over here and we've got
a ZOTAC card so let's go ahead and start
with the founders cards because these
are well this is the manufacturer
experience so you can see the box has
changed slightly versus the original box
specta me grab that real quick this is
what it looked like when Pascal launch
was just a black box it said Pascal had
kind of the angles because member of
Pascal is where they changed the cooler
design to be much more angular looking
kind of a stealth fighter II thing so
obviously we'll go straight to the 2080
ti these are going to be identical but
unboxing experiences so why not start at
the top so if you actually bought or
pre-ordered a founders edition card this
is what your experience is going to be
like you cut the tape on the side slide
the Box open and you will find your card
sitting upright in an anti-static bag
waiting for you will peel that off in a
minute
that nice and ksmo a SMS AAS AAS a Maher
&amp;amp; Maher he'll be fill also to you get
this little pamphlet
no.not pamphlet leaflet thing it's not a
leaflet either this is a very Apple
Liske unboxing experience in my opinion
you get this right here which is a
DisplayPort to a DVI adapter because
remember they took the DVI port off
starting with the 1080 TI
so you also have of course your booklets
of information and stuff your support
guide and your Quick Start Guide it's
just a lot of languages it's not really
that leg of the book for you know
whatever here is the card itself of
course we need to get these satisfying
crinkling of package being opened really
hurts my thumb and there it is right
there you ready we're going to get close
to the mic you ready
so there it is a 20 atti founders
edition card and all of its ear cereal
silvery dual fan blower goodness we got
black heatsink in there too 8 pin PCI
Express power our envy link cover right
there that just pop off how much bigger
that is for the envy link stuff one of
the biggest differences though obviously
besides the dual fans on here is the
fact that the backplate is silver and a
heck of a lot thicker look how much
thicker that is also to the geforce logo
right here is Chrome or nickel whatever
you wanna call it it's shiny so we can't
actually power these up today we don't
even have drivers yet you wanna know the
truth cuz right now the only thing this
is pretty much good for is either
balancing out a table or holding open a
door but that's besides the point
that's a rant we'll save that for
another day up next is EVGA this is the
20 ATT I of course and the first AIB
card we are going to take a look at even
the boxes RGB you see this alright so
here's the card
the XC ultra so this is kind of
interesting because EVGA has various
models that we've already seen we've
seen triple fan layouts we have also
seen dual fan layouts and this is one of
those dual fan cards right here but
would you look at just how thick that is
alright so if we look at this right here
this is still based on the reference PCB
if I'm not mistaken I was told it's
based off the reference PCB obviously we
have our back plate on here but if we
look at the overall dimensions you can
see that's very painful and with them
that it's the same dimensions as a
reference card but clearly just a tad
thicker just a bit the X C right here
right X C yes XC is a 2.75 slot card and
you can see there is obviously a lot and
I mean a lot of heatsink there but they
also have these accent pieces right here
which they're calling trim and this is
something that you're going to be able
to apply for for free according to EVGA
so they'll have more information on that
but if we go ahead and pull off the
plastic on this guy
oh so you can see you have these white
pieces of trim like underneath this
tinted cover there are perimeter screws
on this and that cover will come off and
then you'll have different colors I
think they said black white and red or
give me the colors you can replace the
the included white with so you can add
some color to you card if you want
I've talked for years saying
manufacturers should stop forcing a
color down your throat and just let the
user decide or just go with
monochromatic black let it be over with
Black Card you've been a silver card or
a white card but red and blue and orange
and stuff yeah no no we are gonna go
ahead and move on now to the zotac card
this is the amp 2080 this is a triple
fan design so it's still gonna be based
on the reference PCB because at the time
of launch all the custom cards you were
seeing these companies sort of debut are
not ready for primetime but they are
able to come out with day one reference
PCB designs so it's got this sleeve on
the box that's a bit of a hologram as
well and we're do the best we can to
show you this I mean frame rate on a
camera and this is gonna be hard to pick
up but as you can see the fans and the
card looked like it's moving as you
slide the cover off so anyway this to be
honest with you is the whole reason we
even did this video this little hologram
thing so tech all right good on you you
forced me to do an unboxing video
because of this so inside the box you
get some gorgeous dual molex to 6-pin I
would call it ketchup and mustard this
is more like chocolate and mustard
because it's brown black and yellow let
me just go on a limb and say if you have
to use this you're not ready to install
this card in your system okay no one on
the planet should be using a double
molex to 6-pin power connector and have
an RT X card okay nobody and if you do
what's wrong with you man triple fans
they are longer than the card itself
because again reference PCB it even has
the gorgeous not for resale sticker
right on it which so tech puts on their
cards that's okay we'll peel that off
and make it look pretty but what I think
is interesting and they did the same
thing with the 2080 from Nvidia the
reference card it's got two eight pin
power plugs but two of them are just
blocked off
to make it a six plug what I've never
seen that before but to be fair the
reference board from Nvidia on the 28 II
is the same way but as you can see the
cooler hangs off the back of the card
significantly because it's still just a
reference length PCB with a much longer
triple fan cooler on there and again
this one is about a two and a half slot
anyway I would love nothing more than to
show you guys some performance figures
today but the unboxing embargo has just
lifted as you guys can see and I still
have not had a single piece of
communication from in video regarding
drivers or any of that stuff hopefully
by the time you guys see this video
that's all changed but I'm gonna do the
best I can to bring you the most I don't
know the best coverage that we can
regarding this card's performance
because that's what we care about and
we're still in the dark I have the most
expensive paperweights right now because
these don't have it it's like having a
race car sitting in the paddock with no
one sitting in the driver's seat that's
exactly what these are anyway guys I'm
gonna go thanks for watching this
unboxing video and you rarely do these
but ZOTAC made me do it because of that
all right we're gonna go guys thanks for
watching and as always we will see you
in the next one
are specifically for this from the
embargo list which</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
