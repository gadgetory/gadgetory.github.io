we're gonna do a video that I said even
on Tech Talk that I wasn't gonna do
already making me a liar and a hypocrite
but whatever I can do that I guess it's
my choice Coolermaster skate smart world
series is where you will find the most
custom computers on the planet and Ahmad
coolermaster car for more details
breather alright so you have probably
undoubtedly heard that we are dealing
with a GTX 970 memory RAM gate as people
are hashtagging it or hashtag I want 4
gigabytes or whatever I mean this has
turned into such a circus I guess I
don't even know why I'm doing this video
but I've been begged by so many people
to do it I figured I'll go ahead and do
it so the GTX 970 this thing came out on
September 18th 2014 all of us reviewers
talked about it we all got various
samples I've got the g1 gaming I've got
the SSC from EVGA and it was touted as
like the most bang for the buck card out
there it was like the 90s great but the
970 really is the value and it was
hanging with the 290 and 290x and lots
of tests and the specs were really
outstanding I mean over 1600 CUDA cores
4 gigabytes of gddr5 64 ROP well it
turns out that there at least was a
miscommunication between Nvidia's
engineering team and the advertising
team where the specs for the memory side
are cut down a little bit more than we
really anticipated or even we reviewers
even noticed we'll talk about that a
little bit
now there's two sources I'm going to
point you to when it comes to the
technical facts of this because I'm not
going to turn this into a 45-minute
video talking about the specs and
exactly how they were cut down and how
it matters now that's tech report Scott
Watson and PC per over there Ryan trout
they had done an amazing job at covering
this and going into technical detail and
what's actually happening here with the
970 on a high-level kind of a just a
quick explanation is you have a cut-down
crossbar on the 970 versus the 980 which
has given you one less l2 cache module
that has to feed two memory controllers
one of those feeding the 500 megabyte
segmented portion of that V RAM that's
on there so that's how you have a 3.5
and a 500 megabyte now that 500 megabyte
is be considered a low level or a low
priority Ram and so that's why a lot of
games when you're gaming on them will
only show a cap of 3.5 gigabytes of vram
and not go beyond that into the 4
gigabytes now before we talk about my
thoughts on this I figured I'm going to
look at this from the perspective of J
three years ago let's say J or Eva I'm
sure this is going to apply to many of
you
you've scrimped and you've saved and you
load lawns and you wash cars you worked
overtime and you did we had to do to go
out and buy your first high-end graphics
card and you picked up a GTX 970 on
launch day and you're excited about it
you were playing on the card and you
thought this is fantastic
or maybe you're considering buying one
right now you're in the situation that I
just described and you were considering
buying one of these and then you hopped
on Twitter you hopped on your favorite
tech forum and now you're seeing all
this 1970 RAM gates stuff and you guys
don't know what to do so what I'm going
to do right now is I'm going to turn
around I've got my Elgato Game Capture
hooked up to the testbed right now we're
going to actually capture some gameplay
we're going to go through a couple of
different scenarios we're going to see
how well the card performs in these
different scenarios we're going to try
and stress it we're going to put it to
the cap of that 3.5 gigabytes
we're going to see exactly what happens
so we're going to find out together even
though I've already done all these
benchmarks we're going to find out
together
right now in real-time how the card is
really performing whether or not it's a
card that's still worth buying with your
hard-earned dollars so with that said
let's go ahead and transition into the
test bench let's start playing some
games transition
okay so here we go guys we are going to
use MSI Afterburner here to do our test
of VRAM usage now one thing I want to
point out here I'm using 1080p for two
reasons one my Elgato Game Capture that
I'm using to capture this can only
supply 1080p to the monitor when it's
using HDMI pass-through and then second
1080p is actually used by 98% of gamers
when it when Steam poll was actually
done on hardware so 98% are using 1080p
or less so remember the perspective of
this video is the average consumer went
and bought a graphics card like the 970
and now they want to know whether or not
it's something that they should worry
about or return so the first thing we're
going to do here is the battlefield for
64-bit I shared headed open 64-bit tests
on a 64 man server we're going to just
max the slider out as far as we possibly
can
I also have fraps running here so that
we can see a real-time on-screen FPS
meter I don't like to use the built-in
msi afterburner overlay or on the screen
display OSD so yeah anyway we're doing
1080p for this test okay so we are in
the menus video you can see we are in
the ultra preset four times MSAA which
is the most inefficient use of VRAM so
we're trying to do the best we can to
use as much of that as possible let's go
ahead and bump this up to say let's go
150 on the resolution scale to add more
resolution to this see we get here
alright there we go let's go ahead and
see how this is going to prepare
you can see our FPS even at a hundred
and fifty percent resolution scales
sitting pretty good terrible
I'm only going to play for a couple
minutes here I'll probably end up
editing this so we're going to take a
look at what the vram is doing according
to msi afterburner
alright let's go ahead and see what was
happening here on MSI Afterburner so
according to afterburner
we only used 1.5 gigabyte up scuse me
derp we use 2.7 gigabytes of vram during
that with the resolution scale at 150 so
let's go and put it up to 200 and see
what happens
hope that soldier zoom intensity mode
alright 200% so we're doubling the size
of the resolution here which is going to
put a lot of strain so we're going to
notice some FPS dips for sure but what
we're looking for here is terrible
stuttering or just flat-out freezes
because that's what people were
complaining about and I mean yeah we're
sitting it right about 300 hour 30 FPS
between 30 and 40 FPS but really the
resolution scale at this point is
getting pretty damn near 4k overall on
the textures so I don't know it looks
pretty consistent to me granted the FPS
is terrible consider 30fps to really be
all that great of a gaming experience
so far I'm not seeing any crashing not
seeing any stuttering or any freezing
textures look freakin amazing though
so no I'm waiting for the freezing and
stuff waiting for RAM Gate to appear
still waiting for RAM Gate oh I got
sniped nicely good job mr. sniper all
right so what happened with the RAM on
this one memory usage went up to three
point well you can see right there we
had a spike as we left it 3607 and it
came down now as it's sitting there all
right so here we are in the Skyrim
settings you can see everything is
completely maxed out object detail fade
they were clicked that whatever that is
everything's on ultra FXAA everything is
on the highest you can go here so there
we go let's go ahead and play some
Skyrim now you're going to notice here
that I'm level one I've got like no
progress in the game that's because I
lost all of my Elder Scrolls progress
but that's okay I didn't play it to too
much I just was using it for some
benchmarks and things so pretty much
we're sitting here right at the
beginning of the game
oh well no big deal so you kids see come
alright FPS is running away to 145 fps
you can see we're moving nicely nice and
smooth there's no stuttering as I'm
turning here
there's no motion blur when I turn
though I notice that I do see some what
looks like texture flickering there in
the water but that could be just because
of the runaway FPS I don't know I know
it doesn't actually do that when I have
vertical sync going but hey well look at
the RAM usage and we'll see what's
happening maybe it's name is RAM related
who knows alright so let's see how much
beer and we're actually using rye memory
usage it's even less than battlefield
1400 F or 1400 memory or megabytes can
put total 1487 megabytes we're not going
to go any farther on that one I mean I
know that there are mods and things for
this game there are no mods installed I
don't believe that the average PC gamer
is going to buy the graphics card and be
like I'm going to start modding of
course that's going to be a kind of a
niche enthusiast group there as it is
but as you can see FPS is doing just
fine let's go ahead and clear that bad
boy and now we're going to go ahead and
do the other one everyone said that I
should do on this test which is shadow
of Mordor and I do have as you can see
here the HD content pack is installed
now I've already run this test and this
is one that I will say does seem to
hammer the graphics card more than any
other test that I've done she had to his
mood or middle-earth I said that
backwards but I don't care middle of
shadow Mordor earth
alright options video alright so we're
at 1080p 970 FPS no limits
apply settings yes
so Advanced Options I mean everything as
you can see is just bloom as high as it
will go
alter alter alter alter alter depth of
field order in transparency tessellation
apply BAM alright so this thing is as
high as it will go with the HD texture
pack and once again this is one of those
games that I have not really done a
whole lot in just some benchmarking so
obviously this isn't a playthrough or
anything like that I wouldn't expect a
playthrough that's what you're going for
because you're not going to get it so
it's not in this video maybe the future
video I got to find a way to implement
playing more games in my life I don't
play enough games alright so as you can
see when turning here we did get a
little bit of stuttering right there
when do a swan dive
all right so so far we're doing okay fps
doesn't look too shabby yeah just go for
broke here oh this was a bad thing run
away get away right away whoa hello mr.
ring
I bet yeah we're getting a little bit of
stutters here I think I've bitten off
more than I can chew here this is this
is kind of how I go about life it just
jump in and take on more than I can chew
so I kind of feel like this guy in a way
there's no way I can defeat all these
guys I guess we're gonna try now aren't
we
this is a good way that really tests the
card I guess die
yeah oh my legs I finish you off when
you awake
rad taking on two captains here well we
had a couple really bad stutters there
oh yeah oh yeah I know you uh alright
let's see what was happening here with
MSI as far as you can see here we was
sat right around 3.5 dip down came up
dip down came up core clock it's really
good but as you can see here the GPU
usage had some stutters in there but the
stutters don't really line up with
anything happening with the RAM so I'm
going to say that this might just end up
being part of the HD content and
everything being maxed out and this
being a 970 so I guess that leaves us
into conclusion time okay here we go
guys conclusion time and my two cents on
this whole 970 matter now as I mentioned
I try to put myself in the perspective
of somebody who's going out and buying a
970 they only want to buy one card they
wanted the last several years and
they've freaked out after hearing all of
this 970 rumor stuff which is I guess
not really rumor it's confirmed now at
this point but they're concerned now
about whether or not they should keep
the card or concerned about whether or
not they should buy the card if they
were thing about buying one and here is
the what it comes down to as far as I'm
concerned the GTX 970 is still an
amazing graphics card now the general
public especially those in these--piece
enthusiasts and gamers are mad and I
think that that's a little bit
rightfully so considering it does say
right here massively 4 gigabytes gddr5
now that can be a little bit misleading
because you would think that you have 4
gigabytes available to the game engine
or the gaming engine the way the card
works to available to the games to give
you the best performance but as you can
see with shadow of more
or 3.5 is technically where it caps out
it doesn't even try and use as other
five or 500 megabytes of VRAM now the
only way that benchmarks were able to do
it in fact some of those ms-dos based
benchmarks or command put benchmarks
where they were forcing access to that
ram which was causing the card to
actually work outside of the way it was
designed so therefore you saw massive
slowdowns now Nvidia does say that that
500 megabytes is similar to accessing
system ram which is what happens when
you use more than your available vram on
a graphics card but that it's four times
faster but as you saw shadow of mordor
was not using more than 3.5 because the
game really only saw 3.5 now that is
something that people do in my opinion
have a legitimate fact or a legitimate
right to be angry over thinking they
were buying a four gigabyte video card
when in fact they were getting a 3.5
gigabyte video card now the only people
who would really probably be affected by
this are going to be people who are
playing shadow of Mordor at 1080p on
high res or HD resolution trying to max
it all the way to the right and then
people who are doing things like heavily
modified Skyrim heavily modified
minecraft or other very heavy texture
based games now in my opinion the
general buyer out there is probably not
doing all of that now if you're the kind
of person it's like I just want to buy a
graphics card I just want to throw it
into my computer and I want to have a
good gaming experience by just playing
some my Steam games or playing
battlefield or counter-strike or Call of
Duty or things like Tomb Raider far cry
4 whatever then you're going to find
that the card is going to serve you very
well
and well into the future in fact a lot
of people right now are playing on
graphics cards that don't have more than
two or three gigabytes of vram and you
don't really hear them complaining
because vram is not usually the limiting
factor on the gaming experience so if
you take anything away from this video
the GTX 970 is still a fantastic card
and it's going to serve you well for
years to come on most titles unless you
start getting heavily into things that
are texture based or modified or
high-definition texture packs now
there's a couple of good things that
actually came out of this this was an
opportunity for
mt2 jump and they did AMD definitely
jumped by slashing the price of the 290
and a 290x even further which now means
that you can get graphics cards like the
290x for as little as and sometimes
cheaper than a gtx 970
so really this is a good thing for the
consumers but I do think Nvidia is going
to have to work really hard at getting
back some of the trust of the public I
think there might be a little bit of a
trust issue now when it comes to that
but I don't feel that this is something
that's going to happen again on a videos
part I think they've learned from this
or hopefully they've learned from this
assuming that wasn't an outright
deception I don't believe it's an
outright deception they would know that
this would eventually come to light they
wouldn't try to completely deceive the
public at least I would hope that that's
the case so I think that they've learned
their lesson from this and they're going
to have a little bit different checks
and balances now when it comes to their
advertising and Department and their
engineering department so we can hope
for that at least but there you go guys
if you're looking at getting a gtx 970
the card is still delivering everything
it promised and everything that we said
it was delivering at the time of launch
and today five months later so I don't
feel that it's a terrible card I think
it's unfortunate the way things went
down with the way the vram is working in
fact Nvidia says that this is by design
this 3.5 and 500 it's the first time
they've ever done it in fact it wasn't
even possible before on the way that the
way that the bar on the l2 cache works
but now it's possible so what could have
been a great technological advancement
to say hey we have done something here
that could be very good in the future
unfortunately now kind of gives them a
black eye but I do feel that it was a
little bit of an unfortunate thing where
you're not really getting four gigabytes
of gddr5 for your games to access so
there you go guys my two cents on the
GTX 970 still a fantastic card if I was
in the shoes where I bought the card and
based on the performance that I'm
getting right now and this was the only
card I owned I personally wouldn't be
returning it because I don't fall into
the group that's being affected by this
whole vram thing and then lastly if
you're the kind of person that's like
nope this is a deal breaker for me well
you
even cheaper AMD cards now to consider
like the 290 and to 90 X so all around
it kind of stimulated the market a
little bit when it comes to price drops
because AMD was like heck yeah we're
going ahead and lower prices even more
and be like four gigabytes bitches they
go guys
GTX 970 take it for what it is these are
the tests I performed that was my two
cents on it see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
