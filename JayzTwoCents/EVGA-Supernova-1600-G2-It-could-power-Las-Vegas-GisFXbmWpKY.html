recording this video because I've had
nothing but audio problems and other
boneheaded mistakes that I've been doing
watch this video out of sympathy Jase T
cents here and as my childhood idol Tim
the Toolman Taylor always said this
thing needs more power oh and that's
exactly what we're gonna look at the
EVGA supernova 1600 g2 4 stands for duty
to lift bro
I'm not even kidding guys I feel like
such a youtube noob considering this is
the fourth time I've done this video
although it should flow pretty good now
I guess recently I stuck the EVGA up
supernova 1000 G to in skunkworks and
today we were taking a look at the 1600
which might lead to the question why on
earth what I need 1600 watts of power
well we're going to talk about that
today now first things first let's go
ahead and talk about what's in the box
inside the box you find two more boxes
this is the power supply right here
which might end up being one of the
longest power supplies you've really
ever taken a look at and there it is
right there in all of its textured
goodness 140 millimeter fan fully
modular cables nice giant on/off switch
and fully meshed exhaust plate on there
giving it amazing airflow but where the
weight is actually coming from is this
guy right here because this is all of
the all those modular cables and my god
do they give you a lot of them now we'll
just go and get this guy out of the way
we're going to set the power supply
aside for a second because we'll get
back to that in a moment now these are
all of the cables that they give you
here just way way more than anyone would
ever need for a single system but hey
they're included so you get this kind of
a nylon pouch here where you can put all
your extra cables in there and the only
way to really do this is just dump them
out and as you can see we have got a lot
of cables now the first thing you
I notice and maybe you didn't if they
actually give you this this 24-pin
exhilarating which is perfect for
jump-starting the power supply if you
wanted to use it as a test bench or
something like that or if you're doing a
water cooling bill this is how you can
jump-start your your your water pump so
that you don't have to bring up your
system when you're trying to bleed it
this is cool it's only a couple bucks
but I'm glad to see that they've
included it shows that going in sort of
the extra mile there you've got some
velcro straps here to keep things nice
and tidy and you've got a whole bunch of
modular cables now when I'm digging for
down here is these guys right here
now I've docked power supplies in the
past for including the floppy drive
cable power cables because normally I
just clip them off anyway which I don't
like to do but they give you two of them
here with four pin molex bleeds so that
you can plug them in if you need them
now that comes in handy because there
are some accessories out there that
actually run off of this floppy drive
cable connector so you can include it in
your system if you need it and just toss
it aside if you don't now the other
thing that I'm going to give positive
points for here is that EVGA also went
the extra mile of including all black
cables ah black cables are just so nice
now I like all black cables because even
though you may have blacks leaving on
here once you see the exposed part of
the cables here and the reason why these
are exposed if you guys have ever
wondered it so that you can make those
bends most of the time you have you know
it comes up off your motherboard it has
to bend down so you couldn't bend it
very well if you had it all sleeved up
all the way to the end but it keeps it
from looking like a 1972 psychedelic
acid trip inside your computer if you're
going for some sort of a color aesthetic
or theme you can actually not have to
worry about it because it's all black
you know what you go black you never go
back to colored cables that is now they
give you nine PCI Express cables nine
cables is more than enough for you to be
able to do a quad or four-way SLI now
let's go ahead and go to the class real
quick guys because I get asked an awful
lot about quad versus four-way and what
the difference is and I figure will just
kind of throw that into this video real
quickly Quad SLI is when you take two
dual GPU cards like the Titans it Quad
SLI is when you take two dual GPU video
cards like the AMD R
ix 295x2 and you put two of them in a
single system that is a Quad SLI
four-way SLI is when you take four
single GPU cards and you run them an SLI
config that is a four-way SLI so I will
be going 3-way SLI when I put my third
GTX 780 in skunkworks
when I go to the x99 extreme processor
platform refresh a little bit later on
so I will be going with a 3-way not a
tri sli guys it's not not tri us-ally
3-way yeah thing is going to be getting
a little freaky-deaky in my system if
you will all right moving on moving on
so you get all of these cables with it
and the cool part about these cables is
not only does it have all black you know
sleeve cables that come with it but if
you fancy yourself wanting some color
you can actually pick up one of EVGA x'
color cable kits like I did with my
review of the thousand watt had the red
ones here and they all share the exact
same modular cables so they are
compatible with any of these supernovae
power supplies that are fully modular
like this so that is really cool I don't
have to worry about compatibility issues
later on if I decide to upgrade to maybe
a titanium version of this if one comes
out later I just have a plug and plug
the new one in all the cables stay
intact that is a great feature
I like when companies incorporate
cross-platform compatibility with their
accessories that's a huge deal if they
were to change their proprietary plugs
or their modular plugs every refresh
then if you had custom cables and that
would just be a turn-off it would make
you pretty upset alright so moving on
guys I'm going to be referencing Johnny
gurus full in-depth load testing of this
power supply as a guide for what I'm
about to tell you guys I highly highly
recommend you guys all open the
description go to his review and read it
it's funny and it's very very
educational it will actually teach you
guys a lot about power supplies but
we're going to talk about some of the
high level stuff here in this overview
because I'm not load testing it so I can
actually speak from any first-hand
experience moving on to power delivery
this thing does feature some pretty
impressive power delivery here in fact
the
volt and 3.3 volt rails can both deliver
24 amps up to 120 watts of power and the
single 12 volt rail can actually supply
133 point 3 amps of power now some power
supplies will actually have multiple
12-volt rails in there where the amps
are divided and that actually leads to
an issue when you go with very power
hungry graphics cards especially if
you're going with SLI configs it's much
better to have a nice beefy powerful
single 12 volt rail across the entire
power supply and that's exactly what
they've done here highly highly
recommended max output on the 12 volt
rail 100 or 1/100 150 watts guys right
here you heard it first now fifteen
hundred and ninety nine point six watts
yeah it's delivering the power baby now
the impressive part about that is the
fact that it's able to do it while
maintaining 50 degrees Celsius
temperature and that's because of the
massive 140 millimeter intake fan and
very the components inside are arranged
in such a way so it has very good
airflow now it's actually a very quiet
power supply as well because it is PWM
load controlled fan and the fan will
only ramp up if they load on the CPU
increases as well so it keeps things
nice and cool there's no software with
this power supply the old 1500 Nova
super nova version of the power supply
used to actually contain a built in
software that you could use but I like
letting the power supply take control of
itself that's just the way I've always
felt so I've never bought into the whole
you know software controlled power
supplies but that's just me
now when it comes to power efficiency
curve if you take a look at Johnny gurus
in-depth load testing review please go
check it out do yourself a favor you'll
see that this thing was actually
maintaining a very impressive power
efficiency curve in fact bumping its
head up against platinum during that
test was actually pretty damn impressive
and he said that when you take into
account the margin of error of the
testing equipment it very well could
have passed platinum standards if EVGA
wanted to be a little less conservative
but EVGA chose to put a gold rating on
here instead of a platinum rating
because they'd rather under-promise and
over-deliver rather than vice versa that
would make for a very angry situation
now why would you want to go
with a massive power supply like this J
you're not going to be using 1600 watts
of power even with 3-way SLI and an ex
99 8 core overclock you're not going to
income anywhere near that and you're
right I'm probably going to top out
somewhere between a thousand to 1100
watts a total system draw including the
water cooling the light fans the 3-way
SLI and all of that now the reason for
that is if you take a look at his
testing you'll see that a 50 percent
load at 800 watts drawn from the power
supply he was actually maintaining in
91.8% efficiency that is pretty damn
cool and once you take into account that
I'll be running right around 1,000 to
1,100 watts
I'm still going to be maintaining over
90% efficient that's what I'm after and
the reason for that is because as I
mentioned earlier the efficiency curve
of the power supply if you can keep it
in its max efficiency range based on
your power draw then you actually get
the benefits of a cooler power supply
longer life less noise and you're going
to get a little bit money saved on your
power bill now I did a video before
where I talked about power bill but guys
when you're talking about a thousand
watts the amount of power that you save
by drawing a hundred to 150 watts less
from the wall at any given time is
actually beneficial over the life of
your computer now we'll get more in the
depth of that later in another video
video where we talk about power supplies
and how to pick the right size why you
should over size how much you should
over size etc so we'll talk about that
an entirely separate video but if you
want to know more about this power
supply I highly recommend you head over
to Johnnie gurus video or actually it's
a written review it's not long it's fun
to read he's a very good writer he
doesn't even know me
I'm just pointed out because I think
it's a great resource to learn not only
about this power supply but all power
supplies so guys I'm going to get the
hell on out of here because I've got a
well we got to see a man about a wallaby
to be quite honest sorry for the graphic
details not really alright guys hope to
see on Twitter and some social media and
stuff and if you've just stumbled across
my channel I hope you stick around maybe
you can learn something maybe you can
even teach me a thing or two as always
guys I will see you in
next one unless that next one happens to
be another version of this video because
I somehow dumped and I have to do it for
a fifth time which wouldn't be
surprising in fact during the editing of
this video the battery died which is
funny because it was fully charged so
I've got a bad battery my second battery
is actually bad on top of all of this
that's really annoying</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
