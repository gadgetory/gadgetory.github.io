just to give you a little warning this
video is a little different than the
type of content you used to seeing here
I have two passions in this world
technology and Motorsports and when I
had the opportunity to go up to an
advanced rally school up in Snoqualmie
Washington at a place called dirtfish
rally I was not going to turn that down
so anyway a huge thanks to my friend
Barney Cleese nerdgasm for setting this
up and of course thank you to Volare
media imaging in flight and jasper
newton media otherwise this production
would not have been possible so if
you're not into cars I don't know why
the heck you even clicked on this video
but regardless guys enjoy and we will be
back to our regularly scheduled
technology stuff coming up but for now
enjoy one of my other passions wait what
you doing J I'm just saying that Gerry
Berg is going down
well guys here we are we're finally up I
will say down up here in Washington
where we are at dirtfish rally school
this guy's idea which is fine I'm okay
with him inviting me up here to
embarrass him on the track here so we're
here at a one-day advanced driving
school to learn how to drive these BR
Z's on this loose surface which is
foreign to me but I think we could have
a good time what do you think how do you
think it's gonna go I'm gonna kick your
ass
really did you know I'm an osmotic
filters out you said where they are they
are got a good tune on the v8 the LS
ones purring like a kitten that's okay
cuz more powers are gonna hurt you out
there that's what they said in class I
might be screwed alright guys well
anyway enough talking let's just start
driving some cars yeah
I'll be honest that was harder than I
thought it was gonna be kind of went out
in the first the first run did decent
let me introduce some brake and then
everything just kind of fell apart for
me but it started really come together I
think what I'm not used to especially
with that and I'm used to pavement is
what you do with the gas pedal and the
steering wheel is totally different on
the dirt but it's also kind of scary too
because it's higher speed there's trees
on either side of you you're pointing to
those trees and you your brain is
telling you I'm pointing up those trees
I'm gonna hit those trees but physics
take over and say no the car is we're in
the rotate and do what it wants to do
right
all right so this you know I came in
this without any sort of expectation and
I think that was kind of the right thing
to do
I also learned how much I really don't
know about driving on a loose surface
but it was a lot of fun and by the end
of the day it really started coming
together still a lot of things to have
to unlearn and it's it's it's a
discipline thing I'm disciplined in a
different type of driving style that
some of it works here and some doesn't
but I think that's the fun of it because
I believe it or not I was actually
starting a little bit bored with
pavement and this makes me kind of want
to go out and build a car that I can
take out and romp in the desert and
whatever else and actually know how to
turn the damn thing but I highly
recommend if you guys have ever wondered
what it's like to get into an actual
rally car go out there and just well
kill some cones like I did definitely
check out dirtfish rally school up here
in Snoqualmie Washington
I couldn't highly I couldn't recommend
this any more in fact I'm at a loss for
words because I've been just having so
much fun I'm already thinking about how
I'm gonna get back up here
thanks for to Jerry for setting this all
up and I highly recommend you get your
butt out here now I'm sure Jerry's
behind me doing something and I don't
even care
he needs the exposure you need it you
need the help before you do you dancing
back there take away his power
the day blow
