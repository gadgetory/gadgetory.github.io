cents it's summertime it's hot and I
promise you guys videos on how to keep
things nice and cool now the computer we
have behind us might look a little bit
familiar this is actually my old switch
810 case and we have transplanted all of
coconut monkeys computer parts over
there and look at this awesome cable
management whoo who built this computer
I wonder who built this computer like I
said it is really hot where we live in
fact today it was actually kind of cool
it was only in the upper 90s yeah was
only in the upper 90s but we're looking
at 110 degree temperatures coming did
you know that this weekend 110
yeah so we need to keep this thing cool
now this is what he's been using hand me
that Hemi that over there would you now
his i7 this is an X 58 platform it's a
960 i7 yeah it's prior to the Sandy
Bridge series and it gets really freakin
hot now this is the cooler that came
with it it it's just a dinky little 120
millimeter cooler and without an
overclock or any overbuilt here take it
it burns without any overclocks or
anything on this thing he was still
getting up into the upper 80s lower 90s
on temperature way too freakin hot so I
decided you know what why don't we go
ahead and do a cooling video where I
throw in this bad boy right here this is
an alpha cool complete water cooling kit
they have a whole bunch of different
kits and this is one of their upper end
models and I figured why don't we go
ahead and pull out all the stuff so this
one is one of their premium kits now why
am i doing a kit review you guys are
constantly asking me for parts that I
recommend in your water cooling loops
you guys want to do custom loops but you
don't know what parts to buy it gets
really confusing if you've shopped on
aqua tunings website or you've checked
out
frozen CPU or any of those other
retailers you guys know there are a
metric crap ton of parts and it gets
very confusing now unless you're doing
some sort of a super custom build like I
did for red mist or like I tend to do
for myself or you've been doing this for
a long time and you just know parts
compatibility
because you've done it so much I don't
actually recommend that you guys piece
together your own loops because kits
like this are available now this is a
custom loop in a box this is not
downgraded parts that they just kind of
put into it into a kit this alpha' cool
has a whole range of kits as I mentioned
that go from the lower end to the upper
end this happens to be on the upper end
spectrum but these are hand-picked parts
put in a box the exact same part so if
you bought them individually through the
retailer they're the exact same
packaging inside they just put all of
the guesswork or they take all of the
guesswork out of it and put it in here
for you so that's why we're taking a
look at one of these kits now we're
going to go ahead and unbox this we're
going to put it in his system and we're
going to see how the temperatures
perform now the cool thing about these
kits is as I mentioned they have
everything including the little adapter
you need to plug into your power supply
unit to jumper it and bleed your system
because that's actually the part people
seem to have the most trouble with is
figuring figuring out how to bleed their
system now when you open the box you can
see you're greeted with a bunch more
packaging in there imagine that like I
said guys this thing is completely
custom loop in a box
now reservoirs this is a square box
obviously we're not going with a tubular
how do you do that
oh yeah turbulence
we are going with a bae res now ebay res
basically does just that
it sits back here in the bay the cool
thing about that is typically at least
with the output cool kits they have an
integrated pump mount in the back so the
d5 pump which is in my opinion one of
the best pumps you can get on the market
it's a Lange pump it's actually an
industrial pump basically mated to work
for PCs it's going to mount right here
in the back so you know you have to
think about the loop order the most
important loop border which is pump and
res is a singular combo so this thing's
got the little screw mounts on the side
it just slides right into the reservoir
and in fact he'll be able to see all the
fluid and stuff from the front he can
even put an LED bar right here on the
top and light up his reservoir if he
wanted there's an indentation there it's
filtered it's got flow control in there
it's actually a like a little I know how
you describe that basically like an anti
turbulent fitting on each the intake and
the outtake and they this is actually
the upgraded version the old
had the it was like a copper looking
decal guy go this way there's like a
copper looking decal on there and a
copper fitting here but they've made
these black and blue to match the output
cool theme I think that looks an awful
lot better so that's the reservoir that
comes in there the it even comes with
the fluid which is important - it comes
with an entire leader of their CKC cape
Kelvin catcher I don't really know what
that means
to be honest I think they might have to
rethink the name of the fluid basically
guys this is just an ultra enhanced and
tight corrosive antimicrobial fluid it's
pre-mixed you have to add anything to it
you can't add color to this if you want
in fact we might do that I don't know
we'll see so it's already pre-mixed and
ready to go for you this is the pump
right here as I mentioned it's just a
plain old d5 variable speed so we can
control the speed on there this is
essentially the exact same thing that I
replaced on the red mist build when we
had the pump go bad and they sent me the
replacement pump this is pretty much
what they send you Ek Swift tech alpha
cool XSP see anything that's labeled d5
it's just a rebranded Lang pump so
they're all exactly the same our CPU
block we are using the nexxus cooler
here it's essentially the same thing
that is in my computer behind me only
this is the acetal version not to be
confused with the asshole version um so
it's kind of stretched jokes there it is
a copper base solid copper base and then
it's nice and light though because it's
not the brass top which mine is has all
the mounting hardware everything you
need no guesswork set that right over
there now tube this is a 3/8 inch tubing
here so it's not 1/2 inch tubing but
there's I just want to put a myth to
rest real quick there's absolutely no
difference whatsoever between 3/8 tubing
and 1/2 inch tubing when it comes to
cooling capacity in fact you wanting a
technical the acrylic bit tubing that I
put in red mist is even smaller than
this so yeah this has already come this
already comes a 10-foot length I believe
there you go so what else do we get in
the box here oh yeah fittings you got to
have your fittings these are already all
picked out for you they are compression
fittings they are not Barb's these
happen to be kind of a dust black the
fittings are already there compression
Tunisia
dealing with Barb's and clamps
piece-of-crap of course you have to have
your fans so they come with three and
this is the cool part you guys know that
these are not cheap fans these are the
nbe loops now you guys may think these
look an awful light a lot like the noise
blockers and some of you guys might even
be going oh those are just noise blocker
ripoffs well guess what
alpha cool was actually the one that
designed this fan in conjunction with
noise blocker so the exact same fan with
the exact same rubber styling that we
all love about the noise blocker fans
only there in blue because alpha cools
blue and they are 1,200 rpm fans great
static pressure that's why they include
them in the kit I highly highly
recommend them as I mentioned earlier we
have our little jumper here this is just
a piece that goes on the end of your 24
pin for the power supply you plug that
in and when you turn on your power
supply switch or you plug it into the
wall this will send power to your pump
so you can bleed your system without
turning on anything else new system this
is only a few bucks but this is
invaluable when you do this sort of
thing definitely pick one of these up if
you're looking at doing a custom build
for yourself or custom looping you don't
have one of those now
the radiator as I mentioned earlier this
is one of their upgraded kits so this is
a 360 millimetre radiator but it is also
a 60 millimeter thick radiator so this
is one of the reasons why we converted
coconut monkeys case over to the NZXT
because look at the thickness of this
thing that's what she said
say it say yes look at that 60
millimeters thick by 360 millimeters 10
fins per inch you can see right through
the thing
multiple port outputs on there so you
can pretty much set this up anywhere you
need but I just want to point out I'm
going to have to remove this little side
panel right here this is going to go
right up in there like that and it's
barely going to fit in fact we're going
to have to put the fans up in the top
part in that little cubby because
there's no way these would fit without
hitting the motherboard with the fans on
there so it's gonna be kind of stealth
up in there a little bit it's going to
be a nice clean look and you know you
have to admit the Alpha cool radiators
these are just gorgeous don't you think
I mean look at this but if this radiator
is not big enough for you well maybe you
just like to get yourself one of these
bad boys maybe go with a 560 yeah
yeah now this is actually my radiator
for skunkworks coming up so here go
ahead and hold on just yeah I you
thought was gonna throw it did she I got
him you should see yeah so yeah that's
everything in the box of course it does
have some instructions on there it's
really really simple guys there's only a
couple of connections you know hook the
reservoir to the pump or the reservoir
to the CPU CPU to the radiator radiator
back to the reservoir it's really simple
we're I'm going to go ahead and maybe
time-lapses build I'm not going to do a
how-to because it's so basic in fact
I've got other videos you guys need to
check out like somewhere maybe there and
there on the screen go check those
videos out but we're gonna go ahead and
install this thing fire it up we're
going to see what the temperatures look
like while we check out this alpha cool
custom loop in a box so don't go
anywhere I meant to hit the monitor the
lens and I completely missed handed to
me I'm going to I'm going to reset
member
member
alright guys so it comes to installing
the Alpha cool all-in-one kit it's
pretty straightforward I mean the
compression fittings are easy to use you
just screw them in and make sure they're
nice and tight don't use a wrench on
them because you might actually destroy
the threads on the plastic parts but
screw down the compression may give you
plenty of hose I mean the hose be
plentiful and that joke was bad blend
coconut monkeys when it gave it to me
and as you can see we only use we
actually use less than half of what we
needed because it's such a small run as
you can see I mean it's just from the
reservoir to the radiator to the CPU
block and back when it comes to cooling
it sure as hell destroys this I mean if
you remember from the other video we
were getting 90 we were hitting about 90
degrees Celsius with this thing under
load yeah right now we're running we've
been running prime95 now for 20 minutes
the cpu coolant is pretty much equalized
and we're sitting at low 70s high 60s
with an overclocked by the way this
thing's at almost 4 gigahertz with an
overclock I have no idea what the
voltage is I'm not a monitoring voltage
I'm just letting it Auto volt which you
know is typically a bit higher and the
other temperatures that you saw before
were with no overclock whatsoever now
there are some things I don't like about
this kit I love the design of the bay
reservoir but it has got the stupidest
filling mechanism I have ever seen I
just got to say the mechanism has a
nipple that pulls out it has a little
hole in it that you've got to try and
finagle the coolant through that's too
small for any funnel to fit so we
actually had to like finagle a like a
cake icing thing that you squeeze like
the tip off of that into the hole and a
funnel into that and then coconut monkey
had to hold that while I filled it with
the bottle and even though the bottle
has like a little nipple and squirter
thing it doesn't fit down in that hole
it's too small so most of these Bay
reservoirs that you see on the market
have a fitting on the top that you pull
out slightly unscrewed you put a funnel
right in the top this mechanism on here
it's got to go I mean it looks nice the
the bay reservoir on this looks
fantastic but the filling mechanism on
it it's just I don't know what they were
thinking
you can't possibly fill it higher than
75% now considering 75% on this is above
the import the intake port for the pump
it's not going to be a problem it's just
why even labeled 100% that is about 10mm
meters higher than the actual fill port
I mean the physically that's not
possible the other problem we had is
because this is one of the massive
massive 60 mil rads
we actually use the entire bottle of
coolant and it still wasn't full I had
to actually thin it out some with
distilled water now the still water
added to this it's not going to be a
problem to the coolant I mean the cool
it has some anti corrosive and
antimicrobial stuff built into it but I
don't think I don't believe it's going
to be a problem and if you're looking at
getting one of the bigger kids like the
480 rad that they sell you're going to
have to get another exhilarate Alif
coolant that that's just not enough one
liter is not enough for systems this
size I mean the bae res is pretty big
with a big rad it's just not enough
those are really the only complaints I
had about the system other than that the
system is straightforward it's easy to
install and I really don't have any
other complaints about it I mean it's
keeping the temperatures perfect on this
thing if I go ahead and stop the stress
test which has been running for like I
said 22 minutes now our temperatures
drop right back down into the 40s in
fact once the coolant equalizes it'll be
down to the 30s and this is a closed off
room right now there is no air flow in
or out of this room and it was actually
sitting in the mid to low 60s when we
started the test so the temperatures
actually rose as the temperature in the
room goes up it's one of the things
about water cooling they go up in a
one-to-one ratio if your temperature in
the room Rises 5 degrees temperature new
computers are going to rise 5 degrees if
your water cooling that's pretty much
how it goes so guys this has been the
Alpha cool all-in-one kit they've got a
bunch of different sizes from
120-millimeter all the way up to 480 ml
different size thicknesses of radiator
different pump styles even read
different reservoir styles so guys make
