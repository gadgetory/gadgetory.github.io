weeks ago showing trying to recover some
data off this and whatever I mentioned
this was my brother-in-law's computer
and I said sister at one point some of
you guys were confused for multiple
reasons one I kept I said brother and I
said sister and I said brother let's be
clear this is my brother-in-law's
computer my sister was the one talking
to me about it so now that that's
clarified there were a couple of things
that I heard quite often in that video
and that's one J why didn't you replace
the hard drive with an SSD I mean you
got plenty of them well my mindset has
always been you know it's it's just an
internet browsing machine it doesn't
play games or anything so why do we need
an SSD and then I got to thinking about
it and like yeah it probably needs an
SSD because it's pretty quick and easy
way to upgrade a computer especially one
that's as old as this from 2010 I think
it was 11 it's old it's very very old
she doesn't know it doesn't matter it's
old the other thing was J why don't you
clean it that thing is filthy fine I'm
doing this cuz I want to not cuz you
guys told me to do you want to be cooler
you want to be more desirable well
you're in luck because right now you can
own your very own J's two cents swag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below now admittedly this is
not really new content in fact I have a
video that's quite old that is the
quickest and easiest way to upgrade your
computer or at least make it feel faster
but the hardware I used at that time
wasn't really all that old it just was
newer hardware kind of being bottlenecks
by slow io of the drive so this is a
pretty good test here where we can see
how things like Windows 10 on hardware
that is well before Windows 10 release
this was Windows 7 when it came out and
it's a Pentium dual core without hyper
threading and we're gonna kind of do a
comparison here this has a fresh Windows
install with the fresh hard drive at the
fresh super fresh it's a fresh hard
drive that I installed in this and then
gonna take an SSD in fact I have you try
to think about like what I want to use
for that and oh well drought even had
that we there we go
so we're gonna put in here a Samsung Evo
850 SSD and we're gonna compare what
load times and stuff for likes we're
gonna we're gonna show you how even on
old hardware by simply updating the
drive can make it feel new fast and
exciting kinda like a new relationship
so it's not gonna wear out after a week
and for all you salty folks out there
this is the novelty thread Ripper CPU
doesn't actually work all right we need
to do a boot test here and this is a
pretty standard install there's no
programs on this yet in fact this is
latest Windows 10 1803 created to update
unfortunately with all the updates and
it has no bloatware on it whatsoever so
we need to do a boot test to compare how
much we have actually improved there's
definitely gonna be a jump cut on this
because I'm not gonna you guys sit here
and watch for five minutes while this
boots
so here we go you ready a count of three
one two three
alright so it was 1 minute and 30
seconds when I stopped the timer that's
actually not terrible I expected worse
because it's just a dual-core and stuff
but to be fair the icons hadn't finished
loading on the bottom it's probably more
like a minute 40 but yeah so in terms of
just response times here's Microsoft
edge something no one should ever use
I've already clicked it you see how long
it's taking for to pop up white window
so thinking oh we're getting some
activity there let's just say right now
it's a long time alright so about the
Microsoft Store another thing no one
should ever go to but it's there it's
kinda hard to tell what no now here's
the thing about slow i/o and a hard
drive like this a lot of times people
will confuse this sluggishness of roblox
comes up immediately that's funny people
will kind of confuse the sluggishness
sluggishness that i think that's a word
the sluggish Mis
of a computer and just assumed
automatically I need more RAM
I need more CPU my hardware is old and
that's not always the case the CPU is
waiting for information to be sent to it
right if it's calling for information
and then the hard drives oh yeah let me
get that for you and it's like mm-hmm
where did I put that where did I put
that file ah there it is I'm gonna use
that file in awhile there you go and it
hands it over to the memory and then the
memory gives it to the CPU well that you
could perceive the slowness as being
memory and CPU when actually they're
waiting even an old piece of hardware
like this is waiting on the platter to
spin and the needle to suit to seek and
to find where that block of data is now
this is a 7200 rpm Drive that I
installed where they initially had a
5400 rpm and the RPM at which the
splatter is this splatter no this got
the splatter the RPM at which the
platter is spinning the faster its
spinning the faster it can actually find
that data and so the slower rpm with a
lesser cache and less of your more
recent files or cache are being stored
to be called up and accessed faster it's
just terrible versus an SSD whereas an
SSD a solid state the information is
always there ready to be accessed and so
it's not having to seek and look for
that with a piece of spinning Hardware
so that's why SSDs are something I
always recommend even in my budget
builds so now what happens when you take
an old piece of machinery like this and
you throw in a nice new what what what
body organ do you think this would be
fill your heart no your brains the CPU
your brain is also the memory - but
different parts of your brain right okay
everything's the brain fine we'll go
with that everything's the brain
one last thing worth considering though
when it comes to installing an SSD on a
mobile piece of hardware like this is
this drive could have failed because it
could have gotten shocked it could have
gotten dropped they might have been a
little rough on it obviously the chassis
has cracked we showed you that in the
last video and if you've got a piece of
delicate machinery spinning around and
although it does have shock absorption
built into it can only handle so much
that drive could have failed because of
accidental damage due to physical abuse
the solid-state drives are much much
less susceptible to that of course they
are not impervious to shock abuse but
they
much much more resilient alright let's
go ahead and swap out the drive and
compare now unlike my last video I
actually remember to take this one apart
there's you know back back in the day
Dell thought about this and easy
accessibility for hard drive access you
know they actually take the whole thing
but a lot of you guys commented on how
dumb I wasn't I took that apart yeah I
know I know
so you simply slide out the tray you
undo the screws that are holding it down
right here on the side slide this off
orient this in the same direction put
the two screws back in slide back in
your computer put the screw in it both
normally those two screws but I lost one
in the computer as well as my brain
that's okay so we're gonna have to
reinstall windows on this because what I
could have done is simply clone the
drive but I didn't want to do that
because we also took this opportunity or
at least Phil took the opportunity under
my delegation so really my I did the
work um we decided to go ahead up Dre
update our install media so now we can
actually install Windows we go straight
to 1803 with minor updates needed after
that because you know we might have to
be testing some hardware here in the
very near future that is gonna require
us to want to have test benches good go
and so we are gonna save a lot of time
doing that so what we do now is we
actually need to test where's my phone
we need to test the new boot time on
this which obviously is going to be
significantly faster so one minute and
thirty seconds where we stopped the
counter before I stopped it a little
prematurely and it was probably more
like 140 once all the icons it's loaded
so three two one go it's funny to would
actually noticed the BIOS even loads
faster I guess because of how quick the
device communicates with it now but this
is what I'm talking about right here
this is the it's trying to boot off of
the LAN and obviously there's nothing
there so it's just sitting there pinging
the network that's not even existing and
now it sees that there is no media test
or media failure that's a media failure
test media failure yeah that and now
we're into Windows so here we are now at
29 seconds 30
anything's up so I think I stopped that
about a second late Phil can actually
put the correct time on there but it's
me about 38 seconds 39 seconds so
approximately a minute time reduction on
just the boot now what about things like
we would pop up over here edge remember
out edge took a second to do anything I
get to double click and don't you J look
how much faster that is already
significantly faster here's the AppStore
obviously much much faster so what can
you take away from this video well you
know what often times people think like
I've said unarmed repeating myself but
this is an important message here
brought to you by PBS the storage device
is what was holding up the rest of the
hardware so had you gone out and bought
let's say this was a desktop had you
gone out and bought a new processor and
a new motherboard a new memory and had
the same hard drive you would have a
very similar experience to what you had
before and then today you left going why
is my computer so slow and people often
forget that the speed of your hard drive
is kind of the first line of defense in
terms of speed of your computer load
times on games obviously your OS load
time so if your system is having to wait
for your hard drive to be available for
the rest of the tasks that your OS is
asking of it well obviously you can see
how a simple install of an SSD for as
low as below $100 you could buy a 250
gig SSD for under $100 like around 65 70
bucks now and you can actually take a
nine year old piece of hardware like
this and speed it up to where we
basically feel like we're on a modern
piece of equipment that is just like a
budget based PC all right guys we're
gonna go if you've got any suggestions
on topics that you think we should do
make sure you let us know either in the
comments below or over on Twitter if you
guys see a suggestion that you like make
sure you thumb up it so it goes up
towards the top of the comments and we
can actually see it thanks for watching
guys and as always we'll see you in the
next one
no one might nut mmmm-mmm
so when I was doing this video I had
