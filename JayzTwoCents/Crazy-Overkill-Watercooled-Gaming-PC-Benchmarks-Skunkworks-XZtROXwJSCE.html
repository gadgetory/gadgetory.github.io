this is actually take two of this intro
so I've already started taking some of
the parts off unfortunately I'm a noob
and I didn't check the audio levels you
can't use air flow fins because you will
get any if the Chiellini you scope works
is more than just and over-the-top
extremely expensive stupidly
ridiculously overkill PC it's an
accumulation of things that I've
collected on this channel as a channels
grown I continue to build on and build
up skunkworks because it's more like a
centerpiece oh but I kind of consider an
accomplishment with the channel
okay so there's the new pump and Reza's
put into place so I can start getting
some of the tubing routed
the built-in rez and water pump mounting
locations improved air flow and massive
radiator support make the define s from
fractal design the obvious choice for
water cooling enthusiasts the S doesn't
stand for sexy but it should
now to say that skunk works as anything
other than complete overkill kind of a
physically manifested example of how to
waste money would be a complete lie but
you know what that's what kind of makes
a system like this so much fun now you
guys have been asking for this video for
a long time wanting to know where all
the benchmarks and stuff were one of the
reasons why it took so long was I ended
up having a Samsung 840 drive failure
which was my main drive now I don't keep
anything important on this drive other
than the operating system and a few
documents and things which are backed up
anyway but I ended up having to get
everything back up and running again
redo all my graphics card over clocks
and things and so as we made it take a
little bit longer than I wanted it to
before we get into the benchmarks let's
go ahead and fill in those people who
may not have seen the previous versions
of or the previous video showing the
building of this system this is actually
the system in technically its fourth
iteration but we're calling it v3 kind
of kind of going an apple route here
we're like the sixth iPhone really was
like the seventh generation or something
like that it started off as pretty much
just a 900 D with a single 780 in it and
a 3770k and as the channel grew I
continued to put bigger and better parts
in it had to 70 80 s and then we went
over to a case labs case and then we
went over to what we stayed at the 3770k
and then we went z97 with a 4790k
overclock that and then we put in a
third 7080 and then we went to X 99 with
783 780 s then we went to X 99 59 60 X
with 3 980 s and now here we are with
three Titan X's now some people have
asked why I don't put in a fourth card
and I think the benchmarks are going to
show why I don't put in a fourth card
but we'll talk about that a little bit
more in the end in terms of monitors I
have two vg2 for 8qe 1080p 24-inch
panels
flanking my 27-inch blue is 27 inch Acer
or asus rog swift and then on top of
that I have the Acer xB 280 HK which is
the 4k IPS one millisecond g-sync panel
and the Swift is also g-sync now the
monitor setup is kind of a mixed bag of
a bunch of different things really the
reason why it's set up like this
as I'm testing out a lot of different
monitors I needed a 4k panel hooked up
to this machine so I could do 4k plus I
wanted the IPS so that I could start
getting better color rendering and
better color accuracy when I do these
videos so I'm leaving the ACE or up top
which is kind of funny it's the biggest
monitor and it's up top but what's even
funnier is when you think about the
resolution layout especially when you
look at the desktop you know screen
resolution map it's funny where the top
panel is like nearly as big as all three
on the sides it's it's just really
strange configuration on here I
definitely wouldn't recommend this
especially when you're trying to switch
back and forth between 4k panel and
1080p panel or 1440p panel to do your
benchmarks I like to use rate of
resolution testing for that even though
it really doesn't make any difference
ultimately you can go down in res
without a problem I just like to do
native resolution call me weird plenty
people do but that's the way that I do
it but the current specs of skunkworks
can be found down in the description
below and then you guys can stop asking
you how much it cost or this or that
every single piece down to freakin nuts
and bolts are down there so you guys can
see the total cost and it's always
fluctuating with current market pricing
so you can always see what the current
value of skunkworks is now for
peripherals here on my set up I am using
the Corsair k70 RGB keyboard and we are
using the Coolermaster CM storm reaper
mouse by far my favorite mouse to date
still it's just weighted perfectly it's
got no extra frills no extra buttons
just two thumb buttons and everything
about it is perfect as far as I'm
concerned and then the matte here I
could ask about this all the time the
gaming Matt is an Oris gaming mat it's a
thunder pad I think they call it thunder
mat something like that and I just like
it cuz it keeps my desk protected and I
can clean it literally it gets filthy
and then you can just spray on like
glass cleaner and wipe it down and it
becomes perfectly clean for cooling
inside of skunkworks we have the three
Titan X's and a parallel config it's
amazing how many people tell me this
config won't work but it isn't a
parallel config and if you guys look at
this video right here you guys can
actually see the way that the fluid
enters the bottom card and then it goes
up into the second card
before it comes out of the second card
is coming back out of the first card
then it goes up into the third card
comes out of the second card before it
comes out of the third card so that just
goes to show it is filling up each block
independently and all those people who
say this won't work because it will just
bypass the first card in the second card
clearly have absolutely no idea how
Thermal physics and thermodynamics work
it's always going to look for the path
of least resistance and as soon as there
is the block filling it's going to go
into the next block and then the next
block and then it's going to equally
divide the flow amongst all three blocks
so that you have equal flow in and equal
flow out I don't know why that is so
hard people to understand but parallel
config' it's easier on the pump it's
less back pressure and really
temperatures are not don't suffer at all
but anyway I digress it although off
track but the amount of people that say
stupid stuff like that for cooling those
three Boheme a--the Titan X's we do have
three EK full cover water blocks as whoa
nickel plated with the acetal cover
which is the black cover and then their
back plates for those and then we do
have two radiators cooling those a GTS
nemesis by hardware labs the black ice
nemesis 560 red which is for one hundred
and forty millimeter fans and add an
additional two eighty on the back of the
system which is giving us a complete six
times 140 millimeter worth of radiators
cooling those now they still get a
little bit warm up into the 50s and
which is still warmer than I'd like them
to be but hey I digress considering
these graphics cards can get up to 90
degrees Celsius on reference coolers at
times depending on the load and putting
them under 4k load definitely stresses
them out the 59 60 X is being cooled by
a single black ice nemesis GTS 480 and
it's obviously overkill for that all PE
TG croolik tubing by primo chill and
then e 2 EK reservoirs with d5
integrated pumps as you can see right
there in the top part of the case and we
did redo the entire cooling loop for
this build but anyway that's enough
about that if you guys want know more
about the building of this you're going
to have to go back and watch part 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 of the build lugs and you guys
can you see more about how the system
came together anyway guys let's go ahead
and take a look at the benchmark and see
how it did on gaming
you
now I've talked about bottlenecks and
I've talked about how I don't like the
word bottleneck not because it doesn't
exist but because people overuse it and
then don't really understand what a
bottleneck is a bottleneck is a limiting
factor in your system it is one
component that affects the performance
of another because it cannot keep up
with the higher performing part for
instance in this case clearly 1080p and
this system are just absolutely stupid
as you can see in many of these
benchmarks 1080p was pretty much the
same FPS as 1440p it just goes to show
even if you're using 1080p 144 hertz
panel 3 titan nexus is beyond
bottlenecking
even for a 59 60 X that's the same
reason why if you look at the fire
strike normal score 30 it was 30,000 and
some change it is pretty much only a
thousand points higher than my 3 980 s
were the reason for that being is the 3
980 s were pretty damn near bottlenecked
by the 59 60 X and the Titan X's are
obviously being bottlenecked by the
Titan Nexus so my limiting factor in
this blue tur not is my 59 60 X which is
just absolutely insane now in order to
alleviate that bottleneck I would have
to overclock the 59 60 X farther
unfortunately my chip just will not do
anything higher than 4.5 gigahertz and
to keep it 100% 24/7 stable I bring that
down to 4.4 gigahertz that way doesn't
get too too hot
1.3 to 5 volts is what it takes though
Aven for me to get 4.4 which is kind of
disappointing because so many people out
there have achieved 4.4 on like 1.2 7
volts and lowered x' just I don't have a
very good overclocking chip so that's
why when I tweeted out that I had a
fourth tight necks sitting right here
yeah guys not just a cooler there's the
card I was debating I'm putting it in
skunk works just so I could have that
extreme completely overkill massive like
I've got four Titan X's and my e-peen is
huge because my regular peen is well
anyway uh yeah this would only further
exacerbate notice I said exacerbate
hear me clearly folks this would only
further my bottleneck and would gain me
absolutely nothing even in 1440p I don't
like gaming on 4k I like high refresh
rate panels 4k is still finicky in some
games and some applications I just I
don't like the scaling of the UI 4k is
not my thing
I'm perfectly fine with 1440p especially
high refresh rates and gsync so anyway
but as you could see even with 4k the
three Titan X's were I mean we're just
demolishing games in 4k way above the
refresh rate of the panel of course some
of these games you know I think it was
project cars 118 or somewhere there
abouts fps the screen was Karen all over
the place I mean the screen was it it
looked like shutters that just
completely pulled apart because the
screen could not even come near keeping
up with the frame rates of the three
tight nexus which the nice thing is once
you turn on vsync g-sync
or g-sync or any sort of a sync
technology then the graphics cards come
down from there 100% load and then when
ends up happening is you run cooler
because the graphics cards aren't
running as hard but what I did notice is
some of these games even at 1080p the
graphics cards were only running in 40
or 50 percent utilization with one of
the cards ramping all the way down to
back to its stock 1 gigahertz clock and
completely ignoring my overclock that's
simply because the game could not
utilize the cards because of the
bottleneck so they had to do something
which was just kind of sit there
twiddling their thumbs until the CPU is
ready to process what they were sending
their way it's not the only benchmark we
did we do have 32 gigabytes of ddr4
running at 2666 and obviously this
system spends more time rendering videos
like this one than it does playing games
so I went ahead and rendered out my what
video was that oh yeah my Sennheiser RS
175 wireless headphone video I went
ahead and rendered that one twice and
we'll go ahead and see how long it takes
to render it is a video that is I forget
how long it is let's take a look here at
11 minutes long or tenon yeah it's 11
minutes long there about 10 minutes 53
seconds and I rendered the video at
h.264 codec for mp4 at 1080p 16 megabits
per second or MB
yes and then I rendered it upscale to 4k
at 40 megabits per second so we'll go
ahead and take a look at the time
differences and we'll see how the
rendering speed compares to real-time
speed now as you saw rendering videos
for 1080p I don't even have time to go
and take a poop nap when it comes to
rendering that I really like to save her
the time I spend on the porcelain throne
sometimes it's the only peace and quiet
I actually get but I was present but I
was pleasantly surprised but I was
really happy to see that 4k videos which
I had never rendered because I don't
have a 4k video or a video camera so
there's no point in me ever doing 4k
videos was actually able to render only
about 50% longer than the video is so
for instance it was 11 minute video and
it took I think approximately about 16
minutes to render that's fantastic for
4k especially 40 megabit and the thing
was I have all the maximum settings
maximum depth maximum quality just
everything completely maxed out in terms
of the quality of the render so that was
surprising I expected it to take quite a
bit longer than that so as you can see
the 59 60 X with 16 threads of
processing power overclocked to 4.4
gigahertz and water-cooled never got
hotter than 65 degrees Celsius and it
completely just obliterated 4k and 1080p
rendering I already knew about 1080p
I've been doing it all along but 4k this
is my first time doing it and it did a
fantastic job I mean it just completely
dominated rendering and considering it's
not a Xeon or a dual Xeon or a quad Xeon
system this is why I have no interest in
upgrading because what am I going to
gain I mean a little bit less time it's
fine for me I mean Jesus it was doing so
much better than I thought it would I
have absolutely no complaints so there
you go guys this has been the epic
conclusion to the skunkworks build blog
and you know what I probably shouldn't
even call it a conclusion it's pretty
obvious that this thing is going to end
up evolving in the future that's the
whole point of the system as the channel
grows this system grows and it's just
it's kind of hard to imagine how much
more could actually grow but damn it
certainly kinda like I said I could put
the forth tight necks in but we already
know that this is going to be just
wasted card it would be 5% of yield and
things like synthetic benchmarks which
are not all that important
to me anyway but it would actually slow
down minigames in many aspects because
some games don't even have three-way and
four-way SLI profiles or they just don't
do anything the cards just sit there so
- is still your magic number when it
comes to graphics cards and SLI configs
3 was is just fun I like three and the
fourth cards are just completely wasted
I mean they really are wasted that's why
they're not going to go in there I'm
gonna do other tests and things with
this Titan X on the benchmark it's kind
of nice to have it just floating around
being able to do different things and
benchmark it to other cards as they come
out eventually this card is going to
lose its place as top dog and I'm
interested to see what card that's going
to be I wonder if it's going to be
wearing a red label okay so there you go
guys thanks for watching let me know
what you guys think don't forget down in
the description you can find the PC port
picker link to all the parts for this
system if you guys are new to this
channel feel free to hit that subscribe
button it's entirely free and we put out
videos usually three times a week as
well as a podcast on Thursdays at five
pm called Tech Talk that's a lot of fun
it's a live podcast video podcast with
the barclays nerdgasm good friend of
mine and I love making these videos for
you guys it's an awful lot of fun
complete dream job to be able to build
these systems for you guys to look at
and don't forget we are going to be
doing some more exciting things here in
the future we still have to do parvum
benchmark I'm so behind on things that's
not in the plan so the a and B build to
do the part of benchmarks and stuff you
would think quitting my day job to do
this would have given me more time but
can somebody work on making the day's
longer for me please
all right well with that said it's time
to get the heck on out of here
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
