okay did I have any idea that YouTube
was going to be sort of a success story
for me no way absolutely not there was
no indication whatsoever that anything i
did on youtube was going to gain any
sort of attention or views and it's
definitely been fun while it's lasting
yep plus it's a way to meet chicks my
wife my wife here why did i do tech
edition have you watched any of my
videos seriously have you seen my office
have you seen the amount of crap that i
have the hell with that it's it really
is just pathetic the amount of crap that
I've accumulated technology and computer
was so I sort of figured why not just do
some sort of a show that I could be
proud of and it gives me an opportunity
to look like I have an excuse to be
surrounded with all this stuff without
it being just completely pathetic I
figured I can't be the only one that's
interested in this stuff there's got to
be at least five or six more people out
there that care about the things that I
care about so I went ahead and did the
first tech addiction and it was a
success I started getting all sorts of
comments and messages of people saying I
love this show I love the show so just
do more give me more give me more and
that's what I did why did I stop doing
tech addiction I get asked that a lot
and I've honestly lost a lot of
subscribers for people who just really
loved tech edition and that's what they
loved about my channel it was one of
those things that I feel was just way
ahead of its time it just wasn't getting
the return on investment it was one of
the hardest things I had to do on my
channel was to quit doing tech addiction
which I honestly love doing here we are
now
closing in on twelve thousand
subscribers and it hasn't even been a
year yet Jays two cents I just drop my
mouse Jay's two cents tech addiction
headquarters has not even been around
for a year and I figured it's time to
give the viewers back what it is they
want and what it is they love and when I
tweeted out that I was considering doing
tech addiction again it was like Michael
Bay just invaded my Twitter account and
did his explosions and things and for
about two hours straight my phone and my
Twitter account and my emails just
didn't stop ringing and even if I'm the
only one watching and we're gonna do it
bigger and better than ever and with
that we're gonna go ahead and get things
rolling here with tech addiction episode
who gives a crap we're back we've got
your crazy tech news it's Jays two cents
and this is technician hey guys you're
watching tech addiction it's jase two
cents and we're back and we're doing
this thing again if you ever sometimes
feel like you just forget how to do
certain things like why not holding this
bottle of water but we're back and we're
doing this same tech addiction once
again I feel extremely rusty I kind of
have no idea what's going on I'm kind of
freaking out a little bit here because
there's a lot more you watching then
there was last time and I'm a little
nervous it's kind of scary it's hot in
here oh my god we're back and we're
doing this thing and if you remember
some of the old tech addictions I had a
nasty habit of recording on Apple news
so what's ironic about that is Apple's
kind of been out of the news until
recently and that's how we're going to
start off this edition of tech edition
Tim Cook but current CEO of Apple was
recently summoned to capitol hill in
washington DC to account for its tax
practices the IRS thinks that Apple has
been just a little bit dodgy when it
comes to its tax practices because it is
currently holding 102 billion dollars
income
assets and revenue outside of the
country with all this growth and
investment to the best of our knowledge
Apple has become the largest corporate
income tax payer in America last year
our US federal cash effective tax rate
was thirty point five percent and we
paid nearly 6 billion dollars in cash to
the US Treasury we pay all the taxes we
owe every single dollar we not only
comply with the laws but we comply with
the spirit of the laws we don't depend
on tax gimmicks we don't move
intellectual property offshore and use
it to sell our products back to the
United States to avoid taxes Tim Cook
basically looked right in the face of
the United States Senate and the IRS and
said we're not breaking any laws and
we're going to keep our 102 billion
dollars outside of the country until you
start enticing us to bring some of that
money back you're probably one of the
coolest inventions I've seen in the last
decade is the 3d printer a 3d printer is
a device that is able to take strings of
plastic and melt it and form a physical
object out of it you can make statues
you can make jewelry you can make just
about anything and Americans were polled
on whether or not they felt that 3d
printers or something that they should
be allowed to own sixty-two percent of
Americans felt that they should be
allowed to own a 3d printer twenty-nine
percent felt that they should not and
nine percent were undecided now that
doesn't seem like incredible news until
you consider the fact not only can you
make cool little knickknacks and things
out of it people have actually been able
to make a plastic fully functional
operating gun and because of that the
United States government has been fully
involved in going in common skating gun
blueprints and 3d printers of those
creating guns so those same people who
were polled about whether or not
Americans should be allowed to own 3d
printers were asked Americans should be
allowed to print 3d guns and the pole
was a little bit different forty-four
percent felt that you should be able to
have the right to print your own plastic
gun fifty-three percent felt that you
should not 3d printers are becoming more
mainstream what are your thoughts on
this do you think you should be able to
own a 3d printer or do you think you
should be able to print your own 3d guns
is the hot topic that's been around for
quite a few years I'd like to hear so on
tuesday the 21st it made microsoft held
its reveal event for the brand new xbox
console named xbox one a lot of people
have been asking for my opinion about
this device I wanted to see if there
were any last-minute press releases
regarding the xbox one maybe Microsoft
want to clarify a few things and I'm
glad i waited because microsoft has put
out a full Q&amp;amp;A on the Xbox website
regarding the most common questions
asked after the reveal event before I
get into that I'm going to go ahead and
talk about my two cents regarding the
xbox one I like the concept of the media
control center I think it's kind of cool
that you can control your TV and your
xbox with gestures and hand movements
and throwing gang signs you know
particularly like taking their fingers
and stretch it out and be like what up
I'm controlling my TV is my hood but can
you imagine the remote control wars that
would be happening in front of the
Kinect currently if you have an old
school system like I do or a Logitech
Harmony remote whoever has the remote
their God their King and they're
controlling the system but now you're
gonna have people fighting over and
doing all sorts of stuff to try not to
hold on xbox and people are gonna start
fighting and punching the xbox I could
know what happen and is gonna explode I
personally don't do fantasy football our
fantasy basketball or baseball or any of
that crap i'm not a huge sports watcher
I don't need to have ESPN Stats up while
I'm watching TV the fact that it has a
built-in blu-ray player is kind of nice
because it would allow me to eliminate a
whole nother component inside of my
entertainment center unfortunately it
wouldn't really reduce the amount of
components i have because it's not
backwards compatible with xbox 360 games
which means i'm still going to have to
have my xbox 360 in their entertainment
center taking up more room than my
blu-ray player is no backwards
compatibility that just sucks we don't
know what pricing is going to be yet we
don't know when it's gonna be launched
and we don't know what countries it's
gonna launch in first so when they
talked about the actual availability
they should have just said it's gonna be
available later this year at a price we
haven't mentioned in countries that are
yet to be determined first and foremost
I think one of the biggest things people
want to know is is xbox one backwards
compatible with 360 games and the answer
for that unfortunately is a
disappointing no pc xbox feels that in
order to get better gaming experience
with future hardware they felt that they
had to change entirely the way that the
drive works the way that the developers
code and they don't feel that xbox 360
backwards compatibility fits in there
this is something they could have done
but I feel that for whatever reason they
want to just completely alienate the 360
from this brand new media device that's
what i'm calling it a media device that
can play games in order to get the most
amount of money out of you guys players
want to know what's going to happen to
their old gamertag on their xbox live
account what's going to happen to their
achievements their gamerscore well
fortunately all of that stuff is going
to transfer over to the brand new xbox
one system and it's not going to change
anything you're going to have your
achievements all your xbox 360
achievements your gamerscore off
everything that's in your account now
you're going to have with xbox one which
raised me into the next question do you
have to have an xbox live gold
membership to use xbox one their answer
was no you don't need it but of course
there's going to be a lot of features
and things that you use on xbox one that
are only going to be available through
gold membership what I thought was
really cool though as they did go on to
say that one xbox gold membership does
work on both devices simultaneously so
you don't have to have a separate
membership for one and for 360 they were
asked straight up about the
always-online requirement and they said
no you are not required to have the
internet at all times to use xbox one
however they kind of dodged this
question a little bit because they did
go on to say there are some game modes
and some features that are available on
Xbox one without an internet connection
but they recommend having an always-on
internet connection because of the
ability for xbox one to be able to read
your thoughts and watch you through the
Kinect and spy on you while you sleep
and watch you do all your dirty deeds
through the Xbox Kinect sensor I would
assume that when they say certain game
modes we're talking about multiplayers
not going to work that's a given
probably any of the gesture stuff or any
of the voice commands that's probably
not going to work through just like Siri
on Apple they're going to try and get as
much information and much as much money
out of you as
possible by simply saying well you gotta
have this to have this they did end it
by saying we'll have more information on
that later okay guys last but not least
