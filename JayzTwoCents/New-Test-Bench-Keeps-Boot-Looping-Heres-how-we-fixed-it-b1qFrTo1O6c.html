gonna show you a quick and easy way to
actually get your system running if
you're dealing with a specific program
that it's causing you blue screen on
Windows 10 startup as I'm about to
demonstrate here now my particular
system this test bench has seen a lot of
hardware revision changes a lot of OS
revision changes AMD Intel a lot of
swaps and stuff like this happens
eventually to the OS because it's
dealing with so much software stacked on
top of and the registry is cluttered I
mean lots of problems and that's exactly
what we're dealing with right here we
are dealing with an old AMD risin master
install keeping me from being able to
get in to my now Intel based test bench
what are you doing shopping for a case
when you build what do you looking for I
want something designed for
water-cooling fractal design to find s
all the way check it out
plenty of airflow plenty of open
interior for water cooling radiator
support it even has mounts for your
reservoirs I don't have enough room for
my hard drives okay fractal design r5
look at all those hard drive cages and
you can fit your radiators and water
cooling in here no I got a lot of hard
drives but I also have an e ATX
motherboard ok I'm gonna try something
here ok bear with me you might want to
stand clear I never actually tried this
before
yeah it worth fractal design to find r6
you could fit all your radiators a
crap-ton of hard drives and if it's a
ATX did this is perfect
nailed it now back in the day it was
pretty easy to deal with problems like
this as we're dealing with my boot loop
happening here you would just hit f8
boot into safe mode go in there
uninstall whatever the culprit is and be
up and running a couple of problems with
that one Windows 10 no longer makes it
easy for you to get in to Safe Mode if
you can't access the desktop it's pretty
simple usually you can go in there and
just tell it to restart in Safe Mode or
hold shift while clicking the restart or
bunch of different options but if you
can't get into the damn operating system
what good is that Microsoft whatever the
monkeys over there running the windows
division clearly have never dealt with a
problem like this now what's gonna
happen here the reason why you're seeing
me not touch anything is on the third
failed boot it's gonna automatically
boot you into Recovery Options and
that's how you can get into safe mode if
that wasn't working for you then
typically what you can do is when you
see the little windows circle going you
can just power cycle the PC turn off the
power supply do that three times and
then you'll end up into safe mode but
what it's doing now is it's yeah it says
please wait that's how you know it's
actually going into Recovery Options
that's where we're gonna get ourselves
into safe mode but you're not done there
because I'm gonna show you a new layer
to this problem that makes it just a
little bit more redonkulous if you will
now even here from the recovery menu
it's still kind of buried to get into
safe mode you're gonna click see
advanced repair options
you're gonna go to troubleshoot you're
then gonna go to Advanced Options you're
then gonna go to known us start to
prepare see more Recovery Options then
you're gonna click startup settings then
it's going to give you the option to go
into safe mode hit restart then it will
restart into a menu where you chose what
type of safe mode you want to boot into
there's different options safe mode with
command prompt safe mode with networking
safe mode with no networking because
basically each safe mode that you choose
enables and disables various system
services because sometimes the system
service could be what's crashing causing
you a problem or that's trying to load
in safe mode than whatever so we're
gonna go ahead and just do enable safe
mode with networking
which is number five hit five and now we
will boot into safe know this isn't
gonna boot things like video drivers and
so I'm going to usually boot or load
things like sound drivers nothing is
freakin running and it brings you right
into Microsoft support so we all know
how useful that is and what we're gonna
do now is we're gonna go into add remove
programs now we know the culprit is AMD
Rison master in my case anyway because I
didn't really show it maybe fill might
be able to see it I don't know in
editing but it actually told me AMD rise
in master DLL is what was actually
causing the failure it was saying it
couldn't load exception whatever I
remember the exact error was and here it
is right here
AMD rise in master now normally you just
go in here and then click uninstall and
when you click on install we get an
error here the Windows installer service
could not be accessed this can occur if
windows installer is not correctly
installed the irony on that the
installer isn't installed correctly by
windows own installer than install it
using the windows installer ok so if you
go down here into the windows button you
click that you just start typing
services you can actually go to the
desktop app and see what services are
running and not running and if we go
down here to W for Windows installer
right there you can see it's not running
now if you right-click that and say
start it then perty needs to tell you
that windows could not start the windows
installer service on a local computer
error
18:04 the service cannot be started in
Safe Mode so now you're in safe mode
where you can't uninstall anything which
is kind of the reason why we wanted to
get into safe mode so what do you do J
how the hell do you get past this well
all you got to simply do in our case
anyway was try and find where I am dear
I Zen master was installed so we happen
to know that the location is in our
Program Files
there's the folder right there with AMD
rise and master and all that stuff so
all we had to do here was go in here and
rename it to ms sucks monkeyballs and
now restart your system it should work
at this point you can restart your
system you'll get into the desktop and
then you can rename it back to AMD if
you do you'll deal with this but if you
rename it back to AMD then you can
uninstall it it should be able to
uninstall also with the
root folder named the way it is but
that's all we had to do we just had to
tell basically the startup services in
the registry that it's trying to load
something else not there so it just
ignores it and moves on this could
easily be handled if the monkeys running
Microsoft actually knew what the hell
they were doing just another level and
layer of white Windows 10 sucks and why
videos like this even have to exist but
because we dealt with it and I'm sure
that people can learn from it is why we
made this quick and easy video now this
is gonna help all problems this only
specifically helped the situation we
were dealing with right now Microsoft
you could Windows 10 help you can get
the trick this only helps when the
program trying to launch is causing the
problem and obviously rate rise and
master couldn't launch because we're not
running a rise end system so that was
the the conflict there so now we're back
and running in the Windows desktop non
safe mode with a new folder I'm gonna
leave on here called MS sucks
monkeyballs
ok this makes me happy but yeah it was
it was literally that simple so guys I
mean when I come across these types of
problems I'll try and make these quick
videos to help you guys out like I said
this will only work in the situation of
leaving your phone not on silent where
you making a video this won't work in
all instances but if it's a dll or
something like that that's causing the
issue then you can typically get in the
safe mode and at least delete those DLL
because deleting files works
you just can't uninstall anything
alright guys thanks for watching see you
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
