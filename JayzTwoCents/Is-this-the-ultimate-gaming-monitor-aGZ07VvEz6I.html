are at the msi suite at CES 2018 and
they're showing something new right here
this is a new line of monitors which is
kind of daring in a time where everyone
seems to be making panels and stuff so
you got to really stand out and be
different and this is the optics MGP 27c
and there's also a variant which is CQ
now this is a 1080p 144 hertz panel
that's the SI variant and then the Q the
CQ is a 1440p in the Q stands for q HD
again 144 hertz panel this is a VA panel
it's not ts a TN or IPs at the VA panel
it's got a slight curve to it it's a 16
by 9 aspect ratio not an ultra-wide so
they're kind of really keeping it more
down the middle here but what makes it
different it's not only is the fact that
it's full range VC almost at vsync
freesync from 48 Hertz to 144 Hertz
so if you've got your AMD GPU that's
definitely going to be nice buttery
smooth gaming performance we've got this
LED system that's built in here in the
lower bezel of the monitor and the idea
with that this was a collaboration that
they did with SteelSeries so it ties
into the SteelSeries engine which will
mean all of your peripherals what
they're from SteelSeries that they're
doing their blinky blinky thing the
monitor will do it too but you can also
customize this with game profiles and
csgo seems to be a game a lot of people
use custom lighting profiles in and what
you can actually do is set these
individual LEDs at an individual level
in each one of these segments to show
different game information so a demo
they were showing us here they had it
set up to csgo where one side is showing
health another bar showing ammo another
bar showing armor so you can set that up
to be whatever you want with a lot of
different options at any time there's an
update to SteelSeries engine your
monitor would get it too but what's also
really kind of nice about this monitor I
know I'm not the only one that hates
fumbling around with buttons on doing
any OSD or on screen display adjustments
adjusting things like picture profiles
brightness contrast that sort of stuff
it's terrible because everyone's to put
those buttons out of sight out of mind
and then you're having to feel around
and try and hit the right button that
you accidentally exit the menu when you
didn't mean to well they have actually
got a new OSD program here that works
with MSI or MSI gaming OSD where you can
control all that with the mouse
another thing that's cool with that
though is it also has video game
profiles for your monitor settings so if
you want to various know very bright
blown-out csgo settings so that you're
not dealing with you know people lurking
in the shadows anytime you launch
counter-strike it'll launch that video
profile with the monitor and then when
you go back to the desktop it goes back
to the base setting so you any game that
you set that up with you can actually
have it launched automatically and again
it's all oh s D with the mouse you know
what the fumble around with any of the
buttons to do that now in terms of some
of the specs are here it's HDMI 2.0 and
it's also got about 400 nits of
brightness on that so it's definitely
going to be giving you some good
contrast it's going to give you some
good performance in terms of refresh
rate response time is great it's got a
lot of features that gamers want and the
cool thing is it's also about four
hundred and fifty dollars no it sounds
like a lot but let's compare what some
of these gaming panels that launched a
few years ago let's say the the asus
swift at $1,000 when those first
launched you're getting a lot more value
now for these gaming oriented monitors
at a much lower price point so you got
free sink 27 inch qHD 400 nits of
brightness hdmi 2.0 the lighting
functions here and the new msi gaming
OSD for what i think is a pretty
competitive price but you guys are
ultimately the buyer so sound off in the
comments below and what you guys think
about this and let us know anyway guys
once again our coverage of CES 2018 was
sponsored by EVGA so go and check them
out at EVGA comm as always we'll see you
