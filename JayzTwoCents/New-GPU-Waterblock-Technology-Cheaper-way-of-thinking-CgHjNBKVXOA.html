if you've been following me long enough
you know that I'm an avid water cooler
and one of the things that people
complain about the water cooling is just
to how expensive it is there's one
company out there that's really trying
to make a change in the market and the
way that we think with manufacturing to
bring down the price of water coin today
we're going to be taking a look at a
water block for a graphics card from
alpha cool and specifically this is for
the Titan and no I don't have a Titan
they didn't send me the Titan with the
card jerks then anyway today we are
specifically going to be and I have to
read this because this is probably the
longest name for any product in history
it is the Alpha cool Nexus NV XP NVIDIA
GTX 780 Titan stainless steel polished
clear water block holy crap I probably
just took up my entire videos length of
time to say the name but the point is
alpha cool is trying to make a change
with the manufacturing process of
graphics cards water blocks and to try
and bring down the price now full cover
water blocks typically are just that
they're a solid piece of aluminum or a
solid piece of copper that covers the
entire block and there's a channel
milled into that and it touches
different parts of the block that it
wants to cool whether that may be VRMs
the GPU then maybe the the vram so it's
going to touch these different
components absorbing heat and the water
is going to take the heat away now the
problem is there's a lot of wasted metal
in there that there's pieces of metal
that are just off to the side and not
doing anything
because the heat doesn't absorb through
the entire copper block it just absorbs
through the hot spots on the block where
it's actually touching these components
that it's cooling and I just did a whole
lot of you know wing chun kung fu hand
movements there but a very visual person
bare with me
I talk with my hands but so anyway what
ALPA cool is done and we're using this
block as demonstration I'm not going to
be doing any cooling comparisons
comparisons with it because I don't own
a title so sorry about that inside you
have here the water block we'll get back
to that in a second and in true Alfa
cool fashion a lot of copper hardware
and then of course included with it is
thermal paste that's not branded don't
know whose it is but it is thermal paste
and of course your installation guide
that's all it's in the box we're going
to go ahead and set aside now here is
the block and I'm going to go ahead and
just kind of go on out there on a limb
and say I do not personally like the
aesthetics of this block but it does
come in a black version as well that
looks a whole lot better than this one I
don't like the clear plastic like this
but what's important about this is the
way that the block is manufactured and
that instead of having a single piece of
metal you've got these disks in here
that are pressed into injection molded
plastic now a lot of water blocks are
half plastic my water block that I use
on my 6ad is half plastic you've got the
solid metal piece and then an acrylic
piece that sandwiches it together to
form the path but the point is they can
pre manufacture these disks disks and
very clear I said disks and what they
can do is have thousands and thousands
of these sitting on a shelf ready to go
and when they get a new water block or a
new graphics card they can take the card
they can get a machine tooled up
injection mold the path and then they
press in these disks so what does that
allow them to do it keeps the cost down
because you don't have a solid piece of
metal that costs a lot more to
manufacture than just these circular
disks here that are about on this long
maybe a half-inch long at least
but they can get products developed for
new graphics cards much sooner because
typically it takes weeks sometimes even
months to get graphics card water
cooling blocks when new cards come out
and if you're like me I never buy a
brand new card when it launches because
I want to cool everything and I don't
have water blocks available to me so
they can get product out much faster by
using this technique now alpha cool did
test this on a Titan at a LAN event you
know for an entire weekend of lots and
lots of gaming and the temperatures were
absolutely fantastic I mean they were
down into the 40s on a Titan and that's
pretty insane but as you can see right
here aesthetics you can work on
aesthetics right I mean this is
aesthetics are nothing more than
personal preference and I don't like the
aesthetics of the top piece but what I'm
definitely interested in is the
technology here making it cheaper for
you to get graphics card water blocks
that do the job and at a much faster
pace than you can do with traditional
whole cover water blocks so head on over
to opportunity's website check this
product out just for the sake of
learning about it because if you are
water cooler like me and you are
interested in water cooling they are
really looking at bringing down the way
that manufacturing is done to make
things a lot cheaper for you and me and
that is certainly something we should
all be interested in so guys what do you
think about this new technology what do
you think about the the press disc you
know format thereof just touching the
specific spots that you want to cool and
having the water run directly over those
disks disks to absorb all of the
temperatures so I think it's cool I wish
I could test it but I don't have a Titan
to test it on wink wink
anyway let me get out of here guys this
holiday season I'm trying to bring a lot
of videos to give you guys ideas on what
maybe you want to buy for your custom
gaming PC's and if you have any
suggestions on things you'd like to see
definitely let me know hit me up on all
the social media stuff that's going to
be popping up somewhere and I'll see you
guys my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
