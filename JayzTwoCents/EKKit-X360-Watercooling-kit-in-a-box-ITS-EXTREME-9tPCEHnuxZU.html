and I just don't know where to start
there's so many parts it's so confusing
to me please help well guys this videos
going out to all of you who've ever
asked me how to get into custom water
cooling loops without making sure or
with making sure that you don't
forgetting those important parts there's
nothing more frustrating than doing a
project like skunkworks
finding out you're too fitting short so
what we've got right here is a pretty
nifty box here from ek water blocks this
is the ek kit X 3 16 of the X stands for
extreme you guys know lately I'd like to
go with the extrude on everything that
we do and this water kit right here is
absolutely no exception now ek water
blocks has been around for quite a while
and the cool thing about these kits is
they include everything you could
possibly need all the way down to the
screws and even the pump mount to get
the complete custom water cooling kit
with absolutely no chance of missing any
parts now we obviously include the CPU
block it's the ek supremacy clean CS q
or yeah CS q so doesn't circles and
stuff on it the pump is an e KD d c32
pwm elite kit edition it's actually
pretty cool we'll take a look at that as
a built on heatsink on there for the
reservoir it is an EK res x3 150 it's a
smaller version of the ones I actually
have sitting in skunk works behind me
with the radiator this thing is a EK
cool stream rad xt x 360 it is a massive
massive 60 millimeter thick rad this
thing is humongous got three fans that
come with it they're actually 1600 rpm
fans it's got the fans player got all
the fittings on the liquid thermal paste
everything you could possibly need to do
a custom CPU loop now if you guys wanted
to do a GPU you can just buy your
favorite GPU block I highly recommend ek
blocks if you're looking at style
functionality and they would go directly
with this kit without any compatibility
issues whatsoever in fact I am running
ek blocks and skunkworks so
one get this open why do I see you guys
can't I don't do unboxings often I'm
always doing unboxings and I just never
have a nice handy alright so now that
we've gotten through the Jays proof
coating on there pretty much guys what
they've done is they've gone out to
their warehouse and they just pulled all
these custom loot carts right off the
shelf and quite literally just shove
them all in a box now everything that
you get from this kit is pretty much
identical to if you were to go out and
buy this stuff individually and say oh I
want the supremacy you know csq clean
block or I want the compression fittings
or I want the the rad or whatever that's
exactly the exact same parts and boxes
they just shove it all into a kit so now
the tubing right here is actually a thin
wall 3/8 tubing I kind of like thick
wall 3/8 tubing because you can make
decent bends with it but it actually
looks like it's it's doing pretty decent
like it's not kinking it's actually got
quite a good Bend radius to it before it
kinks you have got all of your
compression fittings you need right here
two four six eight of them so that's two
per component they are really nice
nickel-plated compression fittings
individually packaged look really nice
ek logo neural cut actually called
mineral cut the lines and all that so
here is your water block this is the
clean csq and once again like every
single part in here is actually
individually packaged and look at that I
I just tore off I just twelve a piece of
that my bad all right so the csq block
I'm a big fan of the CST blocks they
look really really nice and that's
actually why I put one inside of my kit
so it's got AMD mounting it's got all
the hardware you need for AMD it comes
pre-installed with your Intel bracket on
there but this one is actually the clear
top on there so you can see your fluid
go through there if you have a colored
fluid it's a copper block very very good
block it's also got your gelid thermal
compound in there it's actually what i'm
using on my cpu highly fond of it
and there you go so there's your block
moving on to the reservoir here is that
bad boy right here now like I said it's
just a smaller version of what's
actually installed inside of skunk works
and I love these raise these reservoirs
because they have so many different
mounting options here it is right here
as you can see it as the it's the palm
material or acetal material with the
clear acrylic it's not too big so you
should be able to fit this that's not
what she said by the way that's not
lately now what's cool about this is
they actually give you two different
mounting mechanisms now the reservoir
comes with its own mount mechanism but
you have this mounting plate right here
that can be mounted to well the pump can
mount directly to this and then this can
be mounted to something else inside of
your case it's pretty nifty little
bracket there it is right there the pump
actually mounts on to there and then
this can go somewhere I suppose but this
is the neat one right here this is the
one that allows you to actually mount
your pump onto a fan it has holes
Universal holes on here to fit your DDC
pump as well as 120 millimeter spaced
holes so you can actually screw this
down to a fan and as you can see it is
spaced so that you do not have any
airflow issues that this is what's cool
this is the part where I think ek is
kind of setting themselves apart from
the crowd where they're actually giving
you options to mount things rather than
just giving you the parts and telling
you hey go figure it out on your own
bozo
so yeah that is that's cool it's
actually making it much more newbie
friendly diving deeper in here we've got
a pump this is the pump combo which is
really neat and you'll see why it's
called a pump combo in just a second so
inside the red box here because if you
haven't noticed by now everything is
kind of color-coordinated inside the red
box you have your mounting hardware
right there and inside you've got some
foam and here is your pump right here
now this is the DBC pump but you'll
notice it's got some some modification
done to it from the factory if you will
that facts are actually being eat okay
as I mentioned the bottom is heatsink
this is cool it's got rubber mount on
there the and if you can see that
hopefully you can see that it's got a
rubber mount on there so it's very anti
vibration but it's got the clear top on
there and it gives you the inlet and
outlet so you have more options than the
standard deviation off of it so it's got
an updated heatsink on the bottom as
well as the mounting which you can see
you can mount it just like that and then
you've got the clear top which I think
is absolutely fantastic in fact you can
even go kind of a step farther and sort
of mount this thing on to there if you
want it or something cool like that and
it's also got some holes for LEDs in
there if you want to do some LED
lighting this is a very very nice pump
it's actually a very pricey pump too if
you were to buy this thing individually
it's cool to see something like that
actually coming in the kits here are
those LEDs as I mentioned as well as PWM
fan splitter well PWM signal splitter
which you can use for the pump as well
as still control a fan all of your
manual material this is the cool part
here they tell you talk about optimal
radiator placement optimal fan placement
push-pull how to install every part that
comes with it this is huge some kits
don't even include instructions and then
of course we have got boxes everywhere
you know copy part about this is I got
I'm going to box all of this back up
afterwards we'll talk about why in a
second here's your ek e coolant or
excellent or whatever they call it the
Evo clear to concentrate you actually
dilute this into distilled water to get
your your actual fluid I just cut my
thumb on the box holy cow that is sharp
careful guys dangerous boxes here is
your little jumper to start your power
supply so you can breed you bleed your
system some extra screws and things
I mean they've really really got you
covered but now let's go ahead and take
a look at this monster rad it's not
actually the monster rad it's it's
actually different that's alpha cool
let's go and talk about this bad boy
here the fans right here they're pretty
basic they're not they're kind of a
no-frills fan they don't have much in
the way of style to just solid black but
they do have sleeved cables and they are
not PWM fans they are DC 3-pin fans so
there are those and I'm gonna really
hate having to Reeboks all this stuff
unboxings are fun
Reebok scenes are kind of boring this
thing is humongous and the radiator is
big too let's get this bad boy open come
on come on look at this guy I got some
warning in there about how to install
the screws you don't impale the thing
and murder it look at the size of the
radiator look at that it's actually a
loaf in density so that yeah even though
it's so it's so heavy duty and thick
like this you can still actually blow
through it pretty easily feel to go my
breath on the other side so that means
these fans are gonna have no problem
pushing air through this or pulling air
or however you configure it and I do
like the fact that it has fittings on
both sides so you actually have some
options for melting us but this thing is
absolutely gargantuan and it's also got
the fitting on the back right there
which can be used for bleep order or
whatever you want to work them fill port
bleed port whatever I guess you got some
options on there so there is that
massive massive radiator now guys why do
I have all of this I mean gosh I've got
so much in water cooling already maybe
I'm gonna water cool the rig behind me
or maybe this is actually a giveaway
item we'll be talking more about that in
the future but anyway that was just a
little teaser for you guys this has been
the ek kit x360 everything you could
possibly need to get yourself a custom
loop in a box so go and check it out
guys I'll put the links in the
description and follow on Twitter if
you've got the guys I've ever bought a
kit like this tell me what you kit you
got let other people know what kit you
got and your experiences with those so
we can help each other out I'm gonna get
the heck out of here guys I'm gonna
Reeboks all of this that's
I kind of suck in anyway I digress see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
