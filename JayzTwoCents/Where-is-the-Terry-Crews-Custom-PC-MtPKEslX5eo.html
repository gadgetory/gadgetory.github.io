$0.02 here and you know what I I think
we really want to do this video I wanted
this entire project to be nothing but a
surprise not for you guys so much is for
Terry Crews but then I realize he's
super busy he's not going to watch
anyway so this will still be a surprise
to him don't don't go and tag him or
anything on Twitter anyway also to this
is coconut monkeys first video that he's
actually recording so if it sucks blame
him okay so part 1 here we're going to
talk about the components it's usually
what I do when I do build logs we're
talk about some of the parts that are
going in here that I'm going to reveal
the chassis and the chassis will be
getting modded actually teamed up with
g-force garage on doing some of the mods
on that so they'll be a part of a series
a little bit later on also be a part of
the delivery but we'll talk about that
now everything you see here is sponsored
so thank you to the companies that sent
this stuff out so anyway we got the x99
e 10g workstation motherboard here from
Asus thank you for sending that over
this to me was two things one
reliability this is a very robust
motherboard they can handle a lot of
stuff Terry Crews is building a system
here for live streaming but he's a huge
gamer and a live streamer so long to
build him a system that was powerful
enough for him to not have to rely on
any sort of external capture card but
could do everything internally here on
the system so this this motherboard
being as powerful it is as flexible it
is and as reliable as it is was first
and foremost I want a reliable system
for him it also looks really nice with
the aesthetic remember we are doing an
old spice beam here which is which was
very difficult for me to figure out how
to tie Old Spice into a computer built
that's weird it's just weird how do you
tie in body spray and deodorant into a
computer build but that's what he wanted
and I think we I think we've got this
you're not going to see the theme today
this silver here is also going to play
very well with the aesthetic if you if
you look up the bear glove sense that's
Terry Cruz's favorite scent it's the one
he promoted the most it's got a red
silver and blue theme to the whole
package of what bear glove is so that
should give you a little insight and
when that's going to be but anyway yeah
so this motherboard right here is I
think was a simple go to unreliability
so what's going to go in there clearly
we have got a 69 50s
from Intel again sponsored by Intel
thank you very much for sending that
over I've been using this in my
workstation rock-solid over clocks well
you've got twenty threads of processing
power which can be awesome for COS of
gaming and live stream encoding all
happening at the same time some folks
might have been like why don't you go
with a Z on honestly because this is bit
better I guess no to be fair this is all
about overclocking right here it's an
extreme CPU he's an extreme guy I wanted
to kind of go with the best of the best
with the x99 platform and this is what
it is right here so we will be
overclocking that of course graphics
cards will on a graphics cards first she
has two gtx 1080s in the system that he
built on Facebook I don't think anyone
surprised about that he'd put one in
there and then he was super excited he
ended up putting two in there so I told
him I said you know what we're going to
have to step it up
so we've got to tighten X's here of
course sent over buying video you guys
can see there's a very pricey theme
going on here to thank you guys for
sponsoring that here that I would say
here they are I've never even open these
to have a knife ah yes
so I've had these for a while now and I
never get openly so let's do this right
now let's going to the yeah we'll call
it the maiden unboxing if you will
whatever you want to call it yeah you
would think I would have opened these by
now right and taking a look at him I
don't know yeah they weren't mine so it
wasn't like I was like super excited
about it but then again it's not like I
could do four-way SLI unless I wanted to
hack stuff but anyway here we go Lowell
ah so I can be a bag yep there they are
two gtx titan x pascal we will of course
be ripping off these coolers things in
their type we won't be taking these
coolers off because you know how i roll
what am I going to do Nick I don't know
if it yeah said again I'm going to get
over the crinkling oh yeah it look
really good on their own but of course
they just don't they just don't meet our
aesthetic there they are
water-cooled gtx titan x is incoming and
put that away before you in the damage
inflammation so i'm doing that a few
moments later
Willie know your the problem is I never
put one of these back in the box you
should see I don't open them up moving
on
here is some Dominator Platinum special
edition Ram sent over by already open
that sent over by course they're very
very pretty
same exact Ram that we have sitting
inside skunkworks right now there it is
we got four sticks obviously because
we're next ninety nine we want that quad
channel goodness but let me tell you
what is unique about this you guys know
that these are special edition numbered
sticks of RAM so they sent over a number
ninety four of five hundred well why is
that significant well the very first NFL
team that terry crews played for was the
LA Rams and his number was ninety four
so of course a so Corsair sent over Ram
number 94 I think I think that's pretty
neat and unique if you ask me little
things like that are what's making this
bill just fun for me now obviously we
have a lot of water cooling stuff we
need to put in here I don't have any of
that coming yet but before we could talk
about water cooling stuff you kind of
have to know what it's going in right
okay this is this is going to be good
the reason why this project has taken so
long to get going was because we could
not or at least I could not come up with
the right chassis the chassis is
everything and like I said it was very
difficult to come up with something for
Terry Crews because although old twice
is fun and it's it's all about power and
yelling and screaming and stuff I've
been to his place you've seen the video
it's on a high-rise it's got glass
everywhere it's elegant
the interior design is very well thought
out you don't just take some janky PC
case throw everything in there call it
Old Spice and send it off to the guy you
have to think about the room that it's
going in and we went to CES we took a
look at a case there that I thought was
perfect for this build this my friends
is the in winds howl 2.0
this is the chassis everything about
this chassis just screams Terry Crews to
me the design the curve the elegance to
it but yet the customization abilities
we have a 360 rad that can go on the top
a 360 rad that can go in the front so
we've got this mirrored glass that when
the case is turned off it blacks out you
can't see inside it's got integrated
lighting in here unfortunately it kind
of came unstuck it's a very textured
powder coat we'll be taking care of that
but you can see it's just I love
everything about it in here and look
closely at this because it's wide open
plenty of room for water cooling these
trays come out 360 in the front I can
put what I want in there I can also rear
mount particular hard drives and stuff
if I want to if I want to get rid of
this SSDs can go on the floor of it
we're getting custom cables made for
this I'm toying with the idea right now
of tearing apart the chassis and getting
it all powder-coated red because like I
said the red came with Old Spice custom
stuff happening with the glass and
NVIDIA garage will show you guys that at
the end this this was it I saw this and
had to have it so I reached out to in
win and I said guys you need to get me
this case this is not a request at the
risk of sounding arrogant this was a
demand
Terry Crews would love it he hasn't seen
this by the way I hope he's not watching
yeah they sent it over that's why we
have number three of the limited edition
500 run on this and the other two were
show build so technically it's the first
one I don't know yet if I'm going to do
an actual build log where I show it all
going together I'll probably record it
as I'm doing it and then make a montage
of that during the delivery video so it
all kind of ties in I even got some
other youtubers helping me out on the
creation of that video we've got a lot
going into this this is a huge
undertaking in my opinion it's the
biggest thing that kind of happened to
PC gaming in a long time bridging
something like YouTube a list celebrity
tying it all together making him feel
welcome to the community which was the
whole point with this build I offered to
do it for him not for personal gain or
do need to know a celebrity but because
I wanted to welcome into the PC
community with something that only he
had I know some people might be
disappointed that we weren't doing like
an AMD Rison build but we had to get
this going right away
who knows what the performance is going
to be on that time will tell I'll be
doing some custom AMD rising stuff but
don't you worry your pretty little faces
about that
every time I look at this I just get
chills you know what this is this is so
pretty I think I'm going to keep it for
myself
Terry Crews you're on your own man but
you must who wants to fight me for it
then a bar all right guys see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
