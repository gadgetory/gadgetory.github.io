my coffee in the morning I'm so cheap
actually reuse the cups this is homemade
coffee
I even grab a handful of straws when I'm
there so I don't have to sign the bus
don't judge me
wait wait wait wait wait it's Christmas
can't wait wait wait wait will you wait
guys he came he came what time is it
guys I got a fractal design Calvin s 36
oh no it is like way too early for this
I'll get the coffee okay yeah
jeepers a custom build by J's to set
aside a fractal design and define an OS
I love the holidays golly a fractal
design core 500 yeah guys look man 44
days this is what makes it all worth
this season spoiled ones you love with
the gift of Awesomeness happy holidays
from fractal design guys if there's one
thing I can't stand it's dead hardware
and I and I've actually had this card
for a little while now this is the
gigabyte extreme gaming GTX 1080 which
is kind of like their no-holds-barred I
just pull all the stops graphics card
and I've never got chance to test it
because it's broken unfortunately it got
jostle around and shipping or something
and so the fans like this one doesn't
turn as you can see it's hitting the
shroud right there this one's like
knocked completely off of its perch that
one works as you can see and the entire
cooler is like twisted it's hard it's
bent right here so I don't know what
happened the box that came in was
actually okay so I think that this was a
review sample that got sent around I
don't know I know who had it before me
but we're gonna do today is we're gonna
see if we can fix it and if we can't fix
this shroud I think we might try and
jerry-rig something yeah I totally
ripped that from Jerry's channel we're
gonna J rig it that's we're gonna do
we're gonna we're gonna J rig this thing
this car does a lot of neat features
though that's one of the reasons why I
want to fix it because it was kind of
built around the whole idea of VR as
obviously all the Pascal cards are but
it has some things on here that are very
thoughtful for instance on the back of
the card right here you can see those
two plugs actually has two HDMI ports on
the back of the card and the idea behind
that is it has an HDMI pass-through
right here for your your headset so that
you don't have to actually sit there and
run some of the dongles and stuff that
come with the headsets you can actually
use everything built onto the graphics
card it's got a ton of accessories that
it comes with two that are designed to
help that while it's actually broken
right here two or so this bit right
there do this I can pick how much I can
move this shroud around this thing is
pretty busted up I'm not gonna lie it I
don't know who had it before me shame on
you
it literally looks like it was dropped
now I know I said I was gonna do a drop
test on the graphics card one day but
this I didn't do this it's hurting me
inside I'm gonna take it apart I want to
see we want to see what we can do to fix
it
so yeah this isn't a review this is
this GPU surgery so like I said the
intro this video this fan right here
doesn't turn as you can see it's hitting
the shroud right there like right here
it's bent this shroud is bent like
downward it's hard to explain it pushing
down right there you see it's not square
and this guy right here feels like it
might even be broken away entirely from
its hub I mean just kind of wobbling
around in there yeah it's pretty bad so
I guess the first thing you've got to do
is go ahead and start cracking this guy
open see what we find because the issue
here is not with the board itself it's
all with the cooler that's the sad part
like this entire card is rendered
useless because the fans can't turn
although I still don't know if I said I
know if it works technically since it
does appear like it was dropped or
something yeah these fins are kind of
crushed in on themselves and they're
bent yep
I'm almost positive now that this card
was dropped now I don't hold this
against gigabyte though because some of
the cards I have to get sent back like
this one here I believe made a media
tour and it got sent around to different
media outlets to be reviewed typically
they just bought some box and back up
ship him back gigabyte takes it and then
send off someone else so this card was
probably not tested after as it was sent
back otherwise it would have seen like
oh it was dropped I also don't if you
guys are watching this now going they
should probably look and see who had it
last and then charge him for it I don't
know if they actually have a record of
who was sent to first or last or any of
that I don't know you would think that
they do but who knows so there's the
cooler right there the thing is so beefy
so this guy's actually got four plugs on
there okay so here's the GPU right here
here's the PCB and it is as you expect
it is a custom board from gigabyte so
that means I'm not going to be able to
take another cooler and just slap it on
here
load all them V RMS and power phases
right there of course they are actively
cooled here are all of the thermal pads
right there so you know if you ask oh
they are regarding cooling so we're
gonna set this guys side he is not our
concern this big giant beefy burly
cooler this is our concern
and by the way moving forward to
graphics card reviews who thinks I
should take them apart now who thinks
should start taking them apart and doing
complete tear downs of them to give a
good idea of how they're built what do
you think hit like if you guys think I
should do that now part of the problem
with this cooler is although it's got a
giant copper plate right here the shroud
around it which the fans are actually
attached to you is just thin metal and
it is as you can see I mean I I can bend
this thing around pretty easily it's
it's very flimsy even though it's metal
so that is going to be part of our
problem here as I mean look how easily I
can manipulate this piece right here
look so you did then that mold it
however I want so it's no surprise then
that these fans got intruded upon if
this thing was dropped
then again graphics card shouldn't be
dropped in the first place should they I
also want to be careful here I don't
feel like slicing my fingers off so it's
literally just four tiny screws that
hold the entire fan shroud together here
alrighty this is now here we go so as
you can see here here is the heat pipes
this is the whole heat pipe and thin
array for this card this thing is
massive holy crap
it is it is ridiculously heavy like I
can't even begin to describe it you can
even see how dense the fin is the fins
are right here like there's so much
weight right there even this part isn't
damaged I mean these these bet fins back
here this is superficial we can bend
those back fortunately all of the
brackets that hold the fans together
here are metal unfortunately this fan
right here as you can see that piece
right there is completely broken off of
the fan but this piece right here it
appears whatever happened the center fan
was pushed down the most in this bracket
as you can see right there broke off of
the actual fan itself so that explains
why that one was having a problem but as
you can see with two on there because
the fans are so light it actually spins
around just fine this whole piece right
here the little arm that holds it is
twisted and bent so of course the crappy
part here is trying to bend all of that
back and the reason why the fan back
here isn't working as you can see if I
hold this up you can see this whole
thing right here
here is like twisted just a little bit
and right here it's just a thin thin
piece of metal right there that holds
this whole back piece together like if
that bends too far it's going to break
but this whole piece is twisted and what
happened is it twisted this corner right
here into the fan you can see it's
striking it right there that's where the
fan is hitting so now we gotta gently do
you mean gently try and twist this all
back into position where it's supposed
to go that wasn't too bad all I do do is
grab the three prongs here at the fan is
mounted too and sort of finagle it back
over sideways and now you can see that
fan now turns without hitting anything
so the center fan here is the one that
we're having the biggest problem with I
think I may have done it as you can see
well maybe not I lied alright looks like
I've actually gotten this all fixed now
fortunately the damage was isolated to
just this fan trap I think I've got it
all lined back up the only thing to do
now is put it back together see if once
the heatsink is on it if it holds up and
then put it on the test bench and see if
it works and there we go
it's all back together all straightened
out fans are turning go test it okay
here we go complete moment of truth I
just installed it I have not turned it
on yet to see if it's going to work
again I don't even know there was damage
to the board or not and I also need to
know if I plugged all the plugs into the
right spot considering that are five
plugs on the board and only four cables
so I guess we'll just have to see all
right three two one
okay the fact that it lit up the fans
are turning and not hitting anything is
a great sign I guess if we want video I
should have probably plugged in the
DisplayPort huh I forgot to plug in that
I need to see if we get an image over
here get a post I still have no image on
the screen
huh
well then let me try restart
oh look the light turn blue yay go over
camera stupid huh for a second there I
thought I broke it but plugging in the
DisplayPort after it was already posting
it didn't wait or trigger the monitor
but you guys know we have to do next we
have to at least run some sort of a
benchmark to make sure it's really
working so I think Valley benchmark
would be a good place to test this right
now it boosted up to 2012 megahertz the
GPU is currently running at 46 see the
fans haven't even started yet
so I think I think we gotta give it a
minute maybe it didn't matter that the
fans weren't running in the first place
alright so the fans are running now at
57 see we're just I'm gonna say an miss
a is working I was able to fix it that
means we can actually do a review of
this card way after the fact if you guys
think I should go ahead and do a full
review of this card let me know the
extreme card here so far are proving to
be pretty damn extreme it's running at
58 C right now and the clock has come
down a little bit to 1974 makers I mean
that's pretty intense right there the
temperatures versus the speed I am
impressed so far anyway guys there you
go just decided to do this video because
I was like well I got to try and fix
this card anyway I could have sent it
back they actually asked me to send it
back and then I thought no no I want I
want to try and take a stab at this and
see if I can fix it
so there you go alright guys thanks for
watching let me know if you guys have
any other topic ideas for me I like to
pull topics straight from the inbox and
gives me mates me know what you guys
think is relevant to all of this but
anyway one fixed graphics card and I
feel a little bit more accomplished
today and I can walk with my shoulders
back in my head head head held higher
however that statement goes alright time
ago guys thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
