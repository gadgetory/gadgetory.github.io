you guys on the other side of the world
in here for once what is it like eight
o'clock where you press are seven
o'clock eight o'clock maybe even nine
o'clock at night what on earth is going
on here oh let's go ahead and get this
Twitter doubt shall we got to get it out
in the social meteors all right we just
put it out there what is going where r2
comments yeah eight in the UK that's
what I thought I thought I money but
eight in the uke god i really wish
youtube wasn't so retarded when it came
to comments like to be able to read them
honestly but hey it is what it is we've
only got four people in here everyone's
out doing their thing on a Saturday
nobody wants to be on YouTube and nobody
wants to be out on youtube I'm only
going to be doing this until 1pm my time
so for about 45 minutes because I'm
going shopping for my birthday early
birthday stuff since we have such a busy
schedule and my wife wanted to give me
something early so no we'll see if I
find anything or not I have a hard time
shopping for myself I never can find
anything it's like you know I when I'm
not buying anything I'm not shopping I
can think of all sorts of things that I
would like or want but then when it
comes down to it and you have to make a
decision it's I just can't I can't make
up my mind let's say update
automatically says people are tweeting
me saying that they can't comment what
is going on here
Wow youtube is being so stupid today
this happening okay uh do the best you
can I guess try other try something else
like maybe Twitter or Facebook I guess
there we go now I can see your comments
know what the heck was going on alright
we have 15 people in here people are
starting to kind of trickle in I
appreciate you guys coming to watch it
on a Saturday I know you guys probably
have much better things that you'd
rather be doing than watching a tech
geek talk on the internet about tech
stuff and ah I moved my computer back on
the desk because I see there it is right
there I didn't like you know that I
couldn't it was it was farther over
there on a table like way off the side
of my desk and it was okay I mean I but
I was always there and I liked it I
liked it being within reach to you know
push buttons when I needed to do certain
things and you know it's also just a
good idea to have it in I shot when your
water cool just to kind of keep an eye
on things that maybe you know first of
all I don't use IE i use chrome thank
you very much but yeah yeah it's good
idea to keep an eye on your pc
especially when your water cool I've
never had a computer leak on me I'm
going to go and do that now that I just
said that do you guys remember when I
redid the water cooling and it turned
kind of purple because i forgot to flush
the pump so there's a little bit of red
dye left in there from the old coolant
over time I want you guys to see this
over time it like it went clear again
look at that it wit clear again and and
then there might be like this just the
slightest hint of you know um I don't
know which way my hand goes here there
might be the slightest hint of purple in
there but look at that it's gone almost
clear again and I'm going to be putting
the mayhem coolant in there which is a
pretty cool i like the mayhem stuff i
think it's pretty awesome and i'm going
to keep the angle just like this i think
this is kind of a cool view for tech
talk what do you think I kind of like
this
awesome let's move xsplit out of my way
here okay so I don't have necessarily
anything I want to talk about today
other than the fact that I know that so
many of my European followers and
friends out there in my asian and
australian guys I whenever I do my
livestreams it's usually 6 p.m. my time
on a friday or a Thursday and you guys
are long asleep and you know I know the
replays are kind of boring I mean people
will watch an hour long stream but they
won't watch a 20-minute video so I don't
expect you guys to do that so what am i
doing I've locked the door I've put the
kid up for adoption and we are going to
hang out for the next 45 minutes or at
this point now the next 39 minutes
because at 1pm I'm getting out of here
promised the wife would go do some get
some things out of the way today and
like I said early birthday shopping
definitely don't want to miss that one
other point of business if you look down
into the description you will see a
click to tweet that is being given
though out on Twitter and you have to be
following on twitter i don't care how
much people complain you give away the
twitter that is a twitter thank you for
hitting a thousand followers and i
thought about I was going to do a $25
gift card but I upped it to bioshock
infinite which is worth a lot more than
$25 I might still do a $25 gift card in
the future here just because I like to
but I wanted you guys liked my live
stream on twitch of BioShock Infinite so
much and there was like 40 anywhere
between 40 and 50 of you guys in there
at all times from beginning to end of
the game and you guys liked it so much
you guys wanted to play it so I
understand that not everyone has a pc
that can run it or not everyone has
steam or not everyone even has a pc but
that's the that's the bottom line that's
that is what it is so it's a Twitter
thank you click that button it will give
you a link to just click tweet and it
automatically put you in the drawing i'm
going to pick a winner later tonight and
it's going to be done with twitter draw
so Twitter draw is going to be how it's
randomly picked through that hashtag
clicking it more than once doesn't enter
you more than once just so you know so
only click it one time
your chances to span it so where'd you
guys want to talk about what's your tech
question just take a look at the
comments in here we got 30 people in
here now Adam Baker says he thinks as
tech guys have better things to do on a
Saturday I know right i'm going to be
doing some twitch live streaming later
today probably some battlefield maybe
some warcraft because i like to go in
warcraft and just troll late lean
because i don't take the game serious i
don't even like to gain that much
minecraft why for some reason you guys
really seemed to like my life's
minecraft live streaming not minecraft
was wrong with me minesweeper
minesweeper lives for me oh my god I I
put on the epics movie soundtracks and
it gets pretty interesting yeah so maybe
later I'll twosome minesweeper live
stream because that's what you guys seem
to really like holy crap if you guys
were in there for any of those
minesweeper live streams put it in the
comments what you guys think of those
mine minesweeper live streams I've had
I've had people come into the twitch
channel when I'm sweeping mine stream
and they're like what the hell is this
and then they get stuck there like oh my
god it's so stressful anyway um MW
quickscopes says or modern warfare I
guess quick scope says AMD vs intel i
got a video on that go watch it it's
probably six months old now and i need
to redo it because we got new stuff
coming out for both we got rumors for
AMD and we've got has well coming up
next month for intel so it's definitely
going to be worth redoing the video
right after the launch of has bowl
because i don't want to do the video
prior to the launch of has well then it
becomes immediately outdated so once
Haswell launches it may or may not be
the time i make the switch to it to
intel so we'll just have to wait and see
then won't we uh river Elijah 13 says
Jay what are your thoughts on the
gameplay of watch dogs I haven't seen it
I haven't I mean I don't get as much
time to game or follow up on gaming news
or anything as much as I would like so
i'm a bit behind on that i'm sad to say
but i do have a product review that i'm
going to be doing here in the future
probably in the near future probably
next week sometime I get a lot of
comments of people when they're building
their computer they they've seen me say
and they've heard me say that I don't
recommend that they use stock coolers
because the stock coolers that come for
both intel and AMD just really suck even
if you're not overclocking just keep it
as cool as possible why put any undue
heat on your processor prop the highest
rated cooler on any computer parts site
doesn't matter if it's new a microcenter
amazon I don't know if NCAA NCIX is
included in this but the cooler master
hyper 212 evo is like one of the most
highly recommended it's got five of five
stars in like 17,000 reviews on this
cooler and the thing is you can get it
you can get it for thirty bucks or less
depending on where you shop so I'm going
to be doing so overclock testing with
this cooler and we're going to see
exactly what what comes of that put that
right there and other than that I've so
got so much in the pipeline that I want
to do I just put up the video today that
I recorded yesterday obviously which was
about ram speed and how it affects
gaming performance which on a cpu it
doesn't of course as with any video I've
ever done there becomes a debate about
you know whether or not info is accurate
or not so there's a bit of a gray area
there where apparently AP US will suffer
more from ram speed because of the fact
the system ran has the double is vram
but I I'm key I would really like to get
my hands on an APU because here's my
official response to that when you take
vram on a graphics card like my 680
right here and I've overclocked that by
by an entire Giga hurt I have
overclocked this graphics cards ram by a
Giga hurt and seen absolutely no
improvement in gaming performance now I
understand that EP user not only sharing
it for vram but because it's shared
information processing that the faster
the ram is the faster i can get the
information out of the queue and through
the cpu the better performance is going
to be but i just considering AP use if
you're already
using them as a gaming processor you're
already not getting great gaming
performance as it is because ap use our
are not great gaming processors and
graphics chips inside of them so you're
already getting minimal frames per
second you're already having a really
drop down performance settings on the
games so how much are you really going
to notice it it's like it's like saying
yeah okay if a cpu is bottlenecking this
graphics card that's noticeable but
you're already bottlenecking your gaming
experience simply by being on an APU
because discrete graphics always is
better than an APU so I'd really like to
get my hands on an APU system so i could
really put that to the test and find out
exactly what the you know the facts are
regarding that imma check out some of
your comments here and see if there's
something I can answer that's fun and
exciting boxer boxer a boxer ax says hi
he just sub today hello welcome to the
channel Adam valker says he loves
minecraft I've never played it so my
twitter information is also down in the
description click that show more button
it says follow me on twitter there's a
link there's also a link to my facebook
page you guys should all be liking that
stuff because i like I've done a lot of
giveaways for for a youtuber that's not
that big you know we're creeping up on
11,000 right now I do a lot more
giveaways I think than some of the big
youtubers and someone commented my are
tweeted me today and said that that's
what they feel separates guys like me
from the big youtubers is that I'm
constantly giving back within showing
appreciation where a lot of the big
youtubers just kind of say hey you know
I am me so there's your there's your
reward you're following me and I don't
feel like that so I'm always doing
giveaways and stuff but I'm always
giving extras to people on the social
media what I mean by that is the Twitter
giveaway that was a thousand Twitter
follower thank you so it's only open to
people on Twitter when I reach 500 likes
on YouTube I'm planning a giveaway or
not YouTube for facebook I'm planning a
giveaway just for facebook followers
that's only going to be announced on
facebook so it's important that you guys
follow these different
social media is not for just information
about myself or technology or
notifications of when a video goes live
there's benefits to that to that could
directly you know reward you guys so
what else we got here I see a lot of
people saying hey I must give a blanket
hi to all of you all 40 of you who are
watching right now um one 666 number
says well AMD's next gen gpus beat
tighten as well as probably be most
powerful in next gen nvidia gpus i don't
know i honestly don't because the 7970
was being handed it was being beaten by
the 680 by twenty percent on most 1080p
graphics benchmarks but then they
revamped it with the gigahertz series
and now they trade blows depending on
who the developer of the game is Titan
was a pretty big leap forward in terms
of the 500 series versus tighten it
wasn't a huge leap 680 versus Titan only
thirty percent um I don't know I think
AMD has its work cut out for him but I
also think that amd's got something up
their sleeve I don't know what it is but
I think they've got something I the
bottom line is I hope it competes with
nvidia at least on the same tier of
performance because then that draws
price drives prices down and as
consumers that's what we want we want
prices to fall if there's no competition
in a particular market then you get you
get market control and they have full
control over pricing and that's bad I
mean think of gasoline for instance
there is no competitor to gasoline so
gasoline prices are through the roof and
we Americans like to complain about four
dollar a gallon gas but I know a lot of
people in other parts of the world like
the UK and Australia pay a lot more even
when you factor in the conversion rate
for gas and we do it's amazing to how
much computer parts cost in different
parts of the world I was corresponding
with someone on Twitter today that was
asking me or on Facebook my god I came
to talk on YouTube YouTube comments and
YouTube messages about their pc buildin
and I
told them that I thought that their
graphics card price was a bit high
because they put dollars so i have
assumed they were in America turns out
they were in Romania and of course just
like Australian so a lot of other
countries are completely hosed when it
comes to graphics card pricing and and
just general pricing of computers which
I don't know it doesn't make any sense
especially since all this stuff has
developed in Asia you would think that
Europe and other Asian countries we get
a price break who knows my robe pulling
in and says you know what sex the fact
that your cpu cooler doesn't fit in your
box and you have to satisfy with the
stock cooler yeah that's when it's time
to get a bigger case that's for sure I
do have the fractal are for right down
here actually it was on the couch back
there and now my towels that I need to
fold you know honey do list our bet is
back there but the are for it's about a
hundred and nineteen dollars you can
find it for about a hundred three bucks
on amazon if you live near microcenter
they will price match it for a hundred
dollar case it's pretty wide and it's
it's a mid tower so it's not super tall
it's not as tall as this bad boy this
thing is huge right here but it's it's
about this tall compared to the NZXT
switch 810 which is what this is but
it's whiter and it's soundproof it's
very very quiet it's fully filtered
cases are becoming a lot more you know
full functioning for cheaper prices now
so if you can't fit something like this
in your case it's time for a new case
okay um let's see we got here month
Matthias Lindbergh hey Jay I'm thinking
of getting an aftermarket cooler for FX
6300 how do I get rid of the thermal
paste on your cpu that was on the stock
cooler simple rubbing alcohol just don't
pour it on your process or your
motherboard but just pour it on like a
microfiber cloth or even paper towel and
just you know it wipes off pretty easily
and it helps get rid of any of the
residue just don't touch it don't touch
this the cooler or the CPU heat spreader
with your with your fingers because oils
from our skin do affect the
it can't affect the paste so it's just
simple rubbing alcohol if you live near
a computer store some places sell
thermal paste remover which is really
just more alcohol and a prettier bottle
I guess whatever yeah there you go
number number nine had a very good
suggestion use a coffee filter and the
reason for that is it's not going to
give you know particles or fibers that
are going to come off of it that's why
you never want to use like cotton balls
or anything like that because we get
fibers everywhere yawn odo says you're
cooking some salmon right now do I want
some a little fun fact about Jace two
cents I don't eat seafood I don't eat
shrimp I don't eat scallops I don't eat
fish I don't eat sushi I don't eat
anything that lives in water not by
choice but simply because it's
disgusting I don't like it and which
really sucks i even tell my wife the
other day with with all of the you know
the muscle building i'm doing and all of
my weight loss stuff that i really need
to start liking fish especially white
meat fish like halibut and salmon is
really good for you because it's high in
the right kinds of fats the omega-3s all
bodybuilders swear by fish and i need to
start eating it but i just don't like

can't reach the poster it's way back
there there the rag hit it how's that
the towel hit the poster for you it's
way too far back there what is my
opinion on razor well I have a razer
keyboard and i'm i'm going to type this
comment oil came to type to show how
loud this damn thing is but i really do
like the tactile feel of the cherry blue
switches that are in it but razer mice
don't get me started i've got a razer
deathadder back there in the the smoke
monster room the closet that will
avalanche if i open the door the scroll
wheels on razors or mites like to go
stupid where if you scroll up you know
if you try to use a scroll wheel to make
the page go up and down the page will
just go like up down up that up though
it won't it just like the wheel gets all
jacked up I like the braided wire I like
the length of the wire I love the feel
of it but I don't care for the fact that
the scroll wheel like to take a crap
because i use the scroll wheel all the
time but the Papa do you don't want to
death adder you don't want a death adder
I said a while back that i'd probably do
a video about why I don't like the Death
Adder and I just need to do it because i
hate that Mouse show the cam inside the
computer um let me see if i can get that
upper way Cameron okay oh yeah well
that's really bright isn't it
I'll do that uh Gee is that it's really
bright configure input brightness there
we go that's almost better apply you
guys wanted in the in computer can I use
this one I'm live streaming on twitch
and stuff just for the sake of it there
you go never put that right there it's
floating it's floating over me okay
there you go there's the the computer
cam but now all of a sudden is right
hold on ah that was loud finger input
now figure out but no piece of crap
alright well that there it is that's
what you're gonna get right there
there's my in computer camp it's it's
around the corner like kind of behind
where the evil would be pointing up I
might move it inside there I don't know
I don't even know why I have the stupid
camera but hey salt tennis where do you
live I live in Southern California I
live east of Los Angeles zetec 95 what
GPU would pair well with an AMD 8350 any
graphics card will honestly i'm using a
gtx 680 with it and a lot of people give
me a hard time because i've mixed nvidia
and AMD I have absolutely no problems
with whatsoever just like some people
run their 7970 s what their 3570k of the
3770 it's fine on a build I did a couple
weeks back and I'm getting ready to
build another one identical computer
over there which is different case I did
a review of the 7870 and that was on an
8350 it did really really well for
especially for a min and mid-range card
250 to 300 dollar cart depending on
where you buy it the 8350 is it is a
good processor I don't know why people
bad mouth it so much oh yeah because
it's AMD and it's cool to hate AMD
because that's the cool thing that's
what the cool kids do we all hate AMD
the 7970 is a best bang for buck but
it's still pushing it's still over 350
to 400 dollars a lot of people don't
have that kind of money just
on a graphics card so if you want to
talk bang for buck you've got to start
talking 7870 or 7850 gigahertz edition a
mcafee protection or avg hmm a lot of
people use avg I don't really like
subscription-based antivirus so I guess
ABG I have avg on here so the Papa do
says by the way j it's james rose from
twitter hey James how are you doing
today buddy 55 yell in here and I'm
getting out of here in 19 minutes so get
your questions in here and if I'm not
answering your question guys I'm not
intentionally doing it I just there's a
lot of messages and things it's hard to
keep up and I'm only one guy so okay on
Twitter Charles price says Jay what do
you do you think so i think you should
scavenge a new 1156 hold on do either
you should scavenge the new 1156
motherboard and overclock your Intel i
five six fifty or just get a new intel
cpu mobo get a new one just get a new
one the architecture has changed so much
since the 600 700 eight and nine hundred
the only we're talking fourth the new
fourth generation it compared to that is
about to come out so the price of the I
sevens and stuff today like the 3770k or
even the i5s is really going to drop
there's no reason not to in my opinion
because i just i don't like revamping
old hardware like that unless you were
severely and I mean severely on a budget
Clyde media says hey Jay my Valley
benchmark score was 1958 with an i5
3570k and a gtx 660 plus 16 gigabytes of
ram what do I think of that score was my
score I need to look my score up real
quick i put it up on hard forms we find
it i want to say it was 3,000 it's gonna
take me a second guys bear with me just
this is this is live this is raw this is
happening now this is on location guys
so just hold up a moment here hold up I
gotta find this the valley benchmark
pages actually I think a better thing to
do would probably be just to go to my my
recent posts because I don't post much
anymore so bear with me guys I'm looking
at anybody you wanna if you want to have
a cool benchmark just to play around
with it including a free sandbox world
that just doesn't end it goes on like
forever as far as you want to travel
download the unit Jin Valley benchmark
it's free it's really cool to give you a
good idea of what the frames per second
is like on your graphics card when truly
you know stressed out because it takes
everything about direct axilla and just
hammers your graphics card so okay if
I've go to my recent post this is just
okay do subscribe threads okay geez I do
talk a lot on this web form okay unigine
preview no but i want i want benchmarks
um gosh I can't find it oh here we go
benchmark BAM number two okay ah sorry
about that okay I said I'm fighting in
that post i said i gotta help represent
AMD crowd pleased that i beat out some
Intel systems here with the same GPU I
had gotten a okay was a 1898 at average
frames per second at 45 max 87 point to
a minimum of 22 so yeah 1898 there you
go what's a good case for 80 to 90 bucks
the cooler mass if you need if you need
good airflow the cooler master is the
cooler master half 922 is a good case
and it's less than hundred bucks and now
you've got me one to redo my Valley
benchmark score simply because your 660
beat mine but then again I was running
really out of date drivers and stuff so
now we have to redo it see what you did
he was you'd now you
now I got to do this now I'm going to do
this am I excited about the 700 series J
no not really except for the fact that
it's going to bring down pricing on
graphics cards which means that I'm
going to end up probably sticking
another 680 in this thing and making it
last for as long as I can the Papa D
wants to know if I'm interested in the
steam box no not really because I'm not
I'm not much of a console player I have
steam on my desktop and when I'm not at
my computer and not gaming so I don't
really care about that much side media
says that score was stock score without
overclocking yeah well that's there you
go that's a good score I be interested
to know what your 3dmark11 score is
because that takes a cpu into account as
well especially with physics rendering
mine was a highest score was like a
10,000 798 so run that and let me know
send me a message james hardie says your
team Wigan Athletic won the FA Cup in
England today internet high-five this is
football soccer yeah I may not like
soccer or football but I know what it is
at least here's your high five BAM
another broken nose to your face there
you go anyway Noah site that's that's a
good point though if the 660 Ti is
performing that well then that's good
that is really good news especially
since my 6 80's overclocked a 1350 two
megahertz it's just time to to redo that
um gosh if I wasn't live streaming right
now I would do it on here okay um let's
see mathayus lindbergh says mathias i
think is mathias limburg says i have an
FX 6300 and 660 GA and i have lots of
problems with your bios not being 1920 x
1080 on your screen is that a common
issue your mobo is from gigabyte i don't
know if that means your bios isn't going
to be 1080 bios or they're very low
resolution they're like 640 by 480 I
believe they're stretched yeah you're
not going to get 1080 bios even a UEFI
okay metroid gaming says i keep missing
your question let me go find it then go
back what mouse my currently using i'm
using the logitech mx518 the
that looks like it's all dented up and
every time this breaks I go and find
another one I'm on my third one in the
last six years I've been using this
mounts this is my gaming mouse this is
what I pound news with i love this mouse
in fact the feet on it are all toward
look at the bottom but tell me there's a
we're here this foots missing this is
all torn up there it's dented do that i
have used the crap out of this mouse i'm
gonna blind you ready BAM you're blind
you're blind now what J the Met toe ltl
ansys what is sorry if I said it wrong
toll te o ok Matt how that Jay would you
suggest aftermarket cooling for graphics
cards and if so what do you suggest
someone would use arctic arctic cooling
makes a really good Universal graphics
card cooler it's got three fans on it it
makes it much quieter it's pretty much
the only aftermarket air cooling that I
can suggest the only other thing you
could do is like this right here is
water cooling so okok Oh cat guts to sue
you guys names are so hard is there any
good editing software you can expect my
daughter's bang on there is there any
good editing software I can expect
window move ex oh you can expect window
movie maker I'm assuming you're asking
for something other than Windows Movie
Maker if you're asking for free no
there's not you got to pay there's
different versions of Sony there's all
sorts of editing software out there you
just got to look okay let's go back up
here hey Jay do you have any
recommendations for the next GPU upgrade
your running two gtx 580 t is in sli
intel rarely drop prices by the way even
a spokeswoman from Intel said they
weren't planning on it they will plan it
when Haswell comes out they they have to
even if it's only by 50 bucks they will
drop it and if not then fine I've got
microcenter and I get a 3774 220 bucks
so whatever james hardie need to buy a
new desktop computer student and want to
buy pre-built any brand recommendations
it's difficult for me to recommend
because I know how these guys get their
parts places like cyber cyber pc and i
buy power and all those guys eight
they they buy bulk refurb and they'll
sell you a computer at a brand new price
and they'll give you refurbed parts and
if you go and look at like the reviews
of i buy power of cyber pc you'll see
that you'll be lucky to get anything in
the box when it comes and if it does
come you gotta hope it's not broken if
it does turn on you gotta hope it stays
turned on and if you got to send it back
you hope you get it back the reviews on
some of these companies are so poor and
be honest I've been building my own
computers and building computers for
other people for so long I just honestly
don't I don't know I don't know who's
building out there and I don't know
who's reputable I mean NCIX is a great
company but they're in Canada I don't
know what they're what you know their
interaction with the u.s. is when it
comes to PC building and selling so HD
gamer says in a few hours it's your
birthday and you're up to gaming and
you're confused what should you get a
gaming PC or HTC One I need both I
really up to gaming but I broke my phone
what do i do first off the price of
gaming pcs vs cell phones is very
different I'm trying I'm curious as to
what PC you would get instead of a
smartphone that's in the same price
range so yeah I would say get the phone
if you have to get a PC that's like 200
bucks honestly hey Jay are you excited
about any new games coming out this year
I'll be honest with you after playing
bioshock infinite I don't know what I'm
looking forward to because I don't know
if anything can match it I started
playing far cry 3 blood dragon and it
was boring Bioshock if I was well I'm
gonna play that game again I'm so gonna
play that game again BioShock Infinite
was so amazing that I don't know if
anything can live up to it in my opinion
at least not now gosh I've had just as
much fun I'm fun a minesweeper lately
than any other games Tyrone Jackson
wants to know should I get a dell XPS
8500 by a custom pre-built or build your
own is that 8500 a laptop or a desktop
you can't build your own laptop if
that's what you're thinking I don't know
anything about the dells XPS 8500 so I
just know once Adele by daily aware that
alien where's became even less value
james hardie said I meant like samsung
or sony or something like that and
you're in England it's not too good with
all this malarkey about making it run
faster I'm not sure I follow the
question man I apologize about that one
mop head so any recommendations for
upgrading from your 550 tis wait what's
your price range that's what matters
yeah that's what matters you could
always get to 660 TI's if you want to go
SLI I want to get another 680 because i
want to start messing around SLI
profiles myself which I haven't done
much of I haven't done a whole lot of
SLI with this stuff I've SL I'd my foot
my 580 you get to roll sold to a friend
he s allied I set it up in the profiles
seems to work really good I just know a
whole lot about it unigine Valley
benchmark from my row pelini and I think
you're the one that was bragging a
minute ago unigine Valley benchmark one
point of extreme HD FPS 30 1253 15.8 15
40 k FS score i mentioned earlier at my
1898 was valley were you talking about
haven benchmark if so that's different
than what i was talking about so that
makes a little more sense to me now that
that score of 12 53 based on the 660 and
the cpu model three-point 03 is intel
xenon Wow okay and that's interesting
that you're running a xenon for a gaming
machine the xenon would be a lot like
the AMD where the AMD is a the bulldozer
and the piledriver CPUs their server
CPUs that were reconfigured slightly to
become desktop PCs so that's why they
don't perform amazingly in games the
xenon is probably a lot of the same
situation where it's not going to
perform in my opinion as good as say an
i5 or an i seven min games but the xenon
is going to have its real strong suits
like probably amongst rendering things
like that James Hardie says sorry to
confuse
mint to mint do you have a brand
recommendation at samsung or sony for
desktop computers i'm not going to
technical things sony's been doing it a
long time but so Samsung you're going to
have to get you're going to have to go
to some sort of a review site and look
up the exact bottles that you're looking
Ryan maclir wants to know if I'm dodging
his question there's no such thing as
dodging here man the questions move
faster than I can answer them so let me
scroll down here and find your question
will you whoops ready go it disappeared
will you make another raging video of
AMD makes a graphics card like the GTX
Titan maybe I you know there's a lot of
truth to the rage videos granted it's
hamed up for the camera anything I've
raged on the the box that horizons sent
there and they sent me two of those
packages by the way that little bitty
part in the big old box they sent me two
of those so I was truly upset that they
sent such a big box because they charged
me to shipping for that size box when I
could have stuck it in an envelope the
Titan that was one hundred percent real
rage there man and then the xbox thing
granted it was not a working xbox the
mentality of David Adam orth whether or
not you know the Xbox truly has always
on internet it was the bottom line that
someone at Xbox or Microsoft had that
type of mentality that pissed me off
will there be more rage videos coming
absolutely in fact I've been thinking
even today even because I rewatched that
xbox video for the sake of rewatching it
and I love the fact that I've kind of
got this thing going where when I don't
like something I run it over with my
truck and I think I kind of want to
start a little you know I don't know I
don't know how it incorporate it yet but
I want to incorporate a some things I
don't like get the tire sort of thing so
I think it would be fun they're always
so controversial people hate rage videos
as much as people love them and when
something gets broken or destroyed in it
oh yeah and I had that video I made
where I broke the keyboard people got
pissed about that one that's Wow yessir
crazy it was like a ten-dollar keyboard
that was not even working HD gamer says
his budget is 700 to 800 I think I'll go
for the PC yeah go for the PC definitely
what do I think of gaming economies team
fortress 2
I don't know anything about it I played
team fortress 2 if it's the same captain
MacGuffin wants to know lga1155 versus
2011 2011 has a future path has a path
ahead of it because of their going to be
bringing back to 2011 socket for some of
the Haswell and the IDE stuff so 1155
potentially has a dead end but yet we
don't know exactly what is coming out so
you just have to wait and see metroid
gaming says he begs that he has chosen
for Bioshock there's a lot of people
that want that game if you just join

Twitter followers so I'm not going to
thank all my Twitter followers by giving
it away on YouTube some a new design
team in on twitter so that's the bottom
line there Maximilian wants to know guys
when it's jay's wednesday do is live
streams with jay has the time Jay does
live streams that's basically how it
goes dimana chybas is silently watching
be a free I think he means be afraid oh
I'm very afraid Jay do I need you to
fold my towels yes I don't know how to
fold towels toilet there they're folded
there they're done that's why I see it
they're done okay guys we got two more
minutes this is your two-minute warning
two-minute warning we're ending the
stream and I'm going to fry's
electronics and if you want to know what
I'm looking at it fries cuz i'm going
for early birthday and and crisp up
christmas shopping going really early
Christmas shopping guys yes if you want
to know you guys get to help me decide
I've got about 200 250 bucks to spend
before my birthday wife is taking me on
a little shopping trip I don't know what
I want I don't know I guess the
decisions I can't make up my mind have
you guys seen up here have you seen my
my shelf of things Jays likes look at
that I've got iPhones up there
Samsung's I've got kilt products
processors we've got headphones munition
up there what's up there I mean look
we've got my Elgato um streaming device
we've got my graphics card you know over
there we've got my TV my sound bar I
mean I've got everything I need so it's
really hard it's really hard for me to
decide if I'm when I'm gonna buy
something like what to buy cuz I'm not
like where the hell was the camera there
we go that doesn't work all right it's
really hard for me to pick things that I
want when it's like you know hey Jay you
can you're going to get a gift because I
have everything I want so I'm not going
to buy an APU for the simple fact of for
a simple sake of doing an apo and try to
get a company to send me one in the
motherboard and then I'll do it see
that's how this thing works that's how
this YouTube tech thing works you get
people to send you stuff whether you get
to keep it or not doesn't matter you get
them to send it to you for their name
out there because you say hey these this
guy was nice enough to send me this you
do a review on it and then use in the
back or you get lucky by doing or you
get lucky doing a you know a build for a
guy and you get to use some of their
parts for their builds do you know
reviews and things like this hyper 212
that I'm going to be doing because it's
the most highly recommended cpu cooler
on the market all right I'm going to
read a couple more and then we're
getting out of here Rai McClure what do
you think of beats headphones i
personally think they are awful because
you pay for the sponsorship by dr. dre I
think the beats headphones get
absolutely hammered by a company called
me initio because initially takes all of
the other headphones on the on the
market reverse-engineer sem finds their
flaws redesigns and then comes up the
better product I love people some people
have accused me of being a sellout to me
initio and here's the bottom line I've
never received a dollar I was allowed to
keep it review units and hold on baby
i'm almost done i'm allowed to keep the
review units and i love the sound
quality there the quality of them is
amazing and because of that is why i'm
passionate about it in college I used to
install competition kicker sound systems
for
kicker as well as rockford fosgate and
we used to compete in DB drags and I was
building 160 decibels s able sound
systems that were purely based I'm an
audio file I love sound I hear sound to
other people don't hear so when I put on
a pair of headphones and they sound like
crap they sounds like super crap to me
I've never heard anything from me issue
that it didn't like so that's why I was
so excited about that as for the beats
yes you're paying for the name I've I've
never had a friend of mine who likes
their beats over the munitions when they
get to hear mine that's the bottom line
so anyway guys it is time to get out of
here I'm sorry that there hasn't been
enough time for me to answer all of your
questions I know of a kid that's back
there screaming so it's obviously time
to go continue to put your questions in
the comments like I do on all my other
live streams I will come back and I'll
