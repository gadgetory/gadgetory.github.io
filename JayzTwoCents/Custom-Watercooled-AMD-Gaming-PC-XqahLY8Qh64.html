you saw this system it would be complete
and obviously I kept my word we're going
to talk about this system we're gonna
talk about some of the parts and stuff
I'm gonna answer some of the questions
and comments that I saw in the previous
video where I was showing me putting
some of this together EVGA silent series
power supplies offer excellent silence
and efficiency through their new EVGA
eco-mode technology and also features a
seven year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more now the case on here is a
case labs sm8 I have said it before and
a lot of people keep asking me what case
is that
again it's the case labs sm8 basically
it's the smaller brother to the case
labs sm8 even though I think this one
came out first
technically or it doesn't have the lower
basement or any of that it's much
smaller but as you can see even with a
full water cooling loop in here particle
graphics card massive radiator massive
pump will defy pump lowering massive
pump but it's still hard to get this
thing looking full what I'd like to do
right now is go ahead and just kind of
run through the list of parts and then
we'll kind of do a two part video here
well two purposes says video not a two
part we're not doing a Part B and Part C
or any of that I promise even though
technically this is already part two I
wanted to talk about why the parts that
are in here are in here because a lot of
people in the previous video seemed to
draw their own conclusions as to why
these parts are in there and
unfortunately you guys are pretty much
flat out wrong and secondly I want to
talk about rigid tubing and whether or
not it's something you should consider
for your first time build because that
seems to be the most common question I
get regarding rigid tubing is do I
recommend that a first time water
cooling builder try it
so before we start talking about the
parts let's go ahead and roll that epic
loop filling video you guys love seeing
the loops get filled and I do admit it
is kind of nice to watch it's it is kind
of sexy so anyway let's go ahead and
roll that footage and then we'll start
talking about the system
I still believe that the best bang for
the buck AMD CPU that you can buy right
now is still the 8350 so it's got eight
threads of performance and that's more
than enough for just about any game
these days so it isn't 8350 being cooled
by an UK supremacy Evo block with the
proper insert in there and proper
cooling plate for the AMD CPU we have an
EVGA GTX 980 super clocked in here with
the EK nickel and acetal full cover
block with the full cover backplate on
their fury 650 more than enough wattage
for this system especially since since
this is going to a customer and it's not
mine I only overclock the CPU to 4.4 so
I can keep the voltage low and I'm gonna
leave the graphics card stock she plays
mostly like World of Warcraft and a lot
of games that aren't super intensive so
I don't want to introduce more heat and
more maintenance or just the idea of
possible crashing so we're just letting
the GPU do its own thing with the stock
BIOS it's not a hacked BIOS or anything
like that the motherboard is an asrock
fatality 970 performance motherboard
it's not the greatest overclocking
motherboards that probably still belongs
to the asus crosshair 5 formula but I
think the bang for the buck the features
that you get on this motherboard for
being a 970 are definitely there you've
got plenty of fan headers you've got
full fan control overclocking control
memory timings memory speed everything
you would want on a basic motherboard is
they're easy to use but with more
advanced feature sets and you really
don't need to go with a 99 tf-x chipset
it's not gonna do anything for your
performance unless you are running more
than two way crossfire or whatever they
call it
I mean it's 2-way would be SLI it isn't
SLI and a crossfire board but unless
you're going more than two graphics
cards three or four you don't need the
990 FX the memory in this thing is
sixteen gigabytes of 82 XP gv1 what with
that because it's nice
read it matches the system nicely
slightly different shade of red but
nothing terrible for main drive 256
gigabyte SSD m6 s from Plextor
and then it's got a 2 terabyte Toshiba
7200 64 Metcash main drive well I guess
you'd call it junk drive game drive
storage drive mass storage now let's
talk about the cooling because this is
the part where most people were like why
in the heck are you spending money on
water cooling this thing when you could
spend the money on getting better
performance parts likes a faster memory
or a better motherboard or another
graphics card or something along those
lines well we'll just start with the
list of parts first EK water blocks 45
millimeter by 480 millimeter radiator
we've got four of the brand new fractal
venturi static pressure fans on here
we've got three of the venturi airflow
fans on the front alpha cool top on a D
5 bits power 250 millimetre reservoir
primo chill revolver fittings for all
the rigid fittings and then of course
we've got the primo chill ptg tubing on
this thing and I got to tell you right
now this thing runs super cool in fact
this CPU under load is only hitting 47
degrees Celsius the graphics card is
hitting 45 degrees Celsius there is
definitely more cooling in this thing
than is really necessary but that was
kind of the idea especially since we
live in a hot climate look the system
just turned red and must be no we're
talking about AMD right now but my white
balance just went to hell here's the
bottom line on the parts this video was
never meant
in fact this series about this case and
this system was never meant to be a
guide
it didn't say guide anywhere in the
description it didn't say guide anywhere
in the title it didn't say guide
anywhere in my dialogue this is a log
this is a computer that was built and it
is being logged via video the parts that
are in here do not necessarily match up
and being the most efficient cost wise
so what does that mean
it means she had a set budget to spend
and I had a set amount of money to work
with things that I thought would look
nice in here do good for a video do good
for talking points I donated to the
build I donated most of the
water-cooling stuff
I got the case provided by case labs
absolutely free to her so a lot of this
stuff here were things that I upgraded
for her just for the sake of doing a
build log on the video it's to the point
to where I wanted to do something nice
that looked really really nice she's the
friend of the owner of red mist they
wanted something that kind of matched
and this is what we came up with now
that my rent 30 is out of the way let's
go ahead and talk about rigid tubing for
a moment here that is easily one of the
most common things I'm asked is how I
feel about rigid tubing and should a
first time water cooler try it you know
quite honestly I think you should
because it doesn't take any real special
tools all the bends you see in here
we're done by hand I didn't use a
bending device I didn't use a bending
aid I didn't even measure it it's one of
those things if you take your time and
you really just think about what you
want to do before you do it anybody can
do this I use an $18 heat gun from
Lowe's nothing special and other than
that other than a hacksaw
in fact I don't even use a hacksaw
anymore I use a $7 pipe cutter from
Lowe's as well because you can do it
with the ptg you can't do it with the
acrylic it's easy the fittings are
cheaper overall than getting all the
revolvers and all the compression
fittings that are needed for soft tubing
the tubing isn't going to fade or leach
plasticizer which is gonna make your
clout your tubing look all clouded or
get dunked up in your tiny micro
channels inside your blocks and if you
mess up the tubing is cheap to get 10
feet of soft tubing is usually in excess
of 30 bucks but you can get 10 feet of
ptg for like 12 bucks so buy a lot more
than you need and practice it's not hard
I think everybody should try it I really
do because if you mess up you can just
try again but soft tubing if you cut
that thing and you messed up and you
were too short well unless that piece
can be used somewhere else in the build
you just wasted that piece and speaking
of somebody from experience who in the
past has messed up with soft tubing and
had to go buy more soft tubing is not
cheap I just think that ptg or even
acrylic still there's a there's plenty
of uses for acrylic out there some
coolants are actually not compatible
with PE TG because
of different chemical base and the
plastic that's in the PT G it could
cause melting maybe I should do a video
about that in the future but just know
that there are uses for both still and I
just think a lot of the benefits of
acrylic tubing or I'll just say rigid
tubing out wave that of soft tubing the
nice thing is you can also fill in a lot
of this dead space with neat little
bends like I mean some of these bends
here are like this simply to fill in
some of the space because of the fact
that you just aren't with with soft
tubing it's gonna go the way it wants to
go and especially since it was coiled up
it's gonna want to go the way it wants
to go no matter what you do it's always
gonna have a curve to it well guys there
you go she's done customers gonna pick
it up Sunday or Monday I think
let me sad to see her go I love working
on these systems I spend a lot of time
on them I feel like a piece of me goes
into them so every time I build one and
off it goes I kind of feel like you know
I'm a little sad like I know ones
someone's mine into my computer and I've
got enough computers around here so
anyway it's time to get out of here you
know I'm thinking we're lacking water
cooling content so I need you guys to
tell me what you want me to cover when
it comes to water cooling I've got all
this stuff in my head and some of it
actually matters it's hard for me to
just pick out like okay we're gonna do
this topic we're gonna do this topic
we're gonna do this topic it's easier
for me to kind of get the collective
information from the crowd saying
alright there's you know 200 people
asked me to cover this so I need you
guys to tell me when it comes to water
cooling stuff what do you want to see
what kind of informational videos
tutorials or how to's do you want to see
and we'll get that done I do feel like
we're lacking some water cooling stuff
on here we're gonna change that soon
I've got the land rig I'm building which
is gonna be a water-cooled again with
rigid tubing I've got some radiator
reviews coming up a few of them actually
and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
do this we're gonna get back to our
water cooling roots here on this channel
especially since so many people are
starting to pick up water cooling like
Kyle and Paul's hardware and these guys
are really starting to get their feet
wet no pun intended
or maybe just slightly I figure we'll
just go ahead and get her done that's it
we're gonna get on out of here I think
the customers build turned out really
really good I think
it looks amazing I even you know lit up
the reservoir back there I just put an
LED strip behind it it's actually behind
the reservoir it's not in the reservoir
see this is my finger right there
maybe not but anyway this is not one of
those lit up reservoirs I just stuck an
LED strip back there all right time to
get out of here thanks for watching guys
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
