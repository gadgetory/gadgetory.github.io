than the idea of overclocking their CPU
the thought of burning up their
brand-new hardware for the sake of
overclocking is just too much for some
to bear but I mean honestly what is the
worst that could happen yes I know I've
used that analogy before but I think it
still applies the mastercase 5 and
mastercase 5 pro from coolermaster
combines modularity with creativity
giving you the freedom to build it your
way make it yours by clicking the link
down in the description back in the day
even the most veteran of builders would
start to freak out a little bit when it
came to the idea of pushing their
hardware as far as they can through
overclocking motherboards weren't making
this very easy a lot of the times the
BIOS were hard to navigate and the
settings were very cryptic and you just
quite honestly didn't know what they
mean but with the inclusion of UEFI BIOS
and being a lot easier to navigate
through the different settings and even
have help menus right on the side of the
BIOS it's easier to determine what does
what and the manufacturers of
motherboards have come a long way at
even making motherboards designed
specifically for overclocking now today
we're going to take a look at three
methods of overclocking to see which is
right for you and just how much you
really will gain now the first method
we're going to look at today is XMP
profile this is actually on your memory
where by turning on the XMP profile the
memory is going to ramp itself up it's
going to overclock itself as well as
usually putting a mild overclock on the
CPU as well and the reason why this
tends to happen is it modifies a lot of
the B clock settings when it comes to
your motherboard now of course something
you need to be aware of is it's going to
vary by manufacturer of memory it's also
going to depend on the XMP profile of
the memory as well as the CPU and
motherboard chipset that you're using so
those perimeters are all going to have
some factor here on how far the
overclock is actually going to go no
method number two we're going to look at
is the automatic overclocking where the
manufacturer has tested tons and tons of
different CPUs for the current chipset
or the chipset that you're currently
looking at in this case today we'll be
using x99 where they determine that
based on the CPU you have installed what
over clock range is going to be
typically these are going to be very
mid-range where there's more Headroom if
you move over to number three which is
going to be manual overclocking but it's
going to be much more safe less blue
screens less heat and less wear and tear
on your CPU now that moves us on to
method number three which is manual
overclocking which can take a lot of
time and energy to get set where you're
100% stable usually the goal here is
going to be to get as much performance
as we can of our CPU and more often than
not setting it right on the edge of
stable or pushing it even a couple of
megahertz farther could lead to blue
screens random crashes and just an
overall terrible experience but just
like photography if you like to shoot in
full manual mode then you would be the
kind of person who would probably also
enjoy full manual overclocking I know I
do now before you do this yourself you
need to keep in mind that cooling is the
most important factor when it comes to
overclocking most of the time you have
to add more voltage to get higher
stability inside the higher frequency
ranges that you're going to be playing
with which means you're going to be
pumping more heat into that CPU and heat
is the number one killer of Southern
Californians no actually it's actually
the number one killer of CPUs but the
same thing here in Southern California
somebody please put a heatsink on this
damn state all right so with that said
let's go ahead and turn around and
transition into the CPU and let's go
ahead and see just how far we're going
to get with the three different methods
overclocking we're first going to do a
base run at 100% stock everything just
completely defaulted on the BIOS to see
what our baseline runs are and then
we'll see how much we actually get with
those three different methods of
overclocking I believe it or not I've
never actually done this test where we
see just how far you're really going of
course remember your mileage may vary
when it comes to CPUs Ram types and
chipsets and cooling alright enough
let's do it now remember we are
completely stock right here so we are
going to head go ahead and run the CPU
test get our baseline number and then
start doing our over clocks and see what
we're going to get here look at them 16
boxes of goodness just floating around
right there
that's that's pretty I like I wish there
were more boxes though all right so our
baseline number here and you guys feel
free to play along at home and compare
your numbers and tell me if yours are
better than mine I would love it if
somebody out there it's just like Jay
your computer is slow it's booked and
mine is faster than yours so please tell
me I would love to hear about your
systems anyway we have got a 1331
three-30 here on our baseline test so
the very first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to save this benchmark score
reboot into my BIOS and I'm going to
load XMP profile to see how much we
improve from there that's kind of like
the easiest quickest overclock XMP
profile and see what we can get now
remember your BIOS is going to be
different than mine you're going to have
to figure out which one you need for you
or what you know settings you need to
change for your motherboard this is not
a guide on how to do this for yours and
we're going to advance frequency here
extreme memory profile XMP we're gonna
go profile 1 which bumps that up to 3000
megahertz on the RAM I thought I had 20
800 mm ram apparently have 3,000 isn't
it sad that I don't even know what I
have system multi player goes automatic
and it is going to be bumping our CPU up
from 3 gigahertz up to 3 point 7 5
gigahertz and the reason why it did that
was it changed our beat clock value our
host clock from 100 to 125 so that's how
it actually achieved the overclock for
the purp for the RAM which also is
affecting the CPU it affects everything
together so the multiplier didn't change
it just upped the B clock to 125 so
there you go let's go ahead and reboot
this into again windows we're going to
run the test again and see how far we
actually improved all right so our
newest score here was a 1495 it's going
to divide that by the 13 30 that is a
twelve point four percent increase over
the base settings on the CPU not bad not
bad alright so in my motherboards case
right here it
got a CPU upgrade drop-down and all
three CPUs for x99 represented 5820k 59
30k and 59 60 X and it has three
settings for each one a 3.8 a 4.0 and a
4.3 one-touch overclocked so I'm going
to do the 4.3 and I'm going to leave the
memory right here at disabled and system
memory multiplier at Auto you could play
with this also and get you know a random
overclock here of the system memory as
well I'm gonna leave that disabled
though quite honestly because the moment
you touch that it then starts to
overclock the base clock as well I just
like seeing 16 of those boxes just chug
away at this image right here
such a nice thing to see I remember the
seat the one of the reasons why I like
Cinebench is it doesn't it's just CPU it
doesn't take GPUs into account
whatsoever you know which some of the
rendering applications would we just
jumped up to a 16 16 9 on top of the
1495 bust out my little calculator right
here let's say 16 69 divided by 14 95
that's another 11.6 percent increase
over the XMP profile overclock or if we
go ahead and divide that by the original
number of 13:30 that is a 25 point 4
percent increase by simply changing a
drop down in the BIOS this is why
overclocking is fun people it's like
free performance as long as you have the
cooling necessary for it and in fact
that OneTouch drop down isn't really
going to even change the cooling that
much whatsoever the voltage doesn't
change to a very big number where you
could use an H 100 or something and be
just fine with that all right so the
next one here is going to take a little
bit of time before we are able to
actually get the overclocks
stable here I have to do my max
overclocked testing and then I'll come
back and show you how far we actually
got by doing things that way okay so
enough time and tinkering has gone by
where I have settled on a 4.5 gigahertz
overclock on my 59 60 X that's actually
a 1.5 gigahertz overclock above the base
clock of the 59 60 X now I want to point
something out I could get 4.6 all day
long on my e BGA x99 class
five board before some raisin on the
gigabyte board I cannot get 4.6
kick-butt gigahertz stable don't know
what it is I just don't have the time to
tinker with it but I've also settled on
2666 on the memory now you'll know you
you typically cannot get the max memory
XMP profile speeds while overclocking
the CPU as far as it can possibly go -
it's a bit of a trade-off but I'd rather
have faster CPU than faster Ram what
that said let's go ahead and run the
test and see just how far it's actually
come before the test finishes here the
last one with the OneTouch overclock was
a sixteen sixty nine and by only doing
two hundred additional megahertz and
bumping up the memory speed a little bit
our speed has increased to a seventeen
forty eight
that's a 4.7 percent increase over the
OneTouch overclock that we did prior to
that with the sixteen sixty nine but our
total percentage increase over the
original thirteen thirty is a thirty one
point four percent improvement in
Cinebench scores and you can see them
represented by the orange stripes right
there that's a seven thirty one point
four percent increase over just putting
the CPU in and letting the turbo clock
of three point three gigahertz to do its
thing if you are putting in Nice
chipsets with any sort of case Q
processor whatsoever or even AMD FX
Black Edition stuff if you're not
overclocking you are missing out on some
serious free upgrades when it comes to
the performance of your PC now one thing
I want to mention is that I personally
don't find the additional four point
seven percent of increase in the amount
of time it's spent to find that stable
four point five gigahertz which quite
honestly took way more effort that it
really should have because it comes down
to the Silicon Lottery some of you won't
even achieve close to those numbers some
of you will be achieving much higher
numbers with a lot lot less effort but
you got to ask yourself if that's worth
it to you the additional four point
seven percent for the sake of tinkering
guys like me find the tinkering to be
the fun aspect portion of this whole
thing some of you might just want to set
it and forget it which is exactly what
you know new motherboards and stuff like
this are offer
so honestly it really comes down to the
amount of risk you're willing to take
the amount of tinkering you want to do
and quite honestly you aren't taking
much of a risk at all by using any of
the built-in overclocking features
inside of your motherboards and your
CPUs you quite honestly should be
tapping into this extra power it's at
your fingertips so if you have the
cooling to support it some sort of a
high-end air cooler or an all one water
cooling loop it's even going to be
beneficial when it comes to these
OneTouch overclocks it doesn't touch the
voltage a whole lot to achieve those
numbers remember these manufacturer
companies are dealing with tons and tons
of data with lots and lots of CPUs that
they've done testing with during the
actual development process I believe
Asus actually gave me a statistic of a
thousand CPUs are tested when they do
their overclocking Suites to determine
what's a safe number for it to play
around with it knows where it's safe let
it do it overclock your PC what's the
worst that can happen well you just have
to clear your CMOS and start all over or
forget it if it wasn't for you the
chances of actually ruining something
are very very slim and the chances of
getting more performance definitely
outweigh the slim amount of risk that
you would be taking anyway guys I hope
you've enjoyed today's video let me know
if your numbers are beating mine it
probably won't be that hard I'm still
really disappointed that I can't get 4.6
stable out of my gigabyte set up when I
was doing it all day long with the EVGA
it's possible to that there's been a
little bit of CPU degradation over time
one of the biggest effects of
overclocking long term is that you'll
start to require more voltage and get
lesser speed out of it as some of the as
some of the transistors and things start
to die and some of your degradation
inside your CPU happens but I'll let
that scare you that's an extreme extreme
case I've been running my CPU at its max
stable but I possibly could as long as
I've had it from day one most people
don't do that anyway guys time to get
out of here hope you've enjoyed today's
video as always thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
