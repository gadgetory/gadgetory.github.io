there are already people in here that's
fast I was gonna find some royalty-free
like background music to play that way I
could legally claim this stream but I
decided that I don't want to I decided I
think a lot of you guys listen to your
own music while you listen to this sort
of stuff so I won't interfere with that
but I'm going to do the best I can to
see these comments as they come in
because I'll be honest with you youtube
sucks at that so I've got my Twitter
open here twitter is going to be the
best way to reach me don't forget
facebook in fact I better I better to
let the Facebook peeps know that this is
up let's see and I don't have a format
really set up today when I did my last
live stream last week or the week before
whatever it was and I gave away those
billets I had a I had a format going
there because i need to get certain
things done and i had the time it right
with boogie and all that stuff so see
yeah all right and the twitter stuff is
roland and out which i really really
like so I'm gonna go ahead and get to uh
get the Zack here first because he was
in the live stream on Twitch the other
day and we were talking about his
computer build and whatnot so I guy I
gotta go back and find his link I think
he tweeted me pretty sure he tweeted it
to me however who the hell knows because
my memory these days it's super shot
because it so I'm old and I don't
remember anything anymore I'm kind of
laughing at this press release this this
Apple apples Warren site at one site
apples yeah one site website is warning
I device owners against jailbreaking
because it can cause instability
security vulnerabilities shortened
battery life unreliable voice and data
disruption of services and the inability
to apply future software updates now
I'll tell you right now I used to have
an awful like my very first iphone was
an iphone 4 because that's when verizon
first got it and I got it was jailbroken
not right away I'd say a few months into
it because I was afraid at first and at
least the versions of jailbreak that i
was using none of that stuff happened I
mean what's up bridge I may have liked
seeing a few bugs here and there that
may be required me to restart the phone
but I mean I didn't have voice and data
problems I'd have disruptions of service
if I wanted to upgrade the software it
was easy enough to wipe the damn thing
for itunes instability it was a little
less stable but whatever but they also
cite the main reason why you shouldn't
jailbreak your phone is because it make
if they lose money I don't give a
of apples losing money cuz i'm
jailbreaking my phone it's my phone I'll
do what I want with it so I was just
reading that art of
I was just reading the article a little
bit prior to this dream right here and
it was actually making me laugh a lot
and I I do not have a jailbroken iphone
5 i'm thinking about it sing about
jailbreaking it but i have it so and oh
my god that you know there are more
responses to this dream than I was
expecting honestly the stream is getting
more popular that makes me happy you
know 25 of you 35 45 whatever there is
just 25 right now and there were like 40
of you in here watching the live build
of my water cooling machine over there
I'm dying gets a little bit rainy in
California we all die just didn't know
if you guys knew about that so I'm going
to do my best here to get to your
questions both on Twitter well Twitter
Facebook and YouTube so put your
questions wherever you want and I'll do
the best I can to fight them find them
i'm going to start here on twitter real
quick i'm gonna go back to the beginning
here let's see what I think about your
build I didn't see it yet I feel bad
because I said I would look at it and
then the live stream crashed the other
night and I got pissed someone to bed
sup Scott hope you document that a 8
build when you do it because I expect to
see that thing up and running okay
Thaddeus says he loves my videos I'm
inspiring to him to build one himself
well good everyone should be building
their own computers I mean as much as I
as much as I'm all for supporting you
know corporations or businesses or
whatever I'm all off I'm also all about
the value and when you don't when you
buy a PC you're buying let's say you're
buying overhead you're buying their
electricity bill their rent their
employees salaries markup on cost to
cover all of that the shipping and grand
I guess it to be shipping anyway but you
know they're you're going to get less of
a performing computer by buying it
versus building it yourself and I hope
you guys watched the build video I did
for my friend Josh it really building a
computer these days if you don't do
anything super custom like the water
cooling I did you know it's it's just
plugging in parts
and all really for the most part only
goes one way I mean the most tedious
part about plugging in the cables is
making sure that the you know I ok
Buhl's you know for the buttons and the
hard drive light and the power light or
the right way and that's about it hey
this freaking cold and I'm complaining
about the cold here it's like 40 degrees
i think which is really cold here for
california and the snow level is like
just barely above where we live right
now so it's it's like as the rain is
falling right now it's like snow and
then it's turning into rain right before
it gets to the ground that's funny and
it was hailing earlier and I'm just
curious is what the weather really is
right now 39 degrees so I I mean you
guys have to admit for California 39
degrees is pretty damn cold now i'm
wearing my car heart sweater here
because it's heavy and it's waterproof
and all that stuff so i got a little
sidetracked here Zach says already
jailbroken your iphone 5 no problems to
report battery life what jailbreak are
you using is it tethered or untethered
I've been think about doing a jailbreak
on this thing I tend to only jailbreak
don't only like jailbreaking when I'm
out of warranty especially since I've
already warrantied this phone once but
whatever Ryan said is currently building
a new pc and would like a good setup an
AMD 8350 crossfire 77 70s and a 600 watt
psu and msi 978 g46 a couple of things
with that build do yourself a favor and
take the money from the 27 70s and put
them into one 7870 or a 7950 and screw
the crossfire set up on that because
you're going to be choking that
crossfire set up with that 8350 and
putting on a 970 a chipset I mean if you
want to see the most if you honestly
want to see the most out of your your
bulldozer not your Boulder your pile
driver processor you're going to want to
get yourself a 990fx chipset and that's
good that means you're going to step
that board up a little bit and I think
you can get a 990 chipset think there's
some boards out there but about 150
bucks so it's gonna it's going to cost a
little bit more but there is absolutely
no point in cross firing 77 70s I'm just
being honest with you
there's such low performing cards a
dislocated brain or otherwise josh says
hey what should I expect when swapping
your b75 md h 34 z77 d3h we'll have to
redo the cable management no and what
would you expect you'll see the
benchmarks of your games go up a little
bit higher you may see loading times
increase a little bit I think honestly
like I already said to you before
consider honestly consider maybe
switching up that 660 for a TI model if
you can swing the difference the
difference of a 662 a TI 660 would be
like huge or possibly consider going
with that 7850 see the AMD 7850 if you
have any plans of going up to cs6 adobe
cs6 it makes use of those better now
than then Nvidia so you know there you
go the orange guy says what are the
courses for college in the computer
science area what are the courses for
college okay first of all there's like
15 different majors with in computer
science computer science as a whole as
just computers but there's programming
networking hardware there is network
security there's database management
there's programming you know there's
different languages of programming it's
so computer science itself is like
saying just think of that as the
department within the college and then
there are different specialties so
you're going to really wanted to decide
what you want to do because it's a huge
range and I can tell you right now too
when it comes to when it comes to being
a programmer there are lots of different
languages and I've talked to several
people because I'm not a programmer
first off I just want to say that right
off the bat I've talked to quite a few
people who've gotten their computer
science degrees and also gotten their
certificates and also have done courses
for programming and none of them really
felt prepared out of college for their
first programming gig a lot of it
honestly is going to be self studying
and self learning I'm sorry I'm getting
a migraine Ellison so you're gonna
you're going to want to find when you're
in class you're going to want to try out
maybe some different internships
short-term internships like a month at a
time sort of thing to get your feet wet
in these different areas and see what
you like because you may find that you
just absolutely hate programming with a
passion and that happened we hired a guy
as a programmer and he hated it and he
quit and he went doing something else
entirely with this degree so Zach says
he tends to like in pc buildings with
building with Legos yeah it's really
really easy he really is where it gets
complicated later on is with
overclocking and the stability testing
and and you know more complicated setups
like you know 2-way SLI through a sli
and all that stuff Scott says how
Coldren a blizzard yeah our main office
is up in Boston and Boston right now is
under like whiteout conditions and it's
funny because at one thirty today at
work I was a saw an email came in from
one of our guys in Cambridge and he said
apparently they're they're in a state of
emergency up there and the governor of
Massachusetts has banned pub has banned
travel so you're not allowed to you're
not allowed to drive a car and they shut
down the MBTA which is the Boston
transit authority and so that means
there's no subways no buses no taxis
none of that stuff and some of the guys
were still at the office so they're
stuck they're stuck until that band is
lifted I have no idea when that's going
to be and if the power goes out and they
got no heat and look it makes a 39
degree temperature here in the rain
really easy to deal with just saying I'm
going to get I'm going to get to the
YouTube chat in a second guys here I'm
almost done with the Twitter and then
I'll get over to the YouTube chat but we
got 25 people in here everybody
everybody retweet this or put this on
your Facebook or whatever let 70p
waking in here let's see if we can get
40 people in here that would make me
happy today okay the 40 degrees is 15
there you consider that decently warm
yes it's very warm for probably where
you live and I and I have we do have an
office up in Rochester New York which is
just south of Lake Ontario like right on
the edge of Lake Ontario which is the
they call it the snow belt so I know it
gets very cold in some parts it's a
sapphire radeon 7950 a good graphics
card for the three hundred dollars the
7950 a great graphics card for the three
hundred dollars probably can't find
another three hundred dollar card that
is quite as good because three hundred
dollars is roughly what the 660 Ti is
going to cost and it's upwards of 3 99
for the 670 and the 7950 in many
situations beats the 670 so there you go
the jailbreak is untethered using
evasion calm very easy to about five
minutes follow those files restore from
backup perfect i'll check it out i might
go ahead and just jailbreak this thing i
guess we'll see uh Scott the eighth crew
okay this is so this going to be your
build here that a a crucial ballistix
sport 16 gigs ddr3 RAM lowepro OCC
vertex 3 2.5 hundred 20 gig SSD asrock a
75 pro for FM one what are you going to
be doing for a main drive then if that
if 120 gigs going to be here OS you're
going to be 120 gig RAF that only gives
you like 114 gigs available even in
formatted state and once you put on the
operating system you're going to be down
under a hundred so I hope you have
another drive ready to go let's see a
nod Tim Oh Tim al says are you going to
have a video on overclocking yes it'll
probably be one of my next videos I'm
still working out the kinks of my 8350
which kind of answers you Elijah over
there he says did you upgrade to a 350
if so how is it um
it's an interesting question to answer
that's why I've been waiting a little
bit on the overclock and the review of
it because I'm still deciding exactly
how I feel about it because the 8120 was
a damn good processor and because i went
from the 8120 to the 8350 which you know
bulldozer has two flagship models 80 120
and 150 and pile driver has the 8320 and
8350 so if i were to make one clean jump
i would have gone to the 8320 but I went
to the 8350 which in just like I
mentioned in my video about graphics
cards a lot of manufacturers do bending
what that means is they perform tests on
these chips and they stick them in bins
based on how they performed and then
they turn those bins in a different
products so the best performers would be
the 8350 the ones that did good but not
quite as good would be the 8320 and you
know the ones that you know failed a
core failed they would unlock two of our
lock two of them and put them in as 6300
or the 6100 or whatever right so that's
binning what usually happens is the
stuff that's on the top end of the bend
of the bin like the 8350 typically has
less overclocking room than the 8320
same goes for the 8120 or that you have
80 120 and a t150 so I have barely been
able to squeeze out more megahertz out
of my 8350 versus my 80 120 but the
internal power consumption of the 8350
is a lot cooler it uses a lot less
energy and I would say I easily saw ten
percent improvement across the board of
computing time and rendering time and
all that stuff it in the end it only
cost me about a hundred bucks because I
sold my 8122 my brother-in-law's friend
and in fact I just put that in his
computer today and so for a ten percent
lower power consumption lower
temperatures across the board were worth
a hundred bucks to me but if I had to
shell out the full 200 plus tax
bringing up to like two hundred and
twenty dollars or a 2 214 dollars
whatever it would be I don't know if
they'd be worth it I'll be honest with
you I really don't and I still I'm still
on the fence about how i feel about
recommending AMD to a first time build
or a scratch build versus upgrading and
let me explain that especially since I
know you know some some people are
building computers now or just built a
computer it depends on your price range
honestly the 150 dollar build we went
straight with the 37 or the 3570k which
is funny a lot of people are talking
 about that build because of the
motherboard that went with it but people
don't realize that the motherboard and
processor combo was like barely more
than two hundred dollars so you can't
beat that build in terms of that combo
in terms of value but if his budget had
been any lower and he'll tell you when
we put this computer together on paper
weeks ago I built him out six systems on
paper six and every system was their
head of variance in some way some were
AMD build some were Intel builds some
were AMD FX somewhere amt phenom
somewhere 2500 k in fact the original
build was supposed to be a 2500 k and
they were out of stock I don't think
there was a single I 7 in there because
of the the budget but again with the
video card somewhere in video somewhere
AMD so I gave him I gave him the choice
of deciding what you know if you want to
stick with some brand loyalty versus
necessity and it's I wouldn't say it's
unbalanced some people refer to it as
unbalanced it's really not I would say
it's not a hundred percent optimized and
a lot of that does have to do with the
chipset but he's looking at switching
that out to a z77 board which really
opened things up in his choke point
honestly at that point is going to be
the 660 and I I kind of feel that it
would be a more worthwhile upgrade in
terms of in terms of general gaming I
think it would definitely be a more
worthwhile upgrade for him to take
money instead of buying a z77 board now
keeping the be 75 board and going with a
660 ti so you guys can see how when it
comes to building systems and it's
really difficult because I know it's
really easy for you guys to send me a
message on YouTube or a Twitter or an
email or Facebook message that says hey
I want to build a computer what should I
buy and it's it's so hard to answer
those questions it really is and you
know it's sometimes it's borderline
sounding like a hypocrite because
sometimes I'll recommend Intel sometimes
I'll recommend AMD and you know I flat
out said in tech addiction weeks ago
that I was not going to buy a piledriver
that they were you know i think the word
I used was abysmal but it became one of
those things where I just wanted to I
wanted to maximize what I could because
I'm way down this AMD path now I mean
I've got a crosshair v formula
motherboard it's a 240 dollar
motherboard when I bought it because it
was it was fairly new and when you spend
that kind of money on a motherboard
you're not going to just run out and
spend that kind of money again on a new
motherboard to go with another brand are
another platform like like Intel and
when I saw that overclocked the
overclocked 8350 was going toe-to-toe
with a 3770k at a similar overclock and
granted only beat it in a couple of like
miniscule tests that really make no
difference in terms of overall you know
real world seat of your pants type of
improvements the fact that it was so
close and the fact that I already had
the cross her mother board and I could
get it for a hundred bucks I kind of
feel like it upgraded to an i7 for one
hundred dollars so that's why I ended up
going that route alright let's go ahead
and go through some of these YouTube
messages here and see I'm going to go
back as far as I can here okay so as
it'll let me go as far back I guess is
someone asked if I got the 8350 yep
already said I did watching from South
Boston and it's insane they're really
enjoying the stream in this storm huh I
enjoy having you as long as you have
power and I think if you
in the stream earlier you mentioned the
story about my Boston office and came
over in Cambridge to Cambridge office
and what they they got stranded because
of the ban on transport transportation
cue evil says didn't you recommend in
the last dream to stay away from AMD
GPUs no I never said stay away would I
always say about AMD GPUs is if you're
purely gaming but you're not using them
to do a lot of rendering or you're not
using them to do any Adobe suite cs5
point 5 or older then nvidia would be
your better bet because the coup de
coeur technology is more optimized for
editing and rendering but apparently cs6
in adobe suite is much more optimized
towards a and B now so I don't know what
that's all about I had a 7970 graphics
card for a couple of days and I returned
it because it was such a bad card hey
they could have been a dud it honestly
could have been a dud but that was the
taste it left and that's that's why I
just kind of walked away from it at that
point uh let's see oh boy okay how will
PC stack up against the new gaming
consoles well you wrote councils first
of all but they're going to blow the new
consoles out of the water there's no
other way to put it even console games
are built on PC imported to console but
PC gaming will always be better but it
will to get maximum graphics will always
cost a premium so the value of console
will be there but the enthusiasts will
always go towards pc gaming and pc
gaming graphics overall are going to
look way better than even the next-gen
consoles especially when PS Sony already
announced that the ps4 is enticing
points has to do with adaptive gameplay
type it has nothing to do with hardware
so I don't know what to expect from that
comment bt48 says I read your comment
and one of the Linus's videos when he
was benchmarking the processors it saved
ten percent of my year saving time on
something like that it's quite a bit of
time yeah exactly I mean if it takes you
know if I save only in couple of minutes
every time I render something and I do
render all the time I'm in Photoshop I'm
in Vegas not just for my videos but I'm
always doing intros or
backgrounds and stuff and if it takes
less time at the end of it I made a ten
percent less time and I did a test by
the way i rendered one of my webcam mp4s
into a YouTube mp4 because I convert
right into YouTube's format so when I
upload it processes immediately when I
when I encoded that before I swapped it
took four minutes and 26 seconds I have
a picture of it when I put in the 8350
Andrey encoded that video from the raw
format it was like two minutes and 30
seconds so in that situation it was a
very big improvement but there were no
effects there was no fades there was no
text there was no transitions there was
no layers so it was of just a very raw
encode test and that saved me a lot of
time just in that one video and I figure
with how often I do it you know if over
the course of the year if I get you know
hours of my time back that's worth some
money to me how good are the best
graphics you can get right now oh boy
the the the comments are updating faster
than I can read them now I know what you
mean by how good are they um they're
really good but that's really a strange
sorry they're allowed people out there
okay my panda man said Franco walruses
hey there Jay hey Frank won't you go
back to PKA now I'm just kidding my
panda man says there are rumors what the
 I don't know what you're talking
about sorry your thing might have gone
by too fast ZX rack says some best
graphics card okay this we're entering
the question they had six eighty or 7970
s depends though if you want a dual GPU
card then you're talking the 7990 which
i think is made by gigabyte i could be
wrong on that end the 690 which are both
dual GPU cards or sli on one card well
games do I play I play a lot of shooter
games I also play some simulation games
I flight simulator 10 I really like to
kind of veg out on I used to do world of
warcraft I don't need more really the
battlefield series battlefield 3 crisis
series crysis 3 beta all that stuff so
that said if you want three weeks if you
wait three weeks to geforce titan comes
out at nine hundred dollars rumored and
apparently offers twenty percent better
performance over the 690 which is 26
eighties so i haven't even seen the
titan yet I better look into that yes
this is a blue yeti there JK JD kill
sorry update your 560ti to a 660 ti only
or do that an update your 2500 k in an
ivy bridge in new mobile I wouldn't make
the change to Ivy Bridge one because
you're depending on your motherboard it
should be able to be the same it should
it's the same socket type of your 2500 k
anyway 1155 1156 are compatible you
would see a bigger upgrade from your 560
TI to your 660 Ivy Bridge was only a ten
percent improvement over Sandy Bridge
and in fact a lot of Ivy Bridge
processors actually ran hotter crazy
shooter dude yes mulyadi okay it's
changing 7770 from weight is changing to
a 7770 from a 650 Ti it's changing what
are you asking if it's good yeah I don't
know honestly the 650 TI and I kind of
stay I hate to be a snob but I really do
somewhat stay away from the low-end
stuff and rage I just got your link I'm
going to check it out after if I might
check it out during this dream actually
panda let man loves me no I love you
more Keith Fisher says building a new
system with a sabertooth 990fx and 83 15
and it is what to expect for
overclocking with it took me a couple of
hours because I was doing a lot of fine
tuning I did get my rig my 8350 and a
990fx crosshair v formula stable up
24.99 6 bigger gig arts i could not get
five point 0 16 so 5.0 16 gigahertz
stable I couldn't do it but I didn't
play with it too too much and I had to
put the voltage all the way up to 1.5
375 to get that to even start the test
and boot and temperatures were just
going like much higher than it wanted
them to even with the amount of water
cooling that I do so but you can expect
some pretty good overclock so easily I
mean
depending on your cooling though I think
4.5 on air and 4.6 on air is very doable
it runs like 5 to 6 degrees Celsius
cooler than the bulldozer did Goku son
wants to know where I live I live in
Southern California what do I think of
the new steam box if you're talking
about the piston nobody knows exactly
what the steam box is yet and the same
made an announcement that I didn't see
the piston it's a neat little modular pc
but it's really expensive it's really
expensive the 18 is relatively new I
guess her new EP use won't come out for
another eight to 10 months you must be
referring to something I'm about PKA got
shut down we need to shut down like did
they get did oky bigot is it over or did
they actually get shut down and if so I
want details now okay KJ I xhd how did i
meet boogie Francis um he actually
contacted me first off he needed help
with some computer stuff and I helped
him and then we got to chatting and
everything would pretty well and PKA got
d dust so you mean woody himself got d
das you know um they just put a kid babe
babe whatever well ya see you know it's
stuff like that that makes me hoping I
never get big because I don't know why
people do that crap whatever I mean I if
I honestly though if I ever get like any
sort of an audience like PKA or woody or
any of them get I'm putting a sonicwall
in here and and just let them try and
de-ice my sonicwall any experience or
heard about NB GBH precision x
overclocking software yes it is the
exact same thing as it is the exact same
thing as sorry msi afterburner it's just
a different is just a different skin the
660 ti isn't exactly low end no it's not
low end at all I consider the 650 in a
650 Ti to be low end
let's say how much will you pay for a
low and medium low to medium settings on
a computer I may be doing a
five-hundred-dollar build coming up here
we're going to see what happens here
I've got a I've got a friend who has
serious need to replace a computer he's
going to want to do it on the lowest
budget possible I and I'm going to
suggest a five-hundred-dollar gaming rig
build so we'll see how that goes so
keeping that in mind is the 60 TI the
best bang for the buck card right now
probably not as much as much as I like
Nvidia and I even proudly display my 680
box on the shelf up there all the time
the best bang for the buck card right
now is probably the 7850 honestly in the
AMD 7850 my five gigahertz right now no
I'm currently running at 4.82 right now
yeah PK got d dost what he said the
show's over um when you say the show's
over you mean for the night or he's just
like bucket pj is over anyway i was
looking at him today he looks like he's
a little cross-eyed i never noticed that
anyway j do you think that technology is
still in its infancy kind of weirdo yeah
absolutely technologies won't look at
where we are today right look at where
we are we're a hundred years ago and
look at where we could potentially be in
a hundred years I think technology is
going to be one of those things where
and I need this I need a turn off skype
I don't want to keep getting noises
sorry sorry about that normally I turn
off the sounds and stuff but you all
sounds say there we go okay um I don't
think technology is ever going to stop
moving because we're gonna find new way
to come new ways to combine elements
we're gonna I mean look at look at die
sizes look at how how much die size has
shrunk over the last five years versus
the last let's say 20 years right i mean
i'm looking at i'm looking at this um
you just grab it this is old 8800 ultra
this 8100 ultra that I hang on the wall
right here look at the size of this g80
GPU right here this thing is if you
you've not seen what the processor sighs
looks like in the new um and heat
spreader covers the entire GPU you know
with processor in here if you haven't
seen what they look like on a 680 they
are like half this and as die sighs keep
shrinking performance goes up
calculation time goes down power
consumption goes down and eventually
they're going to find some whole new
material other than silicon to use for
processors so yeah I think technology is
going to constantly be advancing and I
think any single stage of technology
that you ever find yourself in it's
going to be in its infancy that's just
my opinion though ah my 500 k PK got d
dust okay I five 3570k asrock z77
extreme4 sapphire 7950 ocz 60 gigabyte
SSD 8 gigabyte Benjen Center what
modular HAF 912 western digital green
500 was 6 k stands for 1050 that's a
decent build but I I kind of wonder a
couple of things one why the 912 because
it's such a it's like the bottom end of
the half series why a 60 gig ocz when M
for 128 so G and 7950 is all right I
guess eight gigabytes of vengeance I
would go 16 but that's that's just me
but all that for 1050 is really not a
bad build I mean is that use or is that
like built do you think I could see like
4.8 with h100i yeah I do I think you
guys because the h100i I think also has
thicker tubing on it which allows for
more water flow I would say either the
60 I is best bang for buck or Sony 950 I
think the 7850 is the best bang for buck
but I think once but I think 7950 their
rage starts to be considered enthusiast
class card so it and people are going to
spend you know 350 bucks on a card in
most cases
any thought on the cooler master site on
120 millimeter or 120 m I've not seen it
obviously what I think about cougar
vortex case fans I think they're really
cool I just wish they came in another
color besides orange at least all the
ones I've ever seen were black and
orange a lot of people really like them
but they're there I mean they've got a
really neat design on the fin apparently
they really cut down on the noise and
it's a lot more it's a noise pitch that
a lot of people can contol erate I guess
so he's not gonna be doing PKA alive
anymore unless he can stop the attacks
huh well yeah I guess he could he could
honestly just put a sonicwall in I mean
God knew 100 with 1.1 million
subscribers you know he has enough money
to afford a sonicwall come on I mean
protect your livelihood at that point
all right via vast 729 see you later man
have a good night what I think is the
best budget for running crisis and
battlefield on max settings okay you
can't compare battlefield in crisis on
max settings because crisis is was was
developed back in 2011 and several years
prior to that and crisis is still in
development and gets released on the
19th my 680 my setup which is one of the
fastest AMD gaming rigs benchmarked
according to 3d marks rankings I
wouldn't say it struggles with crisis
but I would definitely say keeping it
above 60 frames per second or that
locked vsync mark is a lot harder than
it is about a battlefield god I turn off
vsync and it shoots up to like 170
frames per second and a 64 player server
but crisis it'll sit at that 60 frames
per second locked on vsync but then old
jump down to as low as like 30 depending
on what's happening but I'm not a lot of
people are quick to start because people
want to jump on the whole I want to cash
in on crisis video bandwagon so they're
all like oh my
Isis videos because i want to get views
enough a blah anyone who is serious
about gaming it's gonna know that you
never judge a games performance based on
its beta because battlefield 3 beta was
the same way in fact I think battlefield
battlefield 3 beta I think might have
even been locked at medium settings if I
remember correctly let's see any
thoughts I already answered that cougar
fans answer that okay for the night but
starting to run was well see Josh what's
a sonicwall sonicwall is a is a brand
that makes VPNs or virtual private
networks where everything inside of your
house all the way to the router works on
a on a virtual server that's completely
separate and so what what makes what
makes happen what makes do as possible
is that you know they get this
distributed denial-of-service where they
get all these two computers to just run
a simple command ping and your IP
address pain pain pain pain pain but the
thing is unless your router takes that
IP address and resolves it and sends the
information back that ping doesn't
happens all the pain happens it's it
says I'm going to throw something at you
and I'm going to see how long it takes
to come back but if you can get hundreds
or even thousands of computers to do
this all at the same time your internet
bandwidth can't handle all of that so it
freaks out and then it happens so
frequent I'm your your internet
connection stops and you've got to reset
the router in some cases and so what if
VPN or virtual private network does is
it it changes the IP address at the
router so the router is on one side of
the sonicwall so the sonicwall is like
thing that is like a virtual a really
effective firewall that completely
segregates you from the world and so
they could paying all they want but if
they don't know the VPNs address then
they'll never be able to do see you in
fact all of our networks at work use
VPNs let's see
on 1440p or 6 80 runs crysis 3 max 45
max it that's about right at four 1440
your 680 on crisis gets like 35 frames
per second completely maxed I would
wonder what else is going on with your
computer if that's the case because my
680m I AMD have no problem with it now
when I'm streaming that's a different
case but I think a lot of it starts to
come down to I think a lot of his starts
come down to processor at that point so
let's go ahead and check Twitter here
see I know we got some interactions here
okay you link me to the Titan cool I
already read that set up what are my
hopes for Titan well let's take a look
at it together I've never seen it I'm
opening it up now what I'm wondering
here first off on Titan is this okay
it's a gk110 base GPU but is it a single
GPU or is it a dual GPU for nine hundred
dollars is this okay so this isn't
considered like I'm assuming that this
isn't considered a new series of cards
however it's just a new enthusiasts card
see six gigs of ram 384 megabit or 304
384-bit memory bus I'm not seeing
anywhere where it says whether or not
it's one or two GPUs in it though if
it's one and it's beating the 619 it's
getting at X 7107 score that's crazy
that's at 1080p guys that's a 1080p
benchmark beating a lot of people 720p
benchmarks
hmm all right um coming back to the
stream here where are you guys I've got
too many too many tabs open holy crap
all right here we go yeah it's a snood
steel latest drivers okay BF 3 beta FPS
compared to the newest drivers is so
different yeah I installed the newest
drivers for my nvidia and i'm really
happy with it um it's nothing I mean I
guess I leave vsync on guys I'm a firm
believer that you should leave vsync on
because you don't want your card to do
what's called run away it's a lot of
card manufacturers will all tell you
they recommend leaving vsync on simply
because they do not want the it's not
good for your graphics card to be
running a hundred percent or even near a
hundred percent so when you turn on
vsync you'll find that your card runs
cooler it runs quieter and 60 frames per
second locked as much smoother than high
or hyper frames is anything above the
frame rate of your monitors like a hyper
frame you don't want that going up and
down no 70 80 70 75 85 90 70 when you
see that type of fluctuation in the
frames per second your eyes are going to
see that you know they're going to
perceive that choppiness much more than
the fluctuation of vsync turned on which
may only go up and down five frames per
second so best case for 50 bucks
probably the half 9-12 which is funny as
I was kind of giving it earlier msi
978 g46 motherboard FX 8350 PNY 668 gig
650 speed ram 650 speed rim ok tr2 600
watt is this a good system for gaming
the 97 TA is our is it's alright the
8350 match with the 97 TA is a little
bit weird to me if you're trying to just
if you're just doing gaming I would
honestly say
the 8350 and go with like a 6300 or even
the 4300 because your games aren't going
to take advantage of the eight cores
anyway like in fact when I'm doing
gaming and I open up when I when I open
up my monitor here I usually see only
four cores that are maxed and then
they'll alternate so you can save
somebody there which will allow you to
put a little bit more memory in there I
personally like 16 gigs even for gaming
and then you can get yourself a 660 Ti
and so then you would have a really good
AMD gaming rig let's see keep hearing
vsync you know vsync stands for vertical
sync your your monitor renders in three
segments so it you got a top hat third a
middle third and lower third and your
monitor renders those three separately
okay so what happens from there is that
if your frames per second is faster than
the refresh rate of your monitor which
is measured in a hurt so 60 Hertz would
be 60 frames rendered in a second when
your speed goes faster than that you
start to see tearing where your monitor
cannot render as fast as the signal
being sent to it and so you get tearing
where those segments of the screen don't
line up there off-centered be and
usually in a diagonal because they're
rendering at a different rate than they
can appear so you start to get what's
called screen tearing and so I always
leave vertical sync on and what that
does is it tells the graphics card don't
send me more frames than I can handle so
if you have a 60 Hertz monitor that
would be 60 frames per second if you
have 120 Hertz monitor that would be 120
frames per second and you know there you
go
I got a text my wife or a quick all
right guys get it I got 15 more minutes
here give me your questions
you had the half 9-12 you bastard I have
a box for a half 922 in there I gave I
actually gave my friend for his birthday
a my half 922 case when do I think
next-gen CPUs and GPUs will come out
haswell's right around the corner and
AMD just launched in october dirt pile
driver so i don't think we'll see
anything from AMD until let's see in
october of 2011 is when they launched
bulldozer so let's just say october of
this year maybe we'll see steamroller as
well i think we'll see before june as
well is intel's new processor best case
is the source 220 you know best case is
always going to be subjective to your
opinion so yeah yes cue evil that's what
vsync is I don't think there's been any
questions on you own Facebook here
jacobo says blam-blam-blam-blam yes
obviously you've been into it Titan is a
single GPU gk110 that's awesome then if
it's if gk110 is that good of a
performer I'm gonna start saving my
youtube money now because i'll i will
buy one in a heartbeat but makes me
really wonder what GK 41-14 is gonna be
capable of holy send me a link of
the PCB let's take a look at that yeah
and once again because if you if you
can't see it get this in my computer my
680 uses a 2 6-pin PCI Express
connectors and even my gtx 580 used a
four pin in this an 8-pin in a 6-pin and
this looks like it's using an 8-pin and
a 6-pin again so that's really cool but
I guess we'll just have to wait and see
won't we but man eight hundred and
ninety nine dollars I had to wait for
there to be a water block for it and
stuff so by the time i get it probably
will not be new
best case EP you &amp;amp; motherboard for three
hundred and sixty dollars okay Panda
you're going to start shopping on your
own for that stuff has started to become
some weird combo so now what do I think
of the Roswell for v2 case thinking of
getting I like Roswell's stuff their
gaming series stuff where as well as one
of those brands though that they make
really good stuff and they make some
really crappy stuff so but the Roswell
gaming's cases have always been pretty
good snood says he loves a bat adaptive
vsync and hated it when it would drop to
like 30 yeah but you know 30 frames per
second be synced is smoother than 30
frames per second of worth of GPU that
can't keep up honestly adaptive being
sink if you're not aware says that you
can run a faster frames per second than
60 and it will it will keep it synced I
believe anyway and then if it goes below
that no it keeps it locked at 60th I
remember anyway I don't run adaptive
vsync honestly and I and it's funny
because my second monitor right over
here is 120 hurt 3d monitor so I really
should put like battlefield with every
now and then run it at 120 Hertz would
be synced and see what happens but it's
not a 1080p monitor it's a 1050 monitor
the half X and video edition yeah but I
don't like the bright green hey Jay you
tweeted me the other day to remember I
get I honestly get a lot of tweets man
so I don't what you would have to tell
me what you said man before I can tell
you if I remember or not best GPU for
140 what does that pounds I don't know
what what that is is that euros 100 to
140 euros so I don't know what that
converts to but you can get the the
tx750 or the tx650 depending on your
needs and there they're pretty pretty
pretty good like mine's a gold series
have I seen the asus Ares to know
haven't I don't know if that is
yeah you know Rajon thing that sucks is
that the moment but Titan has a release
date the price for my 680 there the sale
value is gonna plummet so I know we'll
see I mean I sold my 5 my 584 250 bucks
when it was still going for 300 to a
local friend and then i guess if i can
make gotta happen I had to make 350 to
400 dollars just to bring them tightened
down to the price and then I have to
wonder if the titan how the world of
titans going to perform in an 8350 if
there's gonna be any sort of
bottlenecking so you know I'm always
telling people sometimes it's better
just to get a second card of your
current card once it gets cheap rather
than upgrading but I think it's going to
depend on what the power consumption of
the gk110 or that Titan looks like so i
guess we'll just have to wait and see
what's the best game i've ever played
and why probably fear one fear one was
like the first concept of the horror
game or a now horror game the horror
shooter and that it was just really fun
I like the way fear was done and I'm
still a fan of the fear franchise now
all of them so and that's why it was
just really good engaging you into a
firefight and then scaring the crap out
of you with some supernatural stuff
you're not expecting so do I ever plan
to upgrade my case the 900d looks like a
beast water cooling yeah but if you
looked at the price of the 900d I I
don't have a hell of a time paying 350
bucks for a case I really like my NZXT
switch 810 170 170 bucks you can't beat
it for you know what if what it is what
you get four hundred seventy bucks is
amazing plus I have a three-year-old and
my three-year-old is really good at
swing of things around and bumping into
things and that that aluminum finish
would look like crap after a while and
so I I doubt it what if I could pick my
dream case it would be a white powder
coated
mountain mods case and if you guys don't
know what mountain mods is just go and
look at mountain mods calm I think if
not google it and they just look like
big cubes but you can come it's
completely modular and you can have them
build it however the heck you want them
to build it and all of a sudden our
viewers drop down to 10 what the hell
happened did everyone get d dust I think
everyone got d dust yes that must be
what heaven refresh we were from like 30
down to 10 what the hell whatever that
works for me alright guys so I might get
out here in eight minutes so let's get
the last year questions up here hey Jay
you're doing a pc build in a day or two
could I shout out your video at the end
saying I want to get an 850 bill check
out yeah sure whatever if you want to
shout it out I don't mind talking about
fear made everyone leave yeah it was
weird way it was like 30 i think i was
at 27 people and all of a sudden BAM
went down to like 10 so now we're really
really close and intimate with each
other so we can get all up and inside
each other's heads how's that titan is
the same GPU is the nvidia tesla k 20 x
same shaders bus bandwidth than
everything guys says 235 wats if that's
the case then that's it 235 wats would
be amazing for the power yeah we do know
for sure that the titan won't draw more
than 300 that's a physical limitation
well that's good because that the gtx
580 was like worse than that i'm
honestly wondering where the hell
everybody went yeah that was crazy
everyone was there and then they were
gone I even see it over here on the
chart it was just like 20 it was 31
people and then BAM it was like everyone
just like left at one time that was
crazy well maybe want to start YouTube
um I didn't really want to start YouTube
to be honest with you it was kind of
like a dare almost
was I was dared to see if it would if
anyone would care would be popular and
so I tried it and then whatever and here
we are today and apparently people don't
like the lights changes that sudden like
cliff that actually really cracks me up
everybody crapped themselves when I said
fear literally I was talking about fear
and everyone left what the hell all
right five minutes I'm out of here guys
the 680 uses 195 wats before overclocked
yes and you know my whole system at low
and only draws like 350 watts something
that not too bad though oh you just JD
mega swag just got partnership today
cool man congrats partnership is fun
because then you get a lot more tools to
play with
alright guys we are wrapping this up so
if you got something you want to ask or
say do it now because I'm shutting her
down promptly at six forty-five I got
things I want to do today with my
daughter so now we're down to nine okay
how can you measure how much your system
is using in terms of power consumption
you got to get yourself like a watt
meter and you plug it your computer into
the watt meter and then you plug your
watt meter into the wall and it will
tell you exactly how many how many how
many watch every what not are being
drawn so what did you want to know wait
what did you want to know again oh I
asked what you were doing about a main
hard drive because you're going with 120
watt solid state but that will fill up
really really fast do i watch linus tech
tips live stream no i don't usually i
think he doesn't on fridays doesn't he
I've looked every once in a while at the
replay like some of it but I have never
watched it honestly I'll be I'll be
honest with you I don't really like
watching linus tech tips that much I
don't know what it is I can't put my
finger on it I mean we all know you know
we all know sometimes I don't like this
or I don't like that and you just people
say well why not you go I don't know I
just don't that's kind of how i feel
about Linus like I he's a super smart
guys and you know he's probably more
knowledgeable than I am at a lot of
things but so I don't know I just
something about it can't put my finger
on it it is 641 p.m. here Elliot play
Special Forces team x it's a good game
is that like on the steam or what in the
final minutes check out the build pcs
what happen where'd you go in the final
minutes check out the build pics i sent
you on twitter ok i'm looking here's a
link showing the piece of know
rage I don't see your Twitter links man
i really don't i'm either blind or
something because i don't see it let me
go to your Twitter page and look I want
to see this yeah I see your Titan links
and stuff but I don't see anything about
your build what I think about the snell
Zellman z11 black steel case I think I
like Salman I really do in fact when I
was at CES i went to the zalmen booth
and was just like having I was having a
lot of fun just looking at how pretty
everything is I've always liked Zelman
the only problem is there's some things
up with zalmen that's way way expensive
and they were one of the first they were
honestly one of the first like
enthusiasts heatsink makers for gamers
and they had like that circular heat
sink with the fan blew through it who's
really neat did my gift did I get my
8350 25 gigs stable nope I got it 24.99
6 and that doesn't count because it
didn't say 5 5.15 point 0 16 was the
next one mega jump on front side bus and
course 7 kept shutting off and not just
core 7 but it would switch but a core
would always quit in the middle of my
stability tests so is it worth buying an
SSD for games I got 120 gig SSD for
window I put one game on my SSD whatever
game i'm currently playing the most and
for me it's been battlefield the only
thing SSD is going to do for your gaming
is going to be increased up quicker load
times you're not going to game any
faster frames per second or anything
like that mechanical or membrane
keyboard it's all about feel if you like
the feel of membrane go membrane if you
like mechanical go mechanical so ctrl +
F build itself on my Twitter page should
be the only thing alright let's look
it's fact Twitter's just not even
wanting to load right now
alright would you say to search for
there it is okay let's take a look here
oh look at all that spaghetti wiring in
the back gotta love the spaghetti's know
that that Maximus every time I see
somebody with a Maximus I always get a
little bit jealous because I do kind of
wish I was on Intel be honest with you
is that a half 100 HAF 100 I and igf
h100i the tubes look different okay at
you that's a nice build man like it yeah
I'm a little I'm a little anal with the
wiring like some of that wiring would
really bother me but overall it's really
good job that's cool you got to show me
some of the benchmarks on that thing
derp Adele hey bro think of getting path
of 3 tonight do I have any time to play
not tonight dear Adele tonight I am
having a little sleepover with my
daughter we're letting her stay up late
we're gonna watch movies we're gonna eat
ice cream we're gonna get drunk we're
gonna do some cocaine and she's going to
have the best time of her life for being
3 and so I'm probably gonna get recorded
now or something aren't I noticed you
were revving a little pajama party with
my daughter tonight so we're letting her
stay up late and all that sort of stuff
so retweet his build all right let's do
that there retweeted if you guys want to
see his build with his Maximus and his
his specs are really nice I mean his
computer is probably faster than mine I
would love the bench market against
yours honestly do okay rage do me a
favor and we keep losing people where
all you people going I hate you all I
hate all of you ah
um okay so honestly rage do me a favor
3dmark11 just run it in performance mode
and let me see what your scores are my
score on this thing right now has been a
consistent 10,000 365 you should beat it
but I guess we'll see so anyway guys
that's it I'm two minutes over I'm gonna
get out of here if you guys have
anything else you want me to answer for
about the next maybe half hour I'll
respond on Twitter but after that that's
it I am going to be shutting her down
now and I'm going hopefully you guys
will check out my next video it's going
to likely be how to overclock your
computer and do my favorite send me
ideas for videos that you guys want to
see I've got plenty of ideas but
sometimes I like to do a viewer's choice
and you know I was kind of bitching
about my water cooling vids and my how
to build a pc vidor I thought the views
were too low on those they really are
low but I'll be honest with you God the
retention on those videos is really high
like my Pete Maya how to build a gaming
PC video is over eighty-five percent
retention through the entire video like
at the very end of the video at one
hundred percent watched it's still
eighty percent retention and then my
water cooling vids one is at 80 I think
eighty-eight percent and the other ones
the filling had a fill and bleeds at
seventy-five percent retention the
entire video I don't have any other
videos like that even tech addiction
tech edition always had the highest
retention of all my videos some of the
other ones dropped down to like forty
percent retention so whatever you guys
want to do man whatever you guys want me
to do tell me and let me give me some
video ideas and if i use your video
maybe i'll give you guys a shout out so
alright guys I'm getting out of here
thanks for the eight of you who stuck
around at the end i don't know i would
really like to know what the heck
happened there i wish you guys could see
this let's see i'm showing i'm going to
show you guys hear what it looks like on
my end anyway this is the can you see
that man you guys can't really see that
Kenya let's try another angle here come
on damn it I wish you guys could see
that but you can't anyway there's a
there's a chart right here right and you
guys can follow my finger away in this
chart is showing me what's happening how
many people are staying how many people
