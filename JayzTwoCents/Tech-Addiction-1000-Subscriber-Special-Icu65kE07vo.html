was kind of afraid of what people would
say whether or not you know are they
gonna like me are they going to make fun
of me no matter what you do or who you
are people are going to find some way to
make funny so why not you know just
ignore that and put out a channel where
people can come and get a little bit of
humor and you know I can take my Edition
and present it to you in a way that's
fun and exciting and entertaining my
therapist said it would be good for me
