if it's gonna work I don't even know if
you guys are even able to hear us
YouTube is borked that make you mad miss
me man I'm so tired I don't wanna deal
with this right now we are only 15
minutes late to the show on a show we
already have to cut a little bit short
anyway because White's going out tonight
for girls night out and I'm on I'm going
to be alone taking care of the kids
so anyway Jerry make sure you don't play
any system sounds and your camera just
disappeared again what the yeah
your camera just shut off do you see
what we're dealing with today do you see
I'm hearing I'm hearing system sound we
see Jerry's camera just disappear to get
what is happening this is a train wreck
you just can't look away from it you
can't look away from this I am leaning
back in my chair because that is just
how much I don't even carry knives
locked it back zero gravity position
whatever keep your finger on the button
just keep tapping the button train tuck
train wreck top train wreck talk there
we go
hey guys so yeah I'm doing the best I
can here i julienne I don't even want to
roll the intro yeah if I get shrill the
intro intro is going
well I haven't dropped a single frame
yet but I'm also not uploading like so
my upload is fine I've tested my
bandwidth back on the VPN too by the way
and YouTube for whatever reason was just
dropping like 75% of the frames it's
crazy
sorry turn up your mic Jerry yeah Jerry
does sound a little bit low you can turn
me up on your end I have ear your turned
up as far as you can go on my end
alright how's that is that better oh god
my ears they just exploded that's why
you wanna leave it leave it there
because I can turn it back down
alright you backed me off and you're
good you back off if I say back out my
pop filter on so it's gonna be like
hello pop will you please stop putting
your mouth against it you guys used used
you look like you went super saiyan what
the hell is going on over there I'm
using the Microsoft LifeCam presenter
for this evening now you're in a cave
you're the dark oh my god oh my god so I
guess I guess the topics are in the
title sort of the time the title should
just be just the title should be I quit
should we just change EVGA in the title
the norton since this dream brought to
you by Norton AntiVirus
the stream this dream now they're
telling me to turn my volume down cool
did you shut it guys good they still
think I'm really quiet stir me up just
just turn no I'm leaving it where it's
at because I'm looking at the meters
alright look at yours this stream is
powered by Norton guys oh my god man
that's like the opposite of what the art
turn you're going down a little bit too
slow to turn knob twisting it twice your
nipple knob just a little bit I don't
know what the way to see way to wait
minutes ooh
everyone else says I know all right you
just have the entire life be protecting
the livestream like no just turn up a
little more demo okay that concludes our
show today of Calvary your your camera
suddenly with just like Schwing on the
brightness it's I don't know what it's
locking onto it you know what it
probably is by the window up here in the
corner like well no no no it's locking
onto something dark that's why it's
brightening it it's absorbing all the
power of the Sun Oh
Jerry - quiet y'all gonna tweet out this
tree just say worst tech talk ever it is
this is by far the one of the worst tech
talks I think we've ever had and now J's
will allow time so I'm just the Internet
is basically digital schizophrenia I
wanna I want to make a video where I
literally incorporate you know I know
you did something like this already
you're like you made a video where
you're like I'm gonna take advice from
everybody I mean put it all in one video
this is a black screen but I want to
take one where I literally implement
everyone's piece of advice on how
something should be done in one video
but actually do it Oh will do it even if
I have to play that at
two-and-a-half speed video for my
channel is take everything that I've
ever done that is annoyed somebody and
just put it into one video like half the
thumbnail have huge eyes and puts up put
like put like a poop emoticon in it
because people really hated that when I
when I did that in a couple videos a
long time ago and then have the whole
video be it 120 percent speed or eighty
percent so I can put it I'll put a poop
emoji in there Scooby will put a poop
emoji in right now we're putting in the
poop I'm gonna put real poop on there
I'm ago my daughter craps her pants on
the hour every hour I got plenty of poop
at the disposal human poop yeah these
socks there's just tons of green over
there in the chat I know guys weird look
comments this week are Bork's I
apologize I kind of thought after
today's video - I was like man a bitch
using me more donations coming in than
we can even handle today and it was just
was not the idea I do because you have
to leave early tonight that we probably
won't be able to get to all the
donations today just just to let you
guys know but you you are still a little
quiet by the way looking at the meters
feedback Shh I quit I quit I quit I quit
don't quit I want to quit so bad right
now because you're keeping you keep
adjusting your mic but then you keep
swallowing it just to do the test it's
like I got a big black thing in front me
eyes open my mouth guys I saw Jerry's
bookmarks when I was up there I have
some repressed issues apparently okay
moving forward moving
we haven't dropped any frames that
that's a good thing that workers always
forward the forehead beard absolutely
the for him I called it before head
goatee the other day and the wife was
cracking up all right so um evj stuff
did a video about it dbj is having a lot
of challenges right now with some of
their manufacturing and they're fixing
it but here's the sad part about this is
so people or some people have already
received their thermal pads I suppose or
they're doing testing whatever are
they're just taking apart their card
because they want to investigate their
own issue right super say and Jerry over
there and you just see a big gold wig
right now every time he does that uh you
know what Hobbes you're still cutting me
off and you talk so it wasn't the Skype
issue there's some other underlying
problem on your computer causing that it
could it could because I'm the host of
the of the broadcast I don't know no I
started the hangout no but I'm talking
about this dream how would it know
you're inside of OBS oh you think it's
over yes may be doing it may because
it's because I have the local mic I
don't know and your system sound will
figure it out someday
maybe you're just going to fly down here
every Thursday yeah we should do that
you know I know people you know we're a
highly successful shouldn't I be able to
just fly down there first class one
weekend first class on Southwest yeah
they say they say that too okay so
what's happening now is people are
taking their coolers
part because they're curious and they're
finding I guess the latest thing now is
is there's been some claims that the
thermal pads on the memory chips are not
making contact with the base plate so
here's the first thing I'm gonna say is
I have I have over the last four years
had almost every single graphics card on
the market come come through my hands
and I could say that there's quite a few
graphics cards out there that don't have
any thermal pads whatsoever on the
memory chip so I don't think that's
gonna be as big of an issue as VRMs VRMs
is a bigger deal but here's what I
wanted to do today so I've got my 1080
right here this is the one I use in the
video yesterday that you guys saw where
I did the thermal pad application and
what I want to do right now while we're
just chatting with Jerry is I'm gonna
point the camera down I'm gonna
disassemble this thing again and for any
of you guys I'm gonna take the faceplate
off and we're gonna look and see if this
card is suffering from this WC CF tech
aka
tech tabloid website that you guys
should all trust about as far as you can
throw a Mack truck and we're gonna see
what's going on with this card I've also
got a 1070 over there but I'm not gonna
take that one apart yet I haven't
applied the thermal pads to that one yet
either so the base plate doesn't come
off the or that will caught the
faceplate doesn't come off the card when
you do the Jerry I don't want to see I
can see straight up your nose because I
think I saw your brain your brain oh my
god okay it's really small anyway I'm
gonna take this part apart we're gonna
see whether or not my card deals is
suffering from this issue that's being
reported on no reddit and whatever
outside the people love drama and
unfortunately when you when you get in
the crosshairs of someone's drama it's
really hard to get out of those
crosshairs so anyway this is what we're
doing right here there is LA so Jerry is
talking about and maybe if you
wouldn't mind reading the donation
comments as they come in while I do this
that would be a huge help if you're if
you're up to it sir I can do it as long
as I have access to them hold on I'll
have the document open yeah hub sent the
doc hey hubs you drunk yet yeah I'm
drunk I had to do that
so anyway free donation comments is the
Navy you get more than you've ever
gotten before okay guys listen I have to
be out of here donation comments are
being cut off at 5:45 I have to be out
of here because the wife is leaving by
6:15 so we we will not be able to get
all the to all of them today I apologize
but trust me they're all going into the
document Hobbs is documenting them and I
will see them so even if I don't read it
I will see it okay I will I will jump
back and forth as much as I can here
guys yeah all right so let's see here so
we got an old donation from last week
from D glutton he said I gave Jerry ten
dollars because it needs more Starbucks
great idea on the weight loss 30 years
diabetes makes weight management harder
yeah I don't want the babies I don't
want the Brimley's I got to beat his I
beat my wife that was the weight loss
more struggling but I'm gonna stay I'm
gonna stay with the best I can
don't remember the Family Guy spoof of
the the diabetes guy he's like I heard
diabetes yeah I beat my wife it's a quit
Christopher chin said first time he's
been able to catch the live stream in a
while stay awesome we will first time
here and you got this rigna set train
wreck
yeah mater mater donated a sizable $25
well thank you hey JD very cool in
question dualism 59 30 k of 4.5
gigahertz
reaches 49 seat during at folding it
home while 980ti kingpin 3 way only
reaches 41
idle delta is similar cpu is 34 while
GPUs are 26 to 27 ambien is 25 so why is
the CPU running hotter does GPS because
they do GPUs will be cooler underwater
than CPU my my 59 30k over there in
water will hit 65 when I'm encoding 65
or 70 ok so so the Kingdom liquid is
that what it is or I said he said do
loop oh yeah ok detached
Nick Johansson said J this is for the
adblock and lunch I wasn't able to buy
you what I mean lunch he wasn't able to
buy Moosa time out
Johansson I don't know he don't need you
$50 and he said this for adblock and the
lunch he wasn't like apparently he's
gonna buy you lunch
I like food look at me you can tell I
love food qhg f15 said have you
considered using ng INX as an
alternative to Skype I didn't even know
it existed until I just read it and I
know that is figuring a tinkering but
nothing you're not capable of there's a
guide on OBS forum - and it's it's not
familiar with what I'm talking about
okay well no I'll check that out because
we definitely need an alternative
because Skype sucks hangout sucks we got
to figure out why the hell J keep
trumping me on the microphone that's
something never had a problem with until
like you know probably ten streams ago
or so you're loathe said hey J I've seen
your Twitter earlier I just want to say
please don't be discouraged if it wasn't
for your videos I would not have been
re-inspired to get back into water
cooling I love your content man keep up
the great work try to ignore the haters
and the trolls you know you I know
easier said than done I was pretty
discouraged today and there done that
but the amount of support I I just put
the video out because I needed to vent I
talked to you about it before it went
live I said I just did this video I have
no expectations of it and I expect to
probably be called a a whiny little girl
and let you man you said I'm making the
Barna vlog okay before you before you go
into the next comment so here is the
thermal pad I applied in that video and
stuff you guys saw it on the back plate
right there I have to actually take out
one of those little spacers under there
I mean a mistake but I digress so I got
to take out these three screws right
here and then we are going to see
whether or not these pads are making
contact so this is the other thing that
people have been complaining about and
you'll be able to tell what's making
contact if you look you can actually see
the grease spots because this is where
the back plate makes contact there you
can see there's a good grease outline
here you can see it leaves like a greasy
residue ladies so we're gonna find out
right now now just because this card may
or may not suffer from it doesn't mean
that the problem is or isn't there but
memory quite honestly though is a much
lesser issue oh look we started dropping
frames again memory is a much lesser
issue when it comes to heat then the
and core but cooling them especially
gonna overclock them is certainly
recommended all right here we go those
three screws are off well you know
what's a good sign is the fact that the
thing is stuck to it so it's obviously
making contact with something that would
be no glues no it's not glue they're
just thermal pads
holy hell this thing is on there good
okay hold on
once you guys be able to see this as I
pull it off holy crap
hey why is the boy deferment like you're
torn oh just one more screw missed on
there oh yeah there's a screw missed
right here this little one Hey I felt it
come apart like I felt the pads so
they're touching something that one's
off here we go okay
 look they're touching at least
on this card so half of them stayed
stuck to the RAM and half of them stayed
stuck to the backplate and you can see
the ones that are stuck to the backplate
are the ones that were stuck to the RAM
still have residue on the back plate
right there so obviously they're making
contact Bolton on inflicting all the
cards but it doesn't mean that there
aren't some that are I mean there's
manufacturing tolerances there well the
call went all crazy
that would have to mean that there's a
variance if this is factual and this is
not just other people going what other
kind of can i stir up because
believe it or not there are people in
the industry that do that oh I know I
definitely know that to be true the
question is then I can hear myself in
your computer by the way the question
then is going to be is there a tolerance
in the thickness of the pads that
they're using so well mine as you can
see you can see the residue on there and
ever there they are definitely making
contact so anyway I guess I'll put it
back together now one down the call
quality just went to they were
probably ending this dream here in a
minute
oh is it dropping really bad again
listen listen to the playback it sounds
all robotic both of us hold on the pads
that they're using so Mike can you hear
that playback oh yeah I did but it was
that's weird it was smooth definitely
making contact yeah over here it sounds
fine okay never mind we'll keep going
then maybe it was this on my end
we're so anyway yeah they're black
thermal pads someone's like I don't see
the beds the other black shirt
there's no pet than yours at all J
anyway you can continue if you want to
continue yes sir I just want to get that
out of the way so Mikael caulker says hi
loved those ones printer let's see I'm
at work for the midnight release so I
won't be able to catch the show tonight
you saved me a bunch of time time
digging around cheers guys there wait
there's new Cod coming out tonight how
they missed that one because you like
butta neo said hey I'm stealing your
donation here yeah what did you both
love I've been watching you guys for
just over a year now and you both always
been amazing regardless of what the
haters think we're up here as well as a
hundred thousand across the world
we'll always have your backs thank you
sir thank you sir
robot yeah everyone's hearing the audio
quality go to jet class Tech Talk
on taksaka madness hold on hold on
listen back to the playback I think it's
deteriorating more yeah we're just we're
gonna have to end this I don't know
what's going on with the with the webs
tonight but um our upstreams guys and
everything was good so this is Google
now this this is a Google issue view so
that's why my mic sounds okay and you
sound like that on the stream that's
that's fit Google right now so I don't
know I mean is like what do I do
right yeah I mean it comes to goes I
haven't dropped any more frames it's the
Google call quality they went to
whatever you want to do a big guy I got
your back today no we're not using we're
not using Skype I see a lot of comments
like don't use Skype we're not using
Skype it's actually true
oh we were using Google Hangouts today
to see if that was any better and god
this is so far been one of the worst
calls we've ever got name it is the
worst tech talk but like literally one
of the worst calls ever so uh so we're
still live right now though right we're
still alive it's coming going do you
still use your whoo audio tube amp and
how does this help i if I'm an 8500
sounds really good at 8500 but honestly
that mayflower electronics they have
questions more power so I switched over
and started using it my whoo audio I
actually gave is a birthday present to
Greg you guys all remember Greg mr.
galaxy 10c you're chopped human Jerry
this is getting almost impossible to
understand guys I I can hear myself

audio your Yamaha audio driver working
again
because I'm hearing myself
check check test test one two just want
to see now I'm not okay I brought you
back up
I almost feel like what I'm hearing
sounds less like it sounds less like a
bandwidth issue and a send a more like a
driver was working so now I hear myself
again duck one check check
no see I know there I know they could
hear that if you guys are just hearing
live tech support now anyway are you
there yeah see I think your internet
connection is working you froze I know
