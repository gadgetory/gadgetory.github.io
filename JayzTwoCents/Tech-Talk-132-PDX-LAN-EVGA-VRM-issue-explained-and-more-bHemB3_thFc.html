why it's brightening it it's absorbing
all the power of the Sun Oh Jerry too
quiet you know get y'all gonna tweet out
this tree we just say worst tech talk
ever it is this is by far the worst Tech
Talks I think we've ever had and now
Jays whale allowed I'm and so I'm all
the voice I'm just the internet is
basically digital schizophrenia a cover
i wanna i want to make a video where I
literally incorporate you know I know
you did something like this already you
like you made a video where you're like
I'm gonna take advice from everybody
even put it all in one video which is a
black screen but I want to take one
where I literally implement everyone's
piece of advice on how something should
be done in one video but actually do it
yeah that would actually be pretty
interesting I'm gonna do I don't do get
everything done it 100 will do it even
if I have to play that at two and a
half speed you know what i should do
though video for my channel is take
everything that I've ever done that is
annoyed somebody and just put it into
one video like half the thumbnail have
huge eyes and puts up put like put like
a poop emoticon and its people really
hated that when I when I did that a
couple videos a long time ago and then
have the whole video be it one hundred
and twenty percent speed or eighty
percent so I can put it I'll put a poop
emoji in their scooter will put a poop
emoji in right now would you do it we're
putting the poop I'm gonna put a real
poop on there i'ma go have been poop
emoji oh really you know my daughter
craps their pants on the hour every hour
got plenty of poop at the disposal human
poop yeah hello with these stocks
there's just tons of green over there in
the chat
I know guys we're it look comments this
week are borked I apologize I kind of
thought after today's video to I was
like man if it's using me more donations
coming in than we can even handle today
and which is was not the idea um I do
put that out there that I mean because
you have to leave early tonight that we
probably won't be able to get to all the
donations today just just let you guys
know but uh you you are still a little
quiet by the way looking at the meters
ah feedback Shh I quick sabbatical I
quit I quit I quit don't quit I want to
quit so bad right now cuz your keep you
keep adjusting your mic but then you
keep swallowing it just to do the test
it's like it I got a big black thing in
front of my eyes open my mouth I don't
know why guys I saw Jerry's bookmarks
when I was up there I have some
repressed issue apparently okay moving
forward moving a lot we haven't dropped
any frames that that's a good thing that
work backwards always for the forehead
beard absolutely the for him I called
the forehead goatee the other day and
the wife is cracking up all right so um
e DJ stuff did a video about it EVGA is
having a lot of challenges right now
with some of their manufacturing and
they're fixing it but here's a sad part
about this is so people are some people
have already received their thermal pads
I suppose or they're doing testing
whatever are there just taking apart
their card because they want to
investigate their own issue right super
say and Jerry over there and you just a
big old wig right now every time he does
that ah you know what hob set that
you're still cutting me off and you talk
so it wasn't the skype issue there's
some other underlying problem on your
computer causing that it could it could
because i'm the host of the of the
broadcast I don't know no I started the
Hangout no but I'm talking about this
dream how would it know you're inside of
OBS oh you think it's all bs may be
doing it maybe cuz it's because I have
the local Mike I don't know and your
system sound uh we'll figure it out
someday maybe you're just going to fly
down here every Thursday yeah that's
that we should do that you know I know I
know people you know where highly
successful shouldn't I be able to just
fly down there first class under weaken
first class on southwest yeah
hey ever since on Southwest rate they
say they say that too okay so what's
happening now is people taking their
coolers apart because they're curious
and they're finding I guess the latest
thing now is is is there's been some
claims that the thermal pads on the
memory chips are not making contact with
the base plate so it here's the first
thing I'm going to say is i have i have
over the last four years had almost
every single graphics card on the market
come come through my hands and I could
say that there's quite a few graphics
cards out there that don't have any
thermal pads whatsoever on the memory
chip so I don't think that's going to be
as big of an issue as VRMs VRMs is a
bigger deal but here's what I want to do
today so I've got my 1080 right here
this is the one I use in the video
yesterday that you guys saw where I did
the thermal pad application and what I
want to do right now while we're just
chatting with Jerry's I'm gonna point
the camera down i'm going to disassemble
this thing again in front of you guys
I'm gonna take the faceplate off and
we're going to look and see if this card
is suffering from this wccftech AKA tech
tabloid website that you guys should all
trust about as far as you can throw a
Mack truck and we're going to see what's
going on with this card I've also got a
1070 over there but I'm not gonna take
that one apart yet I haven't applied the
thermal pads that one yet either so the
base plate doesn't come off or that will
caught the faceplate doesn't come off
the card when you do the Jerry I don't
want to see I can see straight up your
nose because I Lydia I think I saw your
brain legal I said ok I'm here they
continue to give us our brain only good
ok it's really small anyway um and then
you're on camera ah ok I'm going to
take this part apart we're gonna see
whether or not my car deals is suffering
from this issue that's being reported on
no reddit and whatever aside people love
drama and unfortunately when you when
you get in the crosshairs of someone's
drama it's really hard to get out of
those crosshairs so anyway this is what
we're doing right here there is a la so
Jerry let's just talking about and
maybe if you wouldn't mind reading the
donation comments as they come in while
I do this that would be a huge help if
you're if you're up to it sir I can do
it as long as I have access to them hold
on
the document open yeah hub sent the doc
one sec hey Hobbs you drunk yet yobs
drug I had to do that so anyway and we
not read pump reading com off three
donation comets is the day that you get
more than you've ever gotten before okay
guys listen I have to be out of here
donation comments are being cut off at
five forty-five I have to be out of here
because the wife is leaving by 6 15 so
we we will not be able to get all the to
all of them today I apologize but trust
me they're all going into the document
Hobbs is documenting them and I will see
them so even if I don't read it i will
see it okay i will i will jump back and
forth as much as I can here guys yeah
alright so let's see her so we got an
old donation from last week from d
gluten he said I gave Jerry ten dollars
because he needs more Starbucks great
idea yeah like on the weight loss 30
years diabetes makes weight management
hard yeah I don't want the babies I
don't want the deal for Brimley's I got
to beat his I beat my life those the I
got started the weight-loss time I'm
struggling but I'm gonna stay I'm gonna
stay with the best I can don't remember
the family guy spoof of the the diabetes
guys like I heard diabetes yeah I beat
my wife it's a quit Christopher chin
said first time been able to catch the
live stream in a while stay awesome we
will first time here and you got this
redness that train wreck yeah matter
mater donated a sizable $25 while thank
you hey Jerry cooling question dual loom
5930 cave four point five gigahertz
reaches 49 c during at folding it home
while 980 TI kingpin three-way only
reaches 41 idle delta is similar cpu is
34 while GPUs are 26 to 27 ambien is 25
so why is the cpu running hotter does
gps because they do GPUs will be cooler
underwater than cpu my my 5930 k over
there in water will hit 65 when I'm
encoding 65 70 80 pen okay so so the
kingpin gone liquid is that what it is
or I said he said do loop oh yeah okay
I'll see y'all detached Nick your hands
to say J this is for the ad block and
lunch I wasn't able to buy you
what I mean lunch she wasn't able to buy
mucha time out Johansson I don't know he
don't need you fifty dollars and he said
this for ad block and the lunch he
wasn't able bike apparently he's gonna
buy you lunch I like food look at me you
can tell I love food q hg f15 said have
you considered using uh ngin X as an
alternative to skype I didn't even know
it existed until I just read it I don't
that is agreeing a tinkering but nothing
you're not capable of there's a guide on
OBS forum too and it's it's not familiar
with what I'm talking about okay well no
I'll check that out because we
definitely need an alternative because
skype sucks hang out sucks we got to
figure out why the hell Jay keep jumping
me on the microphone that's something
never had a problem with until like you
know probably ten streams ago or so I
hear loathe said hey Jay I've seen your
Twitter earlier I just want to say
please don't be discouraged if it wasn't
for your videos I would not have been
re-inspired to get back into water
cooling I love your content man keep up
the great work try to ignore the haters
and the trolls you know let you I know
easier said than done I was pretty
discouraged today and there done that
but the amount of support I I just put
the video out because I needed to vent I
talk to you about it before it went live
I said I just did this video I have no
expectations of it and I expect to
probably be called a whiny little girl
and let you man I met what would you say
on the phone you said I'm making a barn
a blog like yeah that's what I said I
thought I was like what okay real quick
before you before you go on to the next
comment um so here is the thermal pad I
applied that video in step you guys saw
it on the back plate right there I have
to actually take out one of those little
pastries under there I made a mistake
but I digress so I got to take out these
three screws right here and then we are
going to see whether or not these pads
are making contact so this is the other
thing that people have been complaining
about and you'll be able to tell this
making contact if you look you can
actually see the grease spots because
this is where the back plate makes
contact there you can see there's like a
greased outline here you can see you to
see it leads like a greasy residue
ladies so we're going to find out right
now now just because this card may or
may not suffer from it doesn't mean that
the problem is or isn't there but memory
quite honestly though
is a much lesser issue look we start
dropping frames again memory is a much
lesser issue when it comes to heat then
vrm in core but cooling them especially
going to overclock them is certainly
recommended all right here we go those
three screws are off well you know
what's a good sign is the fact that the
thing is stuck to it so it's obviously
making contact with something that would
mean to glued no it's not glue they're
just thermal pads holy hell this thing
is on there good you hold on once you
guys be able to see this as I pull it
off holy crap okay why is the boy to for
me like you're torn which is kid one
more screw missed on there oh yeah
there's a screw missed right here this
little one hey I felt it come apart like
I felt the pads so they're touching
something that one's off here we go okay
 look they're touching at least
on this card so half of them stayed
stuck to the RAM and half of them stayed
stuck to the back plate you can see the
ones that are stuck to the back plate
are the ones that were stuck to the RAM
still have residue on the back plate
right there so obviously they're making
contact TT not afflicting all the cards
but it doesn't mean that there aren't
some that are there's manufacturing
tolerances there well the call went on
crazy that would have to mean that
there's a variance if this is factual
and this is not just other people going
what other kind of can i stir up
because believe it or not there are
people in the industry that do that oh I
know I definitely know that to be true
the question is then I can hear myself
in your computer by the way elsewhere to
be a little too close to Michael your
dad mom like the question then is going
to be is there a tolerance in the
thickness of the pads that they're using
so a mine as you can see you can see the
residue on there and everything they are
definitely making contact so anyway I
guess I'll put it back together now one
down the call quality just went to
they were probably any of the stream
here in a minute oh is it drop and
really bad again listen listen to the
playback
sounds all robotic both of us all on the
pads that they're using so am I can you
hear that playback oh yeah I did but it
was that's weird it was smooth
definitely making contact yeah over here
sounds fine okay never mind we'll keep
going then maybe it was just on my end
weird so anyway yeah they're black
thermal pads someone's like I don't see
the beds the other black sure there's no
peds on yours at all j anyway you can
continue if you want to okay can I
continue yes sir I just want to get that
out of the way so Mikhail Caulker says
hi love those ones Luke's exile on the
3d printer ah let's see i'm at work for
the co deep midnight release so i won't
be able to catch the show tonight you
