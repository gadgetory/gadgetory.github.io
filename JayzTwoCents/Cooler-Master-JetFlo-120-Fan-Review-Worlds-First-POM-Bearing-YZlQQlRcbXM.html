Jays two cents and if you can't tell by
taking a look at the nerd table
Coolermaster has sent us a lot of
goodies to take a look at and
specifically today we are going to look
at the cooler master jet flow 120
high-performance LED fans these are
brand new on the market and they're
quite the hype and we're going to see if
they live up to the cooler master man
taking a look at the packaging here
cooler master definitely spared no
expense when it comes to the packaging
they are very interested in presenting
the fan to you with the same type of
quality in the box as they put into the
fan because a company that puts effort
into their packaging has a lot of pride
in their product it's even got a little
window here that opens up with product
information you can see the fan right
through the window so you know exactly
what you're getting this isn't a white
version it's an LED with a white LED and
it is available in red blue white and
they call this a dark I think that means
there's no LED there's quite a bit of
technology in this fan though taking a
look at the back of the box here we'll
go ahead and go over some specs it's a
like I mentioned this is the white
version and it is an 800 to a 2,000 rpm
fan now this is a high airflow optimized
fan so obviously with the 2,000 rpm you
can get a lot of airflow but you
probably get a lot of noise with it too
and we'll find that out together
it is a pwm fan so it does use pulse
width modulation from your CPU to ramp
up and slow down if you have it plugged
into pwm headers but you can also use it
with a three pin or three pin to molex
adaptor hooked up directly to your power
supply or the motherboard it does
advertise 95 CFM flow rate now obviously
that's going to be at 2,000 rpms but as
you slow down because of the blade
design they're advertising that you
don't sacrifice a lot of airflow it's a
very linear curve whereas some fans have
a very steep curve when it comes to CFM
but once the RPMs drop off so does the
sleep
CFM just very sharpened these are
advertising if you look at the chart on
the inside though a very linear flow
rate which is pretty good it does
advertise 2.72 MMH - Oh of static
pressure so it is a little bit lower
than some of the other fans that we've
taken a look at here but we are going to
see exactly how these things perform
maybe we'll stick them up against a
radiator in another view of video it is
using the palm bearing what they call
their fourth generation bearing is a
poly X methylene polyoxymethylene I'm
assuming it's a type of plastic
why yes palm actually is a type of
plastic it is polyoxymethylene to be
exact
let's go ahead and take a moment just to
talk about the palm design before we
continue with the review the palm design
is very rigid in its very abrasion proof
what it does is it reduces vibration and
noise and it results in a hundred and
sixty thousand hours of life on this fan
this is the first fan on the market to
use this bearing design and it's got a
couple of unique features there's no oil
leakage and it's a self lubricating
bearing which means that you no longer
have to replace any of the fan fluid
inside of your your fan most people may
not have realized that their fans
actually have fluid inside of them
causing lubrication inside the motor so
it gives a very long-lasting life to the
fan 160,000 hours it's going to clearly
outlive most of the components in your
computer it'll be time to upgrade the
computer before you're replacing this
fan it also causes a much quieter fan
motor noise and it's got very high
tolerance and it's very precision so
you're not going to have any play in the
fan it's I'm gonna be wobbling around
the palm bearing is actually very
impressive let's continue
okay so let's go ahead and dive inside
the package here right off the bat I can
see that it is sleeved let's set that
aside and so you have your metal screws
right here which is what is cool about
that is this fan I've already taken a
look at this fan and they have
definitely spared absolutely no expense
when it comes to the design of not only
the fan blade in the motor but
everything else around the fan a lot of
companies will just use cheap plastic
shrouds for their fans and they don't
put a lot of design effort into the
shroud but this this is absolutely it's
actually quite heavy all four of these
corners as you can see here or bolted on
to the fan shroud and they are made
entirely of rubber so you've got an
entirely rubber mounting mechanism here
that is going to reduce vibration and
sound and inside of that rubber as you
can see you actually have a threaded
screw hole so you know Knowle are gonna
have to deal with possibly stripping out
the plastic as you're cranking down your
fan or you remove them and replace them
a lot and move them around in your case
or move them between cases these are
threaded so these little fan screws are
going to screw right on into that as you
can see they will screw right on into
there and they're actually a really
really tight fit so we'll just set that
aside one thing that I like is that they
are sleeved and as mentioned they are
pwm to have a four pin header here I I
do wish you had given us more link
though especially as cases you're
getting bigger in with their mod stacker
case that's just released on the 15th
this link cables not going to cut it now
they probably assume that you're going
to end up using some sort of an
extension cable if you were putting
these in something more than a mid tower
case and this would be very mid tower
case friendly with this link but if
you're using a big Tower like a 900 D
over here or the mod tower this is just
not going to cut it so keep that in mind
if you have a long cable run that's
that's going to be a bit lacking there
but the quality of this fan is up
totally amazing in the construction of
it and if you look at the fin spacing on
the fan you can see I can stick my
finger all the way through the fan and
not have to make it crooked I'm going
straight through the fans to show you
here we're going straight through the
fan which is apparently the design that
idea here is that instead of the air
having to swoop around the blade and be
scooped up the pressure of the air being
pulled in because you know the air flow
is going to follow but you know brothers
and sisters they all want to follow each
other so as Eric moves all they are
around it wants to go to can move
straight through the fan which gives you
very directional airflow and it's a very
unique design I mean there's no other
fan on the market like this this is
really neat okay so as I mentioned what
comes in the box obviously is the fan
itself 1600 rpm and 1200 rpm adapters
and they are labeled as hot because the
resistor in there does get quite hot as
you slow down the fan so the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to go
ahead and power this up at 12 volts
we're going to take a look at it and see
how noisy it is and then we're going to
check out the performance from men
okay so here's 12 volts that is so that
is pushing so much air I can't even get
that to stand up oh it's because it's
only big enough that this is like a
helicopter I have a feeling that this
thing would hover and to give you an
idea of how much air this thing is
blowing if you can hear me over it it's
actually very it's actually very loud at
2,000 rpm if I turn this towards the mic
hopefully that's picking it up that is
insane Fessenden say my air I can still
feel it it's like an air conditioner I
can still feel that holy crap okay so if
I can do this without cutting my fingers
off I'm terrified right now this thing
is going to cut my fingers off hopefully
you can see this the LED unlike most LED
fans where they're on the outside of the
shroud this is actually quite cool this
is like air conditioning I love this oh
sorry okay um the LED is contained
inside the hub and it's blowing outside
around the fan because it's going
through the blades is this is a really
cool design it's very unique so unlike
when you have an LED fan on the corners
pointing down on the blades and you get
those brighter lines that look like a
like a star this is very uniform and
that's I really like this design this is
very cool but okay let's go ahead and
get the adapters on who got terrified
I'm gonna cut my fingers off careful
okay so let's go ahead and put on these
1600 rpm and see what we've got here
okay so that's the 1600 rpm as you can
see that's still moving an awful lot of
air it's still a little bit noisy though
the motor itself isn't making any sound
it sounds like what we're hearing though
is actually the blades even 1600 rpm I
feel like is much more airflow than
anybody's going to need especially when
you have multiples of these like you add
a bunch of these in your case and you're
running them at 12 volts oh my
I couldn't even imagine and but the
amount of airflow is insane Ekans I can
still feel the air really this point
that my mic there I but I have a dead
cat on it basically hopefully you can
hear the air believe that that is
blowing that much air so let's do this
before I put on the other adapter just
turn that off as I have here just a
piece of paper with tape on it and we're
going to see just how that reacts to
really that that's at sixteen sixteen
hundred rpms I got like a flag just
waving in the wind oh that much air
going through there let's go ahead and
try the silent mode the 1200 rpm now
we're talking that is a very acceptable
noise level but look at the amount of
airflow coming through that fan still
and that's actually not that noisy I
point that wow I mean the amount of air
I can feel just it's just this big wave
of air all the way out to here at 1200
rpm at this low rpm and remember this
can go all the way down to 800 rpm and I
didn't say what the starting voltage was
starting voltage on this is not listed
here it takes four point eight watts
though at 12 volts and it's a point four
amp so you're going to want to keep that
in mind it is a much higher wattage fan
than some which will mean that you can't
jumper as many of these off of a single
header if you want to go that route okay
now just for giggles let's go ahead and
run 12 volt all right 12 volts
incoming
that is just sick what is it it is
pushing so much air guys I cannot get it
just it wants to fall over I cannot get
it to stay up that is how much air it is
actually turned into a propeller not a
fan this thing will move an airplane so
there you have it guys when it comes to
fans the jet flow 120 is an amazing fan
I love the led the amount of quality and
craftsmanship that's gone into the
creation of the housing for the fan and
even the fact they've got teeny tiny
little brackets here our support here
for the motor that way you get maximum
airflow out of these things if you're
looking for a very versatile fan that
moves a lot of air at low rpm but gives
you the option to go high rpm if you
want it long-lasting very acceptable
noise ratio and just looks really cool
you definitely don't want to pass up on
the jet flow 120 s these are these are a
great fan they really are if only they
came in LED yellow then they might
replace the Corsair fans I have in my
case and even then these might make
their way onto my lower radiator we'll
just have to wait and save and if you've
liked this product here from
Coolermaster go and check out their
website at coolermaster calm and as I
showed them beginning this video we have
more stuff from Coolermaster that we're
going to be showing we're going to be
putting these also on the 240m 120
millimeter all-in-one cooling unit we're
gonna be checking out the V 700 power
supply it's a gold rated platinum
specified or platinum spec power supply
and we are also going to be taking a
look at the control rx mousepad that all
of this has been taking place on and the
N 600 mid tower case for less than 80
bucks behind me so guys as always if
you've enjoyed this video you know what
to do and I will see you guys in my next
video and until then go and do something
fun with your computer do something
techie and tweet it to me down below
I'll retweet the ones that I like I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
