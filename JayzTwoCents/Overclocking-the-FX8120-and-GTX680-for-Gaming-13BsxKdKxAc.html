where today we're going to show you some
real-world benchmark results of
overclocking my process or my
motherboard so you can see how that
really equates to frames per second and
performance of your processor in your
video card let me start off by saying
this is not a tutorial about how to
overclock so you're going to have to
look somewhere else if you're trying to
get information about how to overclock
there are just too many variations and
too many different components out there
for me to possibly give you information
about how to overclock your setup and if
you haven't already figured out by the
images I'm showing above of the BIOS
from my motherboard there are a ton of
settings that you can go in and mess
with and you can cause permanent damage
to your computer if you do something
incorrectly so be careful my motherboard
is a Asus Republic of gamers crosshair
vive formula and I hope this motherboard
because it has I think the greatest
feature set out of any of the stock
motherboards so it gave me control over
every single aspect I could possibly
need when it comes to overclocking and
the processor I'm using is the AMD FX
8350 and I always save a little bit of
money when it comes to processors
because I always overclock the out
of them and I do the best I can to save
money and pull it back out of the
processor through overclocking which is
the whole reason I always overclock
spend less get more performance by
pushing it to the brink this image I'm
showing now consists of a couple of
programs that I use to do monitoring of
the temperatures and voltages of my
various components of my computer top
left there is my what is that a fan
control software speed fan that's it
that's my speed speed fan software and
that's what I use to control my fans on
various temperatures and other things
the bottom left is MSI Afterburner
that's what I use to overclock my video
card right now everything is set to
stock for all of the CPU tests the red
piece of software in the middle there is
CPU Z that is a CPU informational
program
everything you need to know about your
processor it shows you voltage
multiplier the frontside bus speed the
memory cache memory caches it makes
sense let's see the l2 l3 cache when it
comes to the processor everything you
need to know including stepping all of
that stuff so that's what I'm going to
be showing you where the clock speeds
are and the piece of software on the
right is hardware monitor that shows all
of the temperatures all of the voltages
everything going on in my computer in
just one space right there and that's
what we're going to use to compare some
of our temperatures of before and after
overclocking at stock settings the
processor has a throttling function
where it will actually slow down to 1.4
gigahertz when it's not seeing a load it
does that to save power and to save
temperature but as you can see right
here once we loaded up the 3d mark 11
software ramped right up to its top
speed of 3.4 gigahertz temperatures look
pretty good CPU sockets at 35 degrees
Celsius cores are sitting right around
the mid 20 degrees Celsius and things
are looking pretty cool and comfortable
right now in stock speeds showing you
right here that the graphics card is at
stock speed my particular card does ramp
up to one point one to four gigahertz
even though it's advertised as 1075
megahertz so who knows so what I'm gonna
do now is I'm just going to show some
various frames per second capture here
some of the screen of what it looks like
when it's doing its benchmark and we'll
just kind of skip through this here and
we'll circle back at the end of the test
this next test coming up here is the
physics test and on 3dmark 11 all
physics scores are calculated by the CPU
this is a CPU load there is no load on
the GPU whatsoever so this is where the
overclocking of the CPU is really going
to show and as you can see right here
I'm only getting between 14 15 frames
per second I think it maxes out
somewhere around 17 18 maybe tops
it's very jittery very choppy and this
is where you know the CPU speed really
really comes in handy and I think we're
zooming in here yeah sixteen point eight
frames per second very poor very choppy
very bad now good last thing that three
mark eleven test is a combined test
between the CPU and the GPU the CPU is
doing all of the physics and the GPU is
doing all the tessellation and other
graphics enhancements to the video here
so the frames per second here is looking
like we're right around nineteen frames
per second nothing impressive this is
usually where AMD just falls on its face
especially in the stock scores and that
is blatantly obvious with the eighty two
hundred and forty four score when it
comes to the AMD processor and that
honestly just has everything to do with
its poor physics performance look right
there at the physics core it's only
fifty five twenty the graphics core is
outstanding at a ten thousand one
hundred forty seven but the combined
score is only a forty nine forty nine
what that means is the CPU could not
keep up with the GPU and it is pretty
obvious their stock speeds are nothing
to be proud of we are right in the
middle of the pack there as you can see
by the yellow graph and there's just
nothing spectacular at all about that
performance from the CPU in the
summertime due to the higher heat I run
my CPU right around 4.7 gigs as you can
see right here from three point four to
four point seven we're talking 1.3
gigahertz overclock the temperatures are
idling right around 37 degrees Celsius
the GPU is still sitting here at stock
speeds
nothing spectacular there it is the GTX
680 since I never mentioned it in the
beginning my cores are idling right now
at 20 degrees Celsius I don't really
think that's accurate because it jumps
between 20 and 25 I think it just has to
do with a temperature sensor on there
it's not being very accurate but you can
see fresh boot 37 minimum 38 maximum but
what you might be interested to realize
here is that the frames per second in
the test didn't really improve that just
goes to show that the GPU is taking on
the majority of the load when it comes
to gaming and prepend graphics
performance especially in a synthetic
benchmark like this where it's
pre-programmed it's going through the
same function it's always using the same
process and I'd like to use synthetic
benchmarks because they are a good
control and you get the same result
for the most part and you can really
compare the differences but as you can
see through these tests here they're
really the same as test number one at
the stock 3.4 gigahertz speed but when
it gets to the physics test
it's a whole nother story if you
remember from the first test our physics
core at the stop clock maxed out it
right around sixteen point seven frames
per second but now if you take a look
here we are just flying right past that
up into the 20s 21 everything looks a
lot smoother it's a lot more fluid and
we are at twenty two point two frames
per second so that's already eight
frames per second increase and that's
pretty amazing considering it was
absolutely free power and the combined
test is absolutely no exception as you
can see right here already getting much
higher frames per second things are
going much smoother in the test and that
was by doing nothing more than
overclocking the CPU itself and the
graphics card is not overclocked at this
point so so we managed to jump from
eight thousand two hundred and forty
four to nine thousand seventy-two that's
a pretty good jump considering this is
all free power it just was by doing
nothing more than overclocking your
processor and we went from a 55 20 to a
70 to 71 physics score and you'll also
notice we jumped up an entire bracket on
the phone
chart and last but not least I'm going
to take my msi gtx 680 graphics card
reference model which is water-cooled of
course and I'm going to push this thing
to 1.3 gigahertz which is the max stable
overclock I've been able to achieve to
see what happens if you use a
overclocked CPU in conjunction with a
overclocked GPU I push my graphics card
to a + 176 megahertz which brings it to
an even 1.3 gigahertz and an additional
311 megahertz on the memory and from the
very first frame of the very first test
it's extremely obvious that we are
getting a much higher frames per second
I think we're getting an average of 10
additional frames per second by doing
nothing more than moving some sliders on
the MSI Afterburner software you got to
keep in mind though that graphics cards
do get extremely hot especially when you
overclock so one of the reasons why I'm
able to get such an extreme overclock it
make it stable it's because I am running
it on water and the maximum temperature
that my graphics card ever got during
any of these tests was 51 degrees
Celsius and that was with my office door
shut and the ambient temperature
reaching 83 degrees in this office so
normally if I keep the room open and
have some ventilation in here it doesn't
get anywhere above 45 degrees as you can
imagine there are some improvements when
it comes to the combined test since it
is using the GPU as well as the CPU that
is very smooth it looks like a movie
it's very fluid we're gonna hit it looks
like 26 frames per second or 25.9 so
let's go ahead and take a look at how it
did live it's pulling up the results 3d
mark 11 and I think we're going to break
10,000 yes 10,000 15 so we gained
another 800 or so P score by simply
doing nothing more than overclocking the
graphics card so by squeezing out extra
performance that's already in your
processor and your video card we managed
to go from a low 8,000 to just over
10,000 on the peace core and all the way
up to the maximum bracket we are in the
top percentile when it comes to
performance and we didn't pay any extra
money for it whatsoever unless of course
you're going to count the additional
cooling needs that you are going to have
to take into consideration overclocking
does add temperature it does add voltage
and so you need to be able to deal with
that heat so I hope this gives you a
little bit of an expectation of what to
expect if you're going to look into
overclocking either your video card or
your CPU or both I wish you all the best
when it comes to your overclocking
results and that you find some free
power like I did I hope you've enjoyed
