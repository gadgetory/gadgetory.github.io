gonna talk about a topic I haven't
touched in quite a few years actually
the last time I did anything similar to
this video was back when I had my 3770k
system and I was trying to see where
bottle necking started to intrude in
battlefield 3 but we're doing a little
bit more broad testing today and we're
gonna see what happens when we take our
8700 K and we do a full gamut of testing
at 6 cores 12 threads no overclock or
anything just out of the box settings
we're gonna cut it down to a 4 core and
then a 2 core and we're gonna see if we
get any sort of fall-off telling us
whether or not the CPU race we've seen
over the last couple of years has
actually benefitted to a better gaming
experience for gamers across the board
with its adjustable pmw 3367 16,000 dpi
optical sensor for RGB zones 9
customizable buttons and offering both
wired and wireless operation are only a
few reasons why the corsair dark court
RGB should be on your shortlist for your
next mouths purchase check out its full
list of features by clicking the link in
the description below so like I
mentioned in the intro I haven't done
this in a while last time was a 3770k
with battlefield 3 and that was just one
title that painted one picture and
didn't give really any sort of substance
because it was it should have been this
battlefield 3 bottleneck with a low end
CPU we're not actually gonna be checking
for bottlenecks today reason for that is
where I've only got one CPU that I'm
testing with an 8700 K that I'm going
into the BIOS on Asus and changing the
configuration of how many cores are
active under if you guys knew you could
do that most motherboards that are
overclocking friendly can also allow you
to go in there and start turning off
course you can do this testing yourself
at home if you want to see if your CPU
will start to bottleneck your GPU as you
disable course so we did this three
different ways we did 1080p testing and
4k testing in 9 different titles heaven
benchmark Metro last light dirt rally
far cry 5 rise of the Tomb Raider shadow
of Mordor hitman time spy and fire
strike the reason why I chose those
titles it's a good mix of new and old
demanding titles
shadow of Mordor also had the HD HD
texture pack which are the HD pack
whatever they call it which bumped up
some demand a little bit but not too
much that was a very demanding title
back in its day far cry 5 being the
newest title on this list which is known
be fairly CPU and GPU intensive but it's
also important to note I'm using the
built-in benchmarks on these tests
because having something on a rail is
the only way to get consistent results
to actually measure any sort of
difference but the actual gameplay
experience could definitely differ from
the actual benchmark also to all of
these titles I have pretty much
everything maxed out so what we're
looking for here is how the game
performance and FPS average FPS scales
as we start to either add or remove
cores now hyper-threading is on in all
of these tests so essentially what I've
got right here is an 8700 K fully
unlocked not overclocked but all cores
are synched so technically it's an
overclock because all cores will go up
to the turbo clock weather rather than
just one or two cores and the ddr4 is
running at its native 21 33 megahertz
not a higher like 3200 or anything like
that
and the Titan XP in here which is also
not overclocked but does have the fan
curve cranked to make sure that thermal
throttling does not become a factor we
want to keep things as consistent as
possible so with that said let's go
ahead and jump into the benchmark so you
guys will see the slides and then we'll
do some live gameplay because the slides
only tell part of the story
so the results actually surprised me
enough to where I had only done two core
and six core testing undecided to go
ahead and do all the tests again with
four core and of course 4k and 1080p in
all of these titles because the results
were a little bit surprising where I
think we're gaining obviously in those
slides you could see things were very
very close within margin of error and at
a point which the user would probably
never notice there was a difference
headed in a blind taste test between a
two core four thread and a six core 12
thread in any one of these titles
what would the exception of Metro last
slide I mean I think we saw weather was
a huge FPS difference one hundred and
forty two point nine five with two core
and 1080p versus two hundred eleven
point eight nine that was obviously our
biggest reduction and then we had in
hitman one hundred and thirty seven
point three two with a six core versus
eighty seven point two two were the two
course that was a 50 FPS hit in 1080p
but in 4k once we do high resolution
high settings and were asked asking the
GPU to do so much the GPU slows down to
a point to where even a slower CPU like
a two core four thread is not being the
limiting factor in the amount of FPS
that we're getting now also to it's
important note this is a sixty Hertz
panel and pretty much every single one
of our results here was above sixty
which means we would have probably never
noticed it had we had vsync or g-sync
this is a g-sync panel if we had those
features turned on then we would have
just seen a lock 60fps every single one
of our tests and it wouldn't
mattered but if you're running a super
high refresh rate panel like 144 200 or
even a 240 like the see sonic panels
then you would have probably started to
notice a little bit of difference there
in terms of these 50 FPS variants 2 core
and 6 core were not as far apart as I
was expecting them to be 4k I expected
them to be very very similar the four
core and the six core obviously very
very close very hard to distinguish a
difference between them I'm sure the
sharp the charts the chart the charts
showed that so yeah but there's another
thing we have to test here we need to
test for things like dips and stutters
because what this these charts don't
show you is in a perfect scenario yes
the FPS is very similar but what happens
if you start running a background task
what if there's a background update
taking place with Steam is upload
updating or installing something in the
background if you have that enabled what
if you have Google tabs open you know
Google uses GPU as well and Google can
actually if you have a lot of tab open
the tabs open chrome can actually be
quite intensive on your CPU so there's a
lot of different things here that this
test doesn't actually show you because
they were perfect examples so let's go
ahead and turn around let's get into a
game or two here in real time to look
for things like dips and stutters
because that's gonna affect your overall
gameplay more so than any average fps so
here's our FPS counter right here here's
a graph for you guys to see any sort of
crazy dips and stuff we are actually
rendering the game now see I'm looking
around here and this is our GPU
utilization now you'll notice this
number doesn't pay at 99 like it
typically does in games because as this
number goes up which is a CPU usage the
GP usage is going to go down that will
also be reminiscent here of the
temperature the higher this number gets
the higher that number gets the higher
these get the lower these gets so that
is effectively what I hate to even call
a bottleneck but it kind of sort of is
but you can see we're still getting an
awful lot of fps right here even when
our GPU usage is not completely pegged
so the helicopter view just turned to
point at the ground and look at that
look how far at PS came down into the
60s right so this is definitely going to
be an interesting experience here I
think all right so now I'm actually able
to free look obviously we look down or
FPS goes up
look at the sky or FPS goes up look
straight ahead so it starts doing things
yeah so as I look down loo that our fps
is still really high it's not really
redrawing any images but there are CPU
just sitting in the game here I always
heard that this guy chops down trees for
a living I'm pretty sure look at this
right here I mean depending on where
we're looking I'm wondering though how
much of that will change if we do like
you know obviously four core or six core
all right so we're back in the same
airplane or helicopter see as we were
before but notice this now our GP usage
is much higher because our CPU is
definitely playing hot potato with the
cores but look at how divided up that
workload is amongst the CPUs so far cry
5 and a lot more FPS here than we had
before a lot more consistent - far cry 5
definitely appears to be one of those
titles that is taking advantage of the
multi-threaded workload well we're gonna
wait for right now is the part where it
turns and looks down because that was
where it dipped into like the 60fps 50
FPS ok here we go
let's look at that we look down and we
still dipped for sure but nowhere near
as low as we did before last time it was
well into the 50s CPU is still handling
a workload and passing it around as
multi-threaded workloads are supposed to
do but it's pretty obvious now that far
cry 5 is an example of one of those
titles that will definitely give you a
better experience with multicores
but we're not seeing seeing nearly as
many low dips though on the four core or
the two core for thread we were seeing a
lot more of these low dips so what you
can take away from today's video is the
fact that CPUs are definitely improving
and that's because of the competition
finally taking place in the PC space I
would love or the CPU space rather I
would love to see this level of
competition taking place in the GPU
space so obviously we're still waiting
to see what's coming on the horizon for
both Nvidia and AMD maybe we'll learn
some stuff at Computex and what's coming
I have no idea if you feel I should do
this video with an AMD processor let me
know which one you think I should use
we're in an interesting place with AMD
because we just had new hardware launch
for the Rison 2nd gen I guess they're
kind of calling it's more like a 1.5
but I'll do it again maybe I'll take
something like a 2700 and then our 2700
X and shave it down to like an 8 a 6 and
a 4 I don't know we'll see you guys let
me know what you think I should do my
prediction on that it would be very very
similar to what you saw today just
different max FPS or average FPS numbers
but the same type of scaling between
resolutions because as we've seen games
are definitely taking advantage of
multi-core more than they were say five
or six years ago
meaning that you no longer have to worry
about what CPU you get for your gaming
experience just make sure that you pair
your GPU and your panel I think pairing
the panel on the GPU is more important
than pairing the GPU and the CPU because
this setup makes no sense with a 60
Hertz panel if we're playing it in 1080p
but it makes perfect sense if we're
playing in 4k and even the two core for
thread variants of what we just did
right here with a titin XP and a 4k
panel would have made perfect sense but
not in 1080p anyway guys if you think I
should have done this test differently
or you think we should revisit something
here that we may have missed let me know
in the comments below I like to kind of
tweak our test to try and hit the center
mass of the audience on I'm trying to
get videos that are relevant on these
testing topics but let me know what you
guys thought in the comments below we'll
hope to see you guys at Computex we'll
be uploading a quite a bit of content
giving you a very unique hopefully a
unique first-person type of perspective
of what it's like to attend the world's
largest PC Expo but with that said guys
it's time to go thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
