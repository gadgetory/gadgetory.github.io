host Jays two cents and we're doing
things a little bit differently here
today I thought I'd go ahead and give
you guys just a interesting little intro
here and showing you where all the magic
happens when it comes to my studio and
the things that I do to bring you things
that I find interesting in the world of
technology so don't go away we've got
Thanksgiving to talk about we've got
things to be thankful for and we've got
AMD making its way back into your house
welcome back to tech addiction guys I
hope you like that little intro there
where I showed you a little bit of my
studio / of this / game room / to a dog
house when I'm in trouble with my wife
and this is a pullout futon I can't
sleep on it if I need to I'm gonna try
to get to this really fast I am still
stuffed from turkey day there was black
friday shopping I am beat if it wasn't
for the fact that i've had three
monsters prior to making this and to
starbucks i probably would be passed out
right now and for all i know i'm
probably gonna pass out during this
video because i feel like i'm in a very
very high sugar rush right now what are
we talking about I've got to say right
off the bat that I am just completely
thankful that 750 of you in the last
three months have found it in yourself
to subscribe to me and watch me because
I had no idea where this was going to go
when i started youtube and if it
continues to go forward and get bigger
great and if it stays right where it's
at so what I'm having fun doing this I
hope you're having fun watching and I
just wanted to go ahead and get that out
of the way and say happy thanksgiving
and I'm vehicle to every single one of
you so it's only been a little over a
week since black ops 2 is lunch and I'm
sure a lot of you have already played
the game for hours upon hours come home
from school play the game come home from
work play the game site sleep black ops
sleep black ops I will play black ops
and I will sleep at school I bet you
haven't spent as much time as one guy
setting a world record for a hundred and
thirty-five hours straight he was going
for the world record he was going to
beat the previous record of a hundred
and twenty hours and he did it by 15
hours I have to wonder if whether or not
some of you guys could have done that
because you see the way it works with
the Guinness Book of World Records is
you're allowed a 10 minute break every
one hour and you are given the ability
to skip breaks in order to take a longer
break in the future so if you say I want
to go for hours straight and not take a
break you get 40 minutes or potentially
as much as four hours of data sleep so
if you guys want to go ahead and just
skip all your brakes play all day like I
bet a lot of you
you and then just go ahead and take
three or four hours sleep later and to
just keep going and eat while you're
playing sounds to me like a lot of you
probably already broke in that world
record but either way I haven't even
played the multiplayer yet so maybe I
have a world record for all I know going
the longest without actually playing the
game as most of you may know and some of
you may not because a lot of my viewers
are actually from other countries this
week on Thursday we celebrated
thanksgiving and that's the day where we
get all of our family together and we
pretend to be thankful and we tolerate
each other for a short amount of time
and you try and limit how many fights
you having one day but one of the staple
dishes that you have it Thanksgiving
dinner is a giant turkey and I don't
mean me I mean there was an actual
Turkey on our table I wasn't the only
turkey and my Thanksgiving use the jab
Turkey I really just told a turkey joke
by the way if any of you out there are
good joke writers go ahead and contact
me because I could seriously use some
content I am not very good at cut to
telling jokes but check out this video
right here where supposedly a guy took
five high intensity flashlights and
focused the beams right there on the
turkey and cooked it they cooked it with
flashlights you know it's time lapse
inand doesn't it doesn't look like
anybody tampered with the turkey but if
you look carefully you can see there is
a bit of a cut there is a bit of a
little glitch in the video there where
somebody could have potentially you know
pulled a fast one over on us or maybe
this is just a really good photoshop or
after effects but either way it would be
kind of cool to think about the fact
that you could probably cook a turkey
with at least a few halogen lamps I
would think you know you focus the light
on it long it up and then there you go
can have tech addiction without having
something to do with some sort of Turkey
besides myself so with the launch of
windows 8 staples is put out a brand new
commercial where they talk about their
you know free tech advisor their free
training with any PC that you buy that
comes pre-loaded with windows 8 free
windows 8 training from your son can you
help me with something nope good talk or
free windows 8 training when you buy a
computer at Staples another way staples
makes it easier to upgrade I found this
commercial will be absolutely hilarious
cuz this is how some people would say I
act at work you come and ask me for help
no but some people are saying that this
is staples way of saying that Windows 8
is harder to use than Windows is
intending it to be have any of you use
Windows 8 tell me what you think about
it I haven't made the jump it I'm afraid
to I'm going to wait for service pack 1
before I go to windows 8 but i'd like to
hear how you guys feel about it is easy
to use or is this commercial true where
if you buy it you're good
need some training with it regardless of
how tech-savvy you may be so quite a few
of the previous Tekken diction episodes
have included things about AMD no longer
interested in making performance desktop
processors no longer interested with
trying to compete with Intel and you
know only focusing on their server type
processors and their integrated GPU
processors which are believe it or not
the a series and the a-10 are really
better than intel when it comes to the
integrated graphics but you know AMD is
in January planning on doing some
reorganization of their company to try
and find just the right track and their
niche where they can get a real grasp on
the market and believe it or not Andy
may have silently already made some of
these changes without telling people
because it just came to light that the
Wii U is powered by AMD and if you watch
me on a regular basis you already know
that I'm an AMD power user but if you've
got a wii u what's the performance like
is it smooth they say that it's uh you
know the we finally and matured with HD
and better graphics so what do you think
how's the wii u perform i had to go
ahead and share this this week because
we know there's been so much going on
with samsung vs apple you know and vice
versa and the patent wars and stuff but
i just have to go ahead and report that
apple has hired samsung check it out fam
thumb so apple didn't actually hire this
guy because his name was samsung then
what i'm surprised that samsung hasn't
jumped on this guy and tackled him and
and sued him for stealing their name so
Google recognizes that if you're a
technology company in today's age there
is a really volatile situation when it
comes to our patent office you see the
united states patent and trademark
office is you know really liberal when
it comes to handing out patents you
apply for something you almost always
get it as long as nobody else is applied
before but you see google feels that the
US patent office is making things
difficult for real companies doing real
things in the world google is on an anti
troll campaign where they are seriously
urging the US patent office to go
through and really comb through the
patents to make sure that there's none
in there that are truly stopping the
progression of technology and that
there's no patents in there held by no
reputable companies that are blocking
big companies from actually doing work
from bringing progression to the
consumer google themselves even have a
website where you can go and find a pen
if you'd like to see if something is
patented you could go to their website
and actually do a patent search and see
who owns the pen when is it its fire
woman filed what's the patent number you
know all of that information and that's
actually being used by a lot of trolls
who truly never done anything to find
out whether or not
something that is big in the community
or big in the world is patented if it's
not trolls are going and filing patents
on these getting issued the patent and
then turning around ensuing the
companies that actually created the
technology so Google's pissed about this
and a lot of it really stems from the
things that Apple's doing and samsung
and motorola and they're ready to get
sued by a lot of these smaller companies
that are claiming that they're stealing
their technology but with the way the
system works today it really comes down
to who files first and whether or not
they get the pen and then what they do
is they start bombarding these big
companies with lawsuits hoping to get
settlements just for fast cash and it's
not right so Google's anti-troll
campaign is really pushing for the US
Patent Office to make some serious
overhauls with the way patents are
issued out I have to agree with this
entirely you see the US Patent Office
was all about taking technology and
ideas so you can get a patent on an idea
not necessarily something that's
actually made but taking ideas and
protecting the intellectual property of
who designed or came up with the idea
and the concept but on the flip side
it's also meant to keep technology and
ideas moving forward you're not allowed
to get a patent on something that stops
a progression of technology and what's
happening here is companies are going
and they're just doing these masks
blanket patterns where they're trying to
stop other companies for being able to
move forward and that's not right so the
US Patent Office and one hundred percent
with you on this google the Patent
Office seriously needs to go through and
really comb through these patents to
find out which ones are frivolous and
which ones are truly stopping the
progression of Technology and that just
depth that deserves its own rant video
because that just sort of pisses me off
all right guys it's time for
technologies dumbass of the Week so for
the last two weeks I've brought you
dumbass it didn't include criminals but
guess what we're bringing the funny and
stupid criminals back to tech edition in
Denver there's a privately owned game
store kind of like a kind of like a you
know an enthusiast no hobby shop where
they sell dungeons and dragons and magic
the gathering but video games and all
that sort of stuff too and this guy
comes in and demands to the clerk that
he'd give him all his money and the
clerk says no I got the guys like what
what do you mean no I i I'm robbing you
the clerk says I don't care that ain't
cool and and then the crooks like but
you don't understand how this works I
come in and you know I say give me all
the money and you say here you go don't
hurt me and I say thanks have a happy
Thanksgiving and you know I I just get
on my way but the owner of the store
said
oh I'm not giving you any money that's
not cool that's not cool little man back
that's jacked up bro so the crook is no
he's he's kind of put on the spot he
doesn't know to do is like but that's
just that I I robbed the convenience
store and and the the bank right there
and and and they gave me money the guys
like as a problem I don't care that's my
money yeah so the crooks like I'm fine
screw you and he leaves and that gave
plenty of time for the police to arrive
because the guy pushes the little you
know I'm being robbed button under under
the counter or whatever and the police
start to show up so the guy gets in his
car and he takes off and he flips his
car over and lands in some persons lon
and it gets apprehended for all three
robberies the clerk only had ten dollars
in his drawer he stood in the matter of
principle and I believe it and this guy
is technologies dumbass of the Week for
trying to rob a game store you see you
don't mess with gamers no because we've
got some mean thumbs and you know we can
thumb wrestle you like you would never
believe alright guys it's all I got for
