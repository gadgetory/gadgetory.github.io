you are watching Jays two cents bringing
you videos to try and educate and
empower you to make better decisions
when it comes to PC and Technology
buying and today we're going to go ahead
and discuss the concept of future
proofing so far in the short amount of
time that I've been doing YouTube videos
regarding PC building and Technology
subjects I can't even name the amount of
times I've been asked about how to build
a computer that's future proof hey Jay
I'm gonna spend $1,000 how can I future
proof my computer hey Jay I'm gonna
upgrade my graphics card which graphics
card is future proof few things we have
to talk about when it comes to the
concept of future proofing one you've
got to go ahead and forget the term
completely there is absolutely no
concept of future proofing when it comes
to computers or computer components I
think a better way to think about it
would be the concept of cost efficiency
because what you want to do with cost
efficiency is you want to get the most
out of your money some of the most
common things I'm asked about when it
comes to future proofing is should I go
AMD or should I go Intel or should I go
hard-disk or should I go solid-state is
it worth it and probably the most common
question I'm asked every single day
should I go with AMD or should I go with
Nvidia now you're gonna have to ask
yourself how long do you need the
hardware to last you because you see
software games rendering software
Photoshop Adobe suite all of this stuff
is going to evolve eventually beyond
your current hardware so if you've got
$1,000 to spend how long do you have
before you can drop more money into your
computer and naturally the amount of
performance that you're going to get out
of your system is going to directly
depend on how much money you put into it
now one of the things you have to
consider - when it comes to the concept
of future proofing or as I like to say
say it with me now cost efficiency if
you only have a thousand dollars to
spend today and you know you're not
going to be able to spend any more money
on this computer for any reason inside
of two years it's got to last you two
years you're going to want to go with
the best bang for the buck now for a lot
of people people are going to blindly
say go at Intel or you're going to get
fanboys who are going to say go AMD then
going to really take into consideration
how are these processors performing
today versus today's current software
and what I mean by that is if you go
with a dual-core set of like an i3 it's
going to save you money today but
software every single day is becoming
more and more optimized for multiple
threading even a quad-core is starting
to become obsolete when it comes to
programs like Adobe Adobe starting to
take all eight cores of an FX processor
into account as it is or if you have an
i7 all eight threads with the four cores
and the hyper threading another thing
you have to ask yourself when it comes
to future proofing is how long is the
current hardware been out at the time
you're looking to buy what I mean by
that is the Intel i7 series has already
been out for several years and the
current platform right now as you can
see right here is the LGA 775 this
happens to be an i7 3770k now we all
know that Haswell is right around the
corner and it's likely that sometime
later this year has wells going to be
released so what's going to happen the
price on this is going to drop now if
you buy this today you're gonna buy it
at a premium and you're gonna spend full
retail on this processor but what if
three months from now this processor
drops by 100 or even 150 dollars what
happened right there your cost
efficiency just fell if you do your
research and you see that you're on the
cusp of emerging technology chances are
prices are going to start falling and
they're going to start falling likely
after you buy the current hardware if
you don't wait now of course a lot of
these manufacturers don't really give
you a heads up on when they're planning
on releasing this hardware usually only
a week or two headway and the reason for
that is they don't want you to wait they
want you to buy this now because this
becomes pure profit for them because
they've already manufactured all of
these these are probably not being
manufactured at a very high rate any
longer because all of the manufacturing
processes have already been moved to the
new platform there's nothing more
frustrating than buying a new processor
or a new graphics card only to have it
become immediately obsolete because of
the fact that you bought it right on the
cutting edge of technology evolution so
when it comes to cost efficiency or
future proofing just remember these
things one there is no such thing as
future proof anything you buy today at
some point is going to become obsolete
future proofing implies that the
hardware that you buy today is immune to
the future
that is just not the case so if you live
by the standard and you live by the
motto of cost-efficiency
you'll start to look at it a whole
different way so if you go ahead and
immediately just purge yourself at the
idea of having a future-proof computer
you start looking at anything you're
about to buy or build in the concept of
cost efficiency you just may surprise
yourself and where you end up spending
your money this has been a J's two cents
video dispelling some of the myths
regarding future proofing and getting
you to rethink the way that you think
about building and buying a new computer
and about the idea of cost efficiency
