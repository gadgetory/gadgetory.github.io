the NVIDIA press day here in San
Francisco this to be kind of a weird
video because the timing of this so some
of the information I'm going to tell you
right now in the city you might have
already seen on their live screen what's
weird because it probably should be over
by the time you see this but I'm doing
the video anyway okay so GDC 2017 here
in video scamp's got a lot of new stuff
here with software and a little bit of
hardware we'll talk about as well
so inside visual studio edition 5.3
that's all about dx12 VR application
development API debugging range
profiling not the bad sense profiling
the good sense profiling and then for
some more oculus and vibe SDK stuff
where they're getting much more involved
in VR development VR through one of
those things that's been kind of hit or
miss sitting on the developers SDK tools
how much healthy been getting from the
manufacturers of the graphics cards to
get better optimization for VR if you
can expect that to progress in video
aftermath this is a good one too because
they've come up with this new way for
debugging when it comes to dx12 and to
identify GPU class crashes vs. CPU
crashes part of the problem of dx12 it
is a bit of a disconnect between GPU and
CPU in a synchronous computer sometimes
when the game crashes or something goes
weird or funky it doesn't actually know
what went wrong so the idea here with
Nvidia aftermath is Nvidia users with
their graphics cards would be able to
automatically submit that data that
crash and debugging data to the
developer so they could find exactly
where the crash was and how it happened
now it sounds like things I have been
around all along but the cool part is
this is specifically with the dx12 api
so we can see some better optimization
for DX 12 which you guys know is in kind
of hit or miss with how good it's been
with some title perfect example
rise of the Tomb Raider hasn't been a
great implementation of that another one
here is Nvidia has collaborated now with
Amazon on their new lumberyard of API
which is designed to be a triple a title
feel engine but more aimed at bringing
you kind of a focus of film quality
pixels are calling it where they're
trying to get closer to sort of
real-life representation in pixel
formats
it has to do with volumetric lighting
and a lot of other stuff do I get to in
deep in depth in that right now it's a
lot of really complicated information
that I'm just piecing with the really
really huge safety today but of course
we have got the 1080p ah'd now I can say
that all of the leaked specs have been
wrong which is kind of cool because that
means we actually were a little bit
surprised on this we've got all 3585 484
cuda cores going it's not a shade down
tight next Pascal a 352 bit memory bus
which is really weird because it's going
to 11 gigabytes of g5x on there so let
the jokes going but it's really talking
but one gig didn't work or something on
all off 3.5 all over again
no not really but that's a weird number
I'm a really just didn't explain too
well too much why they went into 11
gigabytes of G by that maybe because 12
so Long's excite but the coolest part
about this is and I don't have to
specific spec yet on availability and
pricing that's the part that you guys
are probably already know by the time
you've seen this and I don't know yet
the kind of making it is what that's
going to be but they did say they are
doing away with the founders price
premium which did you see $100 more for
the 80 series and they are going to
launch the founders card alongside MSRP
pricing and then of course you have all
your AIC are adding card partners
bringing in their own boards and their
own pricing so the price of a little bit
more competitive this time around but
they also are now going to be launching
for the 1080 in the 1060 and overclock
view which is kind of the first time
they've ever done that invidious history
having an overclock view where
specifically they're talked about memory
speed we're going to be launching a new
GT X 1080 that has a overclocked memory
cube with the 11 gigabit per second g5x
memory that you're finding on the 1050
Fiat are you shooting 1080p I will be
available on the 1080 and the 1060 will
have a 9 gigabit per second SKU
available as well to both founders and
AIC for Ford partners again pricing guys
sorry I don't have that information
don't shoot me they wouldn't give it to
us but I wanted to bring some of this
information anyway you didn't see the
livestream don't worry we'll be doing
all the reviews you guys expect all your
favorite youtubers will be doing reviews
on this
and it's cold I'm going to go thanks
Kyle for holding the camera for me I
know if the height thing was the problem
but alright guys thanks for watching
make sure you watch Kyle Paul Hardware
gamers Nexus we're all here we're all
friends we're going to go get coffee now
