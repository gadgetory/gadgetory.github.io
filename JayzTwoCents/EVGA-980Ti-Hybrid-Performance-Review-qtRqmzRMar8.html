cents here and this is like gtx 980ti
week and trust me we're gonna be doing a
lot of different 980ti stuff kind of
like we did with the 960 it's probably
gonna drive you crazy but you guys are
demanding this type of coverage so we're
going to do it anyway we've already
taken a look at the Titan X and we've
determined this is a fantastic graphics
card and unfortunately two and a half
months three months after release has
pretty much been obsoleted by the better
bargain gtx 980ti with it six gigabytes
of vram 1,000 megahertz core clock that
boosts up to 1075 and over 1200 in my
case and the fact that it's six hundred
and fifty dollars three hundred and
fifty dollars less than the Titan X I
mean 20 816 stream processors everything
up stream processors processes whatever
stream processors everything about this
card has pretty much made it a fantastic
bargain compared to the Titan anyway
still more expensive than most people
who willing to pay for but what that
means you can now have custom boards for
this thing but Titan you're not allowed
to have custom boards and video controls
that but the GPU manufacturers can just
go balls crazy with the 980ti and today
we're going to take a look at one of the
first aftermarket custom cooling options
the geforce gtx 980ti hybrid from EVGA
so prime the first one to get my hands
on this and we're gonna try to play with
it if you know what I mean
the octane gaming gear combo from
Coolermaster features seven backlighting
colors turbo mode a vago 3050 optical
sensor along with four levels of dpi
adjustment now you can po noobs without
boning your wallet click the link in the
description to learn more so last
December I've said this before gigabyte
should have made a single 120 cooler
option for their 980 s instead of that
3-way monstrosity thing what they should
have done was simply offer a single 980
120 millimeter radiator with much much
shorter tubing and let the buyer mount
it in a standard 120 millimeter fan slot
in their case just like the 295x2 and
look how successful that card is EVGA
was the first one to kind of answer that
call they they still haven't told me
whether or not it was that video that
inspired them doing the hybrid card I
still think I had something to do with
it and I'm just going to assume that the
check is in the mail
so at CES in January EVGA unveiled the
GTX 980 hybrid which was a custom 120
millimeter all-in-one cooling unit
self-contained no extra wires to install
or anything 980
which was a huge success people loved it
and it was just as successful as I said
it would have been for gigabyte if they
had tried well here we are now six
months later and guess what EVGA is
still the only brand offering all-in-one
cooling options for NVIDIA cards well
here we are taking a look at the gtx
980ti hybrid as you guys can see it
pretty much looks exactly like the 980
did and I do kind of wish that they had
maybe spruced up the shroud a little bit
so that it stands aside or stands alone
from the 980 but it still is an
attractive cooler it really is the color
of this thing kind of looks silver right
now on camera as you look at it but it
really is more of a pewter it has a
slight just like a hint of copper in
there in fact I think I still have the
little plastic covers on there yes I do
I don't really want to pull these off I
want to leave them like new a screw it
pull it off anyway that's the sound of a
new GPU but they're a little bit
slightly copperish looking hint of gold
whatever color you want to call that
they're not true silver so that's one
thing you're going to want to keep in
lined the top here is that same color so
when this thing is installed and you're
looking at it this way this it's not
it's true to silver as it looks I did
the best I could capture it on camera
it's really going to depend on your
monitor settings as well on how that
looks but check it out a backplate I'm
glad to say that we have finally as a
community got an EVGA to start putting
back plates on the cards that definitely
matter in terms of i/o it's pretty
standard still single DVI dual link
you've got three display ports and a
single HDMI 2.0 which is compatible for
4k playback to SLI fingers because you
can four-way SLI gtx 980ti s i don't
think you would four-way SLI this the
only because the radiator in
installations would start to get a
little bit weird but you could do 4-way
on here technically but it is a
reference PCB so that's the thing that's
kind of curious about this card is since
it's a reference PCB there's same vrm
design same layout same everything as
sent over by nvidia what's really
gaining here is a little bit better
overclocking because the fan is going to
be able to stay extremely slow
considering the only thing the fan on
here has to cool is the vrm and the
chips so the fan is going to stay very
slow very low RPM very low noise and all
of the core cooling is being done by a
single 120 millimeter i'm assuming a
Sutekh it looks a lot like an ASA tech
cooler and they're high pressure static
Optima are their height and their high
static pressure feb that's hard to say
and their high static pressure optimized
fan on here now in terms of power it's
the same six pin an eight pin and know
enough about the specs of the thing it's
really not all that different than
another 980ti is like I said it's
reference it's going to talk about
performance now this thing did boost up
for me I got a look at my cheat over
here to thirteen hundred and twenty
eight megahertz all on its own I pushed
it to an additional fourteen hundred and
eighty four now in the comparisons that
you guys are going to see here I was
kind of conflicted I didn't know if I
wanted to leave this at the same 1,400
megahertz that the reference clock or
card that I used was when I compared it
to the Titan because I figured it would
give us pretty much the exact same
results so the Titan XR you're going to
see in these benchmarks were the same
results of what I did with the 980ti
benchmark at 1400 so what we're going to
be doing here is we're comparing the max
overclock to this for 750 dollars at
this kit costs versus the Titan X is
$1000 at 1400 with reference cooler so
it's kind of a weird ideology but that's
just the way that we did it and you guys
are going to see that cards like this
are why the Titan X is pretty much old
news so without further ado let's go
ahead and roll those benchmarks and
we'll talk a little bit more about
you
all right well as you guys saw max
temperatures on this thing 50 degrees
Celsius with a single 120 what's funny
about that is the Titan X's and
skunkworks are actually getting about 5
degrees hotter than that in gaming well
because it's all shared heat in a single
loop with parallel and 516 overclocked
and over volted and blah blah blah but
we were able to achieve 1400 and 84
megahertz on this thing absolutely quiet
now in terms of aesthetics I really love
the pen I mentioned this on the 980 the
standard 980 I really loved that they
did a braided a soft braided design over
the tube here I mean this is just really
sexy coconut monkey what do you think of
that I like it he likes it a lot
therefore it gets the coconuts approval
uh but I mean it it almost looks like a
gosh it almost look like a brake line
really like a black brake line but I
still really really loved the fact that
they incorporated this fan in the
radiator to the graphics card itself
that's why I say there's no extra cables
or anything to install you just plug
this in and plug in power to the
graphics card just the same as you would
any other GPU the unfortunate thing is
that when you control the fan via
precision it actually turns this fan up
and down which is unnecessary and not
this one I was hoping you could maybe
control this fan to get a little bit
better cooling to the GPU
but then again 50 degrees Celsius I mean
you can't really complain about that so
once again EVGA being the only brand for
Nvidia any way to offer us an all-in-one
cooler design for Nvidia graphics cards
980 980 TI I don't know if they made one
for the tight next they might have they
might not have they also have the a CX
2.0 cooler available for the 980 TI and
they've got more stuff coming with for
980ti trust me you guys aren't going to
want to miss that so tell me what you
guys think about this you guys really
liked the design of the hybrid for the
980 I don't see why you guys wouldn't
like it for the 980 TI I know some
people are going to bitch and moan and
grumble about the 749 dollar price tag
here's the thing with that the 980 TI is
an MSRP of 649 they basically added a
custom all-in-one water cooler custom
tailor made to this card
for a hundred bucks and that's about the
price of any respectable all-in-one
water cooling unit from a reputable
brand like Corsair coolermaster usually
between 79 to 100 bucks this thing
performed very very well the only thing
you have to keep in mind is just like
all all-in-one water cooling units there
is a little bit of air in there so
there's a little bit of sloshing there's
you're never going to get all the air
out of the system so when you first turn
it on you might hear a bunch of bubbles
just flowing through the system like
crazy don't freak out it's normal they
will they will make their way up until a
little reservoir and then they will no
longer be a nose factor but if you guys
are looking for silent gaming 980ti and
it's within your budget this is
definitely a card that you guys are
going to want to take a look at alright
guys so thanks for watching today's
video of the gtx 980ti hybrid from EVGA
so we're gonna have a little help here
with the channel now I'm technically
hired coconut monkey now to help me as a
self-employed self contracting I'm not
gonna even call him an intern as interns
aren't paid and coconut monkey sign is
valuable how do you like it so far how's
it pushing stop and start on the camera
you like it you like it Megan a lot so
now we're gonna be doing some projects
here pretty soon what do you guys want
to see on the channel if you guys
remember coconut monkey and I did this
little commercial for tilt that was
actually one of the most fun videos I
think to date I've ever recorded I want
to do more fun stuff like that so I'm
asking you guys to give us some ideas on
what you guys would like to see so with
that said thanks for watching guys
follow on Facebook and Twitter at j-su
sense and at coconut monkey mnk why why
didn't you spell monkey all the way out
as I take it you were lazy I've
apparently hired the wrong guy alright
guys as always thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
