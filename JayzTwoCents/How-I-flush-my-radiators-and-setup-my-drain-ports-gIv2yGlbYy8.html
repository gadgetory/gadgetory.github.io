lighting tends to go like light dark
light dark light dark I rely on a lot of
natural light here in the shop because
it's a window there and had to roll the
door down over there because the
birds are out there like tweet tweet
tweet tweet tweet like it's spring or
some so I roll the door down and
now the lighting in here kind of sucks
and I'm realizing that I'm gonna have to
address the lighting situation in this
room as soon as I address the giant
massive pile of boxes over there which
never seems to get any freaking smaller
the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro
from Coolermaster combines modularity
with creativity giving you the freedom
to build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description now I have to drain my
system again because I'm still working
with Mayhem's and now hardware labs to
get to the bottom of why the color is
changing inside my system and to do that
we're going to put fresh fluid in here
we're going to flush it out with
distilled water we're not going to use
any chemicals we're going to completely
flush it out this is editing J and I
decided to go ahead and pause this video
for a second and let you know that yes
that white speck on my shirt right there
is bugging me so much while editing this
video it must be bugging you as a viewer
so do me a favor hit the like button on
this video because then maybe I'll learn
how to actually wash my clothes damn
idiot
alright back on with the video and I'm
gonna show you guys how the drains work
in my system here to kind of give you
guys some ideas of how to drain your
loops when you're putting your stuff
together because honestly a lot of
people put their systems together and
then at the end of the day they go - no
how the hell am I supposed to get the
fluid out of there well today we're
gonna show ya ok so the first things
first it's the lighting in here like I
said it's terrible so it does cool it
looks like it's black it's not I promise
it's orange this is the loop that's
changed color on me now the CPU loop
which that's the first time that's
happened but again like I said I'm
working with hardware labs and Mayhem's
and we're all working together here to
get to the bottom line because at the
end of the day all we're going to be
left with is a better product if we can
figure out why this is happening now
tons and people came to me and were like
dude my color is not changing you're
cray cray and plenty people came to me
and they're like J my colors changing
please let us know what you find out
that's why I am going to today be
flushing out all of this fluid this is
the primo chill fluid I mean we're
putting the pastel back in here after we
do a distilled water flush I'm not using
any chemicals I'm not doing another Brit
blitz Pro cleaning or blitz cleaning I
have all that stuff but at the request
of Mayhem's we're just going to do a
distilled water flush because our goal
today at least not today it's gonna take
some time is we want the Mayhem's to
change color we want this to change to
start to darken on us because I'm going
to send them a sample of the untouched
fluid I'm going to mix it with distilled
water and I'm going to send them a
sample of the fresh unused fluid and
then once the fluid starts to change a
sample of the dark fluid so they can
compare and see exactly what happened
yeah everyone throws out pH pH pH but we
need to know what is causing the pH to
change knowing the pH change is one
thing but they're going to do their
chemical tests to get to the bottom line
of exactly what is happening so I'm
taking this opportunity here to not only
whore myself out and make a video and
try at the end of the day to make a
dollar at least enough to buy some
Starbucks but to finally answer the
question of how do the drains work
inside my sister transition now my
system I have two loops and the CPU loop
is the easiest to change because there's
the drain for it right there you can see
it's at the very bottom of the pump
reservoir combo and it's at the very
lowest point of the loop that's the most
important thing if you're going to have
a drain valve like I'm using you want it
to be at the very bottom of the loop and
the reason for that is if you you know
crack it open you don't want to have any
fluid settled below that point because
then you have to take the components out
and physically tip them over to actually
get all of that out which is kind of
pain in the ass you know let's face it
we want to do the most efficient which
is also known as the laziest way to do
something at least in my case but
because the radiator is horizontal up at
the top of the loop we have no issues
getting that drained out and you'll see
that the challenge with the GPU loop as
you can see is I have a radiator right
here that's on its side rather than
horizontal so these take longer to bleed
and get all the air out they also are
harder to get all of the fluid out
because you have the rows going like
this on top of each other and so the top
wants to you know you have to tip at
certain ways to try and get it to
a leak our or drain out and then no
matter how hard you try there's always
going to be some fluid lower than where
the fitting is because as you know if
you look at radiators as you can see
those fittings are not you know at the
very bottom right here they're in the
middle so you've got these rows right
here where fluid will collect fluid will
collect down in there especially when
they're mounted horizontal if you have
to do lots of tipping to try and get the
fluid to run from here you know into the
end tank and then back down to here and
it's kind of a pain in the ass the only
way I'm going to really be able to get
all of the fluid out is to pretty much
disassemble the GPU radiators at the
bottom and then you know manually tip
them to get it out which really kind of
sucks
now skunkworks is obviously very busy
down the bottom we got a no to 80 on its
side and a 560 on its side which is why
it's really kind of a pain in the ass to
get these to drain because both
radiators are dealing with that fitting
you know not being at the very lowest
point even though I do have a drain here
that's coming off of a tee fitting on
one of the radiators here on the lowest
point where they're connected with a
cross tube this still is not going to be
at the very bottom of the loop so
although this will help me get a lot of
the fluid out it's not going to get
everything out for me which again really
kind of sucks but you know I'll make it
work because I really don't feel like
taking out the power supply in all the
cables because I did that thing where I
was like hey it'll be really cool to put
hard tubing down here yeah well the
flexible tubing allowed me to at least
pull the radiator out you know kind of
swing it away and get my hand in there
if I needed to to disconnect the rads
yeah can't exactly do that now with the
rigid because I put those in and then
the power supply and now that I have to
drain it I'm like oh yeah I can't can
exactly get my hand in there
so I cracked open one of the little
fittings on the top of the reservoir
that way air can get into the loop
otherwise we can't push it out so that's
going to be something that's you want to
keep in mind is if you get your
reservoir did you get your reservoir at
the highest point of the loop if you
can't obviously if you have a radiator
on top that's not going to work it will
help it bleed faster but all I have here
is an empty one gallon jug of distilled
water and I have a tea valve here which
is a bits power T valve with a fitting
on the end of it plugging that so I'm
going to go ahead and take the fitting
off the end here you can always tell
when your valve is closed by the way
because when the valve is turned
perpendicular to the flow direction that
means it's closed and when it's turned
parallel with it that means it's open
we'll protip there for you that way you
don't screw off your your look cap here
and also there goes all your fluid all
over your chair or whatever like in my
case so now we're just gonna turn this
guy ya skunkworks likes to take leaks
she's a leaky bitch
not really I've only had one leak in
this thing like ever something else you
can do - which tends to weird a lot of
people out when they see me do it at
least friends and stuff is I'll attach a
piece of spare tubing to a barbed
fitting there and then I will put it
into the other end like that as you can
see I actually have that press down into
the handle right there that way doesn't
pop out but then what I also do is I do
that on the reservoir and then I
literally blow into it yeah I blow the
computer get your mind out of the gutter
so you can see the GP loop is mostly
drained there's of course still a little
bit like right there in that tube
there's going to be some left in the
bottom of the radiator right there which
is really going to suck well I guess
technically what we just did was blow
alright okay so the way that I'm going
to do the actual flushing of the system
here with the distilled water is exactly
the same as I showed you when I did the
test loop video where we tested milk and
Gatorade or Powerade and all that junk
where I'm basically going to fill the
loop up with distilled water and then
I'm going to crack the drain valve at
the bottom of the loop just a little bit
and I'm going to use my fill tube and
I'm going to continue to add distilled
water as it's slowly draining out of the
bottom and letting the fluid recirculate
in the loop that will end up catching
all of the orange and pissing it out
through the the actual drain at the
bottom and then once we're done we're
going to drain the entire system again
like I showed you and hopefully get as
much the fluid out as we possibly can so
as you can see even though I'm filling
it with clear distilled water it is
actually turning orange because there
was still some orange dye and fluid down
there in the radiators so we're just
going to continue to do this method of
filling this reservoir as I crack that
drain loop down there letting it drain
into the catch bottle there until it
starts getting completely clear it could
take a while especially in the loop this
size but that's the way that I actually
will try and flush out previous color
remember Mayhem's we want this we want
this fluid to change color because we
need to be able to test it so that's why
we're only doing the distilled water
method but the way it's drain it and
stuff at all that all remains the same
so as you can see right now the fluid
level and the reservoir is going down
slowly because I have that drain just
cracked just a little bit and now as it
goes down I'm just going to fill up the
reservoir again and I'm going to do this
over and over and over until the
reservoir is completely clear also make
sure you keep an eye on your catch
bottle there you don't want to overflow
on you you might have to throw that out
every now and then depending how much
fluid is in your loop and how much
coolant or water it takes to actually
completely make that you know clear damn
son keeps going in and out making things
super bright the exposure is all screwed
up in this damn video now one really
important thing to note here is that I
am NOT powering up the system
to do this to be able to run the pumps I
have the pumps plugged into another
power supply over there as you can see
just a cheap little thermal tape power
supply TR or rx 2 or TR 2 rx whatever
yeah so I just have the pumping power do
that you do not want to run your system
while you are doing this especially when
there's a chance of you possibly
splashing it or spilling it so do not
run your system while bleeding and
trying to drain it like that but as you
can see now the orange dye is no longer
affecting the clear so that means we are
completely flushed out of the color and
it took about two gallons of power cord
huh yeah way to go Jay but it took me
approximately - well this is the second
gallon of distilled water and you can
see what's left so that's about how much
it took it's going to take a lot less to
do it with the CPU loop because like I
said there's less fluid in it and that
is literally at the very bottom of the
loop so I'll be able to get most of the
coolant out before we even start now
allow me to show you why having
multi-port res tops is definitely
something worth having even if you don't
think you're going to ever have the tube
coming in the top because being able to
open up one of these makes it very easy
compared to having to unscrew the whole
top when it comes to letting the fluid
out right now I have the tube coming
down in here into my catch a can or one
gallon distilled water bottle let's be
honest it's not really a can but even if
I turn the valve to full open look at
it's like oh nothing wants to come out
because you have pressure in here and
you need to have equal in for equal out
there has to be air to replace the fluid
so if you're doing this going it's not
working well once you open up one of the
ports on the top and air can get in as
you can see then magic happens so yeah
you have to have a equal in equal out
air has to replace the volume that's
currently being used up by the fluid
well the new fluid is installed and it
looks freakin amazing in fact I'm a
little bit unhappy now with the orange
tops on the dominator because it's such
a different color it might actually end
up taking my silver ones and painting
them to match this more about Caltrans
road cone orange color but anyway there
you go guys those are the methods that I
use for draining and kind of flushing my
loops if I'm just doing like a distilled
water flush obviously if you're gonna do
a deep cleaning you need to take it
apart and you need to use like any of
the persistent prep or the blitz pro or
whatever you're going to use to clean
your system you know individually and at
least per the instructions on those kits
but this is nothing more than just a
quick simple flush because like I said I
explained in the beginning of this video
that I'm doing this because we want the
fluid to change color which really kind
of sucks because I'm going to have to go
through everything you just saw again
but because we want to get to the bottom
of this we want this fluid to change
color that way I can send a sample of
the unused fluid which is actually right
here so I've got extra like I showed you
that's not going to go in the system so
then I can send them a sample of hey
this is what the fluid is like exactly
out of the bottle mixed with distilled
water and then this is what the fluid is
like now after getting contaminated and
then they can do chemistry and science
bitch and all kinds of other stuff to
figure out what actually happened to the
fluid which will then hopefully tell us
exactly what's at fault is that the
fluid is that the dye is that the
radiator is it flux is it who knows is
it that the nickel plating is it the the
o-rings who freaking knows and until we
know we can't we're just we're just kind
of throwing you know pitches in the dark
we don't know exactly what's happening
pitches in I didn't make sense I don't
know why the hell I said that but anyway
I just had to say why I was doing this
otherwise there have been a lot of
confused people going why are you doing
this when you know it's going to change
color on you because my system has got
he's got the plagues anyway guys time to
go thanks for watching make sure you
guys look in the description anyway time
to go guys make sure you look in the
description check out my second channel
got some more car stuff coming up some
vlogs and other ways to help support
with Amazon and whatnot anyway time to
go thanks a bunch for watching and I got
to carry this 80 pound behemoth back up
the stairs moving to a two-story house
and putting the office upstairs was a
terrible idea
my back hates me but skunkworks looks
awesome though I mean really you can't
deny that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
