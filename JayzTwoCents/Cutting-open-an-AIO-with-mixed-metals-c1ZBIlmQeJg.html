wanting to do for a little while here
that I'm finally gonna do it's gonna
involve a little bit of destruction and
some of you were gonna probably cringe
but I digress this is necessary for the
sake of science yo J to define our six
in white fine our six in white
okay okay it's an arsenic but it's not
new in fact it's not even all white I
mean what's with the black front really
coming from the guy with the black and
white car black hood black okay that's
different it's the same that's not the
same exact same thing not the same fine
change it then how with the custom wrap
from slick wraps front panel whole cakes
whatever you want even custom designs us
that's right we did do that video about
the custom wrapped our six choose any of
their existing designs or customize your
own upload it and they'll make it for
you
see wow you really can make these custom
with rats
so this one specifically is going to be
involving you know a iOS and the concept
of galvanic corrosion so this right here
is the a 240 G this is from ek water
blocks this is the all aluminium
aluminium wherever you're from it's a
custom water-cooled loop and it's a kit
so you put it together but even the
fittings are aluminum the blocks
aluminum the GP blocks aluminum even the
parts inside the pump that could
possibly corrode through galvanic
corrosion are aluminum now what causes
galvanic corrosion is the mixing of
metals so specifically like copper and
well copper and aluminum this is
dripping on my hand what am I always
doing that so mixing things like copper
and aluminum can definitely accelerate
the idea of galvanic corrosion now this
right here this is this is the pump I
tried to use in this system which didn't
quite have enough power this is
technically an AI oh but the AI oh the
radiator that comes with the Kelvin from
fractal design is actually an alpha cool
radiator so this is a truly 100% copper
setup so this isn't going to be a
candidate because it doesn't have mixed
metals so if you talk about the idea of
mixing metals people tend to just freak
out because they go well you can't mix
aluminum and you can't mix copper and
this and that you'll get galvanic
corrosion it's a term people throw
around because they hear about it online
and stuff and then they just sort of I
know they regurgitate and they repeat
themselves and they don't actually
understand what's happening they never
use aluminum in the loop because we've
got mad at corrosion when you use it
with copper well guess what most of your
a iOS on the market I showed you an
example of one that didn't do include
copper and aluminum so this is actually
an old H 100 right here H 100 i I've had
this thing for like four years now
something along those lines maybe even
longer I'm gonna cut this sumbitch open
we're gonna cut it open today because I
am curious
if I love this phone almost in fact NEA
Sutekh rebranded AIO which is most of
the ones in North America our copper
base on the block as you can see right
here with an aluminum radiator so we've
got mixed metals from day one the
difference is they use a fluid that is
designed to combat galvanic corrosion
now most coolants that are on the market
for your open loops or your custom loops
are also they have inhibitors in there
for corrosion the difference is these
are much more controlled they have a
very specific coolant that we use and
it's the same across the board they've
got all the same you know materials
being used whereas an open-loop or a
custom loop you're using different
brands I use different different grades
of plating different grades of copper
different types of nickel plating so
there's very little control over that
and then the type of coolant that you
use especially with all of these
boutique type coolants now like the view
and the Primo chill are the what that
mayhem is pastels and all that stuff may
not necessarily have the best amount of
anti-corrosion in there so this is what
the inside of the h100 eye looks like so
as you can see it pushes the fluid down
through the middle right here across
these copper blocks or this these fins
right here a fact that's not even a oh
yeah the our fins are just really
freaking tiny and then it goes out the
outside and back out and into the
radiator in fact here is your
temperature probe right there but this
thing is obviously full of coolant so
I'm gonna go and drain this real quick
which not very not a lot of it we're
gonna drain it based on the way that
this block looks so I don't think we're
gonna see any corrosion but I'm gonna
cut the end tanks off of the radiator
and see what it looks like inside
quickest way to do this
I have no idea what color the fluid is
in fact almost any time I've ever
cracked open an AI oh I hate that AI oh
it's hard to say AI oh it's almost like
saying I edited it edited the video
edited it I gotta go edit it
it's a weird anyway I digress Pleasant
anytime I've cut open an AI Oh in the
pasture or used any of the expandable
ones the fluid has been clear so it's
kind of funny that this one's a little
bit green which is interesting because
usually galvanic corrosion has a little
bit of a green blueish kind of a color
to it that sound sure you use a fresh
blade Oh
smell it smell so bad
so do this this is this is actually
better than I was expecting I've had
this AO for four years and as you can
see there's not the slightest amount of
discoloration or corrosion in this I
mean if anything it looks is probably as
clean as day one
the sad part is I've clearly ruined a
perfectly good
heyyo so right but it's back together
get my hand my hands are dirty with a
little bit of soldering but as you can
see right here the most important lesson
to be learned from this video other than
Jai pointlessly opened up a radiator no
it's not pointless we learned something
today if the coolant is designed to
handle such mixed metals then you can
actually mix metals still not recommend
it but you could mix metals and have
long-term success with it had this just
been distilled water or something like
that without any sort of anti corrosive
agent in there this would have not only
gotten growth like you know algae and
stuff but it would have also corroded on
the inside as well so yeah this quick
little video because I wanted an excuse
to cut open a radiator that was made out
of aluminum I picked the oldest one I
had and now this that doesn't mean that
a iOS don't corrode it's up to the
manufacturer to use the right coolant
chemical configuration because if the if
the chemical makeup is not proper and
it's not just how the right agents in
there the right anti corrosive material
or additives then you would certainly
get different results yeah I mean I
think that right there it kind of paints
the picture you can see that that is
super clean all right well if you guys
got any other suggestions and things we
should cut it open
JG can open a twenty ATT I know yeah you
guys have any suggestions of things you
should cut open let me know down the
comments below or hit me up on Twitter
at jst sense thanks for watching guys
and as always we will see you in the
next one I still think the coolant got
kind of dirty though just why that
turned that color so I think there is
obviously a life to the coolant but in
terms of corrosion the H 100 I
the test of time now I can do the stuff
I've always kind of wanted to do and see
how well it can withstand oh that's
actually not bad oh this is okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
