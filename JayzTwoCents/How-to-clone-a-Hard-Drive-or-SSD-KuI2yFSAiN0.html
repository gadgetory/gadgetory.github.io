J's two cents here and I get a lot of
product that comes through this room and
while ago I actually was given a Samsung
840 Evo to put into skunkworks this
wasn't actually sent to me for an
official review but I have been
mentioning that the 256 gigabyte SSD on
skunkworks is filling up pretty fast and
the 128 gigabyte SSD that's currently
installed in my test rig has less than
eight gigabytes free on it pretty damn
atrocious when it comes to hard drive
situation in this room now I've been
putting off actually doing the transfer
of data on to the new Samsung Drive
because I'm so busy making content for
you guys and then it dawned on me why
don't I just do review showing you guys
how to migrate all of your data
why don't I think of this sooner EVGA
ACX 2.0 cooler with its three phase six
slot motor 11 Swift fan blades and
double ball bearing design offers
reduced power noise and thermals for the
optimum gaming experience click the link
in the description to learn more now
this is actually a topic that has been
requested quite a bit and I never
thought about doing it because sometimes
I forget things that seem so basic to me
especially since I work in IT for my day
job sometimes I forget just how not
common-sense it really is what I mean by
that is a lot of people who've never
done it wouldn't necessarily know where
to start now if you do a simple google
search you'll find that there's a ton of
utilities out there that actually do
data migration and copying and cloning
up drives but I'm gonna go ahead and
show you guys the way that I do it now
this is the drive that came out of skunk
works the main SSD was an ADATA SX 900
256 gigabyte drive and I have the exact
same drive in a 128 gigabyte format in
the test rig behind me now it doesn't
actually matter what kind of drives you
have it doesn't have to go from an SSD
to an SSD it can go from a hard drive to
a solid-state drive back and forth it
doesn't matter all it's going to do is
take the data and clone it over to the
new drive now I use a program called
Acronis True HD the reason why
mentioning that is it actually comes
bundled with the a data
drives and prior to doing let a data
reviews I just use some free utilities
which sometimes we're great and
sometimes they weren't but today's topic
we're actually covering it with the
Acronis True HD that comes bundled with
the SSD and I'm not a sponsor of the
channel or anything it just is what I
have available to me so what we're going
to go ahead and do is we are going to
install these drives into the test rig
we are going to set the a data as our
source drive and we're going to set the
Samsung 840 Evo as the destination so
it's going to format the SSD and that's
going to copy the data here and put it
on to there so we have to exact copies
regardless of what the capacity is it
doesn't really matter what the capacity
is as long as the data that you're
copying fits on the drive that you're
trying to put it on
I couldn't take 500 gigabytes of data
and put it on to the 256 I wouldn't
exactly work in fact it wouldn't even
let you do it it would tell you there's
a capacity issue so we're going to
install these into the computer we're
going to boot up a Cronus and we're
going to point the camera at the screen
it's a little bit archaic but I can't
use my capture device because it's going
to actually do a custom partition on one
of the drives and it's going to boot
into its own little oh s where it's
actually going to do the cloning so
let's go ahead and get these installed
and start up the utility transition
okay guys so we're currently booted here
into my test system and if we take a
look at my computer you can see the
situation is actually worse than I
thought I only have six point one three
gigabytes left on my 128 gigabyte Drive
that's pretty bad
now this is just a system recovery
partition this is my original SSD that
came out of skunkworks one hundred sixty
two gigabytes free and this is the 500
gigabyte SSD here you can see there's a
little bit of data on there but here
they are everything was automatically
detected and you're good to go so we're
going to do is we're going to open up a
Cronus true HD over here on the right
there's a box here where it says clone
disk there's a lot of different features
built into this but we are going to do
clone disk and it's going to initialize
here and it's going to allow us to do
automatic or manual which gives us full
control we're going to do automatic here
and I'm going to say that I want to take
my source disk which is asking for right
here source disk which is my SS s X 900
even labels them out it says Samsung SSD
840 Evo 500 gigabyte a data s X 900 119
gigabytes free after the system
partition and then my a data s X 900 238
gigabytes of my 256 so this this is my
source I'm telling it to copy the 238
gigabyte Drive and we're going to give
it a destination disk and as you can see
it grayed out our source because we
can't copy it from itself to itself that
would be kind of redundant we're going
to copy it here over to the 840 Evo hit
nest neck hit nest the dead hit next the
destination hard disk drive you've
chosen contains some partitions that
could contain useful data click OK to
confirm deletion of all partitions on
the destination hard disk drive so what
it's saying is it's going to wipe the
drive now we want to go ahead and copy
partitions without changes or copy
partitions and use disk as a non system
GPT cell we're going to go ahead and
copy all the partitions with no changes
I want a direct copy we're going to hit
next target disk and source disk are
correctly identified here they are and
we're going to go ahead and send this
thing off
to the races so proceed so now when it's
going to do is it's going to analyze the
source and the destination this could
take up to 2025 minutes to actually
perform but as you can see it was just a
few simple clicks so we'll go ahead and
let this thing run and do its thing and
then we'll come back to it and see how
well it did and once again I apologize
for the audio and/or the video quality
here I will work on better ways to do
screen captures I promise
but once I got away from HDMI cables and
actually got a lot harder to do screen
caps my bad
alright so the cloning is done we booted
back into the operating system on the
test bench and if we open up our File
Explorer here you'll see here's our
crappy try that is nearly full we've got
our for our 500 gigabyte drive right
here and our 256 gigabyte drive right
here now this was the source here are
the files you can see all the folders
and stuff the windows folder is the
Windows 10 folder widows old because I
upgraded from seven is my fraps folder
that's got some of my benchmarks and
stuff in there that I've been working on
and if we go ahead and take a look at
the destination drive the 500 gigabyte
SSD it's the exact same thing look at
that all the exact same stuff in here so
they are now direct clones of each other
so theoretically all I have to do now
let's plop the 500 gigabyte SSD into
skunkworks and we're up and running so
there you go a short sweet non fluffy
video here from J's $0.02 just showing
you quick and easy how I handle all of
the different drives coming in and out
of this place and moving them around
between computers without having to
spend tons of time reinstalling things
so if you've got computers that you want
to be exact copies of each other this is
a really easy way to do it this is also
really easy we use this in IT we use
them we basically create ISOs from the
existing hard drives and when we set up
new computers at work we just copy the
ISOs which is our main like kind of a
master copy of all of our operating
systems and software and stuff we just
install the ISO onto the new drives
which we created also from utility
simple very similar to this so guys when
Jace $0.02 I hope you guys have enjoyed
the video I didn't do anything crazy
with the editing I just wanted to give
you nice raw information here and as
always guys thanks for watching
head on over to Twitter if you have any
questions if you want to submit topics
very similar to the hundreds of you that
have requested this video you finally
got it head on over there or Facebook to
tell me what topics you guys would like
to see me cover I think one of the
reasons people keep asking for is Jay
how do you do cable management again
that's one of those things that seems
really simple and straightforward and
common sense to me but maybe there's
some tips and tricks I can show you guys
to help out when it comes to cable
management so I'm gonna get out of here
now I'm gonna install it in skunkworks
can be up and running there's always
guys hope to see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
