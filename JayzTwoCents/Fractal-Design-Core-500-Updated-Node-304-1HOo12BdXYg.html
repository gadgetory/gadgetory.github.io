we're going to take a look together at
the brand-new Core 500 Mini ITX chassis
from fractal design the note 304 was one
of my favorite ITX chassis zuv all time
but it had some things I didn't like
about it the core 500 very well may have
solved that so don't go anywhere the new
z170 classified motherboard from EVGA
features 8 phase PWM 4 Way SLI support
along with top notch components to offer
gamers and enthusiasts more of what they
want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more I'll
be honest when I say I'm surprised that
they launched this chassis under the
course student name brand this really
feels like it could have been in the
note series and let me tell you why it's
very familiar to the note 304 it's very
very similar a lot of of characteristics
of this case share note three or four
features for instance it's got a single
shell that you undo four screws the
whole shell comes off yet access to
three sides of the case very similar to
the note 304 the power supply
orientation and the way the power supply
plug plug plug incorporates with the
rear again just like the note 304 the
layout of the ITX motherboard the
placement of the fan in the rear all
identical to the note 304 however they
have made some serious changes to this
that to me make it feel like an upgrade
to the node 304 so I'm a little
surprised that they put it under the
core name this could be an attempt by
fractal to really boost their core
presence when it comes to the core line
of cases that they make and maybe it was
also a move to kind of keep the pricing
down just a little bit now starting with
an external tour of the case the front
here is a faux finish where it's plastic
but it's made to look like a sort of a
brushed aluminum design and you have
some vents here on the side which really
are for show because there are no fans
in the front of this case in fact
there's not even any direct airflow from
these vents to the inside of the chassis
so they're really just more of an
aesthetic breakup to give some detail to
the front of the case but you can also
see one of the major differences between
the coat that I keep calling it the code
core node code but as you can see it
does include a
i expansion beyond here which is good
for people who wanted an optical drive
or a fan controller or whatever else you
might put in that slot I mean you can
there's lots of things accessory-wise
that you can stick in there on the top
here you have this is one of the major
changes from a note 304 where you had a
power button on the side and then your
input jacks on the side that was pretty
much it where they moved it to the top
here you've got a power reset you've got
a hard drive indicator light headphone
jack mic jack and two USB 3.0 now by
tilting it forward like this you can see
another major design improvement over
the note 304 is you have a top vent
which will actually incorporate with two
140 millimeter fans or 120 millimeter
fans giving you much better airflow in
this thing than you were getting with
the note 304 the note 304 had two 90
millimeter fans on the front for intake
and one 120 or 140 millimeter exhaust
fan on the back which is creating in my
opinion kind of havoc for airflow
especially when you had a lot of stuff
obstructing that the 90 millimeter fans
especially with the hanging hard drives
on the left side of the case here you
have a big giant vent because this is
going to allow better airflow for your
graphics cards now I would still
recommend a blower style card in this
chassis here that way the graphics card
is not relying on any of the chassis
airflow to keep the graphics card cool
it can pull in its own fresh air from
the side and exhaust it out the rear
giving it a lot much lesser impact to
the cooling environment of the chassis
where the GPU acts a little bit more
independently if you were to put in some
sort of a atmospheric design where the
hot air is exhausted into the atmosphere
and then the chassis has to exhaust the
hot air you're going to find that you're
going to heat up other components in
here namely your CPU on the back of the
chassis you can see you have your
exhaust fan and then you have your GPU
mounting brackets right there and then
you've got the power plug for the PSU
which is an extension cable that plugs
in to the front mounted power supply on
this again just like the node 304 and
then lastly on the left side you've got
your vent right here for the exhausting
of the power supply unit now moving on
to the bottom of the chassis you can see
you do have a filtered intake here for
your
power supplies so it's going to pull the
air in the bottom and exhaust it out the
side once again allowing the power
supply unit to not really affect the
atmospheric condition of the chassis so
there's a lot of there's a lot of
thought in this chassis where you're
going to keep things from interfering
with each other especially when small
form-factor cases like this cooling is
everything okay so let's go ahead and
take a look at the inside of the chassis
and to do that you guys are going to
have to scoot in and get a little bit
closer I promise I don't smell too badly
I took a shower before doing this video
not really but I just wanted to you know
make you feel a little better so like I
mentioned from the start all of the
sides and the top are covered by this
single shell of a of a cover here which
fits very very snug so exactly the
easiest to get on and off but okay it
gets the job done now right away you can
see on the top of the chassis here we
have a bracket for two 120 millimeter or
two 140 millimeter fans now obviously
this could also accommodate all-in-one
water cooling which is a major
improvement over the note 304 now the
way you accomplish that is you pop off
the front panel which will give you
access to some screws so that you can
actually remove the if I can get the
stupid thing off already done it like
five times should be easier than this so
by removing these screws right here you
can remove the five and a quarter bay
which is attached to the radiator / fan
bracket and then you can install an
all-in-one water cooling loop in there
or extra fans or whatever the only thing
you need to keep in mind though is to
use the 140s up front right here you are
going to have to well pretty much give
up the expansion bay because they're
going to interfere with these little
tabs that are kind of sticking out right
here what you're kind of a see if you
guys can see that right here which are
kind of a guide track for a you know an
optical drive or whatever may go in the
front right here now as you can see you
do have a pretty good amount of depth
right here and they have lined up the
five and a quarter and the bracket on
the top here in such a manner that if
you are using something like an H 100 or
a 120 millimeter size fans for your
all-in-one cooler like an H 100 I or a
- 20x or something like that you could
pretty much use this with the five and a
quarter bay not having to be removed but
if you want to go with something thicker
like the predator and I think I
mentioned the two 20x a second ago which
is also pretty thick those types of all
one coolers you would want to remove the
bracket and then install that now all of
the cables on the inside here are black
which is very very nice all the way to
the end
you've got ribbon cable here for all the
front panel connectors so unlike the
note three or four you're not going to
see any rainbowed colors on the end of
that here's all your front panel
connectors here again black all the way
to the end and then of course you do
have your fan
now the standoffs are pretty much pre
mounted here where they are a part of
the floor board of the chassis so you
don't to worry about trying to screw any
of that in but because as you can see
here there is no cutout to the bottom of
the motherboard tray area if you're
going to install an all-in-one cooler or
an aftermarket a heatsink of some sort
you're going to have to pre install that
on your motherboard otherwise you are
not going to be able to access that it
would have been nice if fractal design
had put some sort of a removable plate
on here where maybe you could unscrew
you know a couple of screws take the
plate out have access to the back of the
motherboard tray and stick that back on
I don't think it would have cost them a
lot of money to do that that would be
something that be nice to see it lacked
any sort of access to the bottom of the
motherboard in the node 304 I kind of
hoped they would have taken this
opportunity to address that however once
again they have not now on this side of
the case you can see you have room for
two three and a half inch drives or two
two and a half inch drives now if you
include these two here a three and a
half inch drive access right there as
well as a front-mounted SSD mount on the
front you could technically have four
hard drives in this thing I mean that's
having four hard drives in this three of
them being three and a half inch
compatible that's a lot of hard drive
space in such a small chassis now
because I know a lot of people are going
to ask and I pretty much need to know
for myself especially if I'm going to
use this chassis for say my PDX build we
need to see whether or not the all the
one cooler is going to fit in here
transition
you
you
okay so as you guys saw I decided to try
and put the predator 240 in here and it
just it's not going to fit the tubing is
too long now one of the cool things
about the predator is I could put
different fittings on there and shorten
the tubing up or whatever I wanted to do
and I might still try that but at least
the way it fits out of the box into this
case natively it doesn't fit hey guys me
again editing J I'm not really
correcting recording J on anything this
time that's kind of nice right it's sort
of a change of pace but I want to
mention something that I thought I
mentioned in the video that apparently I
didn't and that is the fact that I can't
turn the radiator around the other way
I'm sure people are like well why don't
you just turn the radiator around so the
fittings are towards the front you'll
get some more slack and then everything
is fixed well remember the power supply
goes up front and the fittings hang down
too low there's just simply not enough
room I tried but it didn't fit and I'm
still sad about that
alright recording J go ahead and take it
away now I'm starting to think that
maybe all in one water cooling wasn't
really the focus with this because
there's just not enough room between the
top of the bracket here and the socket
and that holds true because I tried it
also with the Corsair H 100 I and even
though this is a much tinier k-dub
cooler compared to the predator I still
couldn't get it to fit because again
very rigid tubing and it just put like
crazy kinks and bends on the the tubing
here to where I just couldn't get it in
there comfortably it was putting way too
much force on the socket because the
tubing was wanting to straighten out
which was pulling up on I just wasn't
comfortable with that whatsoever but
that's not to say that this case that's
really a flaw because I mean let's be
honest here ITX cases that are big
enough to accommodate water cooling
typically are too big to make sense as
ITX cases so an ITX case like this
really did show the improvement where
it's intended to be which is better
airflow and that is the fact that you
can put intakes on the top exhaust on
the rear and you can really keep your
components cool which the note 304 did
an okay job at but wasn't fantastic now
you could still do an all-in-one cooler
on the back you can do it 120 on the
back you're just not getting a 240 on
the top you can get a 120 or possibly
note you
not getting 140 on the back there's just
not enough room between the top here I
mean you could remove the top bracket
but then you basically turn it into a
node 304 so you could do a 120 all the
one water cooling unit in the back and
then maybe have an intake fan up front
you probably would not get a 120 on the
rear and a fan right here in the front
it's probably not going to fit I don't
have any 120 all in one water coolers
hanging around otherwise I would I would
give that a shot but again I don't have
one but anyway I think the core 500 is a
pretty good step up from the node 304 in
my opinion simply because of this the
five and a quarter bay the relocation of
the buttons and the air flow honestly
it's what's most important all right so
tell me what you guys think and if you
have any ITX chassis as you think I
should try out that maybe fit that kind
of a niche group of needing an
all-in-one water cooling unit compatible
and still being small form-factor
without being you know too big like the
case labs x2m yeah fits water cooling
but then again it technically could fit
an ATX case in there we just rearranged
some things so it's way too big for an
ITX travel case like I'm looking for but
it's good for like a small desktop ITX
build that can soak that water cooling
so that's why I'm not using the x2m
anyway guys I'm gonna get out of here
thanks for watching today's video
I think practical design did a fantastic
job on this case I'll find a use for it
I definitely will just so know exactly
what it's going to be I'm disappointed
because I wanted to do a water cooling
build in this and take it to PDX plan I
don't really want too much to
cannibalize my predator and take it
apart I mean that's an option but I
don't really want to do that I don't
know we'll figure it out alright guys
thanks for watching and as always we
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
