say something yeah what's that maybe I
didn't see your meter moving else about
to be like pending any audio problems we
should be good not used to being quiet
he's used to me being quiet Jay I'm
freaked out for a second admit well
because I have a native mic when I'm not
talking I see a noise floor but when you
stop talking it cuts out completely so
yeah here we are
Tech Talk number 155 just a reminder
this show has nothing to do with tech so
with that lower your expectations and
then and then wherever you think they're
low enough lower them even more lower
them even more absolutely right in the
intro all right well - to check tag
number 155 no doing video cards at UTC
eating my mouth no that's okay that's
okay then I'm gonna put in salty nuts in
your mouth BAM affection have wonderful
roasted and salted almonds pigman it
perfectly here because they're roasted
and salty
yummers mmm so we'll get to this topic
eventually but wait we should just talk
about nonsensical for at least
an hour then a dad like male pattern
baldness
Jerry do the men in your family go Bob
actually we get widow's peaks we don't
really go bald we just get that thing
where it like goes back like eight
inches on both sides I say and and you
never lose the hair on the top and you
never lose it on sides you just get this
like really wicked widow's peak thank
you an island on your I don't think I'm
gonna get it because I think I think I
got the genes from my mom's side so I
think I'm gonna have hair and tell him
like 95 years old but I don't think I'll
live that long everybody told me I'm
gonna die in my 40s oh well okay then
let me revise the question do the women
in your family go bald uh yes actually
Wow that's actually consider but yeah no
my my grandma had really thin hair
my mom had really thin hair I mean not
bald bald but like you know we're see
scalp and stuff so that's her hair
thinning hair thinning yeah they don't
go completely ball yeah we filmed a
video today guys that goes live tomorrow
it's definitely worth watching its kind
of on the shorter side it's like a 7 min
video I don't normally the new videos
that short but we we we chart our
charges ourselves up with ESD and
started shocking the out of a
computer to see what happens so yeah
that's we or you use them for an ESD
sorcerer is that top-secret for the
video my butt in the chair okay okay I
thought you might all I got you know
whipper balls out and got a Van de
Graaff generators yeah one of those
things they actually knows little test
yes D yeah we're watching videos of that
were they like they use that they use a
gun to like actually poke and prod at
things with with the SD so we actually
had one we had one of those guns when I
worked at mothers were computers cuz we
just bought it at an auction mm-hmm and
we used to just use it for frying old
electronics before we throw them away in
the recycling bin out back so people
would stop like going back there and
looting it but ya know it's pretty cool
it shot like a lightning bolt
out of it a good probably three and a
half four inches and you just drag it
across and it would just destroy it
yeah um I figure I was gonna say I
wasn't I forgot it's almost weekend I'm
like I'm checked out
no it's weekend well I mean it's cuz you
work hard you actually make videos I
forgot what that's like
I actually I I hold this though it makes
me feel like I could make a video if I
really want to do like holding this on
my own
oh yeah play that well you know you
gotta look the part
fake it to make it yeah see if they can
tell you Meghan I got two I got two
microphones on there was that thing to
 the body on one of them you have
three microphones yeah I know if you
want to count the left and right channel
independently both technically two
different pickups the same you know ant
source but two different because
actually I'm not even sure if it is the
same amp in it to be honest because if
you open it up it actually looks like
two two shotgun mics have you seen the
inside of them yeah yeah they just lit
looks like two shotgun mics fully
suspended in there I don't know if the
electronics are individual to them it
looks like the circuit board is just
power distribution but I really don't
know I'm not an electronic engineer so I
don't really know what to how to
identify what a DAC looks like and all
that guys we're gonna use the
hashtag on Twitter hashtag ask tech
Chuck will cue that up and we'll just
kind of do a lot of viewers Choice
topics today we will talk about the
quote unquote rumor of no new Nvidia
cards at GTCC which is kind of
interesting because the GTC conference
are
the graphics technology conference is
usually where Nvidia launches their new
stuff so we are approximately two months
away from the Pascal family being two
years old that's an eternity in graphics
card life because normally they don't go
longer than about 18 months at the most
so yeah this is a Pascal's giving a
little long in the tooth man do you feel
like they're hitting a wall or do you
think they're just milking it for
everything they can I honestly think the
lack of competition on AMD side just
made Nvidia feel like why do we need to
invest the money to come out with a new
family of GPUs when we already are
cornering the market that's a fair
statement it's not like it's gonna make
pub G run any faster anyways yeah that
one that's all that but he's playing
best stuff got on that game so far
number three I've actually gotten the
chicken dinner why she let me rephrase
that my team actually got the chicken
dinner and kept me alive
you're just that you're just the guy
that's up there like kind of just decoy
like literally every time we did
encounter any kind of danger they just
told me to stay in the truck and
all like jump out and run around and
kill everything so it was it was really
like zero effort on my part I think I
had a frying pan and that was about it
mm-hmm but victories victory man it
doesn't matter if it's an interim oil if
I was just gonna say that I watch a fast
look furious lately I almost said that
oh my god ask any racer any real racer
it's not how you stand by your car yeah
at least your car doesn't matter if you
win by an inch or a mile winnings
winning I'm seeing some comments here
about pub G's trash it sounds subjective
and personal there's there's two two
schools of thought on pub G either you
love it or you hate it and play
fortnight instead but I haven't played
fortnight so I don't really have a
reference I haven't read it either but
I've heard that it's a it's the new game
that everyone's like obsessed with and
we're gonna be doing our minimum spec
series with fortnight but I mean it
seems kind of neat it's just I think a
lot of whoa cuz you can build forts
right but it's like fast it's like
really fast building it's like I saw
some dude he was just like running
across the building like building
 roof underneath him and running
across it like he was Silver Surfer and
I was like oh this feel like it
like a Team Fortress vibe from what I've
been looking at well the capacity to
build something in Minecraft
I don't think fan of minecraft anymore
well I'm not saying yet to like the game
I'm just saying look how fast you can
run around just plop down blocks so it's
kind of that's true thing that's true I
guess it is kind of the mind core
minecraft versus fps I'm surprised they
didn't make a Minecraft fps like like it
seems to me like as modded model is
minecraft was I never saw me yes mom
they're just in mini games on custom
servers and stuff okay I know that's my
daughter's plan Adam back in the day and
I never I never saw an FPS game for it
Pub G needs more firearms I've never
I've never personally found a sniper
rifle
I found it twice but I'm no good with it
like it's it seriously has like some
weird bullet drop thing I cannot account
for you mean like realism
like I can't handle the realism Jay I
need I need those bullets to fly
straight and true and be instantaneous
like a laser beam what I love is games
that are as popular as like pub G right
like millions and millions of millions
of players you always have those people
that are just like it's trash it's
garbage I hate it and then you get those
people they're like I love it and I'm
addicted to it I think that's a fair
that's a fair statement but I I don't
know it sounds like people are applying
their opinion and trying to blink it
statement it and you can't do that how
dare they
you can't I think it statement entire
thing about this game is entirely trash
now if you said I feel that this game is
trash then that's a that's a statement
but when you blank it or just like this
game is trash or people that always
speak for everybody and always use like
let's say like we owe in us and it's
like you don't speak for everybody you
didn't speak yourself bro yeah
the only thing I can agree on a pub G is
that on Xbox one it's the biggest piece
of ever it's like they did a
prototype version it's it's literally
like alpha but it runs even on my xbox
1x I just got the new Xbox one X because
I needed a blu-ray player that could do
HDR for the new TV right so I bought it
as a blu-ray player and I said ah what
the I'll throw 4:07 on there for
seven actually looked really good rain
60 frames per second 4k Forza horizon 3
still runs at 30 frames per second which
I can't even understand because I
started the game it even says it's Xbox
one enhanced for Xbox one X and it still
runs at 30 frames a second I don't know
what the is wrong with them but oh
my god pub G runs it like maybe 15
frames a second
it's not playable it is not playable
crazy
Jason Christophe asks how do you feel
about an LS swap - 240 260 280 Z I feel
that that's a lot of power to weight
ratio it throws off it throws off the
50/50 weight distribution really bad
though that's the B's I've driven in one
before makes a wonderful drift car
because you drift cars you want them to
be front heavy as but but honestly
that that swap just ruins all of
the programs that I think what he was
getting at if I might just sort of
assume I know what he was asking is
whether or not I am against it like am i
a purist
no I'm not really a purist with anything
I love swaps I think the more bizarre
okay I'm saying it ruins the performance
of the car but it is cool like I would
totally do something like that if I had
like an extra like 240 or 280 see like
the old style - I'm talking like the old
like early 80s late 70s throw an LS into
one of those bad boys I mean that's a
fun car I mean it'll smoke the tires off
that all the way through every year not
that long ago I encountered a v8 I don't
I don't know what the eight it was but
it was a v8 rx-7 that's that might have
been you sure that wasn't an LS cuz
that's a really common element asshole I
just I'm just saying I don't know
specifically what was in it I just know
that it was a low Pinkham v8 and I was
like holy hell that's that's not
something you expect to see on the
street very oh yeah yeah cuz we got a
guy up here - exotics at RTC the exotic
show that we have here he shows up in
his rx-7 all time it's like the old you
know the really old like seventies
version they didn't have like a nice
curbs on the hood and everything it
basically was just shaped like a wedge
okay he has an ls3 in it and when he
starts it was just like Rob you know it
just sounds so crazy and I'm like that
seems like a weird swap because the one
thing about that car is that it's unique
because it's got a Wankel rotary engine
you're basically pulling that out and
swapping it was something else that's
even weirder but it just seems like a
weird car to swap into since it's
already weird to begin with yeah
well I mean I aside I'm not against swap
sir I'm not a purist I'm not that guy
that's like no how dare you pull that RB
24 out you know or the RB 26 or whatever
how dare you you know it's like your car
are your deal do what you want you know
enemy of it yeah I've seen a guy who
took us in this is sacrilege okay so I I
still support it because I think it's
cool but I'm just gonna qualify this
with it's absolutely sacrilege to be in
a super ruin or myself
the one key thing about supers they're
all-wheel drive right I mean they're
like rally cars for the street I love
Subarus because they play in the dirt I
saw somebody who actually took one
slammed it to the ground and did a BMW
mPower swap into it so like one of the
bmw m3 engines in the transmission and
then made it rear-wheel drive so it was
basically a Subaru WRX STI with a BMW
powerplant it was rear-wheel drive it
was a drift car that's just a
Frankenstein it was totally a
Frankenstein because I'm like that's a
car that's I mean at least leave it all
wheel drive but then again I think doing
a swap and keeping all-wheel Drive is
infinitely more complicated because you
have to get everything to line up with
the half shafts and everything for the
wheelbase yeah but but but as far as
making a rear-wheel drive I mean all you
got to do is made up the STI
transmission to the new power plant and
then plug the front what is it the where
the half shafts come out for the front
just basically weld them so that that
side of the diff doesn't work and then
transfer all the power to the back but
I'd imagine that you'd like if you
didn't like build out the transmission
in the gearbox in the back he probably
just shattered the frost date on
Chad s why didn't you J why didn't just
get a used GTR cuz I didn't want to use
GTR that those are the stupidest
questions though why didn't you this and
the why didn't you that because I didn't
 want to I mean is it really that
hard
first of all maintenance on a GTR is
freakishly expensive second I'm not
gonna buy a used GTR I have no idea what
that shit's been through you notice it's
been thrashed so it hasn't been thrashed
you know the warranty is void on the 8th
launch I give you lost no surprised it's
the 8th launch yeah I want to say that
it was actually less than that when they
first came out before they did the
double clutch it might have been but
yeah I know I know the newer ones
because I specifically told the the the
dealership that I was considering a GTR
the new GTR base right and I was like
they basically were and the guy that I
trust the guy they weren't just they
weren't just blowing smoke up my ass I I
know the guy and he used to work at the
Nissan do ship and he's one telling me
he's like you know on the 2017-2018 GTR
and the 8th launch it voids the warranty
the entire drivetrain warranty
so that's crazy and the thing is they
have a you know they have a black box
and any time you bring it in for service
they scan that black box if you've read
lined it or the are the transmission
services gone over temp and and hasn't
been serviced or any of that stuff then
they look for every reason possible to
avoid that car yeah they didn't warranty
the clutch remember the original GTR
they have the single clutch they said if
you use launch control even once you
voided the clutch warranty
yeah they built a feature into a car and
then they don't want it and exactly
exactly up literally on two launches the
clutch was not so on the GTRs so on the
flipside my zl1 1le has a track warranty
I could take it to the track and I can
beat the out of it and as long as I
have not messed with the tune on the car
then they will warranty it so I'm
actually pretty impressed by that yeah
so well because Ford's doing it so they
kind of have to write 4x you know I have
a bad history with Chevy but Chevy's
just like Ford their race the race
division is completely different than
their mainline cars yeah I mean gee I
can't compare a Chevy Volts here freakin
Camaro I mean they're they're two
completely different worlds and build
quality inside and out hey hey rim racer
16 if you don't wanna hear a car talk
then click the X dude no one forced you
to get in here so you can just like
peace the out for all we care
honestly Hauser's have an axe man no no
no you got to say the trade trademark
thing J what yes I don't give a the
unsubscribe go ahead my trademark
I don't know that's your trade mark
dude oh because of that video oh yeah
yeah I don't care bro hit unsubscribe I
don't care
Jay are you getting sick I'm on the edge
of sick because my youngest has been
sick for like two weeks with a stupid
cold going around here and I've been on
the edge of like feeling like I'm gonna
get sick but not actually sick so it's
like my voice sounds a little scratchy
and stuff but other than that like I'm
not I don't feel sick but I do feel like
I'm I'm everything is my autoimmune
system is just like doing everything I
can to not what's so I'm on the cusp of
either about to get really sick or about
to not you know what I mean yeah a
little bit of a cold going on that's
been lingering for about two weeks my
wife had to go to the doctor today
because she's got a chronic cough for
like the last two weeks I was like you
got in the moan you go to the doctor and
they like looked her over they're like
nope your lungs are fine you just need
flonase so she wouldn't got flonase
today but and then Xander was sick in
December
so it's been just going around and
everybody to school sick like I wish
parents would stop sending their kids to
school so sick oh my god you go up there
and it's like every kid is just hacking
up alone yeah you're like wondering why
everybody's getting sick and why we got
the freaking bubonic plague running
around stranger asked why is Jay so
pissy today cuz I've to deal with stupid
comments like yours it's not being pissy
this is normal Jay Jay Lee I didn't even
know difference actually thought he was
being pretty chipper today
I'm a little low on energy I do you feel
like I need some caffeine but why ever
well I already had my n feta means and
caffeine for the day so I'm just good
well I basically did I take adderall
every day an adderall basically is just
a very highly refined low dose of meth
it isn't made in the bathtub at least I
don't think it's made about that nobody
really knows what goes on behind the
doors at Pfizer Jay did you find a good
tag at ten gigabit switch yet no and
maybe maybe you have a suggestion for me
Jerry I need to do so we have our we're
built the new server in here yep and I
want to on my land I want to get a good
10 G switch just so that the
workstations and the server you know can
communicate at that speed that 14-under
megabytes a second speed so I'm I'm open
to suggestions on a good switch doesn't
need to have a lot of ports we only have
about three computers to plug into it so
you're gonna have a hard time finding a
low port count on on a 10 gig switch I
mean because they're just they're
they're still so targeted towards
commercial use you're not gonna find
like a home version I think there's one
company that makes like a five port that
I looked at but it was still like six
hundred bucks and add shitty review I've
seen a bunch of like there'll be eight
or sixteen port one you know gigabits
and then it'll have like four or ten G
on it now let me see which one I was
looking at side one myself and the only
reason I haven't gotten it yet is just
because the price uh so it's one hundred
a hold on here no sorry one what is it
one thousand base T I'm not entirely too
concerned with the price if it's good
does it make sense
right right no no yeah I mean if you're
willing to spend like like about a
thousand bucks I know d-link makes a
rackmount one that's like baller it has
like a five-star rating yeah there's no
one I don't want to drop a couple grand
on it because it I don't need to think
that extravagant but there's gotta be
something
it's 10-gig bastey there we go come on I
mean a lot of people's to keep saying oh
Bick wa t I've been trying to talk to a
big booty but they are incredibly
unresponsive so I've kind of moved on to
a different brand they're really good
for wireless stuff but other than that
I'm not really like excited about their
stuff but like d-link here's the one I
owe you know the that got shitty
reviews it's kind of funny normally
d-link is not really synonymous with
high quality in my opinion Linksys has
failed me uh was the other brand I had I
had Linksys just go in there no net year
yeah net year was the worst net year was
absolutely the highest failure rate I've
ever had in my house uh the the d-link
stuff worked really well though I still
have d-link switches throughout my whole
house and I've never had one fail in ten
years
yeah but I'm using their consumer grade
stuff the only one that I have that's
their professional one is I have a
twenty four port dealing I only use
three ports on and it's it's never died
but I've never actually pushed it to its
limit so Cisco make still makes really
good stuff but their stuff honestly is
overpriced for the feature set now I
mean it's there there's way better
options it's too bad this d-link got a
bat who who raided this down home this
was like a perfect rating before now
it's only three stars oh but only has
four reviews so like one dude just came
in probably gave it one star cuz like it
didn't arrive on time and how much can
you trust a product that only has like
you know four reviews
yeah and do you want to run are you
gonna be running a cat 6 e or 7 or are
you gonna run fiber I probably won't run
fiber I would only do fiber if I was
gonna actually go up to like 40 gigabit
surprisingly the fiber switch is like
three hundred dollars cheaper for some
reason beyond my comprehension but yeah
the 10k coppers about twelve hundred and
forty-nine bucks for the d-link twelve
port and it's got it's actually got an
uplink to four fibers so if you ever did
want to link multiple switches together
with fiber you can do that and then
everything else could be on copper but
uh but ya know it's I mean these things
are so damn expensive I don't understand
why they don't have a consumer like just
five port regular because the people
will use them right I mean I have a I
have an AZ that's capable of ten gig I
have multiple computers that have ten
gig cards in them the ten gig cards came
down in price you can actually get what
does the Asus makes a ten gig card
that's 100 bucks
right
and so asus includes them and a lot of
their a lot of their motherboards now
and like the workstation boards have 10g
built-in dual ten yes so I don't I don't
get why the switches are still so
goddamn expensive because like because
like you said they're still tailored
towards enterprise solutions yeah yeah
just need a some but somebody needs to
just pop the cherry of the consumer
market and just come in with one and not
charge a billion dollars for it who or
what you do is you just buy a bunch of
to port ten gig cards and they're just
daisy chain the out of it use and
use the nasa network address translation
or not Wow see if you can find something
on this the lawn guy just said what do
you guys think about new eggs skipping
out on charging state sales tax and now
they're forcing everyone from 2014 to
2016 to pay the tax that's got to be
 there's no way they could
enforce that no is there no way can they
can enforce it but I've bought so many
things from new egg and I've never once
not been charged state sales tax oh
really I want to say I want to say that
I never got charged for it because
others am here with you but they can't
they can't even ship to Washington for
my understanding though no I've order
stuff from new egg tons of times really
I mean I know I know that New Age I used
to buy a new egg cuz I ever that new egg
isn't even allowed to go to Washington
like you'd the events and stuff because
they don't they don't charge Washington
sales tax and they don't have a there's
some rule there I don't know much about
it but I remember I remember a couple
years ago this was like a big thing now
let me login to my accountant see when
the last time ordered something once I
can't imagine I wonder if they're
talking about use tax does the
difference between sales tax and use tax
for instance when I bought my fs5 it was
from Oklahoma and they were very adamant
like okay look we're not we're not
charging you sales tax but you very well
could be charged a use tax which is very
similar to a sales tax it's just a more
of a flat rate that handles take the
state it's just it's up to the seller to
and like enforce that document so they
could new it could be doing something
like that new it could have maybe gotten
slept for not doing a use tax and now
they're trying to go back and apply use
taxes to all of those those what's I'm
not familiar with use tax do we not have
that here in Washington use tax is more
of a federal thing like across the
entire United States okay cuz I mean
everything I've ordered from another
state like be from B&amp;amp;H or a dorama or
I've never paid tax on any of that stuff
me either I think this is one of those
like it's too difficult to enforce so it
just gets swept under the rug all the
time kind of kind of taxes but yeah I
don't know much about use tax I just met
that don't that's the only I could think
that's happening here with the the whole
new egg thing but I have not seen an
article I have not heard anything about
this other than the one person
mentioning it in chat so I have no idea
what that is
have you yeah anything come up in your
search nope so I don't word Adid if you
can post something like elaborate on it
I mean they talked about I found a link
to sales tax exemption question about
new egg and sales tax on Tom Hardware
from like a billion years ago yeah
there's nothing there's nothing new oh I
did find one article here hold on here
so this is new egg stops collecting new
york sales tax consumer electronics
retail new air announced friday but this
is back in 2008 but they're no longer to
comply with the new york state law
requiring the collection of online sales
tax oh are some states instituting a
rule that you have to pay sales tax even
on online purchases is it possible that
that's like some new thing that some
states are doing because it looks like
new york has according to this it's
possible but I don't know I mean is
there a statute of limitation how can
how can they go back to 2014 and just be
like oh yo Texas for all your purchases
this year yeah I don't that doesn't make
any sense and even if they did come to
me and be like you have to pay this
they'll be like you guys
transactions done man you can't come
back like you know year later well I
mean the IRS can I mean I guess if they
was dire I see a lot of people saying I
wasn't charged tax another than this
state love above so here's the way it
typically works and this is why you
probably have to get charged tax in
Amazon almost anywhere you buy Amazon
because they have so many distribution
centers now right yeah if you are buying
something from an online site and they
have a if they have a distribution
center brick-and-mortar or even an
office in the state in which you reside
they have to charge you the local sales
tax regardless of where it's like
shipped from so if you if you live in if
you live in Oklahoma and you buy
something from new egg and let's say new
egg has an Oklahoma warehouse even if it
doesn't come from Oklahoma that say it
comes from there Texas warehouse they
still are going to charge you the oak
sales tax that's the way that it works
so I don't know maybe something like
maybe maybe I have no idea but I can't
find any article talking about this no I
haven't and I haven't bought anything
for Newegg in a year but last year I
bought a ton of stuff from Newegg and
and I didn't pay taxes on any of it so
in Washington at least right so I don't
know if this is some new law but I can't
imagine that it's retroactive back to
2014 even if it did exist because like
how how in the hell did they let like
four years blow by without realizing
that a corporation that big was not
charging sales tax when they should have
been so just like FAO and Chet just says
I got an email in November that just
that December 8 2017 new egg would start
collecting sales tax in Pennsylvania
they never used to do that so that must
mean they have an office or distribution
center in Pennsylvania now or
Pennsylvania is requiring that sales tax
be applied to their state for online
purchases California was trying to do
that too so it's one of the two they
either have they either have a location
now in Pennsylvania or Pennsylvania
requires the sales tax to be applied to
online purchases either either or it
also sounds like new eggs shouldn't be
allowed to ask for that money back if
they're hit with a penalty from like the
IRS for not collecting taxes that's on
them to pay it I mean I guess they could
try to Duke you into paying for it but I
don't know how they could because that'd
be the equivalent of you like buying
something that they they put the wrong
price on and them calling you back and
be like oh dude we're supposed to sell
you that motherboard for $20 more so can
you give us another 20 bucks or mail it
back I mean they can't do that yeah they
can't go to sack I mean that has been
applicable date yeah so if you get some
email that's like new eggs strong-arming
you to pay a bunch of back taxes you
like click this link and pay us $8,000
in sales tax I would probably talk to
like your local like law enforcement or
something and see if there's any if
that's if that's an enforceable law you
know what this writ that okay so I'm
sure people have noticed over the last
decade there has been a huge push to
online purchases online sales it's
bigger deal than it's ever been
I disagree I buy everything locally
everything liar I have seen your box
collection dude everything in my house
is made in China even the boards on the
floor so anyway so what's happening is
these states are realizing like they're
not getting their sales income tax or
their sales tax because people are
buying stuff from out of state so all
these states are scrambling
to try and collect money somehow some
way because you know they need more
money there won't be a big deal if they
actually spent the money they get you
know and actually accounted for it
it wasn't like it wasn't like California
or the like oh my god we need to fix the
potholes we are down we are drowning in
piles like I like LA specifically we
have so many potholes it's terrible we
need to raise the price of gasoline 10
cents and add a 10 cents County tax or
whatever on it and then they get the
money and they get the the millions of
dollars for it but then they'd pop it in
the general fund and then they don't fix
the streets and then two years later
like oh my god we need to fix the
streets the streets are so bad we need
to raise ten cents it's just a perpetual
thing that keeps happening nobody pays
attention it just keeps sliding by hey
that Derick Sadr just messaged me on
Twitter he said to their any don't miss
items the deal women read and Ben
Kirkland air he said I'll be there later
this month I just reply back so go spin
on the Microsoft campus sign huh tell
him to take a video please please Derek
if you're watching right now please take
a video you spitting on the Microsoft
sign-off 148th and redmond i will i will
retweet the out of that I'm not
butthurt at all though I'm glad
Microsoft laid me off makes me happy
the okay so zero flaming says the State
Department of Revenue are sending out
collections for it not new egg
new egg provided transaction records
though ok Fox so in that case you might
be screwed cuz that's that's actually
the same as being audited by the IRS
basically you're being audited by the
state I guess
yeah well that sucks cuz what if
you're somebody who has bought like I
mean Cod from 2014 I mean there's people
that are price pent you know twenty
thirty forty thousand dollars a new egg
over the last like four years that's not
ridiculous if you're always building
like new PCs and stuff what are they
just gonna come after him for four grand
in taxes like that's just ridiculous
yeah yeah I bet if they do something
like that they'd better offer like a
payment plan and like that like
that's that's I kind of want to keep my
eye on that now because that's scary cuz
can they just is that gonna start
happening everywhere anything could
happen anywhere that these 500 men out
in the capital decide they can do I'm so
sick of the political landscape right
now oh my god it's not just the u.s.
though it's it's jacked up all over the
world it is
it is I'm gonna pan Adele you hear about
them as bitching about the government
you go to England all you hear is them
bitching about the government so I mean
what do you think is Canada has the same
problem as we do or they're like
completely polarized over like half of
them hate Trudeau the other half love
Trudeau you you have the guys that are
like oh man our universal health care up
here's badass but then the other half
are like it I broke my knee and my
surgeries in like seven months it's like
you know they there's so many different
sides because like here yeah and sure
it's a stupid expensive and but at
least if you need a surgery on something
you can pretty much guarantee you're
gonna get it in like a week or two up in
Canada it's like no you you unless it's
life-threatening I mean your your knees
blown out it's like you're done like you
got to wait half a year to get
anything Steve Ward on Twitter use the
ask hash the hashtag ask Tech Talk would
it be a good idea to trade a 10 60 2010
or to a 980 at no cost
I don't think so because a 1066 gig is
about the same speed as a 980 already so
if you already have a 1060 just keep
it's more efficient
speaking of graphics cards and stupid
pricey I'm just gonna tease my my next
little giveaway campaign since I'm such
a giveaway show oh my god I actually
actually acquired graphics cards to give
away that wasn't easy believe it or not
yeah I heard those are kind of in
shortened a man had nothing to do with
cryptocurrency at all though just so
everybody's clear on that
yeah had ever had to do all them damn
gamers why can't you guys game scaled up
all the cards you stopped game in that
way we can do our mining sorry I'm
giving away a ten sixty a ten seventy
annotate eighty and possibly a 1080i and
you know that's gonna be a worldwide
giveaway so yes I just was like I want
to give away some cards and what you I
want you giving away yours because
they're mine and keeping them here
because I'll never get to replace that
that's Jays retirement at this rate like
the price of graphics cards are going up
in lockstep with bitcoins so like pretty
soon it'll be like 1080p is going for
$32,000 right now but I'm keeping a
little ledger here if the people click
and dislike on the stream and the people
saying stupid stuff in chat and I'm just
gonna DQ them so yeah this qualified man
is how I do yep don't be a dick don't be
dead best thing YouTube ever did was
actually allowing us to see who clicks
like and dislike now but oh no way where
do you see that it's in the Creator
studio I'll show you
oh sweet olga nestle yeah that way you
can always tell when people are just
being like you know dicks to your face
but then behind the scenes are like
applying for all the little giveaways
and stuff so oh there's gonna be fun
best thing I ever did was implement that
now if we could just anyway so hey I'm
gonna write the script adjust auto bands
everybody know shut up in shadow band
I'll even let them know their band
beside them yeah oh my god where do you
enter the giveaway blitz it hasn't even
 started yet Jesus Christ
vultures vultures can I enter your
giveaway cuz I need I need a cup I need
another ten eighty for Bitcoin money can
I can I enter your contest please you
know how bout a couple Titan exes is
yeah a couple Titan X would be fine do
you got any Titan bees or heard those
are pretty quick surprisingly no I do
not have one I never I was I was like
I'm not gonna buy that stupid stupid I'm
gonna buy that to do how much of the
bees gone for now the Titan bees did
they suffer from the same no
they were already three thousand dollars
doesn't sound like a very good
investment
know what I mean for crypto mining if at
na vi's cost with you like a thousand
dollars now because the inflation you
might as well get something that mines
six times as fast you know for three
thousand yeah but I don't think it I
don't think in mind six times faster
though right I think I think Adam was
showing that his compared to my system
with the to Titan X's in it he was
beating my score by almost double with
one Titan B yeah but it's more than
double the price true it's three times
the price uh I don't know what does tell
you what does that take next pika for
now Oh
twelve hundred so twelve hundred bucks
so yeah got a little over double thank
you point five times so I guess I guess
it's still not very cost-effective no I
guess okay so speaking of graphic starts
talked about that so rumor has it that
GT C which is normally the you know you
know Adam o Adam but um you said Adam
that got stuck my mind now Apple always
has their you know GDC or their
developer conference WDC whatever it is
and they that's usually where they would
launch the iPhone and they started
holding their own press conferences
later
well JTC is the same for graphics
technology and that sees you or AMD and
NVIDIA and all of them will show off
their newest creations and that's
apparently not happening this time
around
rumor has it and get or isn't even able
to talk about
cuz I don't have an NDA with a video
right now and I don't have any
information otherwise I wouldn't be able
to talk about any of this so that gives
you a timeline
rumor has it we're not seeing anything
till cute to like mid late q2 when it
comes to Nvidia graphics cards and then
the rumor that I've been listening to
locally is that it may even get pushed
back farther interesting it's very
unlikely that it's gonna be Volta core
or Volta you know stacked Ram or any of
that stuff since because of
manufacturing costs and given the
current state of graphics cards I don't
even know how this launch would go
anyway I'm surprised they didn't just
shill it like they did with like Star
Wars cards and like do like another
movie themed card like like what's
what's a ready player ones coming out
I'm surprised I didn't do like a ready
player one edition led RGB backlit card
that's the exact same it cost like
$5,000 more they're slipping dude yeah I
mean so if we if we can't even
manufacture graphics cards fast enough
now
I mean allegedly to keep the pricing
down based on demand I mean the moment a
new gaming card comes out you you you I
just see the problem persisting don't
you yeah no and the thing is
cryptocurrency I did some more research
into it I thought there'd be a good way
for them to cripple it like basically
not create CUDA variants of the cards
and the thing is is there's already open
source libraries that bypass CUDA and
use the floating-point API Klee so yeah
so that went out the window so even if
they Adam ate a card without CUDA it
wouldn't have stopped cryptocurrency at
all
alpha high of 78 says they're gonna wait
for AMD before they something with a
better card a month later I for a while
I absolutely positively don't believe
that from everything I have ever seen
the the conversations I've had with
Nvidia the emails they send the
marketing material that they send us the
reviewers guides and the media guides
and all that stuff Nvidia legitimately
is in their own bubble and doesn't give
two craps about what AMD is doing they
truly don't and Markus shirts so
different between the two companies I
mean they're not even remotely
competing honestly if you want to look
at the numbers right and AMD says the
same thing they say they're not
concerned or interested
what nvidia is doing I don't believe
that because I think that they're always
playing catch-up within videos so there
have to be you know at least cognizant
of what the market is doing
AMD obviously caused a disruption with
on the CPU market but yeah I mean looks
like we've had Vega 56 in Vega 64 it was
sort of a flop in terms of performance
to power ratio and it's just not much
really came of that there wasn't a
continuation of that Vega line the 570s
a 580 is still there mainstream cards
and it's really interesting how far
we've been going now without new
graphics cards it's pretty obvious the
cryptocurrency is stifled this entire
market I don't even know what to believe
anymore in terms of how this is gonna
play out in the future I used to be
pretty good at making predictions and
over the five or five and a half years
I've been doing this now I've made a few
predictions that turned out to be pretty
close I don't even know where to start
anymore
yeah well I'm thinking that what's got
to happen and it probably will happen
because I mean it happened last time
cryptocurrency was mined with GPUs is a
company needs to develop hybrid ASIC
they can do it and it's more complicated
because the current cryptocurrency
mining that's being done can't just be
done with it with an ASIC it requires a
GPU because the massive memory bandwidth
it has but once China figures out how to
take that massive memory bandwidth throw
away the rest of the and bolt that
into a little self-contained unit they
can mine same things gonna happen as
before and GPU prices are gonna plummet
supply is gonna go up and all the crypto
guys are just gonna dump it yeah but but
it's not happening as fast as I thought
it would like I know everybody comes to
me they're like oh man it's really
complicated cuz you gotta use you know
you got to use a gddr5 you know and you
got to have this massive memory
bandwidth and only a GPU controller has
and I'm like well if they can put that
 on a GPU they can obviously do it
in a standalone unit it's just a matter
of manufacturing right in a demand
that's there the demand is super high so
there's got to be a company in China
right now being like you know what we're
gonna cut down the cost of these crypto
miners and speed them up dramatically by
cutting out all the that's not
needed like graphics out and all of the
API set that's needed for doing graphics
processing operations and just cut
it down and basically make it like a
rudimentary really fast mathematic
machine and be good and the fact that
Bitcoin is still sitting at eleven
thousand dollars a coin Korea
man it's going whales like guys
you know where was it one year ago one
year ago it was what about four thousand
three now yeah four thousand yeah so
people that are in it for the long haul
that invested back then man they're
still sitting pretty but what's what's
the it's a theorem that uses GPUs yes
the theory Bitcoin doesn't use GPU at
all anybody this is Bitcoin nine a six
the GPU market is wrong it's all a 600%
um so let's see a theory and price what
are we looking at right here let's look
at the in theory impress index on coin
telegraph it's pretty flat right now
which is a good thing for investigation
I don't mean a good thing for for
aetherium that's actually pretty pretty
par for the course but it did have a
drop did you see the drop that happened
around February sixth yeah I see that
but look how fast it rebounded oh yeah
yeah it popped right back up and I mean
even at this PTO is only at about 1200
so you could argue you know 800 is a lot
less than that but that's that's common
for crypto currency and the way
cryptocurrency works guys is it's a
self-balancing algorithm the whole point
because they borrowed that from Bitcoin
the way Bitcoin works is as soon as
supply outweighs demand the difficulty
on the network goes up and it makes it
harder to get more Bitcoin so that that
demand will start going up in the supply
all start to drop and it constantly if
one of the three legs of the currency
the demand the supply or the cost change
dramatically the other two elements
automatically shift to bring it back
into balance yeah like they say like if
you look at Bitcoin like watch my
Bitcoin video it's really old now but it
still explains pretty much how it works
in detail it basically says that the way
that the blockchain works is it's it's
basically self-healing anytime something
happens or any catastrophic thing
happens it readjusts itself and it like
difficulty goes up exponentially the
more people to mine so every time more
mining equipment enters into the
algorithm they're still giving out the
exact amount exact same amount of
Bitcoin every you know hour or whatever
but they're only giving it out so the
more people that are mining the harder
it is for them to win that and the
lottery gets more and more difficult to
win like more numbers get added to the
lottery card basically yeah basically
GPUs became a money making tool which is
why they're so expensive and I based on
this whole see everyone started
screaming at the bubbles crashing yeah
oh my god prices going to come to norm
well no no this is this is still a
volatile market but a market that is
here for the long haul nonetheless so I
am legitimately concerned about the
future because there will be an ASIC
though but it'll be a hybrid ASIC cuz an
ASIC alone is gonna do it because it
needs that crazy memory bandwidth but I
guarantee you that there is enough
demand for it now and the supply of GPUs
is dropping to a level where it's no
longer advantageous to buy the GP is to
mine anymore they are gonna have to
create this ASIC in the first company
that does it is gonna come to market
with it and make a killing the same
thing happened when was it bit not bit
power the guys that make the s3 and the
s5 bit me is a bit Maine one of the
companies that created the first ASIC
that mind a Bitcoin back when it was GPU
mined exclusively these little Asics
were like tiny little USB thumb drives
you plugged in that mind faster than the
fastest GPU and cost like 50 bucks
overnight everybody abandoned the GPS
and moved to those like it was like
instant yeah so so I think we just need
that to happen and the only way that's
gonna happen is if GPU prices go up to a
level where it's no longer profitable
for miners to acquire the cards at those
prices and it's gonna starve the market
enough for them to go and research other
alternatives and it is the scary part is
for what Jerry is saying here guys is
that price is can go much much higher
before that happens
true very true because right now it's
still profitable even even at 10 80 if
you pay $1,000 for a 1080 if the current
it's like 1300 or 1200 for now okay so
let's say $1,200 well that's that's
actually probably getting close to the
limit but once you get to 1200 ollars
just think about it the current
difficulty and prof ability of aetherium
and the cost of aetherium you would
easily be able to mind to aetherium an
$800 a coin on that thing in six months
so you're basically gonna pay for the
graphics card get like $600 back so it
still doesn't need to go up quite a bit
yeah but it will I mean that that's how
it supply and demand works right I mean
the price will just keep going up until
it's at a point where people just will
not pay that price anymore they'll back
it off a notch and then something else
will come come through that'll relieve
the pressure off the market and then the
GPUs are just gonna plumb it and then
and then and then the company I mean
it's gonna hurt Nvidia and AMD
dramatically because they're gonna go
overnight from getting $1200 a card to
that
being worth like only pennies because so
many of them are going to enter the use
market instantly I mean I have to admire
the creativity of this but it just
really sucks that it that it's a
crossover you know platform that is
affecting so many things but the
shortage but I will tell this I so when
I did my video about cryptocurrency is
it ruining gamer or games and all that
stuff this is a domino effect yeah you
have your game manufacturer or your game
developer compass it may affect your
we-we-we mill games here uh we have CNC
gaming cell anyway you have your game
developers you every game publishers
let's with EA and all that aside of the
guys what do you feel like EA but you
every game developer your cut and all of
them if their game is a new title that
people can't run because they can't
afford to buy the grat new graphics card
in the last two or three years we're
going on about a two-year we're going
about two years now that the the pricing
of graphics cards have been volatile
because of this so you start to get to
the point where your your hardware is
becoming antiquated and you can't run
the newer titles that you want or you
may even fall below the minimum specs
and you can't buy or enjoy the new game
because of it there's a domino effect
sure you can't game but you also the
developers their titles aren't doing so
well they don't get the funding above
their investors yeah it's there's a
domino effect sure it's a very extreme
one that I'm I'm laying out right here
but the other thing too is when it comes
to just the overall the overall pricing
of this market the domino effect has so
many things happening here now it's not
just crypto miners that are that are
causing this shortage I I made that
video and I'll leave them nameless but a
manufacturer reached out to me and
they're like hey I'd like to talk to you
about your video you're on the right
path but there's way more at play here
and what they explained to me was there
what's really causing the shortage with
graphics cards and the reason why the
manufacturers can't just and I'm not
talking out like AMD or Nvidia reached
out to me it's one of the AI B's
basically they said look we would love
to manufacture more cards we physically
can't not because they can't ramp up
production because there is a worldwide
memory shortage though memory shortage
is keeping them from be able to
manufacture more car
because memory is now something that
more manufacturers are using than ever
smart cars just smart phones your
tablet's
everything uses the memory now there's
only like three manufacturers the memory
in the world
yeah and so they in storage right
storage is probably one of the biggest
ones right everybody's moving demand in
SSD and everything nobody's using
spinning disks anymore right and there
there's an and storage there is a memory
storage or nand storage shortage memory
shortage and it's domino affecting right
now so you have this a massive amount of
pressure put on that many of that that
that manufacturing process that means
that they cannot actually make it fast
enough and so that's why we're seeing
this shortage the cryptocurrency is just
it's just one direction that that
particular shortage is being hit because
the graphics cards can't make the cards
cuz it's short on memory so the bottom
line is it was a problem that was
probably coming anyway it's just it's
gotten worse because of of everything
else happening and one of the things
they actually attributed to this to was
the amount of the amount of smart cars
now what I mean by that is not
self-driving cars or anything like that
obviously those use you know processors
and stuff in there but the infotainment
systems and and all the things that are
being put into cars now better standard
feature that yeah so there's just so
much happening here so the question is
how long now before we come up with an
entirely new process of computing yeah I
mean do you think do you think we're on
that cusp now in the next let's say
let's say the next two decades next 20
years we'll see some new way of doing
this well I mean we already do right
with quantum computing as a real thing
it's a proven technology I mean some of
it's still theoretical but it's a proven
technology it's just the cost of using
it is basically astronomical right but
that's what happened with the original
microprocessor to write the silicon
microprocessor right so so eventually
we're gonna see probably quantum
computing stepping in and not not maybe
replacing but at least augmenting on
some level but they got to figure out
how to do that without having to be
like negative you know 200 degrees
Celsius you know there's some there's
some big blocking issues they got to
overcome it you know they need to be
able to do quantum computing at room
temperature which again is something
that probably is theoretical and hasn't
even been tried Matt Nichols and Chet
says when individuals are buying
hundreds at a time that isn't
contributing it
contributing but what I'm saying is when
you have automotive manufacturers buying
millions at a time
yeah and I'm talking about the chips for
memory not millions of graphics card but
millions of components ah components
yeah that is putting a strain on
everything so it's it that is one piece
to this problem and that was extremely I
open i opening in that conversation that
I had about look yes graphics card may
you know cryptocurrency mining and of
course it has put a direct strain on the
very specific application of which you
were complaining about but there but the
worldwide shortage is much deeper and
bigger than your discussing and that's
what the conversation was you know what
you you actually called out another
problem and that is even if they are
successful in creating an ASA actually
actually I think you may have
inadvertently answered the question as
to why there isn't a hybrid ASIC for
mining right now and that is it has the
same requirement as the GPU
manufacturers it needs that fast GB
gddr5 memory right that's coming out so
obviously it which is what everyone in
that video is telling me they're like J
Asics are good in all but it's the
memory speed that is needed for things
like aetherium because I'm still pretty
ignorant to how its mind I just followed
more the stock market and the stock
supply problem than the actual like how
it works cuz how it works made I thought
it made little difference to me but
obviously that that plays into the
entire thing so now it's on my part
speed it's all about memory size and
speed because it's all about lookup
tables they're all the mathematics
involved they're done through randomly
generated tables in memory that then you
have to look up improve your work so so
basically think of it like just putting
a billion Excel documents every second
in the memory and then processing them
to get an answer out so it's it's it's
not a lot of C it's like you can even
lower the speed on the GPU CBR the C the
GPU and it's not really gonna affect the
performance of it at all if you can
trade it off for RAM speed it's all
about the RAM stream and then but the
comments like this like JW Dickinson
dick Eason says yet they still seem to
not be expanding manufacturing and fear
of something of the market crashing so
they just rather have incredibly high
margin than just making more fabs I
maybe he wasn't here when I said it they
can't make more there is a worldwide RAM
shortage they I think what he's talking
about there's more more manufacturing
facilities that are capable of creating
it from rile
but but that but okay every time a GPU
manufacturing no no just the memory
modules like like you said there's three
manufacturers of memory like in the
world right they're not and they're not
tapping out they're manufacturing now
because of the raw process their
manufacturing is what's in shortage not
the not the not the capability of the
fabrication so these warehouses are not
these warehouses are pumping out as fast
as they can based on the how fast they
can actually mine the material to make
the chips out okay you're so you're
saying the limitation is actually on the
raw materials these oh if that's the
case then yeah it makes no thank you
more matter so you can make empty
manufacturing plants I can't make
anything because the manufacturing
plants they already have are not tapped
because the raw materials of the product
they make is what's tapping does that
means we basically need to find a new
superconductor like which is why I just
said how long can we can we keep this
this computing process as our future I
mean obviously we're what were what
eighty almost eighty years invested into
the current technology but I mean this
can't be the only way in the world to
compute this can't be no no and the
thing is right solutions come to
problems when the problem happens right
like like this isn't a market that's
really proactive it's more reactive so
now that we're seeing a problem where
graphics cards are too expensive for
people to buy um the gaming companies
now are taking a hit all these problems
are gonna sum up to more research and
more investment into a better technology
oh the conspiracy theorists are starting
Oh what do we got now project Phoenix
media no idea who he is but he's got
check mark he says the three fabs are
colluding to lower yields to make more
with less he's saying he's saying I've
done that before I don't doubt it but
he's saying that the the chip
manufacturers are specifically stifling
production to keep the yields high yeah
like did you hear about this a long time
ago like ten years ago that's illegal
first of all in like even international
trade law that is illegal to do that but
how do you prove it like all they gotta
do is pay Jose just not to run the
backhoe at Full Tilt right yeah what one
one for the machine that smells the or
and one for the garbage let's take an
extra-long lunch break today exactly but
but that happened with diamonds too like
everybody thinks diamonds are incredibly
rare and it turns out they're not even
nearly as rare as people thought
they are like that there is an
artificial blockage on you know diamond
my
most of the diamonds those mines
intentionally operate and hold huge
supplies and reserve because they know
if they flood the market meet the demand
it'll drive the price down and this
becomes as popular or as as pricey as
glass exactly and they basically said
like this some of the some of the places
where they're mining these diamonds like
on earth are literally like you grab a
handful of dirt and diamonds are
like falling out of it like there's it's
it's not nearly as precious of resources
people let on yeah
well gold other hand were running out of
like at an alarming rate like we haven't
we we haven't found a lot of new gold
and luckily we don't depend on gold
nearly as much as we used to in
microprocessors and stuff like I
remember back in the 80s everything at
gold right yeah but all those
manufacturers of motherboards and stuff
for saying three times the gold content
on the socket 3x gold content because
I'm all the pins are gold-plated so it's
it's three X low of like 100 millionth
of a gram
okay so Linus did a video when he was in
Taiwan that was very fascinating what he
was there for Computex last year I
highly recommend everyone go watch this
video it was super interesting he
basically did a tour of those those
recovery manufactory plants that take
the all the old PCBs and everything yeah
and they melt them down and actually
recovered the gold content out of it and
he was even holding like a giant gold
brick just like a solid you know chunk
of solid gold yep he was like I'm
holding like $40,000 with the gold right
here in my hand that was recovered from
recycled PCBs yeah there's a there's a
guy on YouTube who does just does it in
his garage he shows you how to like
extract the metal from it what he does
he takes smartphones old like Nokia
smartphones and he breaks him up
literally takes pliers and stuff and
busts them into little chunks puts him
in a beaker dumps this acid compound in
there and the acid compound basically
turns the gold into a liquid basically
like it like dissolves the goal and then
he puts it through tars what's that I
was telling a person I love him too so
anyways he takes this this material and
He pours it through this filter and then
all the gold sinks to the bottom and
then he adds this to it that
basically reconstitutes the gold and
then he smelt it in the fire to separate
it from whatever the binder is it's
a huge long process but the dude doesn't
his garage and he said like a single
smartphone from the 80s has has about
$15 or the gold in it mm-hmm
so if he did that on a large scale and
you know you had you know a hundred
thousand million or whatever Nokia
phones that were just destined for a
landfill I mean that's gonna be a lot of
gold right yeah yeah I mean because if
you look at Linus's video he shows how
there's just left huh sorry Marco said
Cody's lab it was Cody's lab that was
that I remember the YouTuber the day
he's that guys cool actually he drinks
like heavy water deuterium and like
show people it won't kill you it certain
amounts he's he puts a science where his
mouth is like the dude literally like
almost commit suicide every episode to
show you any dangers in the in the
last video that they showed how it was
like a giant warehouse full of boxes and
things like bulldozer level of PCBs that
they're just like scooping into these
vats and like melting them and all that
stuff crazy that can't have stores just
give the away now like like you
know secondhand stores used to sell like
CRT monitors and stuff they don't now
they won't even let you like donate them
you take it there they're like nope take
it to the recycling facility at the dump
so there's just piles and piles of these
and you literally drive to your local
dump and they will just give them to you
like nobody wants them because it is a
it takes a very specialized set of
equipment to be able to extract the ore
safely from it yeah so how many
facilities are there really they have
that capability to do it efficiently
enough to make it worth it yeah I mean
it's just funny how many businesses
arise from like even waste right you're
dealing with we're dealing with waste
and suddenly here you are now like
reclaiming precious metals he had to go
through a lot of clearance to do that
video just to have access to the gold
you know what I mean yeah now watch that
video I was like oh my god this is this
is insane just the amount of the amount
of reclaimed precious metals I mean
there's a lot of silver - in the
manufacturing of this stuff precious
metals are pretty pretty safe investment
I mean it's nice because it's an
investment into something tangible that
we know that there is a limited supply
of the only thing that's gonna us
on gold though is as soon as they figure
out a better conductor like like I'm
pretty sure there are other conductors
that are equally as good like I think
even at this point copper has been in
the way that they use it manufacturing
and stuff can largely replace what gold
used to do but still think about it what
happens if one day they just decide
they come up with something they cost
1/100 as much as gold and conducts twice
as good like I mean gold prices are just
gonna plummet the next day well you know
the answer to all this is is it's on
another planet somewhere unless of
course you're a flat earth theorist and
then it means it's outside the dumb like
was that you long that was talking about
this like okay so let's say we get to
Mars and it costs like was at $10,000
per pound or whatever he's got it down
to that he can get like a pound of
material on Mars for $10,000
Gold is heaviest no no no I'm
saying the undiscovered metal oh you're
talking about like the unicorn tears
yeah like an avatar was the unobtanium
yeah that whatever whatever the newly
undiscovered will solve all of our
problems metal is it's out there
floating around on a rock or buddy
they're gonna bring it back and like one
gram can be stretched to make five
billion motherboards or something like
that it turns into a different material
based on the amount of resistance of
electricity you put through it kind of
like Batman's cape Oh exactly and if you
snort it it gives you a boner for four
hours no four and a half hours safely
hey it's all in the dosage all in the
dosage man it's all in the nose it but I
mean like I said though you depending on
what you believe it's either outside the
dome or it's just floating around us so
yeah actually one thing I wanted to end
on the cryptocurrency subject though
before you shut it down is is I have
definitely changed my tune a little bit
in that cryptocurrency is pretty
responsible I mean I will accept that I
think I did in the beginning to some
extent but I still stand by people using
their cards to mine during you know like
individuals like me like when you're not
do it like I still completely stand
behind that because that's the only way
you're gonna offset this price you're
not by you not mining and refusing to
mining you're not making a stand you're
not making a political stand that's
gonna kill Bitcoin if anything by you
not mining you're actually helping to
drive the price up because you're
dropping the demand by not participating
in every single person out there that
had a GPU started mining their
ass off during every Idol cycle they
would drive the difficulty so high on
the etherium market that it would
probably end up pricing the cards out
and you know do many people accuse me of
being that that white knight running
around I am NOT gonna mow my cards
because that's not what they're for died
my cards have a different purpose for me
here in this business I agree with you
entirely if you have
the cards already and you can make money
they'll do it my problem has always been
with the companies that are building
mining farm spending you know buying 500
cards at a time and working out these
backdoor deals to buy the cards before
they ever become retail available that's
we're definitely getting them cheaper
than everybody else because I can tell
you right now I don't know a single
crypto mind like dedicated crypto my
minutes pay in retail for cards yeah I
mean or not so all back let me ask you
this though is there been is it actually
been a definitive test on how much life
reduction there is on your card when
you're when you're running it a hundred
percent and the downtime like that not
that I know of but here's the problem
memory has a finite number of reads and
right yeah it does it absolutely does
it's just like an SD card if you guys
don't know this if your SD card X eats
then exceeds the number of read writes
or whatever it the card becomes quote
unquote software locked and your
computer will think that your card is
locked if you're trying to write to it
but you can read from it you can read
from it we actually experienced that not
too long ago yes you can't the problem
is you can't recover a bad sector on a
on an and based or memory based disk you
can't on a physical disk because it just
gets weaker magnetism so you can usually
recover data if you keep reading it over
and over and over again but with SSD
when that sector is dead it's dead so
like you said
what's that oh sorry no it's talking to
us are gonna Nick oh so so anyways on
that on the SSDs yes if a sector hits
what is it like a hundred thousand oh
one hundred million is up read writes
then they basically they lock it that's
it's done and then you're just basically
develops bad sectors sorry I was I was
having a conversation with Nick behind
the scenes or we're gonna we're gonna
time someone out and chat oh my god what
did they do did they do something bad
did someone in it's someone in our
Nissan challenge group saying soubise
are better than Nissan's they are though
you're not the time Fiat - Nick Nick can
you buy me out I don't think is a
/timeout or I just right-click the name
and do it nobody looks like a
right-click me here I'll get this chest
okay there I'm in chat let me right
click myself and see my time myself out
yes come on come on all I can do is
remove remove my comment I can't tie
myself out Nick seeking time yeah I'm
doing it do it I wanted me I wanted me
to let me get article Easter guess we've
got timed out for 300 seconds and you
are and here we go you are it did it for
me it just doesn't show you see your tip
oh my mouth stopped working I did
that to build up all your Z is my mouse
back yeah my mouse is back all right let
me see if I can type something test oh
you've been put in timeout by the owner
of this video or moderator please try
again later
hey project Phoenix media don't try and
talk cars Evo bigger than Subaru that
should be MIT - better than Subaru you
noob you know what you know I'm gonna
tell I love Evo's I drove an Evo 9 and
it was an illustration it is not a rally
car anymore no no it's not a rally car
it's way too sophisticated
you're probably car but I think you're
telling what like anybody can drive an
Evo fast anybody can drive anybody
anybody can drive any car fast you
 turn the wheel and you just
stomp on the gas and the thing just like
figures out how to
get you around the corner it's like
what's the fun in that does your car
does the same thing on the dirt no no my
car you steer with the back wheels like
the front wheels have no nodes a
forklift
what is it what did they say it dirtfish
the front wheels are just for
influencing steering direction they
don't actually commit the steering ya
know Subarus understeer like a bitch I
mean you can correct it though like I
talked to a guy who showed me how with
the sway bar setup if you put a really
stiff sway bar in the back and then put
like a soft sweet bar in the front you
can actually get it to over I'm
conflicted Jason Van Patten just donated
$100 to tell me to time this out I dare
ya you can't turn that time about okay
you can't time out a super chat yeah you
can't time out a super chat so I can't
like when you sorry when you go into
super chat it goes into a different
thing and when I right like when I click
on it it won't let me time you out so
but hey I mean credit where credit's due
thank you for the hundred dollars though
appreciate it thank you it's pretty
sweet you're good man hello a nation
dare yeah I can't it won't let me do
anything with it weird I think somebody
should one-up him and do do a hundred
and dollars and one cent oh god I
remember that remember that one episode
that one that one livestream we did
where everyone donated like an odd
number yeah I do remember that yeah
actually one of my one of my biggest
live streams I ever did was I think it
was Mother's Day for my wife and I was
like today I'm gonna give all the
donations to my wife and like three
people got in basically a tip war for
top tip yeah and it got to the point
where I was like eighteen hundred and
some dollars and I was like oh I
died like shut it down I was I get
nervous at that point like it's
chargebacks and stuff like that I was
like oh god after you give the money to
your wife exactly why did I get I gave
it to her right after the show actually
went down to the safe and actually
busted out cash and handed it to her
she's like no no I just take him off the
card owes like no just take it now just
take it now like they did this for you I
promise in before chargeback um
interesting sidenote
and in all the years we've done this
we've never had a chargeback I don't
think Google operates that way I think I
think Google like there's no charge back
I think like IOU Bank at one I've had
one charge back on PayPal and the only
reason I went hey tryst is I never got
the notification I didn't challenge it
how do I challenged it it wouldn't go on
through that's PayPal it's not it's not
going to be PayPal with Google like I
think it goes somewhere else and at the
bank
has to do a chargeback I think that I
think Google just they don't go take it
back from a content creator I think
Google just eats it oh you're right yeah
because that's all that's all done
through yeah you're absolutely right
that's all done through like the Adsense
thing right on that's not PayPal at all
exactly yeah well PayPal has gotten a
lot better with chargebacks cuz that
used to be like a really scary thing
that's why people stopped using PayPal
for a long time but now PayPal changed
their policy on on donations and tips
right they that there is as long as it's
proven that the donation or tip was
acknowledged in some way shape or form
or you got what was said like an
acknowledgment means literally just
being shown somewhere on the screen yeah
then they will in favor of the recipient
now I did I accidentally tip thousand
dollars when he meant to tempt ten
dollars and I went like refunded him
immediately like I went to the PayPal
dashboard and said nope cancel this
transaction it was an accident
yeah remember when we gamertag got a ten
thousand dollar tip from a kid that was
like logged into his dad's credit card
it wasn't one tip that kid was tipping
for like six months it added up to like
$10,000 he was his top tipper of like
all time he had all the access to the
servers he had his own private server
basically it was all services right like
what he gave him all the services and
then yeah his I think his dad found out
or something about it and so went back
into the system and challenged the
entire thing and charged back he took
him to court and actually won I was
waving at the camera vigorously and then
a train horn went off it scared me yeah
it's like I just I can't respect people
to do that like honestly if if I even
had a guy once tip and then charger
backing him the charge back note or
something like that he said I just
needed you to see my message I was like
well then why are you taking it back
like we talked about that everybody else
out there's more like big donations
coming guys there's no reason to donate
there's really no reason to donate
please don't but bazinga XS are rich and
I'm basically like poor but I'm okay but
X says American muscle cars beats all
rice burners and no is the challenge and
hey as the challenge met
I own a 370z and a zl1 1le Camaro so
where do I where do I reside in this
argument you're gonna be all for
American cuz you basically got the one
American car that can go around a corner
like that one well you got one of two
American cars
but the car at the car that's like just
as fast as the Hellcat but can turn -
exactly
not my car though because it's six feet
it's slower in a straight line than the
ten speeds eo1 but that's okay yeah I
was actually surprised though the hell I
went and looked at the Hellcat lap times
four in a second they weren't bad like
actually they are the zero one one Olli
holds the fourth fastest time in Laguna
Seca though oh I believe I beat every
single McLaren except the p1
they can't even beat beat the Dodge
Viper I think that was one I was telling
you the head-to-head hmm I don't know oh
no sorry no it wasn't that odd Piper it
was the hot Corvette zr1 nozr won yep
and they did the heads up it was the
ones that had all the Megatron
bits all over him right like all the
splitters yeah yeah weighing in the back
and everything and yeah I think it was
like a tenth of a second faster than the
Corvette and the guy who's driving even
said that it shifted smoother in the
Corvette he like he preferred the
shifting in the Camaro and it's still
single clutch it's interesting the the
automatic that shifts just as fast as a
PDK is a single clutch but Wow but I did
I don't know some voodoo magic but
GM and Ford collaborated on that
transmission so yeah fun fact for all
you all you car lovers out there I found
this out like a couple years ago and I'm
still shocked that it's actually true a
lot of the foreign supercar
manufacturers like Aston Martin Ferrari
Lamborghini they actually license a lot
of their suspension and braking
technology from American car companies
Ferraris magnetic dampeners that they
use on their cars actually owned and
created by GM Jason Christoph says I
firmly believe no replacement for
displacement well that's why I have a
376 cubic inch with a one point seven
liter supercharger on it sir unless you
go back to the first Dodge Viper they
had an 8 8 point something liter engine
and only at 450 yeah
but the funny thing is those because
they're so under tuned like if you send
it to Hennessey all they do is put a
supercharger on it with bigger injectors
a fuel pump and then they have to put
one brace underneath it and it basically
bumps it up to 1,100 or power yeah you
know kingsnake or some same transmission
everything the thing just like is so
over bill the auto can't downshift the
Kapiti cade that makes sense because you
don't have a second clutch waiting to go
you know right basically two gearboxes
in one case
you know yeah I think that's the thing
with the double clutch right is you get
the speed on the up shift and the
downshift because it's basically doing
it the computers matching the revs right
between the clutches so it's like dead
smooth where isn't a single clutch
you're gonna get that but I like that
don't you like that that bump that you
get when you shift like we're kind of
like slams in your seat a little I mean
I know it's not perfect for downshifting
in a corner and like that but I
have not ridden in us in a any
performance automatic vehicle in a very
long time so I don't remember what
that's like oh it's like it's basically
electric smooth you don't even feel the
gear change at all I just don't know I
just know pee decays and and other dual
clutch cars they just it's not like
they're fart every time they ship Iran
that's all I know
oh no I take that back III guess I drove
the Aventador but I only got to drive
that for like ten minutes so it was kind
of hard or dual-clutch yeah I'm pretty
okay I'm pretty sure if for $500,000 a
better beat no no Lamborghini is
known for doing weird like yeah
yeah let me see your so guys we got 20
minutes left in the stream there's not
that we haven't just been biessing this
whole time we're this this is the wine
down section we just kind of chill but
whatever we want usually about cars and
we usually roast each other and whatever
so let's hear dual is a dual clutch
let me see like now this might surprise
the chat guys but I subscribe to the to
the car mentality of Drive what you love
and love what you drive I don't really
care what you have and you shouldn't
care what I have I know that's rare
that's really rare but yeah that's the
way I live single clutch bro Wow and did
not thousand 17 Lamborghini Aventador LP
700-4 saves weight by using an ISR
instead of a dual clutch unit well it
certainly shifted like a dual clutch
even the - yes I'm sure that the rev
matching computer and it probably takes
up the slack but in a true dual clutch
like the shift takes it's like under 10
milliseconds like literally you're in
the other gear like it's instant there's
no drop and boost nothing it's like
they're crazy they're absolutely crazy
Sam vo3 says wind down when did we wind
up haha when we talked about
cryptocurrency I was getting a little
wound up I was getting pretty wound up
to you not really not really
you know I there's see you know how most
people have a they have a favorite
manufacturer and a
and a hated manufacturer but I loved him
Chevy's man do I hate them porches right
I don't have like I can't say okay I
hate this brand I don't I don't hate
forward I know I hate dodge dodge is
probably the lowest on my list in terms
of like so and that's just because of
personal ownership experience but yeah I
know dog has massive problems with their
their hemispherical combustion like
stuff it it doesn't work like all their
engines break down
ya know Yanni Fernandez I will not say
your name I cannot be summoned no I'm
trying to think of like what
manufacturer I literally despise Jamie a
while while Wacka Wacka says my wife
broke down sad face I mean you're
watching us and you're not going to
rescue her or do me get you a triple-a I
don't know you say he's like sorry sorry
honey I'm watching these two you asshats
just talk about cars on the show called
Tech Talk it's it's awesome Oh Mike
views Mike who's gonna school you it
button well why are you shaking her head
no you know he's going to yeah what you
don't even come close to Mike's
abilities he's like I spend away he's a
can you drive it's actually gonna drive
it's been a while since Mike's actually
drove Mike Mike vu and Chad is one of
the one of the guys we race with and
he's talking to Nick and Nick is
shaking his head no when I said Mike
who's gonna school him and and Nick's
like no Nick guys Nick's like 25 seconds
slower than Mike move on the same track
just so you know that's they're lucky
that I don't live down there my Subaru
would just smoke that piece of
American car you're driving I see guys
might see we would destroy a button will
you'll be like 40 seconds slower my car
only goes around the track sideways like
I can't I can't actually the STI won't
actually turn around the corner comes
back Mike boosts supey also goes around
the track sideways on the pavement but
that's just because he likes to drive
off track we have video to prove it I
think it's fair to say though that you
everybody probably has a favorite like
you might not hate the other companies
but like who's your favorite
manufacturer like all things aside money
no object who is your favorite
manufacturer as far as like just the if
you'd only ever have one car what would
it be I don't have one I don't have one
remember we and when we and you've asked
me this question a million times my
answer always was the Olin well II zl1
one le I said it a million times as a
car would go by since it was announced
last like February
was but the thing is I don't love Chevy
I just love that car there I can't stand
Chevy I had a horrible experience with
Chevy Chevy is a company that Chevy Volt
was the biggest piece of I've ever
owned in my life but in the big butt is
your car that in the end in the hot
Corvette I love those cars now I will
say this I've started opening up the zl1
now that we're past the engine break-in
period and I did have a
I did have a Focus ST with with dealer
plates on it try and race me on the
freeway the other day
now here's legit I think he was legit
thinking that he had a chance because
you either know what you're looking at
when you see my car or you don't from a
standstill he would have gotten some car
lengths on you out of the gate no no he
wouldn't that is nuts
is an ST not an RS oh sorry sorry I got
a backwards no that's T okay know that
my car still time zero to 60 in 3.5 what
is it what does an rs-232 does it yeah
it actually might even be breaking into
the three Platt hold on here board yeah
this was an ST with dealer plates
no no they asked he's a piece of
that's the front wheel that's not even
all 150 or 250 horsepower deal a it's
like stalking could be so I didn't
realize we were racing until I realized
I was about to rear-end him because of
how fast I like pulled up behind him and
then when I pulled to the side and like
just paced him I was like waiting for
the beeps until I realized he was flat
out so yeah there is rolling start
you're gonna decimate most things I mean
honestly
their attraction I I hope you get down
here soon traction in this car is well
it's uh there's traction is a an elusive
thing in this car you know I'm actually
shocked by this
according to Motor Trend they're saying
the Ford Focus RS 2017 is 0-60 of 4.5
seconds I find that really hard to
believe I believe it because we when we
were doing the comparisons with the 370z
and stuff my card is like a 4.7 stock
and I've raced a couple of our s's that
were stock and it was not like they were
maybe I was maybe at their rear corner
panel on the launch so the STI hold on
here so the Subaru STi sedan is 0 to 60
and 4.8 in the RS is 4 points
that's crazy cuz the STI is down 50
horsepower and weighs more
all-wheel-drive like all it drives your
um drivetrain loss though no no but
that's what I don't understand is though
they're both all-wheel-drive cars which
ones the STI and the Ford Focus yet yeah
rs is different different tuning do
different lower end torque it must it
must be you know those were soubise
don't have the same low in a quirk yeah
well I know my ear my ear does wait stop
doing the close ratio gearboxes because
of the gas mileage crisis back
in but that's way that's why I said the
the new one doesn't have the same
low-end torque dam 4.7 that's that's
pretty weak sauce actually yeah that's
got me shut for 350 horsepower 350
torque and a car that weighs what 3000
pounds now look up the look up the zl1
one olie performance tires so zo one the
zero to one hundred and seven point four
seconds is impressive alright so here we
go when we pull it up c'mere okay right
here from I want to make sure it's a
reputable site though okay Karn Drive I
have not launched my car or tried to yet
because there's a thing if I'm rolling
down the street doing 45 50 Nick was in
the car we did it what would we lose
traction it like 75 yeah I was doing 75
on the freeway push the pedal in next ya
know we're spending tires like crazy on
the freeway so I can't I don't know like
it's really cold right now though so I
mean obviously these tires are not but I
I'm just like the guys that can drive
these cars and launch them and press the
 out of me because I still don't
know how to launch his car well it says
a zero to sixty in its 3.5 seconds all
in first gear so that's got a really
tall first gear it does at the top of
third you're doing 120 and it doesn't
eleven seven in the quarter-mile Jesus
at 124 that is properly quick for us for
a stock street car now compare that to
the Hellcat that's insane alright let's
see here Hellcat alright so here we go
same thing Car and Driver so that we're
doing comparison zero to sixty and 3.6
seconds so it's only it's only a tenth
off zero to sixty but to cool the feel
ones that might want to leave the tent
faster than a Hellcat attend faster
Kraken
let's see you're the weight difference
is like huge
but it also has 57 extra horsepower 400
pounds less let's see here where's the
quarter-mile time on this thing they
have 57 more horsepower remember every
every hundred pounds is a tenth in the
quarter oh is it really is that kind of
the math yeah so see srt hellcat came
okay doesn't have nearly as good of a
stopping distance so that's kinda that's
gonna really screw it on the track but
what's the quarter mile I'm trying to
find it still here let me just do a
search first looking at the charger or
the Challenger the car driver this is
that yeah I think that you oh this is
the Challenger okay you want me to look
at the charger it doesn't matter they're
they're fairly I thought they're
basically the same right well I think
the challenge is a little heavier though
let's see okay so here that's Car and
Driver okay here it is the charger
quarter-mile to work that's funny real
quick mr. zombie says forget all your
failed cars as I Drive a Cummins he
would win the tug-of-war Oh actually Jay
the the new Dodge Challenger SRT does 0
to 60 and three point four it's a tenth
faster which one is that this is the
charger this is the it's a little bit a
little bit lighter yep yeah just a tiny
tiny bit faster but I bet you you still
have the faster zero at one hundred time
let me see if I cried Abadi Hellcat runs
quarter-mile in ten seven no it doesn't
it's the wide-body demon and say oh yeah
the demons a whole different beast guys
the demon is like over 800 horsepower
yeah it basically weighs like the same
as the charger hellcat so it's all
Weapon X actually sells a chiller system
for my car so that just like the demon I
can redirect the air conditioner into
the supercharger see I love that I think
that is a great idea whoever came up but
it's only for drag racing they're like
don't do this on the road course well
what's your what's your zero to 100 in
that car seven point four okay so seven
point two on the on the Hellcat the new
Hellcat and what's it weigh I think the
weight is comparable to the MA
let's see the kerb weight is my cars
like 3800 Oh 40 550 yeah so that chart
that charger is is rightfully fast like
the Challenger run faster than the
charger though I think a lot of people
write off the charger is the faster one
you know why it's faster though it has
it has nothing to do with it's the it's
the transmission because your manual so
you're gonna be losing speed between
shifts this is the 8-speed automatic
well then compare it to the zeal one
hence be taught oh yeah let me see her
see I'd much rather have the manual not
to mention I can only have a manual like
the one le only comes in a manual
tanaris ask are Tanner's ten ers asked
what size tires on the one le the
Front's are three three oh five the
rears are three twenty five and it is
the Goodyear Eagle it's as good your
eagle f1 supercar three are your a 2018
right yeah okay so yeah your zero to
sixty is three point four so it's a it's
a dead dead match two hundred mile an
hour top speed quarter-mile eleven point
three seconds on the zl1 ten speed yeah
this is for this yellow one one Le now
the reason why my top speeds much slower
on the Z on the one le is because of the
arrow Michael I think my big my car tops
out like 194 yeah but but your cornering
speed goes up pretty dramatically so
it's still fast it's gonna be faster
around a track yeah of course I'm just
I'm just saying the zl1 10 speed is it's
just damn fast it's crazy to see it just
killing the Fords though because the the
Ford Mustang Shelby gt350 is 3.8 seconds
zero to 60 and so's the shelby gt350r
but they're also done in the 500
horsepower range they're lighter cars
though aren't they so but we have
significantly less horsepower actually
no that was the manual hold on here let
me look up the auto that that was
actually the what's here mate it was a
10 speed manual i'm the zl1
yeah for the zl1 ten seconds okay hold
on I got it now here we go
oh wow actually slower it's a tenth of a
second slower to zero to sixty because
it never gets at because your car the
manual does zero to sixty in first gear
this one has to shift yeah
so that's so it's yeah you're actually
is your 60 is what I like more than
anything but my car is also incredibly
inconsistent how it's really easy to
jack up the launch but on automatic it's
really consistent now my car has and I
didn't even know this because I'm
breaking in the car I wasn't going
around hooning right my car has won a
factory line lock I have also three
different like launch control modes
quarter
half throttle 3/4 throttle I can also
control the RPMs at which the like when
it stops feathering the gas and all that
stuff but the fact that has a factory
line lock is insane and actually a lot
of the Fords have that now - oh really I
didn't know that yeah that's it's for
drag racing cuz you can basically pull
up into the trap and just smoke your
rear wheels without having to you know
coast your front brakes it's kind of
funny because I'm still in the mindset
like my Z where it's a three hundred and
eighty or so horsepower according to the
dyno correct it 380 horsepower
you know nav six it's a bit on the
heavier side has a slow transmission
like the the manual shifting in the Z is
very nachi its variegated it's not yeah
like the CL one may as butter smooth
shifting it is insane how fast you can
shift that car but I I still drive
around this mentality of like oh oh that
STI might give me a run for my money
when I'm in the Camaro I'm like wait a
minute
no I unless he's put like 50 grand into
that car well I'm pretty not 50 grand
but less he's put at least to you know
$20,000 in mods and stuff in that car
he's probably not going to keep up with
the zl1
especially in a role but I still don't
drive around thinking to myself I have
one of the fastest production cars in
the planet it's weird like I don't think
yeah and to be fair even the STI if you
did because I know some of you has a
500-horsepower STI and I'll tell you
right now it can't do that all day long
and it will break I mean it's there to
get them reliable at 500 horsepower yep
you like a Cosworth block that's been
sleeved and and then you're getting
into like you know 30 in a transmission
stock it's gonna be way too much iti is
lock whatever says Tesla will smoke all
those gas cars Tesla absolutely will
smoke to approximately a hundred miles
per hour maybe a little bit lower or a
little bit slower than that until the
sport until the roadsters out there yes
Derek stirs he's talking about probably
that even the p90d with the ludicrous
and all that stuff the the faster cars
like we're talking about not necessarily
the zl1 but like the demon and all that
stuff reals them in every single time so
the only problem though is yeah the the
Roadster is gonna be the big change
right because the roadster is going to
have I think a thousand horsepower and
it's gonna have was it six hundred no a
two hundred kilowatt battery yeah so
you're gonna be able to go six hundred
miles in the thing actually will corner
it'll do serious is it called roadster
what do they call it
it's the Tesla Roadster 2020 okay so I
thought yeah yeah so because they're
they're shooting for a 2020 release but
uh but no I mean that's that's the thing
is it's gonna be the first Tesla that
actually can be built to run on the
track all the other things we've had we
had it we were at the track last month
there was a p90d with the ludicrous
whatever on track yeah and he puts out
some pretty good times but if you look
at his if you look at the sheet it's
like each lap is is like minus 2 SEC or
it's like plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2
plus 2 from the previous laps because
it's slowing down every single lap
significantly as I understand it like
after 3 laps the thing will literally go
into limp mode and won't let you go more
than like 60 mm but the guy I'm talking
about ended up getting towed off track
okay well that makes sense
yeah so yeah I don't think the Roadster
is gonna have that mean the roadster is
gonna nerf its performance but not down
to a level where it's gonna screw you
but but you're not gonna have consistent
performance which means you'll never be
able to learn to drive it in its edge
cuz it's always gonna be changing how
much do zl1 Camaro is cost I'm a simple
Google search would help you because
it's it's based on region like here in
California Southern California they're
marked up a lot I looked it up it's
about $70,000 for the ones ele zle ii
mean one le sorry one day so the zl1 has
a base price of like 63,000 here the one
le package is 7500 alone but then
there's other things on top of it like I
have the PDR which is a performance data
recorder basically it's every option and
so the car can be had for about 73,000
the thing is a lot of the dealerships
out here have a markup on them like 20
so the car I bought had a twenty
thousand dollar markup they wanted
ninety-three dollars or ninety three
dollars ninety three thousand dollars I
told the off so they took the they
took the the mark-up off but they had to
like call GM to get it approved whoever
I'm like waiting my why didn't I call GM
this is a dealer thing I'd have to know
the deal that GM is involved in that
which is kind of shady but so now I know
I mean we didn't I didn't pay that
markup hell no I was like I actually
told him I said I will drive out of
state to buy it and bring it back into
the state just to avoid the markup I
like driving I've no problems driving
Arizona so yeah they took it off but
yeah the one all these packages like
7,500 bucks the PDR 1300 and then
there's other things like on there
on the paint you you paint color you
want you can even pay an extra six
hundred bucks just for the paint color
you know oh geez yeah it is a good
looking car though I'll totally give it
that you test the roadsters also two
hundred thousand dollars so you have to
keep that in mind that's the point I was
gonna get at that the class of car that
the zl1
competes with is just usually two to
three X the price right now of course we
need to see long-term reliability
reports Chevy
a lot as Tesla even the modern Tesla's
like my neighbors already had his into
the shop once that's when he's had it
they're a billion times for like
breaking struts and stuff like that and
busting his driver's seat and electrical
issues there I'm not I'm not saying that
they're unreliable it's just you can
tell that they're running them
completely at the bleeding edge and
they're learning as they go and you know
that's that's your basically a beta
tester if you buy one of their cars yeah
I would love to do it for riding on
Twenty twenty roadster though - did you
see the did you see the zero to sixty
one point nine seconds zero to 100 and
4.2 it gets the 100 faster your car gets
the 60 in first gear no you said 4.2
minus 3.5 but still oh sorry 3.5 my dad
I'm thinking about that Subaru you mean
a Nissan he's no no my Subaru does it in
4.7 guys - 45 if I know great that was
stock my car now has tuned so I don't
know what the zero to 60 is is it now
but top speed of 250 miles an hour
yeah well 194 is fine for me I'll never
do it dude at my car I had my STI up to
165 and I only know that that was the
speed I was going because the
speedometer wouldn't go any faster like
it literally just buried the needle and
hit the peg yeah and I was scared to
pull off the gas cuz it was it was doing
that thing where if I let up off the gas
like even just a little bit it would
start to do a shimmy and I was like yeah
I don't want it I don't want to flip
over it I just can't imagine doing that
kind of speed with no engine noise
that'd be so weird just win just it's
like you're in a hangar it's like you're
in a glider in this well how else are we
going when I had you in the car I think
we hit a hundred and forty something
didn't we I just I wasn't looking at
your speedometer all the windows down
and I seriously felt like the rear winch
though the rear window was gonna just
pop out yeah it was there was a lot of
drag but your car is this like one one
angle short of being a Volvo in terms of
like Aerodyne
it is not yeah yeah and even the even
the intake on the front of it it just
God there's nothing aerodynamic about
that car at all whereas my mise à L one
the one Ali has just like ridiculous
amounts of aero downforce on top of
mechanical grip yeah the canard things
on the front look badass 2j what number
is your car I don't know they're not
serialized I guess it would be the last
numbers of the VIN but I don't know like
my Z has a my Z has a number it's it's
Nismo it's 2010 newsmen number six by
five but I don't know the zl1 doesn't
have a plaque or anything in it which I
thought was right so Isis me considering
lifecycle like show based on what I read
they're only making 750 of them in 2018
so I don't know I mean I love this video
watching 805 horsepower cadillac
escalade smoke camaro zl1 and the
quarter-mile yeah well it's got 200 more
horsepower 800 horsepower that is just
nuts and it's mighty built it yeah penny
whine a lot in your car I haven't
remembered yet
what do you gotta do to get that
supercharger whine open up what you'll
be in tomorrow okay so here's the thing
the ported throttle body the the roto
fab intake and then with my muffler
delete I haven't shown anybody any audio
clips it I have no mufflers on the car
right now it's it's just straight cat to
cat to pipe so though those 3 mods alone
are good for almost 50 wheel horsepower
so my car is gonna be just shy of 700 by
the time you get down here can you put a
when you're done are you gonna put down
the dyno to see what it's putting down
at the wheels um I can't I may have
access to him but the problem is each
dyno is different right so the arts a
degree but at least if they if they have
a baseline if somebody else came in
there with a stock one and rayna at
least you could compare it to the
baseline you can compare two stock cars
and get two very different numbers to on
the same dyno so mines around by about
10 horsepower basically no we have to do
is SAE correction which is kind of like
the standard but yeah I'd we do have a
access to a dyno I mean I just had mine
my Z dyno tuned a couple weeks few weeks
back it'd be cool to compare it to the Z
I mean even though they're not even
remotely in the same ballpark just to
show the difference between the two cars
that you're driving around yeah so to be
fair I have not driven the Z's since I
bought the zl1 because I'm terrified of
how freakishly slow it's gonna feel no
it's got a to it
let me tell you why I haven't driven it
I'm taking that I'm taking the Z to
chuckwalla on the 18th of this month
okay
driving around the Camaro and the amount
of like feathering the throttle and the
amount of thought I have to have on
where I push that accelerator based on
what I want the back of the car to do is
is is a whole new learning experience
for me because I have never driven a car
with this much horsepower yes you can
usually just floor it and you're just
gonna you're gonna hook up and shove the
car it's all grip yeah this yeah so by
the time I'm ready to go to the track by
with my cage my four-point safety cage
it was just for aidid today so it should
be here in time for me to put in just
before the track day but the the amount
of power loss I'm gonna feel hopping in
the Z is gonna probably make me feel so
much more confident in the car than last
time I drove it on track yeah I'm
expecting to see my times come down even
farther because everything's gonna feel
like slow motion I could totally see
that
I could totally because the same thing
happened to me we went up to dirt fish
because also used to do in the STI yeah
have that rat yeah all that time to
react with those rear wheel drive
Ferraris yeah it felt yeah it felt
completely different and relaxed and not
like tense at all and there's probably
people that if that was the first car
that they got into and rode in the dirt
they would probably be like
their pants say how fast they were going
but you see it but you see us as 1000
health power and 978 rear wheel mana you
speaking your language
you're gonna track both cars though
right yeah but I'm not gonna track the Z
probably until later this year like in
the fall maybe after summer cuz it's
still not recommended to do track events
until after 1,500 miles gotcha
and it's taken me a long time to do that
the engines barely broken in and I've
just finally started redlining redlining
that thing and here's something else I'm
having to deal with the Z winds up to
almost 8000 rpm yep these l1 red lines
it's 6,500 so still pretty damn good for
a big v8 I mean yeah with us with a with
the route style supercharger yeah I have
been hitting the rev limiter before
shifting because I'm not in tune with
the car yet based on on audio and I
don't look at the tech when I'm driving
fast in a straight line so I keep
bouncing off the rev limiter before
shift so I've got to tune myself to the
Z so what so here's what happens singers
Rabin's it's like
yep get the car rolling modulate the
throttle because you can't just push it
the throttle die you just push the
throttle down the entire car if I turn
off traction control the tires never
hook up through any gear if I just shift
shift shift they just keep spinning so I
I'm accelerate accelerate sorry I'm
pushing down the throttle slowly easing
into it I finally had the throttle
pegged it's time to shift oh I
bounced off the rev limiter I lift up
off the throttle I bang in a second I
push to throttle down again cuz I'm
already like oh I hit up hit the
rev limiter so the Rev revs come down
revs come up again second gear turns
into other motor smokey mess and the
same thing happens in third so it's like
I'm having to learn how to drive a car
with this much horsepower because I'm
used to just mashing the throttle and
going forward that doesn't happen yeah
it's scary on the track like fuel cut
hit and fuel because I did it in the STI
even cuz my STI only revs to 6500 and
and you know when you when you downshift
and you peg it and you hit that limiter
oh my god the car just wants to do a
nosedive almost like a grenade it breaks
at high speed and I'd imagine your car
probably does the same thing yeah now
Nick was in the car with me when we
actually got the car to hop which was a
really weird feeling my god I've never
Nick Nick Nick is sitting right there he
will he will tell you I am telling the
truth he was in the car the tires were
spinning but they heated up as they spun
and right when I let off the throttle it
slowed down enough to where they finally
got grip and when they gripped the whole
car kind of hopped forward and actually
came up the whole car the whole back of
the car came off the ground for a second
based on grip yeah because it just was
weird like the tarmac was just the right
kind of material the tires had heated up
to just enough and they were coming down
off like me letting up off the throttle
just enough to when they hooked the
whole car like literally hopped and he
could feel the whole car resettle back
on the ground it was the weirdest
feeling dude
so if we can track insurance I've never
had a car like a bunny hop yeah I just
think this is quite the jump going from
a-z that's what like 400 horsepower way
lower torque figure to something that's
symmetrical torque and horsepower yeah
it's yeah it's fun I'm try not to kill
myself in it but well say take it easy
and don't drive like you do on the
simulator where you do Nurburgring like
7,000 times cuz you know easy into
the woods
I don't really that much on there
burg anymore I did when I was down there
holy man yeah but like what car
were you driving it was a one of the g3
car
remember but no I've done it enough
notes where I've actually got the track
fairly memorized which is crazy that's a
hard track to memorize that is I still
haven't memorized and I've done it
probably a hundred times on the Xbox so
and I still can't figure it out yeah oh
my god anyway it's time to go we need to
get you down here so you can enjoy the
car especially now that the engine
break-in is pretty much past that period
it's I mean you've driven in plenty of
fast cars but yeah I mean it's a
Camaro you wouldn't expect it well the
only car I've driven that's close to
what that is would would be the Viper
which is only 450 but it had that same
symmetrical torque where it just it just
constantly pulls and if you push it to
the floor it just walks this and now car
is incredibly unbalanced very very
unbalanced and you sit like basically on
the rear wheels so it feels like you're
driving a boat like it's just the turnin
on it's way too crazy and the Recaros in
the in the zl1 are all so ridiculously
comfortable even for big guys so no I
can't wait I'm glad that that's actually
like I said legitimately that's one of
the cars that's definitely on like the
bucket list like that is that is the
embodiment of a Hot Wheel yeah it is
that that's the adult version of a Hot
Wheel like bumblebee bumblebee was
the slow car that's like that's
bumblebees Big Brother you know so know
I'm excited I'll get down there probably
I did you get my message I said like I
think April is when I'll be able to come
down I think so we just have to work it
out because uh you know the little ones
birthday is in April and normally we
take a weekend and whatever so don't
worry I will figure it out guys we get
out of here I'm gonna roll that outro
thanks for hanging out with us during
Tech Talk number 155 where we talk a
little bit about tech a lot about cars
and just a whole bunch of nonsense and
 and I see Jerry touching his
mixer so this should be interesting okay
outro is rolling
thank you for watching tic toc 155
Nvidia problems not making you have as
far as paper currencies every
other oh he loves you and that that's
cool I'm think that's gonna get my car
is faster than yours he's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
