and today we're going to talk about
beatboxing no not beatboxing beatboxing
which is actually as rocks brand-new
nuke style PC this is extremely small
and in fact they measure it in litres
and it comes in at just over a half
liter in size it's kind of interesting
but that that's the way they do it
whether you're looking for a pump
reservoir custom GPU block or a complete
loop and a box alpha cools wide range of
products can make your next water
cooling adventure an easy one
click the link in the description for
more details alright the beatbox is a
tiny tiny PC that is just really just
throwing it out there high level it is a
super tiny full functioning PC in fact
it's already hooked up behind me here
now we're going to talk about some of
its features we're gonna talk about some
of the options because there's actually
three different variants of this and
we'll kind of do like a little demo of
exactly how well the thing performs
alright so I'm going to refer to my
notes here or I would never get this
right now there's three different
systems that are available from the B
box lineup here you've got the
bare-bones and then you've got full
systems one with an OS and one without
an OS now the one we're looking at here
is actually equipped with the Intel n
3000 which is basically a seller on a
currently shows it's a 1.0 4 gigahertz
machine now that actually sounds
extremely slow but it's actually very
capable for what it is now it is 64-bit
Microsoft Windows 8 on here I'm not sure
if it's actually 8.1 but it says
AIDS anyway and it is a running 4
gigabytes of installed memory it says
3.6 7 gigabytes usable that's because
256 megabytes pretty much are going to
be allocated to the internal graphics
memory chip or graphics chip that's on
the CPU so that's why you'll see usable
is a little bit less but anyway it is a
nook style PC so that means it's
extremely small this is not a gaming PC
this is not really a workstation PC this
thing is designed for like multimedia
playback or being maybe some sort of a
satellite PC that you can remote desktop
to another PC there's just a lot of
different functions for this thing now
it is
chillie available all the way up to an
Intel quad-core n 3150 processor which
is up to 2.0 8 gigahertz so it's like
twice the power of this one here the one
they sent me here is kind of a decent
mid-range where you're not going to have
you know top-of-the-line specs but we're
going to go ahead and kind of take a
look at a demo here of how well it
performs sitting kind of right in the
middle now for storage on this
particular one here we've got 128
gigabyte M SATA Drive now they're all
compatible with M SATA as well as
supporting one two and a half inch SATA
Drive like an SSD or even a mechanical
if you want it and it does include the
adapter for that as well if you want to
add another storage device to this so
this being only 128 gigabytes I'm not
going to be really putting any games on
it I'm not even going to be able to
store any real big multimedia files or
anything like that but it would be
perfect to put it say in a home theater
PC accessing movies I'm an AZ or
something like that now for connectivity
it has three monitor outputs on there
it's got two HDMI as well as a
DisplayPort on there now we're currently
hooked up to a display port and a 4k
monoprice panel right here and we'll be
doing some 4k playback as well as doing
some steam in-home streaming from
skunkworks
over to this machine right here now this
is also the world's first nook that has
the USB type-c standard now we have seen
USB 3.1 come out already but you guys
know that that pretty much uses the same
non-reversible full-size USB plug that
we're going to start seeing people move
away from here and later 2015 going to
2016 where type C is going to become the
new standard pretty much for PCs and
phones so this thing does have a type C
right on the front as well as a super
speed USB 3.0 on the back two more of
those on the rear and just a ton of
connectivity it also features a pretty
powerful wireless device in here and
it's got 802.11 a/c as well as Bluetooth
4.0 so you'll be able to hook up your
phone to it you can stream music to it
you can take Bluetooth devices like
keyboards and mice and controllers and
just have a lot of connectivity with
this and with it being bluetooth but
also fitting in kind of that multimedia
sphere bluetooth connection is readily
available on our smart phones and our
tablets so it may
connecting the thing extremely easy now
last but not least before we do the demo
here it also has a multimedia remote
control trust me when I say this would
have come in handy when the wife and I
were catching up on Game of Thrones and
if we had to stop it or posit or so III
taken a small form-factor PC and put it
in the living room I don't have a
full-time home theater PC this would
have come in handy because I was just
using a small PC that didn't have a
remote control and any time we had to
start the next episode or posit or
rewind it we'd have to get our big butts
up out of our couches or my big butt and
the wife the wife of course there's not
a big but I would never say that but if
you get up off the couch and go over and
wiggle the mouse and have to rewind it
but this thing has a full multimedia
remote control alright let's go ahead an
around let's do a little bit of a demo
here showing you how well the thing
performs and we'll just kind of have
some final thoughts on the thing now
figure the first thing we'll do here is
we'll do kind of a restart test
sometimes these small machines take a
long time to start and turn off and all
that and as you can see it turned off
pretty quickly here especially since
it's only a Celeron it's only running
1.04 gigahertz it's not fast at all but
you can see that with the light weight
of Windows 8 at least that's what they
claimed it's perfect for devices like
this monitor itself is kind of slow to
turn on though so area C now we're
already back into the desktop so that's
actually pretty quick in fact that's
that's very near the speed of skunkworks
but then again skunkworks doesn't have
the fastest boot in the world either
so here's we're going to do now we're
just kind of do a 4k video playback demo
here they've got a little demo thing on
here it's not my video it is going to
look kind of like their ad but it's
already loaded on here so I'm just gonna
go ahead and play it just turn that down
so you can see playback on this thing is
extremely smooth I'm not sure how well
it's being translated into the video but
this is a 4k playback right here now one
other thing I forgot to mention was that
they do come in three colors black white
and gold they sent me the gold unit
which I would have preferred the
back or the white but I mean I guess
it's it's very similar to like apple
colors which is funny looks like Apple
displays on there so yeah 4k playback on
this scene is extremely smooth alright
that's enough of that let's go ahead and
do the steam demo like I wanted to do
here so here's my week library of things
that are installed right now on
skunkworks because it automatically
detected that there was another system
on the network that has steam open which
it is right now on skunkworks
so let's go ahead and do some grand
theft auto 5 right here on the Nook
streaming from skunk works I don't worry
it will scale properly once it starts
all right so the settings right now is
we can see settings are set to right now
I set it down to 1080p I didn't want to
do 1440 which is skunkworks where it's
ads to make it harder on the decoder
here but I could do 1440 if I wanted
it's going to stream whatever is
streaming from the source but it's also
going to down sample it to whatever the
actual resolution I'm playing on this
machine is right now which is 1080p but
MSAA is on and everything so here's
we're gonna do we're just going to run
around and cause a little mayhem here
now the FPS is going to be pretty much
limited to 30 FPS because that's what
the steam in-home streaming is capable
of I'm just walking around with sandals
khaki shorts some loafers and a 9
millimeter just like Los Angeles
local coffee shop is closed it's too bad
oh man now the cops are after me yes
this is a terrible terrible game this
game should be removed from the market
immediately but not to owe a whole crowd
of people
Wow okay well other thing we're going on
vacation I don't feel any perceived lag
whatsoever in fact one thing to point
out right now
is that the sound you're hearing is
actually coming from skunkworks not this
machine because I figured if there was
any perceivable lag it would have been
noticeable by trying to fire the gun
here and then the sound would be off or
the sound of the sound would be before
you would see it here which isn't the
case I'm going to say I've never
actually done a video review on
something while running people over it's
interesting so here's an example here
I'm going to shoot and listen to the
sound and the sink of the video
there's no lag whatsoever in fact when I
look over at skunkworks over here there
is no lag also when it comes to the
input so that's pretty cool
for all of you give me a hard time too
about my lack of weapons and stuff
I lost my game save so as you can see
this thing is perfectly capable of being
an in-home streaming gaming device as
well now as Rox done a really good job
at thinking ahead about different uses
for this system and where you could
actually mount it for instance it's got
a little set of hardware that comes with
this where you can put some screws in
the back here and you've got a VESA
mount on here which is actually
compatible with both types of visa and
you mount this to the back of your
monitor or your TV if you're not using
that that base amount and then this just
slides in the back slides down once you
mount that to the monitor and then this
can be sitting on the back of the PC not
even an exposed or even visible and you
can have what seems like a complete PC
built into just a monitor but it's on
it's just on the back well J if it's on
the back how you going to turn it on and
off well fortunately the remote control
also has a wireless power on function so
they've really done a lot at thinking
ahead about the versatility of this in
fact this is definitely going in my home
theater because this is I think this is
going to be a fantastic and expansion of
my home theater in fact it might even
end up in the bedroom because of the
fact that one of the things that we lack
at least in the master bedroom in my
house is being able to watch any sort of
online content back there so one thing I
do wish though and I mentioned that
there they had done a great job at
laying this thing out is I wish that
they had put an actual headphone jack or
sound output on the rear if you guys saw
when this thing was hooked up I had a
cord coming out of the front going to
the back because if you are using this
as a standard PC and you're not going to
be using the audio over HDMI because
audio doesn't carry over DVI on a DVI of
DisplayPort which I was just using for
this 4k monitor you're not going to be
able to carry the audio out of the rear
you're going to have to bring a cable to
the front which is where the headphone
jack is and that was just unsightly so
it would have been nice to even if they
had just relocated that entire thing all
the way to the back I think that would
have been better even if someone was
using headphones with this I think it's
a lot less likely that someone would be
using headphones with this then say a
three and a half millimeter jack hooked
up to an amplifier or speakers like I
was
or something of that nature so I think
that this is a fantastic little PC no
it's not skunk works powerful no it's
not a gaming machine it does exactly
what it's supposed to do 100% silent
powerful nuke
type PC that's going to give you in home
streaming capability online streaming
capability 4k playback and you can do
gaming like you just saw through like an
in-home streaming service which I had no
problems playing the game right there
even though it was at 30fps yes I know
the FPS police are going to go insane it
is what it is guys and it did exactly
what it was intended to do it does
exactly what it's advertised to do so
there you go guys the asrock beatbox
nook pc it's not much bigger than well
the size of a visa mount that's about an
inch and a half thick
fantastic little device guys go and
check it out if you guys have any
questions you can find links to it down
in the description handle number two
social media if you guys just want to
bug me because I'll bug it back and it's
time to get on out of here so thanks for
watching and as always we'll see you in
the next one
tamanna Singh wasn't made of solid gold
because then sorry as rock I would sell
this thing in a heartbeat
like gone immediately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
