name what's up guys Jase you sends here
and I recently set out on a challenge to
challenge myself with 500 of my
hard-earned dollars to build a gaming
tower that can play games here in 2018
500 ollars worth of build is actually
not that hard these days I mean
especially with the 2,200 G got 8
gigabytes of ddr4 in here but you know
what actually made it a little bit
challenging was I set out to also
include this a monitor and peripherals
and we did it $493 I think yeah whatever
links in the description below with all
these parts you guys can add it up for
yourself or VPN has sponsored today's
video and right now they are offering my
viewers 77% off a three year membership
and they are adding more servers across
the world every single week in fact
right now they are up to 4,000 48
servers in 62 countries including the
Middle East Asia Europe and the Americas
now VPN stands for virtual private
network and that is important to all of
us because it keeps people from being
able to spy on our information and Nord
VPN doesn't keep any logs so there's no
log whatsoever of what you are doing on
the Internet
when connected to Nord VPN so start
taking your internet privacy serious
with Nord VPN and save 77% off a
three-year membership by using offer
code Jase to sunset check up see the
link in the description for more details
alright so let's talk about the parts
here real quick as mentioned this is an
AMD based Rison 2200 g this it's really
hard to deny the value of the new Rison
AP use they are pretty much around the
same about a GT 1030 graphics card or
like an rx 560 they are not
groundbreaking but because we are
pairing it with the Skepta 20 inch LED
1600 by 900 panel this is not a 1080p
and it's also not larger than 20 inches
but this is from the perspective of
someone that's got very little money and
nothing to reuse I have always done
these build guides with the assumption
of like you could use a TV or something
to hook it up to but that's not always
the case so we remember the 19 point
it's like it's like a nineteen point
five or something like that they say 20
on there
but it's a 75 Hertz panel so it's a 1600
by 900 which is in between a 720p and a
1080p so actually I'll be offloading
some of the pixel density which is gonna
make our 2200 perform a little bit
better you pair it up with a 1080p panel
then the 2200 starts to feel the feel to
hurt just a little bit now in terms of
peripherals this is great this is
actually RGB it's got a crazy-looking
mouth so it's a keyboard and mouse it's
not a mechanical keyboard but its
suspension cap structure lifelike
mechanical keyboard feeling okay
colorful mid plate and gorgeous
breathing lamp render atmosphere with
colorful backlight I can't wait to
render some atmospheres with that one
but the rest of the parts like I said
2200 G 8 gigabytes of Patriot ddr4 20
400 megahertz memory now the reason why
I didn't go with faster memory obviously
our budget didn't allow but I did a
video and I'll do a pop-out right here
for you guys to go and check out where I
did actually test memory speed with the
overclocking of a 2400 G and we found
that it didn't have as big of an impact
on Rison - especially the AP use then it
did on the first gen rise in general
performance when he come to overclocking
the memory
now obviously the memory that we're
using persistent memory is what is
shared with the APU so we definitely
wanted more memory and a decent speed
I'm sure this can overclock to at least
2600 may be 2800 we'll be trying that
out take it by a 320 MHD - this is a
motherboard I used in my past budget
guide it's really hard to deny it's
solid build quality inexpensive but also
has all the features that we need it's
just if you're following this build
guide keep in mind you might have to
update the BIOS on this before I rise in
to chip or 2200 d24 energy or whatever
so that's something to keep in mind and
he does actually send out an update kit
which includes like a single core or
whatever blah blah blah PSU that would
allow you to update that but that Avice
obviously adds time now why did I go
with a 500 watt PSU well because it's
really easy to take something like a
1050 Ti later on and pair it with this
system now we're not gonna be doing that
today because this was obviously this
would obviously put our budget at more
like six hundred and fifty dollars but I
wanted to make sure we had enough PSU to
add
great GPU later on and 500 watt means
that we can go all the way up to
something like a 1070 TI or a 1080 even
not necessarily a 1080 TI comfortably
but I wouldn't really pair at any 2 TI
with a 2200 G anyway that'd be a bit of
an imbalance but this PSU was actually
pretty inexpensive it's 80 plus and EVGA
has been making great power supplies
over the last couple of years it's a
brand I trust and so it's one of the
reasons why it is in our build also
there's no SSD in this build you guys
know I love to use SSDs but I couldn't
give us a decent amount of storage and
maintain below the $500 price point if
we weren't buying a monitor and keyboard
and stuff then we would have been able
to but instead I'm using a barricade a
barricade Seagate Barracuda at Barracuda
to one terabyte Seagate
it's a hard drive and it's one terabyte
so it'll hold our games on our OS and
stuff and again the only thing that's
gonna really suffer with that is the
overall load speeds if you've gotten
used to an SSD then this would obviously
hurt if you don't have a PC then what
hurts is the fact that you can't load
anything anyway so who cares if it takes
a little bit longer but for the case I
did not spend a lot of money this is the
Rosewill Challenger s no admittedly I
could have found a cheaper case but what
I liked about this is I believe the
internals are black I could be wrong it
might just be bare steel but it has
intake fans and exhaust the problem is
when you shop for a very cheap chassis
or case the way they actually reduce the
cost is they don't include fans in many
instances or a single exhaust fan this
one according to the pictures anyway
looked like it had intake fans
it might not I don't know I might have
just eaten my words we'll find out when
we open it up otherwise this should
still provide adequate cooling it has
side vents intake vents obviously and
exhaust vents so if I have to add a
couple of $2 fans to this I will let's
build it montaging
so here it is a pretty basic tower no
frills in fact I was happy that it is a
black interior and it does have two blue
LED intake fans like I was hoping
unfortunately they source the cheapest
cables they possibly could blue USB 3.0
even and beige
HD HD audio cables can't get any more
basic than that the case was 49 bucks
and there's only some people out there
they're like this was the wrong case for
that you should have gotten this case
and that's the best part about these
guides is you can take that money and
allocate it towards whatever you want so
if you think it should have been a
different case and you're following this
sort of a build guide then do that buy a
different case but I felt if this was a
good case for the price because the fact
we get three fans including LED fans
once I started shopping cheaper cases
trust me I looked the intake fans were
non-existent which means we would have
had to have bought extra fans to keep
the temperatures inside down which can
affect the APU performance so I felt
like this was a good trade-off and they
even gave us a bio speaker that is
freaking awesome because most people
don't have bio speakers anymore and the
case manufacturer provided that so
Rosewill included that which is nice
because now we can troubleshoot with
BIOS beeps I don't know how many people
don't realize that's a thing because it
hasn't been a thing in a long time but
we have to do now is see whether or not
the BIOS on this motherboard is going to
support the 2200 G out of the box or if
we have to update it so which means we
obviously have to hook up our monitor
and stuff so that we can get into the OS
so let's go ahead and do that alright so
we are up and running after a bajillion
updates hit or renew we're just gonna
play a couple of games I've got
installed we're gonna start with Friday
the 13th really fun game is actually
live stream this quite a bit
unfortunately it's a game under legal
battle now so who knows what the future
is on that but let's go to the settings
and video settings we're gonna make this
realistic right so we're sixteen hundred
by nine hundred full screen windowed no
we want full screen
there we go no vertical sync overall
quality let's put this to medium I think
it's sixteen hundred by nine here we
should be able to do medium that should
mean whoa that's not supposed to happen
so obviously we're having some sort of
issue here with our video it's not
overclocked or anything I may have a
slight overclock on the memory but that
was passing this on my other test fine
so I'm gonna go ahead and reset defaults
if it still does this I'm gonna try
reinstalling the driver if it still does
it in 3d mode then chances are we have a
bad CPU okay so here's the CPU I already
had we're starting to think now the
problem is persisting no matter what we
do so we're starting to think that might
very well be a bad CPU so the only way
to rule that out now is to take out the
one that I bought from Amazon and put in
the one that I already had which I know
works just fine and see if the problem
persists all right let me shut down this
Windows Defender cuz the only thing it
defends is your performance it takes it
away it's actually a noticeable
improvement when you disable that on a
low-end CPU so maybe we'll make a video
about that but we're gonna finish this
video got things to do
let's see if that fixed anything so
we're gonna go back to will try
counter-strike because that one was a
guaranteed not gonna work every single
time it loaded up it did that so let's I
swapped the CPU as you guys saw and
we're gonna see this is gonna work now
oh so something else is clearly
happening here
monitor maybe well it's doing it again
on the screen this is what happens when
we go fullscreen we tested the adapter
and the cable like I said it's not that
but check this out this is the weird
part you ready for this watch this so if
I just the volume which brings up this
little overlay for volume it's fine it's
when it goes back to the focused window
that this happens now this only happens
in full-screen not in windowed mode
alright so we stole the small HD monitor
off of the camera that Phil is using and
as you can see we're getting these same
exact result we switched the CPU same
result
this obviously replaced the monitor we
also tried different
cables different HDMI cable as well as a
DVI cable and it's a DVI to HDMI and
we're getting the same result any
different output on the motherboard so
the common thread in all of this is the
motherboard so unfortunately that's
where this video has to end because my
journey to build the ultimate gaming rig
for under 500 bucks including a monitor
keyboard and mouse is completely just
blocked now by a bad motherboard so I
guess I get to go through the RMA
process and get a new one so we will do
a part 2 of this video guys trust we
have been at this all damn day all day
every minute of this day has been
dedicated to this video and
unfortunately I'm really upset that I
can't give you guys a conclusion now I
mean I can tell you this you wanna know
how the video or how it was gonna
perform go and check out my review of
the 2200 G in fact I'll put it up right
here for you guys to go and check it out
that's exactly how it was gonna perform
no surprise there but the challenge here
was seeing if we could build the entire
set up - cos because you don't actually
need a new CD key to reinstall it I'm
gonna tell you guys how but you can
actually reinstall windows if it's been
activated before but yeah so this sucks
this really sucks so I tried I tried
guys and out some money so hopefully I
can get this all fixed thanks for
watching guys hit that like button if
you appreciate the efforts click the
bill I don't think it matters anyway
just come back if you guys like the
content I know it's to say I'm really
kind of flustered now because I'm mad
I'm really mad as mad as Paul's hardware
if it doesn't show on my face I'm gonna
help us to express it clearly I am
smitten with rage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
