and I get a lot of complaints from
viewers saying that I spend way too much
time dealing with high-end hardware and
to that I want to say you guys are
absolutely right the new EBG a silent
series power supplies offer excellent
silence and efficiency through their new
EVGA Eco mode technology and also
features a seven-year warranty for
worryfree gaming click the link in the
description to learn more we've looked
at a lot of high end mechanical
keyboards and high end mice and stuff
but you know something we have never
looked at on this channel is an
inexpensive gamer option that doesn't
include a mechanical keyboard or some
high-end you know super spiffy gaming
mouse but we're going to talk today
about the octane from cooler master this
is a gaming kit and you guys have seen
the add-on that I didn't actually intend
on doing a review of this but after
using it for a little while and having
been used to typing on mechanical
keyboards for years now I thought this
was something that definitely needed
some attention for people who are gaming
on a budget and want to get a better
gaming experience but without blowing
you know what little bit of money that
you have and still have some of the cool
features that you'd like in a gaming
keyboard and not be stuck with just some
cheapo 10 or 15 dollar Walmart Dell or
HP membrane keyboard that really doesn't
give you any sort of bling whatsoever
this is a gaming combo now the octane
gaming combo comes in at about 55 bucks
at Newegg it seems to be anywhere
between 50 and 60 dollars depending on
where you buy it now it is a full QWERTY
keyboard it's all very appealing matte
black but the cool thing is is it does
have backlighting which is something
that tends to cost a bit more on many
keyboards especially ones that don't
come with a mouse but it has a lot of
functions on here on top of that I mean
you've got your volume up and volume
down controls here you have your media
controls and then of course you have a
keyboard lock which is what a lot of
gamers like when it comes to gaming
keyboards is being able to lock the
windows key so you don't accidentally
knock yourself out of the game
especially if you're playing like an FPS
and you go to hit ctrl to crouch and you
bump that stupid Windows key in next you
know you're kicked
your game so you can lock that but it
has different lighting modes as well
which is something that a lot of people
like to see especially if you have a
nice build a set it going maybe AMD red
like we have red stuff going on behind
us here
you could simply change the color to red
this button right here every time you
hit it it just cycles through the seven
different LED backlight colors we've got
blue red green purple a kind of a neon
is it's yellow it's more of a neon green
kind of an aqua color a very light blue
color and then off so unfortunately
there's no white it would have been nice
to see a white but those are the colors
that we have on here it does have a semi
built-in wrist rest so it does give you
kind of a place to put your palm it's
not very big but it's probably plenty
proper size for many people you can put
your palm on there for me personally
half my palm hangs off it's not as
comfortable as I would like but one
thing that this is this is purely
subjective one thing that I'm not a fan
of on this keyboard though is the
fattened spacebar so when I tend to push
on the spacebar kind of on the lower
side it doesn't feel as crisp or as
responsive it almost feels a bit mushy
because the actual membrane is farther
up on the key so when you push it down
here on the bottom or on this corner it
feels a little bit mushy when you're
doing your typing and sometimes I wonder
did I actually hit spacebar or what but
other than that you do have you know
varying brightness control here I should
actually hit the right button nice so
you'd have varying lightness control
you've got off one to three different
levels of brightness and then if you
simply hold function and push the LED
there then it will just kind of cycle
through the different colors
sort of in a breathing motion but that's
pretty much it for when it comes to
control now the bottom of the keyboard
does feature these very large rubber
feet in all four corners so when you set
it on your desk and you get really
involved in your game you're not going
to be sliding it all over the place so
as you can see I'm hitting it and we
can't get it to really slide
unfortunately the pop-out feet on the
bottom here do not have any rubber on
them so once you lift it up for an
upright typing position which is
something
I prefer you lose about half your
friction and it does become a lot easier
to slide it's not going to move around
too much but you do lose quite a bit of
the friction so that's something to keep
in mind it would have been nice if they
had rubberized feet on that so wouldn't
slide but hey you know at this price
point it's not uncommon for little
things like that to be you know part of
the total package
it is a rubberized cable it's not
sleeved it is not removable and there is
no built-in USB hub on the keyboard now
when it comes to the mouse to the mouse
mousse when starts saying a little bit
weird eh so when it comes to the mouse
you have the same seven backlight colors
so you can match your keyboard in your
mouse and then you do have one dpi
adjustment button up here for four
different dpi levels the manual says
five hundred to thirty five hundred are
adjustable but it doesn't tell me the
ratios it does have these kind of a led
what looks like headlights on the front
of the mouse it looks very attractive
one thing to point out though is when
you cycle through the different colors
the scroll wheel stays white so that's
not going to change but the matte the
scroll wheel does have a very pronounced
click so it's very easy to tell when
you're scrolling now on the bottom of
the mouse it does have three I believe
they're like a polyurethane set a feet
on here so it does slide pretty smooth
even on the desk surface thus the
roughness that you hear that's my desk
the the parvum scratched it all up so it
does actually move really well and very
smooth even without a mousepad and once
you put a mousepad under it of course
the thing glides incredibly smooth FPS
shooters are pretty nice on this it's a
very light Mouse so movement on this if
you're used to a heavier Mouse or
weighted Mouse which I am it's going to
feel very light at first once you get
used to it you can do some very
incredibly quick mouse movements with
this so I guess the last thing to do
before we end this video is to do a
little bit of a typing test you guys can
hear the way the keyboard sounds it's a
membrane so it's going to sound like a
membrane keyboard but then we'll just
kind of give some feedback on the way it
feels when you type and then we'll draw
some conclusions now physically draw
them that would be like a kind of a draw
my life and I already did that so
transition
okay so I just got notepad open here I
know you guys can't see it doesn't
really matter we're just going to do a
little bit of a noise test on here when
it comes to typing but I don't think you
guys should expect anything spectacular
with the noise they're not mechanical
keys so it's not going to click it's
just going to sound like a regular old
keyboard in fact I'm just going to type
this sounds like a regular old keyboard
there it is
so because it does have a little bit of
flimsiness to it none awful lot when you
hit keys like spacebar there's a little
bit of a noise that goes along with it
so I just typed right now when you hit
the spacebar there was a little bit of
noise that goes along with it and it's
not too bad but really for the price of
the keyboard and the mouse combo it's no
worse than any other membrane keyboard
I've ever dealt with it doesn't have a
metal plate in there which a lot of
mechanical keyboards have so yeah the
noise sounds like any other keyboard
like I said the spacebar it's a little
bit springy because it's got some play
in there a little bit mushy but if you
guys don't know the way space bars work
on a membrane is it actually has a metal
bar that goes across it so that it's got
you know actuate the membrane no matter
where you push on it so it's actually
that metal bar to there that you hear
making that sound and there's also a
spring on either side so it's very
springy but other than that it's a
actually not too bad to type on I've had
it here on the test bench for a while
and so far I'm I'm pretty pleased with
it especially since I haven't typed on a
membrane keyboard in quite a while as I
mentioned I wasn't going to do a review
on this but I thought it was definitely
worth doing review since I know a lot of
younger gamers or people who don't have
a lot of money to spend on their
peripherals would be interested in this
option especially for you know about 50
bucks you get a keyboard and a mouse
that has you know full media controls as
well as backlighting and adjustable
switch or sensitivity in the mouse it's
the kind of thing we all definitely
would like
as gamers so like I said after using it
for a week I really do think it's a
decent product to go and consider
especially on if you're on a limited
budget so tell me what you guys think I
know a lot of people prefer a membrane
switch over a mechanical switch I've
already mentioned
I prefer mechanical but I have no
problems typing on this thing whatsoever
so what do you guys prefer and why you
guys prefer a mechanical switch which is
your favorite switch and if you prefer a
membrane which is your favorite membrane
keyboard sound off down in the comments
and represent your favorite keyboard
switch type and let's all know how you
guys feel I wouldn't be able to do these
types of videos without your support so
I am eternally grateful for that thanks
for watching guys and I will see you in
the next one thanks for watching today's
video about the octane gaming combo stay
tuned later on this week I am going to
be bringing you a video on the Sapphire
ITX compact r9 285 I've already been
doing benchmarks on this thing preparing
for that video and this thing definitely
packs a wallop they were actually said
that word before I hope that means
something good this thing actually packs
a wallop in a very small packet I mean
look at the size of the box it's
actually on the test bench back there
you can see how small it is I've had
software that comes in packages bigger
than this so if you guys are looking for
a small form-factor graphics card and
one that's powerful then you definitely
don't want to miss this review you'll
see that later this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
