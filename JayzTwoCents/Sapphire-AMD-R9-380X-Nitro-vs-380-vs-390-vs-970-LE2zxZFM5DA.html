know that's who's watching this video
you guys you guys are as big of a GPU or
as I am it's ok to admit it you guys
have been asking me on Twitter and
Facebook and anywhere else you could get
my attention to please review a 380 X
well that's exactly what we're doing
today and I'm sure you already knew that
because I hope you read the title the
flavor of today's 380 X is going to be
specifically the Sapphire 380 X nitro
which is a factory overclocked and just
a behemoth of a card this thing's
actually pretty big and weighty given
what it is but anyway we're gonna check
this guy out today we're gonna see how
it stacks up and AM the lineup and we're
gonna talk about this card where it
belongs to whether or not you should
even bother looking at a 380 X I mean
hopefully by the end of this video you
can answer that for yourself from
November 26 through December 7 to get
amazing discounts on case labs most
popular cases like VST H 10 th 10 a s 8
SM 8 s 5 X 2m or my personal favorite
the SM 8 now even though these cases are
built ahead of time via their quick ship
sale case Labs knows that no cases one
size fits all so builders can still fine
tune their setups by selecting key
options such as radiator mounts flex pay
options Drive mounts and much much more
oh yeah and all case accessories are 50%
off during this sale so if you've always
wanted your own case lapse case act now
and take advantage of huge savings by
clicking the link down in the
description so here it is right here the
sapphire r9 380 X now the 300 series
launched back in June which also
launched alongside the new fury line of
you know VG cards like the fury X and
the r9 380 X is kind of a weird card if
you asked me specifically because of how
big the AMD lineup already is in fact
that lineup consists of the 360 370 380
380 X 393 90 X the r9 nano the r9 fury
and then the r9 fury X that's a lot of
graphics cards in one line up so it
really it's kind of interesting about
that they chose that mark up or that
position in the lineup to actually put a
stop-gap card which is really what the
380 X is now obviously being a 380 X I
expect performance to be somewhere
between the 380 and the
90 I think that should be pretty obvious
is why it's a 380 X so the 380 X
obviously is going to have higher specs
in the 380 and lesser specs than a 390
but the sapphire natural nitro Edition
the macro and this thing here is your
natural card guys from go ahead and push
it to the limit yep
you know the nitro cards are featuring
obviously higher than base spec so for
instance this thing is from the factory
is up to nine hundred and 70 megahertz
on the core clock however the Nitro is
doing 1,050 measures so it is a factory
overclocked card it is a 28 nanometer
GPU die in here and it has 2048 stream
processors which is 256 more than the
380 it's got 4 gigabytes of gddr5 which
is going to be more than enough for
pretty much any 1080p game even games
are vram intensive like Skyrim with mods
or shadow of Mordor it's got a DVI I
DVID
an HDMI as well as a DisplayPort now for
power delivery it does require two 6-pin
PCI Express power it is PCI Express 3.0
card obviously and we've got two massive
fans on here with a heatsink that runs
the entire length of the card as well as
this thing a custom PCB this is not a
reference PCB so it is larger than the
standard 380 which makes it kind of
beefy and kind of heavy now the back
obviously you can see we've got a
backplate I got EVGA to start including
back plates on their cards and now we've
got sapphire who pushed against my
saying you need back plates just for the
aesthetic benefit of keeping up with
competitors well look at that they told
me they didn't need to do back plates
and here we are that's a big deal in
fact they even put a big sticker right
on the front of the box that says back
plate alright guys let's keep the back
plate movement going if you guys know of
any companies out there that are not
including back plates on the cards let
me know and we'll send the Jays army
after them and the factory TP of the
card is only about a hundred and
seventy-five watts this thing because it
is factory overclocked is going to be
pushing out a little bit more TDP than
that which I think the massive cooler
with for copper heat pipes on here as
you can see is going to do a fantastic
job at keeping this thing cool what also
again I give huge kudo points to
sapphire for doing is they do also
include the vram as well as the power
delivery as an actively cooled part
by this heatsink it is being the main
heatsink with the heat pipes is touching
the vrm on this thing which is going to
help keep the vo rooms cool VRMs believe
it or not when it comes to overclocking
if they're not kept nice and cool can
introduce instabilities and artifacts
and all sorts of damaging ways to hurt
your card by not keeping the VRMs cool
if you guys notice the lights kind of
going up and down and up and down we've
got clouds big poofy white things going
by in California they must be on their
way somewhere else they don't usually
stick around damn it
they keep blocking out the Sun and
messing up my lights now before we get
into the benchmarks one thing I want to
go ahead and just nip in the bud is when
I put this thing up on Instagram and
said that it's one of the sexiest
coolers I think on the market a lot of
people were pretty much really harsh and
said well I just looks like an AC xcopy
it looks just like EVGA s cards if you
think this cooler looks anything like
the AC X except for the fact that it has
two round fans which blade design aren't
even the same then please go get some
glasses get an eye exam or a head exam
because you cray-cray obviously there's
only so many designs you can do in a
rectangular shape like this but I think
sapphire did a really good job at
keeping this thing aesthetically its own
I mean yeah there's a couple of things
you might be able to say maybe kind of
look like the AC X but I don't think
that's true at all this thing looks
entirely different even the backplate
looks amazingly unique on its own
all right enough yammering let's go
ahead and put this thing on the test
bench let's see how it performs and by
the way we are running the newest 15.1
one crimson driver on this thing so I
have no idea how it would have performed
when I first got it because I went ahead
and redid the pinch marks with the
Crimson drivers simply because I didn't
want to put this video and have people
we like didn't you're the latest drivers
gay so yeah 15.1 one crimson is the
drivers that we were using for this test
bench without further ado here the
transition
now the only reason I even included the
1970 in this benchmark is I know a lot
of people were gonna ask me how does it
compare to a 970 now the thing is the
970 is much more expensive than this
card so obviously it should perform
better so the only reason it's in there
I didn't want to put it in there
is I know if I didn't put it in there
people were gonna ask me well how did it
compare so take that for what it is but
obviously it fits in between the 380 and
the 3 9 390 exactly where I thought it
would what was interesting is that an
overclocked 380 pretty much came like
right up against the baseline of where
the 380 X was at stock speeds at least
with the factory overclock but keep in
mind that all three of the AMD cards in
this those graphs that you saw the 380
the 380 X and the 390 are all Nitro
series carts so they all pretty much
have about the same level of factory
overclock applied to all of them on the
base numbers which is why I I'm happy
that sapphire sent me all three of the
nitros you know obviously with the
exception of 390 X so that I could give
you guys pretty consistent baseline
improvements between all three of those
cards one other thing to keep in mind in
these benchmarks especially with like
Witcher 3 in Crysis 3 is my benchmarking
suite has the settings set to like ultra
or whatever the max settings are for
these games and the reason for that is
you gonna see what the worst case
scenario FPS is on these games so
obviously games like Crysis 3 and
Witcher 3 if we were to reduce those
graphics their graphics down to say
medium then it would perform just fine
and you get the 60fps that you were
after so if you're looking at even 1440p
gaming at medium or high it's very very
capable of that especially games like
battlefront has no problems running
battlefront even though I don't have it
in the test market in spent tests
benching sweet words are hard guys we're
too hard then you could certainly play
it at very very high frame rates the
game is not very demanding but holy hell
is it beautiful so there you go guys the
AMD r9 380 X sapphire nitro Edition now
I do retain my initial response in the
beginning of the video where I said I
think it's unique and interesting
that they chose a 380 X maybe it's the
fact there's not a whole lot of market
at the 250 dollar range it's just right
around with this card comes in about 249
at the time in this video and the Nvidia
doesn't really have anything down there
that can compete with this card I mean
we've got the 950 in the 960 they don't
even come close to the performance of
this card but then again they are as
much cheaper than this card as this card
is cheaper than say the 970 so it's kind
of a big gap in performance there and it
looks like AMD just kind of slid this
card that looks kind of wrong doesn't it
just kind of like slid this card right
in there where hopefully you guys are
looking at this being a good stopgap
card for 250 bucks
1080p or 1440p gaming very very capable
you guys noticed I also didn't do any 4k
benchmarks on this this is not a 4k card
that would be that would just be a waste
of time to even try and do 4k gaming
with this car especially one of them but
anyway guys time to get out of here
thanks for watching today's video let me
know how you feel about this card and if
you had 250 dollars to spend right now
on a graphics card what card would you
buy would you buy this one or would you
buy something else sound off in the
comments tell Safire what you think
about their card and as always guys I
will see you in the next one oh and by
the way have a Happy Thanksgiving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
