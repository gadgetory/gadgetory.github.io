remember a couple years ago I did a
basic beginners guide on how to water
cool your computer well here it is
unfortunately it's in some serious
disrepair and actually some stuff going
on in here I want to take a look at the
inside you can see this Inlet completely
it's the inlet to the reservoir to the
pump completely collapsed on itself so
I'm expecting this block to be
completely gunked-up but this is
actually like an old athlon x4 it's a
very low watt part and actually the
owner said that it never even overheated
and stuff which I believe because it's
such a low wattage part but you know one
of the best things we can do around here
is you know take care of these computers
and provide tech support for friends and
family but it's also a serious need for
an update so we're gonna kind of do two
birds with one stone here we're gonna
take this loop out we're gonna look
inside of it and they're gonna build a
whole new system to just deal with this
so yeah let's go ahead and take it apart
and see what's inside today's video is
sponsored by Squarespace and whether you

fortunately I can get this loop out in
one piece because I don't want to have
to disassemble this inside of the system
but you can see at the bottom of this
reservoir how it's all kind of black and
gunky yeah I'm not sure exactly what
that is I mean it could be growth
normally growth has a little bit more of
a green color to it not this sort of a
black color but I have a lipstick as a
bracket I have a feeling that what is
inside the loop or at least inside the
block that is completely clogged it up
is the same stuff as this so we're gonna
be completely building a new system the
only thing that's really gonna get kind
of transferred over here is the hard
drive so there's a thermal paste thermal
paste looks alright I mean didn't expect
it not to be so here's our loop see
comes out one piece so here's the excess
PC block we can actually just take an
allen key and undo these four and then
see what's going on inside the block but
first I have to drain it here's all that
gunk I was talking about right here I'm
pretty sure that's right inside the
block looks like and one thing to point
out though is this owner actually has a
few dogs and you can see that as much as
we tried to clean this out listen to
that fan that was clearly dried up this
one's completely seized up it's
important to really dust out your
systems as often as you can if you have
pets or you smoke or you vape or
whatever we're near your computer then
you're accelerating the level of which
the degradation can happen to your fans
right here these are old yet loony fans
they were used when I gave them to him
but yeah he's also a disabled veterans
so I'm not expecting him to get down and
crawl around all the time and clean this
off but I'm just wanted to kind of show
you what long-term use with a pet
environment actually looks like on fans
and stuff he would have noticed this a
lot sooner had he had a more powerful
chip that would have actually noticed
when it was getting cooling issues so if
you guys are wondering what this loop
was this was just a distilled water with
Petey nuke mix this was not a fluid like
a premix or concentrate this was just
straight-up distilled water I mean the
tubes collapsed on themselves and then
just sort of never came back it's kind
of crazy Oh exactly what I expected to
see that looks like doo doo doo
completely clogged it's even solidified
so that's why there was no more water
flow going through there okay that this
could probably be cleaned even gonna
know the truth like but yeah I don't
think we're gonna even try
that's pretty built up in there could
probably wire brush that but what's the
point I mean this is this water block is
so old we're just gonna go ahead and do
this quickly we are gonna build a new
computer from scratch cuz it's time this
computer was the CPU and RAM and stuff
that he got at the time was near end of
life and that was back in 2012 when we
built the motherboard the RAM and the
CPU the graphics card updated
for him last year but or maybe a year
before geez time flies all right let's
do it
so here we go his new tower up and
running it's got a gtx 980ti it's got an
i5 7600 k with an asrock gaming K six
fatalities Z 270 motherboard 16
gigabytes of ddr4 a brand new power
supply and obviously we've got our EVGA
240 millimeter a IO cooler in there so I
was worried about gunk and stuff
building up in another custom loop
making this a lot more maintenance-free
and a lot more easy for him to maintain
and I think I say he's a disabled vet so
don't know how to get down crawl around
on the ground or whatever trying to take
care of this so you might have noticed -
I installed the power supply upside down
so it's pulling air from this vented
shroud right here rather than the floor
because the first thing I asked him
especially after cleaning out the other
case is will it be on carpet or on a
desk and he said it's going to be down
on the floor on carpet so I don't want
pulling up dirt and dust and even though
he does not he's not gonna let the
animals in that room it's you know how
animals are and hair and all that it
will get and everywhere in the house so
I don't want it sucking any of that dirt
up into the power supply so we inverted
it but as you guys can see Oh in the
case obviously here is a define see from
fractal design it's a tempered glass
edition so it has a tempered glass side
panel you can see in there a huge
upgrade from his previous build which
was like an Athlon x4 I think it was
ddr3 and it was certainly a dated system
so now he can play just about any game
he wants at high resolution high
settings I want him to be able to just
max the settings out and that's what he
can do now so what do my guys I just
wanted to bring you guys this video and
show you kind of what happens with a
soft tube loop that gets clogged up and
gets gunky and give you guys more
ammunition to be like this is why you
shouldn't water cool but you know what
doesn't matter that's what we do around
here we love water cooling and I'm going
to always advocate it but we did an AI
oh and this one to make it as much less
hands-on as possible any guys we're
gonna go thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
