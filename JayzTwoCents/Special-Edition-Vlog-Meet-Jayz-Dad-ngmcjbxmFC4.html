there's somebody else on here that you
guys have probably never seen but if you
follow me on Twitter and on Facebook and
all that stuff you've definitely heard
about them
because this is my old man I'm his pops
like some people think you're my grandpa
in public but anyway there's no
resemblance here whatsoever no you if
you guys follow the vlog channel you've
seen miss Jays two cents you've seen my
daughter but you've never seen my old
man in here yes and when I did the vlog
on Friday about you know the help scare
that we just went through if you guys
aren't aware on Friday
my old man here was I'm always gonna
call you my old man you're always gonna
be my old man just like yo if I can
always be your baby you know my baby you
can always be my old man anyway he was
diagnosed with male breast cancer after
feeling some what yet pain didn't you
yeah after about a week and being the
tough guy in the Navy veteran that he is
and the Vietnam survivor and the ambush
patrols and going out there and looking
for Charlie and laying down runways and
UDT and then or anything like he'll the
other way running while getting shot at
if you weren't allowed to shoot back
sort of thing yeah you but some people
have heard some of the war stories that
you've told me because when I mentioned
the cancer scare I only have 1500
subscribers versus the 20,000 people
that could potentially be watching this
video right now
but that video has almost 1200 views out
of fifteen hundred subscribers that is
an insane view ratio and what that means
is that a lot of people watched it a lot
of people were you know we're interested
in what it meant when I said Jay got
horrible news and a lot of people
started sharing their stories with me
lots and lots of you know prayers for
best wishes and the flipside a lot of
people started sharing with me their
stories both publicly and privately of
their parents or their wives and
girlfriends and brothers who have died
to cancer because it's it's a real thing
it's a major you know epidemic all over
the world different types of cancers and
many of which aren't curable so there
you take this guy here that his seem
fairly invincible I mean you've had
you've had heart attacks when you were a
lot younger you've had strokes you have
type-2 diabetes right yeah I'd like to
have type 2 diabetes and that's what's
wrong with my legs right now yeah that's
led to the strokes and the neuropathy
you also have neuropathy so you have a
very hard time walking
you're turning 71 how many one that's
seven I'd went well I gave you a no that
one gave you an extra year because I
used to always guess her age Tim high
and then you would get offended now I
guess too low in your offended look if I
can't win a dress like you were going in
40 I feel like I'm going on for some
time but anyway it really got me
thinking you know I've been on a couple
of like my friend boogie2988 the guy who
was you know cussin and yellow and this
because that's what his channel is you
know he's a he's a rager and he's got a
character but I was on his livestream
when there was you know tens of
thousands of people watched that and
when he you know we just were chatting
and talking you know on live stream and
you know he had asked me you know people
somebody asked a question you know who
were you guys as heroes and he talked
about you know Superman spider-man knows
all that sort of stuff I thought about
it and I told them that you have always
been my hero oh I never heard this first
this is why we're doing this
because I very nearly may not have had a
chance to tell you yeah I'm 32 years old
right 32 I'm 32 years old to date and I
think in my entire adult life I've never
told you how much you mean to me it took
me two years after I retired to get you
yeah you were retiring from the Navy and
you were starting all over what about of
the hard work but no I got to thinking
about it and you know a lot of people
may have seen my draw my life video that
I did and I don't emotionally open up
and I think you know that and and you
don't either nope and it's a trait I've
definitely gotten from you but a lot of
people always ask me about me why I'm
successful in almost anything I do I put
my mind to I because I been successful
at it because the the drive and the
diligence and the attention to detail
and everything that makes me me I feel
I've learned from you well you know I
knew that when I took it to when I was
doing a special consulting for Toyota
and I took you to work with me and we
worked on the networking yeah I knew
then I knew you're born but that date
well I was 16 when I put on a suit and
tie and went to work with you it Toyota
Motor Corp corporate office in Torrance
California and but I mean everything
today it's amazing how much I've fallen
in your footsteps to with the project
management and a lot of the things I do
for work but it all goes back to you
know you put me on your lap when I was a
kid and teaching me how to use a
computer and one of the best things I
ever did and you should take lesson from
this and when he tried to get that the
computer on my lap I never said no never
let him go yeah and that was the best
thing I ever did and I do the same thing
with my daughter now and look how good
she is with a computer she's amazing
the sad part is she's better at for than
I ever was and there's a really smart
Easter that kid's gonna put me to shame
but I wanted to I wanted to publicly
take the opportunity to put up there on
the internet forever and just let the
world know how much you mean to me how
worried I would try to make me cry I'm
trying not to look look I've got to be
I've gotta be the big tough guy here
but you know I've not been very good at
sharing my emotions and you know it's
it's caused me problems in the past and
it wasn't until all these people told me
how they didn't get a chance to say
goodbye today look and maybe I wouldn't
have had that opportunity so I have the
ability to record this and keep it
forever and I want to share it because a
lot of people were concerned a lot of
ways when I readily comment to them I
would like to say no thank you very much
for all those comments you made on the
blog because you should see the way my
phone blew up when I tweeted out that it
was a misdiagnosis and that you don't
have cancer it's important to say that
too that you don't have it what's it
called what do you have gosh yes it's
not worried about that baby I don't see
lots of CO Mystica mr. classic elastico
Mystica something like that basically
it's a growth caused by your medications
and caused by my blood pressure
medication now you've been taking since
your 50s well this way I have taken for
one year he says that's about the right
time for that to start happening he said
you never go away and it might even hurt
a little bit more but even if they
change the medicine I would come back
again yeah I know but the bottom line is
this is not that this is not it's not a
danger this country but apparently but
apparently it appears on imaging a lot
like cancer enough to fool your doctor
well that's why we went to USA because
they're specialists at the rate Research
Center and I don't blame the other
doctor for making miss diagnostic
because unless I knew what they were
looking in this guy looks at it all the
time they wouldn't know they would've
thought was cancer well a lot of a lot
of people I talked to you know I talked
to Robert at the gym about it and he was
like well I'd be mad you know with all
the fear and people get sick you know
you had to deal with almost a week I
would rather be safe than sorry yeah
what if the doctor hadn't said anything
yeah and what if it was so but basically
I I just wanted to tell everybody out
there on that camera that everything I
am and all my success that's happened
here on YouTube and in my career and
technically the technical side of me I
have definitely learned from you and
this is me making more head to be a
thumb phone this is me making an honest
effort to open up more emotionally with
my family and I and now I I love you
very much
you're definitely you've always been
there in my teenage years you help me
get my Eagle Scout you've pushed me to
do things that I otherwise wouldn't have
wanted to do but definitely never
regretted doing them after getting the
Swift kicks in the ass that you were
willing to you know what I thought about
the other day during remember going for
your Eagle Scout and you had to make a
wicked basket a wicker basket and that
was the worst basket ever man I thought
I just sat there and cracked up and
laughs because we think about that
basket yeah it was crooked and it was
all excited and like weighed out it was
horrible
yeah yeah but when it came down when it
came time to do the shootin badges that
definitely showed my strength I'll take
credit for that one guys I hit mother
too he taught me how to shoot Navy
taught you how to shoot and you were
expert every year equal lawyer this man
right here I mean you're in the Navy 20
20 years 20 years and every year he
qualified in the in the Navy he
qualified as an expert shooter yeah
people I say was a navy usually said got
somebody that's on the ship running
around the ocean I had to tell him how I
carried him 16 in the jungle so he
carried an m16 in the jungle and you
went up we you went out with the marine
recons didn't get yep I tell people
military bona fide badass and when you
were in New York we were looking through
your military photos because we were
looking at old photos can you ask your
military stuff and Diego Garcia and all
that sort of stuff but you are my hero I
love you very much and you don't need to
wonder whether or not I do or don't love
you because I don't have the ability
well the one thing it bothered me
somewhat because I got used to doing
everything with you and I know dads have
to back off in fact when they asked him
you want me to back off a bit well I
don't know answer did I say no no no
okay I know I could have told you yes
back off detent down that next yeah oh
one single I'm doing this year look I'm
very proud of this man he had a
mammogram I had a mammogram
my 70 year old father had a mammogram
anyways guys the bottom line here is you
know this isn't tech related other than
the fact that this is the guy that
started everything I've become today
when it comes to my technical career and
all the stuff I do on YouTube but a lot
of you told me you didn't get a chance
to tell people how you cared almost all
of you told me to tell this man how I
carried and that's exactly what I'm
doing today so turn and tell someone you
care that you love them and don't let
them wonder if you do
because just like when Alma died
immediately oh I know right when my
grandmother died it was I didn't get a
chance to tell her and she and I and I
felt bad because she wondered if I liked
her and I remember that watching she
knew but she getting back to told my
sister my grandfather was more like a
father to me than my real father was and
he died I didn't have a chance to say
goodbye and but because of the not
terrific relationship he had with your
father created your drive to be a better
father yeah my father I was 40 years old
my father went to first baseball game
with me yeah and the whole time you were
and when you were a young boy he was out
in World War two out in the yeah Wow
really Normandy wasn't it didn't go in
Germany in Germany yeah he marched all
the way to Berlin was at the Battle of
the Bulge and he crossed the bridge at
Remagen there's some rich military
history in this family that's for sure
but guys we're gonna go ahead and cut
this out I just wanted to we're gonna
cut this off now just make sure you tell
someone how you care and it's a little
bit different from the normal format of
my show but when an opportunity like
this happens and you have so there's
people today who did not get the good
news that we got so we've got to think
about those people too and I love you
very much I don't think I could have had
a better father and I just wanted the
world to know that they
take care of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
