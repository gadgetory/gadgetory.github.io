been a little bit of a lack of a and B
discussion this week at CES especially
since they have their keynote with some
really high-level teaser Rison to or
then to Raisa and 3rd gen which is weird
a3 is the - in this case a guide I guess
they also talked about the new Radeon 7
which is the seventh animated version of
Vega well some might say we saved
potentially the best early first we've
got to thank our sponsor and of course
that is Coursera in the Corsair one high
performance desktop PC the i-140 eye 160
and eye 180 to be found in the link in
description below so one of the things
that's really hard to do with these
trade shows where you get very high
level information very lock down demos
is a true opinion on a product so we're
gonna kind of hold off on that but
there's a discussion I want to have in
this video a little bit later on so
please stick around but I really do want
to see your comments down below but
before we kind of talk about performance
they do have some demos here I'm going
to kind of take a quick look around the
card and what's different from Vegas 56
and Vegas 64 which has a very similar
design at obviously the most major
changes you can see is they went with a
triple fan design by kind of getting rid
of the blower style cooler we saw in
video do this too but obviously they
have a dual fan solution this is a
triple fan by just truly dropping the
blower style cooler and going with the
multi fan so it's solution like this you
can get more power and a lot more
control over thermals by doing this
obviously as you can see though they
also have a very dense thin array in
terms of the amount of heatsink fins
that are on this card by doing so
they've greatly improved the thermal
capacity of the cooler I saw a lot of
comments back when in Vega 56 and 64
launched that they loved the raw
aluminum brushed aluminum look the
backplate in my opinion is one of the
best back plates on the market in terms
of aesthetics the only thing that's
different between this card and the
actual production card because this is
an engineering sample as they've removed
the logo from the back so it's going to
be a very clean aesthetic looks pretty
much identical to the Vega 64 with the
black bracket right here we've got our
black bracket on the back
and this is not a dual BIOS card though
although the Vegas 64 and 56 did have
dual by us this one does not appear to I
don't see any switches anywhere on this
but I mean you can still pretty much
overclock this card plate and curves and
all that stuff using the adrenaline
software now it's got dual eight pin
power plugs on the back so you could
definitely have to pair this thing with
a pretty decent power supply but you
should do that any time you're shopping
talk to your anyway in my opinion though
more power than you think you need that
way obviously you are run into any
issues there but other than that it
still is very reminiscent and derivative
of the very clean and very minimalistic
approach to the design of the cooler and
the graphics card as a whole from Vegas
64 now in terms of specs it's actually a
not only a die shrink in terms of seven
nanometer but it's also a stream
processors shrink so it's got thirty
eight hundred and forty stream
processors that's hard to say speed
price to 50 so instead of 4096 stream
processors this has three hundred three
hundred and eighty that's really reduced
no 3840 it's also instead of 64 see use
hence the Vegas 64 it's got 60 so it's
kind of interesting that overall the die
is I kind of shrunk in all those aspects
but the performance is up in fact they
are boasting a r-tx 2080 level of
performance in obviously standard games
stuff not r-tx that's a whole different
discussion to have on a different day
when we get more hands-on on this but it
has a got an increased boost clock and
turbo clock or moose clock turbo clock
base clock across-the-board that's where
they're getting a lot of their
performance improvements so we've got 16
gigabytes of HBM to unhear up from the 8
gigabytes down on the biggest 64 and up
quite a bit from before found on the old
fury and fury x but yeah it's one the
same that's like does more screen buffer
makes sense well I guess that depends on
who you ask
obviously the game developers would love
to have his
Green buffer as possible because then
that becomes less of a limitation and
they one of the launch partners for this
card is the division two and they've got
the developers here on site talking
about the game obviously some of the
technologies involved like it's got to
improve AC furnace compute but they've
even said that they have seen in 4k
which has definitely been making a push
over the last couple years be more
mainstream that it can use you know 10
gigabytes 11 gigabytes of screen screen
buffer pretty easily but with it's 4096
bit memory bus you can have up to one
terabyte per second 3-foot on the memory
so memory is obviously a huge focus with
with Radeon graphics now it's going to
head on over here to the division 2 demo
we'll do a quick demo on that and then
just a very quick food for thought
discussion at the end this is a demo of
the division 2 and what kind of really
sucks about this is they didn't activate
Windows it's not activated the problem
with demos is the fact that they're
extremely locked down they're not final
so I hate to I always reserve opinion of
anything that is not final until its
final because it's not fair to anyone
involved when you have early access
stuff because things aren't optimized
the title obviously has some room for
improvement we're not gonna see this
reach retail until March so yeah reserve
any of those opinions on performance
until things are done and even it says
right here work in progress the first
thing I wanted to see what are the specs
what are they running out well we know
they're running 4k but if you go to the
settings you can see all you can do is
change controls you can't change any of
the settings so I have no idea what the
anti-aliasing level is I have no idea
what type of AAA is running I have no
idea what like the post-processing
effects are but anyway in terms of
perceived smoothness it is very smooth
but I would expect nothing less at this
level of graphics with this type of
frame buffer in obviously a launch party
partner title so that's where we got to
see how it handles other titles and
games that are pre-existing rather than
ones that are designed with the card in
mind during development now it's going
to talk about something that I've
intentionally reserved this video to the
end of the week we had this meeting with
AMD much earlier in the week and I
basically said I want to reserve my
opinion on this one until I have the
card in hand obviously but - I wanted to
really watch what the audience was
saying I was very curious because
everyone was expecting because of I
think unnecessarily on
air leaks Navi right now and that's
obviously not what this is this is a
this is a generational improvement to an
existing product and because of that a
lot of people I think we're being
extremely unfair to AMD by saying well
know that what I thought we were getting
a 250 dollar card that was supposed to
destroy the r-tx 2070 you may or may not
see that this year in 2019 but what I
was really concerned with and I wanted
to see what people were saying is about
realistically the price increase this is
a price increase versus Vega 64 Vega 64
unfortunately was plagued with
production costs issues versus retail
pricing and was very cutthroat with the
Pascal series from Nvidia and video
launch to 1070 TI right around the same
time intentionally to fill that gap at
that performance per dollar figure which
made it very difficult for Vega to
really kind of get legs and become very
widely adopted because supply was
impossible it's hard to get a card it
really was and then getting yet to buy
it with bundles and and so a lot of
people were really mad at AMD you know
about a year and a half ago so I wanted
to see if people were just as upset at
this and pride this price increase of
about $100 but at the end of the day you
are getting something tangible for it
that you would be able to experience at
the time of launch versus being a
technological thing that you're
expecting that for that extra money with
Nvidia where you got to see titles come
online taking advantage of a hardware
level improvement where this is
something developers could update have
backwards compatibility with old titles
to take advantage of some of these newer
technologies you know the asynchronous
compute improvements and all that sort
of stuff so I'm really curious as to how
you guys feel is the hundred dollars a
deal-breaker for you for this card at
700 being pretty much one of the most
expensive AMD mainstream cards that's
ever been developed or are you guys okay
with it and that's just food for thought
I want to know what you guys feel if you
are upset at one brand for a price
increase but not another it comes down
to whether or not the price increase
gives you value so that's where I want
you guys to chime in down below anyway
here we are at CES 2019 wrapping up our
show with the AMD booth and I'm excited
I'm excited to see where this goes
because I've preached it a million times
we need the competition obviously AMD
has been competing in the CPU space and
really really getting back that market
chair which is great it's great for all
parties we need the same thing on
graphics so guys tell me what you think
in the comments down below and as always
thank you to Coursera for sending
here for CES 2019 that's a wrap for us
thanks for watching we'll see you guys
in the next one I'm going home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
