and apparently I'm got the frame all
messed up so I'm gonna hunched over like
this so I can actually hit the screen so
I finally get to bring you guys a video
that I'm really really excited about
because I finally get to build my own
SLI system now I have done tons of SLI
builds for customers and friends and I
can't even count how many times that
I've done it I mean SLI builds are
pretty much gonna be coming out of the
air
back end of something or another but
anyway I've never done it for myself so
I finally have found myself in a
position to where I can do an SLI build
and I'm doing two gtx 780 s there's one
of them right there brand spanking new
card gonna be going inside my build
matching my other 780 now along with
that there's some changes I'm gonna have
to make so I figured I'd do just kind of
a little bit of a build log for you guys
showing you the process and what I have
to do I'm now this isn't a how-to I'm
not going to show you guys how to do an
SLI or how to do water cooling I've
already done water cooling cooling I've
already done water cooling builds in the
past so you guys are gonna have to go
and check those out individually if you
want to but I'm gonna tell you what's
changing in my system and so you can see
I'm not doing just a card I've got a lot
more than a card going in there so the
parts I'm putting in of course alpha
cool some of the best radiators you can
possibly buy now when it comes to
fittings and stuff I've got an array of
extra fittings over here that I just
never know what you're going to
encounter and I want to make sure I have
all my radiuses and things covered in
case I need to do something special
there I've got two alpha cool d5 pumps
right here I'm gonna be doing a dual
pump honestly it's 100% overkill it's
not necessary but I'm gonna do it anyway
just because why the hell not yeah and
then I've got a another SP 120 quiet
Edition fan right here because I'm going
to be putting as you can see down here
this alpha cool 480 rad up top and
removing the triple red that I have next
to my 480 rad down on the bottom so I'm
gonna have two 480 rads so why am i
doing that sure I had more than enough
radiator capacity in beforehand to where
I could have just put the card in and
been happy I'm glad you asked I've got a
V 1200 power supply here replacing my V
700 power supply from coolermaster it's
a platinum rated power supply even
though it says gold on the box this is a
preliminary test sample so I won't be
doing a review on that one I'll be doing
a review on the actual retail sample
which is platinum rated but I'm going
with 1200 psi 1200 psi you know that was
a real that was really a face slap that
actually hurt but I'm going with 1200
watts of power so I can keep my system
in the peak efficiency there but that is
a longer power supply and as you know my
current build the power supply barely
fits with the triple rad there
but the longer PSU there's no way it
would have fit so I'm gonna go ahead and
get that triple out of there put a 480
up top we're gonna put it up in the roof
and we're just gonna have way more
radiator space than we need and then of
course I've got the matching ek blocking
backplate to the system that's our the
black block and back play it's hard to
say matching block and backplate to the
card that's already in there and then
we've got of course my tubing and stuff
and then my extra set of loot ro custom
sleeved extension cables had those made
for a reason because I knew this day was
coming so guys let's go ahead and just
kind of put this all together hopefully
and get it done in one day it might take
two and then we'll go and do some
performance reviews and we'll see what
we've got
so don't go away stay tuned be right
back after these messages
and all that other stuff they stay on TV
even though it's not TV camera guys
we're back now it's been about a week
since I started this project and let's
go ahead and talk about some things that
happened in between first of all I did
change up my loop as you guys know I
took out the triple rad I added a 480 to
the top and I added two brand new alpha
cool D 5 pumps running and series to
keep the noise down because I can leave
them on a low setting and still have
plenty of pumping power for two graphics
cards two radiators and a CPU block so
perfectly happy with that I installed
the graphics cards in parallel which
means they are splitting the water flow
between both of them at the same exact
time rather than running in series where
the water goes through one card then
another and then going into the CPU
block temperature-wise they only gained
about 2 degrees Celsius per card so
instead of getting 42 41 degrees Celsius
max on one card I'm getting about 43 to
44 max on both cards simultaneously
while overclocked and slightly over
volted that's perfectly acceptable to me
considering the fact that on air with
the reference cooler it was easily going
up to 80 to 85 degrees or whatever the
temperature threshold was so that's my
new loop perfectly happy with it
couldn't be more ecstatic
now clearly my panel configuration
behind me has changed I was running a
27-inch 60 Hertz panel 1080p panel and a
24-inch 60 Hertz 1080p panel and I
decided I was just going to use the 127
inch but it was so freakin overkill and
I was getting too
hundred frames per second in battlefield
4 which is the cap on preset ultra with
MSA and all settings maxed was averaging
anywhere between 170 to 200 and had
friends over here to witness it and
could see that the frames per second was
just beyond ridiculous so I thought you
know considering it was scoring you know
almost 5200 in valley benchmark and it
was scoring twenty thousand five hundred
and 3dmark 11 I figured you know let's
go ahead and do this right so I took the
27 inch and putting on my test bench
took the 28 inch on the test bench
giving that to the wife and I decided to
go ahead and go with three 24-inch
matching panels which are the Acer g2
for 6 HL panels
I love the panel's $141 couldn't ask for
a better panel for the price you may
have another panel on that price range
that you prefer then go with whatever
panel you want I don't care what you use
use whatever the heck you want I only
worried about what I like so you can
keep the panel comments and go and buy
your favourite panels now with three
times 1080p 60 Hertz that's what 57 60
by 1080 I think is the resolution so I
knew it was going to hammer the cards a
little bit more but even in battlefield
right now I'm still getting great frames
per second averages here in 3-way our
two-way SLI with 3-way monitors and I
could not be happier the only thing I
never I have a hard time getting used to
is the peripheral vision I'm not used to
seeing all this stuff happening out of
the side so I'm kind of like wide-eyed
when I'm playing and I'm feeling very
weii scary eyes so I've been having a
hard time getting used to that it's
getting better but flying in battlefield
4 absolutely amazing flight simulators
are fun driving simulators are fun maybe
I'll build a driving simulator now and I
can actually play some eye racing with
with Jerry Bart you know a ka-bar to
Cleese and maybe cause some havoc over
on eye racing but I digress
it's a whole lot of fun and I can't wait
to experience this even more with having
three monitors active at the same time
titanfall has some quirks with it I
don't think the prophets working
perfectly because for some reason when I
have three panels going I have no radar
and I have no points progress whatsoever
no radar no points but everything else
is perfect so I don't know what happened
to the
so it makes the game a little bit harder
guys I'm really happy with the envy
surround I've never had an envy surround
of my own I have set it up for other
people but I've never had it full time
for myself to mess around with so if
it's something you guys have you know
graphics cards that will support it you
would have to have a really powerful
single card to do it
two-way SLI is certainly recommended for
that but it's something that I am
learning to enjoy and I think that the
immersion of gaming is just a whole lot
more awesome when you have stuff
happening you know all the way through
your peripheral vision in front of you
flying in battlefield 4 is a whole new
experience flying in my flight Sims is
amazing and driving simulators if I
finally can go out and buy a steering
wheel will be even better I don't have a
lot more fun with that so there you go
guys that's my experience here with
setting up and be surround for myself
the first time I've owned an envy
surround setup and my first time really
running a two-way SLI setup of my own
I'm used to one powerful card having to
with three monitors it's just a whole
new experience it's really really
exciting so what are you guys using are
you doing an NV surround are you doing
an eye affinity on AMD tell us about
your setups and your monitor setup so
that people who are thinking about doing
this can learn from you guys on what
your experiences are try and keep it
half way you know and NVIDIA sucks or
AMD sucks free I know it's hard for you
guys I know you're really passionate
about the brands that you like but do
the best you can to be mature I know
it's hard and it's the Internet go ahead
and help each other out talk about it
down in the comments there or take it
over to the website or on Twitter as
always guys you know where to find me
and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
