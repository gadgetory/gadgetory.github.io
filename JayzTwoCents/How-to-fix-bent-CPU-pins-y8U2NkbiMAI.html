willing to fix a subscribers broken rise
in CPU where some pins got smashed and I
thought to myself rather than do it for
them I figured why not actually show
them how to do it themselves with what
the rise the rise of rise in CPUs this
year and how many of them were sold and
the fact that this applies to all the
backwards compatible AMD CPUs that have
pins on them like the FX CPUs and the
Athlon CPUs I figured this is a topic
that's probably worth covering or
limited time by a select EVGA GeForce
GTX 1080 Ti or GT X 1080 graphics card
or a laptop and get a free copy of
Destiny 2 for PC help save humanity's
last safe city by following the link in
the description below so what I have
right here is my running and working
risin 1700 X CPU it's one we've been
using when we do our rise in benchmarks
and you know what I figured I'm so
confident in this what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to damage this CPU I'm going
to intentionally hurt it so I'm gonna
drop it on the pins kind of reminiscent
of what might be a typical issue up
there someone's holding they drop it and
these pins are fairly fragile they'll
kind of smash over and showing you that
it's working right now I'm going to hit
restart oops and now it's probably a
triggering update but I'm going to show
you guys the way that I do this now
there's a lot of different ways that you
can do this or even some specialized
tools out there that people come up with
to fix this but I'm gonna show you the
way I do it with minimal to no budget
whatsoever now this isn't the first time
anyone's done something like this so I
don't claim to be first or original at
repairing a CPU in fact Linus did a
video showing how you can repair the
motherboard pins on an Intel socket
which is much more delicate and much
more difficult but we're gonna do it
today with AMD because I think it says
is the easiest thing out there and some
people really freaked out when this
happens and it you really don't have to
but we need to talk about what tools you
need now the only three things you need
to get this done at least using my
method is the CPU and the motherboard
admittedly you should have both already
if you have a damaged CPU and a
razorblade
now I've heard people using like tiny
the needle nose pliers and microphone
but you know magnifying glasses and
stuff it's not the way I do it I'm of
the mindset that I like to do things as
simple as possible with the least amount
of trouble as poss
and this one's designed to be fixed in a
matter of which is readily available and
if you don't have a razor blade you can
run down to you know the corner store
get one pack of razor blades from Home
Depot or whatever are going to be very
very cheap but you know we have to do
first we have to hurt this guy this is a
$300 CPU this is not like this is not
some cheap like I could go grab the FX
CPU and I could totally show you how to
do it on an old FX CPU that would like
it if it went re and if it didn't work I
wouldn't be out you know a $300 CPU but
this is how what does it say about a guy
if he's not willing to put his own stuff
on the line to stand by his methods
right so here we are right here with a
perfectly good rise in 1700 X CPU the
way I see this typically happening is
guys are like holding their CPU and
they're like yeah and then they drop it
and it doesn't take much to bend these
pins I mean look these these pins are
they're not even a millimeter thick I
mean what are these probably half mil at
best and there's a lot of them obviously
so you know what we got to do
so apparently I'm a better dropper than
I thought because after like the first
three drops I couldn't get anything to
happen like it cause it kept hitting the
corner which is fairly protective right
the pins are somewhat recessed but then
on the fourth drop they bent a little
bit then finally I decide to just take a
pen and take measures into my own hands
one of the ways I've seen these get bent
though is if people put them in the
plastic sleeve like to ship used or
something to someone who bought it
online and then they don't put it in the
right way believe it not there's an
orientation a top and a bottom then when
they snap it closed it bends in all the
corners of the pins so what I did what
the pen was I just sort of smashed into
one of the corners and I think it did a
pretty good job of making it look like
the picture that was sent to me for
asking whether or not I could actually
you know fix this for them now this is
pretty repairable in my opinion means
some of them are pretty smashed the hard
part here is going to be straightening
them back out without breaking if a pin
breaks off you can technically fix it if
you have the right equipment it's a tiny
tiny little solder it's just a lot more
work I mean at this point I wouldn't
even attempt it because I don't have the
right equipment to do it so let's go
ahead and see if we can't fix this
because obviously this ain't going to
work like this what I typically will do
with the razor blade is I'll just sort
of take it and I'll kind of put it in
between each row here to make sure that
everything is kind of straight so I'll
take it here I'll start in the end and
then I'll just sort of like weave it in
between and then just kind of rock a
little bit alright so I'm making sure
that the other parts of the chip right
now are good and this parts with me a
little bit tedious you're gonna have to
have some patience I mean at this point
you're trying to save yourself hundreds
of dollars so you don't want to rush
this technically you can't make it worse
unless you break the pins but if it's
not working now and then it doesn't work
later you're kind of in the same boat
right so this side of the CPU is pretty
good it seems like through all those
drops nothing really happened on this
end the very first row though has a
little bit of resistance that's why I
just kind of wiggled it like that and
I'm sorry of using this as a spreader if
you will I'm using the razor blade to
just go through the pins and make it
straight so it keeps everything nice and
straight this is where the hard part's
going to be though the first thing we're
going to want to do though is kind of
start on the end and just sort of
Ryback these pins and this is actually
very difficult with the lighting I have
in here a my goodness because it's
reflections everywhere we just want to
bring the pins back to straight we don't
want to force them too hard we just want
to sort of work it slowly and that's
what I'm gonna be doing at this point so
what I'm gonna do now is we're just
gonna sort of time-lapse this because I
really need to take my time like right
here this summit's bent on this corner
so I'm gonna rotate it 180 we're just
gonna go this way and make sure that
everything is straight on this end
otherwise if they're not straight this
way I can't go that way
if that makes sense so we're sort of
just like hashtagging this left and
right as we go a terrible analogy but
you know I think you get what I meant
so what I'm doing right here now is I've
gotten these basically upright I've got
to make sure they're all straight so
they're all kind of smashed a little bit
different direction like when it got
smashing on the corner so I went right
somewhat left's and went back so I'm
just slowly trying to get them facing
generally in the upward direction so
that I can then start to deal with
getting them facing straight and the
rocking back and forth motion of the
razor blade like this when I switch
angles is just making sure that
everything stays in its own row because
I don't want one to accidentally make
you know get flattened out and be
interfering with the road next to it
because that's gonna be a problem
so I basically got it now so that when I
look down long ways on this axis we're
actually looking pretty good like I
don't see any pins leaning over into the
row they're not supposed to but when I
look down this axis I know if you're
gonna be able to even see that there's
still quite a few facing that way
the other thing had to be careful of too
is while you're doing this make sure you
know while you're holding it down you're
not smashing pins elsewhere like I
started to smash down this corner with
my thumb I mean ideally doing this maybe
and some kind of a vise would help but
then you can't run the razor blade along
it nearly as easy see this pin on the
end right here is like curved that's the
problems I think we might've broken off
we'll see what happens so you can see
right here and if we can see that we
technically lost a pin because that one
got smashed really good now I'm still
gonna test this CPU though because
believe it or not there have been
instances where pins have broken off and
there was no adverse effects whatsoever
I personally don't have the tools to do
it but I'm sudden I see if the CPU works
because I have heard of plenty of
instances where there are pins on here
that don't do squat now we've got them
all per inch lined up but we're not done
yet because if they're not perfectly
straight then they might have a problem
going into the socket so what I'm gonna
do next is I'm gonna take the
motherboard and I'm gonna try and put it
in the motherboard what happens with the
motherboard here is when you turn this
like that you can see the whole top part
slides and if you get the CPU in like if
you get these straightened up enough to
we get the CPU in you can work this back
and forth that will also help you to
straighten out your pins
yeah she got in there so that went in
there at first try there's been times
where I'm Way off now I'm just kind of
working this back and forth and I can
actually feel a little bit more pressure
when I do that but now that it's in
there I'm just gonna kind of wiggle it
do the same thing here just sort of
wiggle it around so you not went down a
little farther it wasn't quite in all
the way yes yes just going in there
without without any effort now all right
so we gotta test it now and I've seen
instances where one pin like that no
post because it's an important pin I've
seen where I busted pin like that can
cause kind of a lot of thermal paste
I've seen an instance where a pin like
that can cause a memory channel to go
bad or no problems whatsoever so I kind
of guess kind of take the chance here
and see what happens because at this
point it's from the perspective of I've
got a CPU that doesn't work anyway now
we're trying to salvage it and see what
happens it's unfortunate though I mean
the very first pin is usually the one
that will break is it got smashed the
most guess we'll see I might have just
cost myself 300 bucks but it's worth it
to do these videos quite honestly all
right moment of truth so we're going
through our postcode so it's like we've
made it past all the CPU codes if we're
in GPU we got posts if we go into BIOS
so you can see our frequency right there
running at 3.4 that's factory oh come
back we've got our 16 gigabytes of
memory showing right there voltage is
good and all of that so that's a good
sign let's go ahead and let's give
Windows boots you know the thing with
the pins is this AMD likes to remain as
forward compatible as possible so all
those pins may not even be in use that
may be a dummy pin that may not go to
anything it doesn't mean it won't go to
something in the future who knows I mean
FX was kind of sort of the same way this
is why you can hear about pins breaking
off and there was no adverse effect I
mean the pin is still sitting well the
pin has gone off to a better place so
but anyway all 16 gigabytes are showing
right there we've got our reserved
memory for our Hardware brain at 21 33
because it was all stock speed and if we
look at our whoops foot our CPU all our
cores are present everything is running
normally as it should all our cache is
showing so yeah
there you go guys as long as you take
your time and have some patience you can
actually fix it and I did all I did all
I used to do it was a razor blade and
the motherboard but hey it's working we
fixed it and I don't have to spend
another 300 bucks to replace it it's the
only 1700 X I have the other one was
given away so with that said guys thanks
for watching if you have any other
suggestions on how to repair or how to
fix videos send them to my inbox or
sending to Twitter wherever it's obvious
that I listen to these so for you that
sent me that email I'm not gonna put
your name out there know if you want me
to but here you go here's what I would
have done and as you can see it's
working and it looked an awful lot like
yours and the pictures that you sent me
so give it a shot and let me know how it
works out
thanks for watching guys and as always
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
