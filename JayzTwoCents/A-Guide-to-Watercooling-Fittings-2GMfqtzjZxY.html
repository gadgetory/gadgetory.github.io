today we're going to talk about a very
important topic male pattern baldness
oh wait actually actually that's a
different video topic but anyway in the
last three years and all the
water-cooling stuff that I've done it's
actually kind of surprising that I've
never done a fittings guide why I found
it fitting that we go ahead and do that
today if you guys are like me you
probably have a very cluttered email
inbox like very very cluttered so I
signed up for a service called unroll me
which actually helps me take control
over my inbox once again using their
roll up and daily email digests I can
see only the subscriptions that are
important to me and kind of block out
the others that I'm not really all that
interested in fact I can even
unsubscribe from all of those emails
using a very easy to use single page
which gives me control over my inbox
once again taking security very serious
they also use OAuth which will keep your
credentials nice and secure and with
their 45-day back scan from the moment
you sign up you're guaranteed not to
miss a single subscription so what you
guys waiting for take control of your
inbox once again head on over to
unrolled op me and sign up now I mean
seriously you have no idea what you're
missing the aim of today's video is not
so much to cover all the fittings that
are out there but just the main ones
there's no way I could cover every
fitting type that's available just to
kind of put things into perspective bits
power which is one of the major fittings
companies out there has over 740 SKUs by
itself I'm not covering all that now the
first thing you have to do before you
can buy any fittings is you have to
determine what type of tubing are you
going to use now in the past soft tubing
like this guy right here was really the
most common thing people use it was very
easy it was plentiful it was easy to
mold and just move around wherever you
needed it I mean it was very flexible so
you didn't have to have perfect runs
like you would with something rigid
tubing which brings us to the next one
which would be rigid tubing these are
the two major tubing types you're going
to find now some people might be
thinking right now well what about
copper tubing copper tubing still falls
under the category of rigid tubing and
we'll use the same fittings as this so
for the sake of simplicity
city let's just go ahead and refer to
these as rigid tubing instead of PE TG
and acrylic and copper believe it or not
they copper actually comes in pretty
much the same sizes as all of the
plastics so it makes it very simple to
just kind of convert whatever material
you're using to rigid tubing now of all
the different types of fittings that are
out there a very small percentage of
them actually have to do with connecting
to the actual material itself now it
comes to connecting to these you're
going to have a few different types and
you have to forgive me one of them I
don't have in front of me because I
haven't used them in years
so I don't have one to show but that
would just be a simple barbed fitting a
barbed fitting is just that it's it's
short for Barbara now I can kind of
demonstrate what a barbed fitting is
here by using one of the compressions
and what that is is it's nothing more
than just the little metal piece that
kind of sticks out there and has a
little well barb on it that will grab on
to and actually hang on to the rubber
itself but basically the material will
just fit over the barb and then you have
to put a clamp on it or a zip tie or
something to keep it from popping off
that would be a barb now moving up to
the next step you have what's called a
compression fitting and that's what I'm
holding right here now you've got a
bunch of different kind compression
fittings you've got Chrome
you've got copper matte black polished
black black chrome I mean tons of
different colors out there not to
mention there's a ton of different
brands so compression fittings between
themselves are not much different all it
means is that the actual tubing is going
to fit over the barb just like I already
showed you now if you take the
compression end and you slide it over
the other side instead of having to use
a clamp the compression itself as you
turn this knob will call it a knob the
compression fitting itself over the tube
it will start to clamp down on this tube
and it won't let it pop off now that's
all a compression fitting is now when it
comes to soft tubing you pretty much
only need to by compression fittings and
the reason for that is you can bend the
tubing to get it all to fit into place
so the most cost-effective way of doing
your your loop if you're on a strict
budget is certainly going to be soft
tubing and by going compression fittings
now what sides
meetings and what size tubing well
that's going to depend on you what I'm
actually holding here is 3/8 by 5/8 I
believe and it's a pretty thick wall in
fact that's what makes it so difficult
to you know put this tubing on to the
barb fitting is this very thick wall but
I prefer thick wall tubing over thin
wall because you can get very tight
bends on it as you can see it won't kink
the thinner of the wall the easier it is
for the tubing to kink like it's doing
right there and that will block all flow
there's nothing more I need to tell you
about making it fit other than make sure
that the tubing size that you have and
the to MA fitting size is the same so
let's say you were running a 1/2 inch
inner diameter that's what the ID stands
for a half inch inner diameter by a 3/4
inch outer diameter you want to make
sure that your compression fitting is
1/2 inch by 3/4 OD or 1/2 ID by 3/4 OD
so as long as those two numbers match
then the fitting and the tubing is going
to match so you don't have to really
over complicate it just over complicate
over complicate I don't know now where
things start to get a little bit more
complicated is when you start using
rigid tubing because there are different
sized rigid tubing x' just like on the
soft tubing you are going to have to
make sure that your sizes match now
there's really only three sizes when it
comes to rigid tubing and they're always
measured for the most part by outer
diameter because that's the part that
matters because the only type of fitting
you're really going to use on these is a
rigid compression fitting it's very
similar to the way the barbed fitting
works only it has bow rings are the
compression fitting for the soft tubing
it has a ring on the outside that clamps
down and that's pretty much it so
nothing is going into the actual rigid
tubing itself it all has to do with the
outer diameter now the three main sizes
right now are half-inch outer diameter
which is getting more popular because
people want to fill up their big cases
and use thick tube you have your 13
millimeter outer diameter and 12
millimeters outer diameter I believe it
or not that one millimeter makes a huge
difference in fact these two right here
they would look identical but they're
not in fact I cannot use a 13 millimeter
outer diameter on a 12 millimeter and
vice versa it simply won't work now I
have here a few different compression
fittings that you would find for rigid
tubing compressions now for instance
let's go ahead and demonstrate to you
why 12 millimeter and a 13 millimeter
are not interchangeable so I have here
once again a this is an alpha cool
compression fitting I have alpha cool
I have primo chill I have bits power so
there's there's a lot of brands out
there now when you separate the
compression here you are going to find
that there are no rings and things
inside these are what create your seal
and if these are not in place your
system is going to leak you don't want
to do that now you take your tube this
happens to be a 13 millimeter because
this is a 13 millimeter fitting and you
put on your compression first and this
particular array or this particular
fittings case it's got an o-ring and
then it's got kind of a flat washer not
all of them have that so make sure you
use whatever materials come with your
fittings slide the o-ring over it then
slide the flat washer there's also an
o-ring on the inside here that's going
to seal against the tube so you slide
that bad boy in there and then you can
slide and tighten everything down and
then once everything is tightened into
place you get a seal and things are not
going to leak on you so there we are a
happy camper with a 13 millimeter rigid
fitting in place nice and tight
nothing's going to leak we're good to go
now one millimeter doesn't sound like a
lot but let's go and try and do the same
thing with the 12 millimeter tube now
the moment I put the compression fitting
over the 12 millimeter you can already
hear the difference it's got lots and
lots of play in there the o-ring slide
that into place the washer and then we
will slide this now as you can already
see the inner o ring on the 12
millimeter is not holding the tube but
the o-ring on the 13 millimeter holds
that tube nicely so if we were to try
and put this together
with the improper materials well that
would be a bad day for your computer
because it's going to get wet
so I'm going to crank this bad boy down
it is threaded all the way down as you
can see it doesn't stay so it's
important to make sure you just measure
to outer diameter rigid tubing 12
millimeter or 13 millimeter now let's go
and talk about the different fittings to
get things looking nice in your system
one of the most common things I'm asked
especially with the skunkworks build log
is how I passed the fittings through the
floor of my case well I use this guy
right here and these are called bulkhead
fittings or pass-through fittings now
basically all this is single piece of
metal that has a lot of threads that's
drilled all the way through and threaded
with GQ 1/4 thread so that you can put
fittings on either side of that and then
it's got a threaded outside here with a
collar so all you do is you drill a hole
in the floor of whatever you want to
pass through that matches the outer
diameter of this slide that through put
the locking collar on there and then
this will be sitting in the floor or the
wall or whatever and it's threaded so
all you have to do then is take your
fittings slide your fittings into place
and then just like anything else you put
your tubing on it and then you can pass
through whatever it is you're trying to
pass through so it's just called a
bulkhead or a pass through fitting and
you can use that to pass through
anything the wall the back of your case
the floor of your case the you know
ceiling whatever you want to do now when
it comes to rigid tubing you have two
options when it comes to bending it you
heat it and bend it like you've seen me
doing all my build blogs or you can get
these 90 degree bends you've got 45
degree bends like this guy here and then
you've also got these well there are 90
Bend that has compression fittings
already built into it so this is
actually a more cost-effective way of
doing the bends if you're not going to
heat and Bend because the fittings are
already built into the fitting and this
is one of the things that bits power has
been doing is adding a lot more custom
fittings like this so that it doesn't
get expensive we have two by two
compressions for either side or one for
either side and then have the 90 like
this guy here see how this guy only has
the threads
this already has the compression built
into it so then all you do is you take
your tube and you know you put it
through and then you can do your bends
like this this is the way that all the
bends were done on the parvum build and
that's why the Parvin builds water
cooling setup was stupidly expensive
because I think there was something like
33 fittings in that in that build so
that really is a quick way of adding
cost to your system now the cool thing
too about a lot of these 90s especially
with these dual rotaries is the fact
that they can rotate so I'm gonna put
two of these chrome ones together here
just to kind of actually they're nickel
plated but just to kind of demonstrate
that these can bend and rotate in two
different positions so if you put
together a series of these you can know
you can come up with some pretty crazy
stuff some people have even done entire
systems where the entire loop is done in
fittings and not tubing and that can get
very very expensive but people have
definitely done it now the last thing I
want to talk about here is how I do the
drain system because a lot of people
have asked how I do the standalone drain
system and the way I typically do that
is I'll get a drain valve and all this
is is a ball check valve that's all it
is where in fact this one's stiff there
we go when it's open like this water can
flow through it when you close that T
valve it closes a little ball in there
has nylon seals and then water can't
flow through it so what I do is I'll
take something like this guy here which
is a it's just a multi fitting valve
here where it's got an inlet so that's
where it'd be coming in from the pump or
something like that and you've got all
these different options here for outlets
and what I'll typically do is I will
just take something like this which is a
double-ended male fitting slide it into
slide screw it I'm going to screw this
video and screw the hell out of this
fitting and then attach my valve so
let's say this end is coming out of the
pump that end is going to you know maybe
a piece of tube or maybe I even just put
a little plug on there and use that
specifically for my drain and then we
can have you know the other side going
off too you know
ever the graphics card of the CPU etc
etc so this guy is going off and doing
his own thing and then we just plug up
the other ones and then there we go now
the way I actually do my drains is I'll
have the plug or I'll have the valve
just sitting here plugged off with the
valve closed so that fluid can't go
through it
that way when I take off the plug
nothing comes out and then when I'm
ready to drain I'll take an extra piece
of tube like this with a fitting on the
end undo that plug screw this guy on and
then I can have this going into a bottle
or something like that and then when I
open up this little valve then
everything just flows out into the
bottle or whatever that I want when I'm
done I close off the valve and then I
can just unscrew my my drain plug or my
drain tube here put the cap back on and
we're done so that's the way that I do
my drains the hard part is finding the
right place to put this in your system
this needs to be at the lowest point of
your system otherwise you're not going
to get it to drain properly it's also
helpful if you have a radiator with
multiple fittings or reservoir that has
multiple fittings on the top so that you
can unplug a fitting at the top so air
can come in to push down the fluid
otherwise it takes a long time to drain
so that's the way that I do my drain
fittings so there we go guys that's it
that's the way that I do fittings I
don't really use anything more than what
you see right here even though there's
700 something different types of
fittings on the market but you know
there's custom fittings for everything
every need and no matter what you always
would have the right fitting you just
have to kind of think ahead plan ahead
and determine okay take you can take a
picture of your system and get down
there with Photoshop or you know windows
paint or whatever and just kind of draw
lines where you think the tubes would go
and everywhere there's a been determined
am I going to bend the tube I might have
to I have soft tubing or am I going to
use a fitting like this and every time
you do that you can then determine okay
we need a 90 here we need a 90 here we
need a 45 here and then you kind of get
an idea of how many fittings that you
need it's always a good idea to order a
couple more than you think you need and
have them as spares which may sound cost
ineffective but the reality is that you
are going to likely need more than you
think you do it's good thing to have it
just in case so I hope this has helped
explain a little bit more when it comes
to fittings this is by no means an
in-depth all all
fitting Skype but it are it is talking
more about the things that I use how I
use them and just some of the conceptual
ideas that I do or I use when I build my
systems so there we go guys
JS to sense hope this has helped that's
why I do these videos I want them to
help strengthen that community
especially the water-cooling community
and that's pretty much it so thanks for
watching guys we'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
