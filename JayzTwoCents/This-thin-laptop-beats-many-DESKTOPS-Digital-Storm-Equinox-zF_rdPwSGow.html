laptops are usually one of those love it
or hate it type of categories but you
know given the fact that computers are
getting more powerful and less power
draw and power demanding it's no
surprise that we are seeing a whole
bunch of new laptops especially with
coffee lake so we're gonna be kicking
this off right here by well our series
of gaming laptops coming up here by
starting with the digital storm 15.6
inch Equinox gaming laptop it's thin its
lightweight but more importantly is it
powerful we're gonna find out do you
want to be cooler you want to be more
desirable well you're in luck because
right now you can own your very own Jace
to send swag and immediately be the cool
kid on the block max out your sex appeal
by following the link down below its
with the launch of Coffee Lake late last
year meant that we obviously had new
mobile platforms coming and this is our
first one we're taking a look at here in
the studio the equinox s89 55 this is a
15.6 inch IPS 1080p gaming slash
productivity laptop what I love about
this is you can see it is a very
minimalist design you have a very sleek
digital storm logo a matte black cover
with some silver accents back here on
the hinge nothing gaudy no LEDs
everywhere no bright red or orange or
colors to be like hey I'm a gamer but on
the back you can see we've got a massive
amount of cooling and ventilation
because this is also a 1070 max-q Nvidia
discreet graphics card in here so that
means it has a very strict criteria of
both acoustics and thermals that have to
be maintained if you guys have used any
small form factor or a thin laptops
before you know you usually sacrifice
connectivity but not the case here you
have our charger port right here which
uses our 150 watt charger brick this is
also thin and lightweight you can carry
this in a backpack it's not going to
weigh you down a full size HDMI 2.0
which is going to give you a HD r10
capability so you can connect it to an
external HD RS or TVs and get that
playback too many display ports right
here and two USB type-c and then to us
the 3.0 and moving to the other side you
got another USB 3.0 a headphone and
microphone jack and a full-size SD card
reader which is perfect because if
you're using this for content creation
video editing on-the-go which I will be
at Computex this is important of course
we have our Ethernet jack right here
with this little fold down door keeps it
nice and sleek and kind of out of the
way when you're not using it once you
open it up though we are going to expose
the best part of this laptop which is
the 15.6 inch 144 Hertz 1080p IPS 5
millisecond panel and the fact that this
IPS makes it perfect because of color
accuracy and color recreation when it
comes to video editing or picture
editing but the 5 millisecond 144 Hertz
1080p make it also a good mix for gaming
we've got our membrane keyboard right
here it is full RGB backlit customizable
backlit via software that's built into
the unit got our speakers right here
which are up fire in front of the
monitor our trackpad is placed off
center to the left a little bit that's
fine with me it has a fingerprint reader
on there though which shows you that
they're taking security in mind I've not
personally set up the fingerprint reader
but it's here on the trackpad and then
of course we've got our left click right
click buttons which I do feel is a
little bit spongy but they're also not
easy to bump why are you using the
trackpad and before we get into
performance here though I'm going to go
ahead and crack this one open because
upgradability is something that's
important when it comes to laptops this
particular model comes with a 500
gigabyte samsung 960 Evo nvme SSD which
I think's a little bit lacking so I'm
gonna personally expand this to one
terabyte not today but I'm gonna do it
before Computex and it has 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 that's and they need to be
upgraded to 32 gigs for me as well but I
also want to take a look at what's going
on with cooling in there so that's what
we're gonna do next
alright we're gonna crack this apart I'm
gonna be using my eye fix-it kit to do
this I know this seems like an advert
but it's not actually bought these so if
you guys are curious about the tools I'm
using and you want these also for
yourself
there will be a link into the
description of an amazon link where you
can go and check them out every single
teardown I do pretty much I use this kit
for actually I think my wife got it from
for my birthday last year so there's
that good old wifey I have not taken
this apart before so I guess if I break
it at least I already did my benchmarks
Wow
so this is actually using Corsair
Vengeance ddr4 in here Oh check this out
we can actually put a three and a half
inch or two and a half inch right here
that's perfect so I'm not even gonna
bother taking this out now I'm actually
gonna stick in an SSD right now so you
can't expand this with this you can do a
two and a half inch drive or there'll be
a hard drive or an SSD but it does look
like we only have room for two sodium
sticks right here now I didn't under in
this so do as I say not as I do
this is the hold down here just with one
screw this is such a delicate like
ribbon cable we've now expanded another
500 gigabytes and that's it so we just
put it back together in reverse order
make sure it's all snapped into its
place so I figured we start things off
here with the performance test with an
actual boot timer so I just pushed the
power button and we can fill put a
little timer up on the screen in post
there would you because I'm bad at
counting but it's 960 Evo nvme SSD so as
you can see it boots up pretty quickly
yeah not bad at all so here's we're
gonna do I went ahead and did a gambit
of benchmarks on this I spent about
eight hours going through testing
various games on this is it is a ten
seventy max Q with eight gigabytes of
gddr5 and we do have of course the eye
78750 h6 core 12 thread cpu so let's see
how it performs
so what you're looking at here is the
control center 2.0 this is kind of like
their little well I guess control center
for the laptop I don't see myself really
using this over time like you can see
the fan profile for the GPU is on the
left side CPU temperatures and fan
profile on the right side and what I
think is kind of interesting here is
it's got an automatic setting which I
guess you give an offset to the fan
curve which is interesting the maximum
speed the max Q and then the custom you
can make your own fan curve this appears
to be a button that does nothing
whatever let's go and start with CPU
temperatures shall we we're using crap
which is close to a massage we are using
MSI Afterburner though to actually
monitor the CPU temperatures because
when you use the control center for the
temperature reading and then you start
something like Cinebench which loads the
CPU this stops updating now you guys
already solved my Cinebench score was
what we're looking for here our
temperatures so when I click run they
immediately shoot up into the 70s upper
70s when this becomes a little bit more
heat soaked it will reach 90 91 ish 86
85 88 so it definitely gets warm but not
too warm I mean laptops are designed to
run warmer they truly are and what we
saw was not a huge drop-off in terms of
thermal throttling our highest score was
a 1095 this score right here was a 1064
we have been doing some gaming and stuff
on here right now so the temperatures
are a bit warmer we also have msi
afterburner running a few other programs
running in the background but our max
temperatures we looks like we hit 91 and
a couple cores so i'm gonna have msi
afterburner up because i want to see
what kind of over clocks we can actually
get with this unit I'll be using heaven
to test this only because it's a bit
consistent but because of the max-q
nature of
thermal and power draw and temperatures
even though we have a button available
to us and a slider that we can utilize
an MSI Afterburner it does take effect
but the thing is once the temperatures
reach about 55 C we start to see a
reduction in core clock in order to keep
from breaking out of that max-q setting
that is basically hard controlled by
Nvidia so let's go ahead and do a plus
100 on the core clock we can see what
happens to our core speed right here and
it jumped up into the 1600s but watch
now that where temperature is gonna go
up right here 57 c 58 c this is starting
to come back down towards the 1300s as
this hits 60 this will drop back down
into the 13s periodically and a lot of
our overclock see there's our 13s again
is being negated because this
temperature is going up but if you look
at our FPS right here for heaven with
high bent or high settings and
tessellation is on and 2x msaa
this FPS is actually pretty damn good in
the 90s and up into the hundreds but
what about an actual game okay so here
we are in doom undoubtedly one of the
most fun replay value games in terms of
graphical fatica graphical graphical
yeah graphical quality but what I want
to point out here real quick is we do
have MSI Afterburner hooks to Vulcan
which is showing 289 290 FPS which is
exactly double what the actual in-game
FPS counter is showing so I think we
should ignore the Vulcan counter here
and go with the in-game here we're gonna
be running the highest settings possible
to start because doom does not require a
crap ton of hardware to run really well
we are set to Vulcan custom because
everything is on ultra with nightmare
applied where applicable so as you can
see we are currently well over 100 fps
and 1080p Ultra Plus nightmare in Doom
where are you at where there we go I
mean 100 and 200 FPS there for a second
I mean grant we're in the Titans lair I
mean it's not really rendering like a
huge world right these guys like ow ow
ow ow ow oh yeah I think a lot of people
would agree that Doom has one of the
best soundtracks
the one thing that's kind of lacking on
this laptop honestly is speaker quality
I mean I think they did an okay job
considering this size at which you have
to work with but I think a lot of gamers
at the same time and I'm not answering
for all gamers but I think most people
would play with headphones anyway yeah I
think there's no doubt that this thing
can game and look at the GPU temperature
it still runs cooler than a Founders
Edition desktop card while gaming flat
on the table alright some final thoughts
here on the digital storm equinox the
15.6 inch form factor to me is the
perfect sweet spot 17-inch has always
been a little bit large to try and fit
in a backpack especially if it's a
thicker laptop and then 13-inch it's
perfect size for on the go but it can't
play games so I feel like this is the
perfect sweet spot I'm still in love
with its minimalistic design when it
comes to laptops I am a huge fan of less
is more in terms of just how sleek it
looks but the level of performance that
this has the gaming capability the CPU
performance on this on top of it the
acoustics and the temperatures on this
are fantastic now all of the testing
that I did was just sitting on a flat
surface like this which most people
would use it if you're going to be using
it on your lap I don't recommend doing
that because you will plug up a lot of
the vents on the bottom obviously using
it on a bed or something keep that in
mind you're going to want this on a flat
surface it does not pull in much air
from the sides that would have been I
think one improvement in terms of
cooling is that it could have done more
side Inlet the keyboard is nice to type
on the keyboards nice to play on I
didn't find myself accidentally clicking
on things or moving the trackpad around
with my wrist which is often a problem
with very sensitive track pads but this
one seems to be just right in terms of
sensitivity here's the bottom line good
gaming laptops make good productivity
laptops the amount of GPU offloading
that's taking place now and a lot of
modern software in terms of business
solutions means that anything with a
discrete GPU is going to give you a good
performance now I didn't do battery life
testing on this because my main focus on
this was going to be content creation
and/or gaming which is something you're
always gonna want to use on plug power
AC power because that's going to give
you the max performance now there's a
couple of things I would've liked to
have seen let's think of what it looks
leaker if they could have gotten a more
edge-to-edge panel in this you can see
the bottom here does have a bit of
Lexx in there but when you're not
touching and pushing that and you're
just opening closing the lid it's pretty
rigid in fact one thing I want to show
here real quick they've got the actual
tension and the hinge just right and
when you open it it tilts back you can
see that hinge is just right I hate when
I go to open a lid and the whole thing
flips back on me
one other thing I'm not a huge fan of is
the way the matte black attracts
fingerprints the moment you consider
touching it
a fingerprint pops up get me a mint
touch - yeah it's just really efficient
at it they show up before you even touch
it but guys that has been my first look
here at the new 8th gen intel 6 core
laptop CPUs you guys tell me what you
think I think digital storm has done a
great job at minimalistic but high
performance and at a price point that I
think makes sense it's just under two
thousand US dollars as tested I would
have liked to have seen larger hard
drive capacity and memory capacity at
that price point but given how easy this
actually upgrade this I don't think
that's too much of a problem but what's
more important than my opinion is yours
so guys sound off in the comments below
let me know what you think about this if
you got any other laptops you think I
should take a look at then make sure to
sound off down there as well or head on
over to Twitter and hit me up there at
JS T sense again guys thanks for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
