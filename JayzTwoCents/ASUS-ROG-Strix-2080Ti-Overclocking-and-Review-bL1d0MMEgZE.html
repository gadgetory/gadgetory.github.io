with our MSI gaming extra cards 220 atti
sli cards with custom PCBs and an air
conditioning hooked up to it and we took
three world records while we wait for
the real overclockers to get there Ln
two setups and their cards up and
running but we're gonna go ahead and
show what us regular guys are able to
get our hands on and how far our custom
PCBs can actually go
we did that with MSI now we're gonna
take a look at the asus strix cards a
very popular brand that very that most
people are familiar with it's ready to
see what the thermals are like with the
overclocking is like the acoustics and
of course see what kind of single card
scores we get so with that let's unbox
it not this one though this one didn't
come in a box that one did it's we're an
open now today's video is sponsored by
North Vee PN a company I'm very
passionate about and have been using for
several years now VPN stands for virtual
private network it keeps your data
online encrypted and secure now you
wouldn't send an important package like
this our TX graphics card in a clear box
would you heck no because it's
guaranteed to not make it where you want
it to go or at least everyone's gonna
know what it is on the way the same can
be said for your data an order VPN not
only works on your desktop browsers and
of course your desktop but they also
have mobile apps to keep your devices
like your phones in your tablet secure
while you are on the go north VPN has
thousands of servers in over 61
different countries meaning regardless
of where you are you can start taking
your internet security seriously today

I like that I appreciate this box though
because it's a more standard sized box
for some of the other guys have come out
with like the biggest boxes they could I
think for that shelf presence when
you're in Micro Center looking around
you're like God that one's big that one
got my attention that's what she said
so here's what you get right here nice
soft foam and installation saw your
driver's and stuff right here right a CD
why guys come on thumb drives are cheap
enough just don't even include anything
velcro strap card nothing under the card
okay so no support bracket or anything
like that which the previous Strix
models came with so I guess we won't be
testing sag though because we're using
my open air test bench on this alright
so here it is the Strix 2080 ti with its
nice brushed back plates there we go
that has been handled now it is a dual
BIOS card but the only thing that really
changes with the BIOS which is the fan
curve it doesn't change things like the
power limit it doesn't increase the
power limit it doesn't increase the
voltage it's just a fan curve thing
which I guess makes it kind of nice if
for some reason you had to reflash the
BIOS or something corrupt so you have
another BIOS ready to go but I've never
really had that happen before I've only
had BIOS corrupt because I corrupted
them by trying to flash them with
something custom but that's besides the
point we had this new button right here
this is a power led on/off button so you
can long press that to turn the lights
on or off quickly without having to load
up I guess your your Asus tweak software
which is kind of interesting because I
mean most people have a case it's not
like you can just reach in and turn it
on and off you take your side panel off
so we've got three fans just like the
previous Strix card these are high
static pressure fans though you can see
how it's not just blades it actually has
a ring around the outside of the blades
that connect all of the blades so the
air can't splash off the side it gets
forced through the blade down through
the fan into the heatsink now you can
see that the heatsink runs the full
length of the card the only gap we have
right here is in the middle fan we can
see where the heat pipes actually are
other than that that there is a very
major use of thinner II that's we're
gonna dip we're gonna have it thinner
it's called thinner II
but I can see we got one two three four
five vapor chamber heat pipes in this
they also stuck with the stock dual
eight pin PCI Express power connector
where you can work are we looked at the
MSI trio had two eight pins and a six
pin so I'm curious to see what this does
in terms of power draw on what the power
limit is on this because it does look
like we're sticking with the stock at
least current on this in typical Strix
fashion we also have an RGB header on
the back okay this is really interesting
actually so this is a twenty eighty and
I think this might be an engineering
sample like I said didn't come with a
box or anything the twenty eighty as you
can see has the RGB header and two fan
headers that way you could actually
connect things like your intake fans on
your case or something to the card that
way when the card would ramp up and pull
more you know fan rpm it would also
increase your case fans who supply as
much air to the card as it needs
interestingly enough though the twenty
atti
does not have that you can actually see
where they would be but they're blank so
that's really curious I wonder why they
did that and I will say that the twenty
eighty is also running a dual eight pin
and not the eight pin and six pin so
yeah okay so as you can see with the
heatsink though it's very thick this is
a two and a half maybe a two point seven
five slot card this is the power
delivery or the vrm so you can see there
are heat pads on that connecting it
directly to the fin stack I don't think
there's a heat pipe going through there
not that I can see and of course you can
see that all of your RAM chips are
touching the cooler as well and
obviously the die itself so it's going
to get this on the test bench and see
exactly what kind of results we get with
this I'm curious to see if we can't go
higher than around the 2100 mark which
seems to be kind of a hard wall for many
cards at least maintaining that core
speed because as we showed in our
original founders edition review power
limit has been the limit on how far
these cards can go
so the Strix card now has been running
for 15 minutes or so yes it is in an
open-air test bench once again I say
this in every video we test open air
that way we know what the coolers limits
are not what the case is interfering
with so your results will vary now we
are running the P mode or the
performance mode on the bios which which
is just a little bit more aggressive fan
curve because it's an overclocking card
we also are running on OC mode in ASA
software which is the OC tweak too so
yeah I also want to show if this LED
button does right here so you see how
the LEDs are just sort of glowing red
because that's their color I guess if
you hold it you can see that the lights
turn off and then if you push it again
the lights turn back on I mean it's a
neat thing but are you gonna take your
site side panel off every time you want
to push that no probably not
alright so let's see where our
temperatures are stuff have balanced out
now we're using 1440p max settings on
heaven because although this is an older
benchmark heaven still puts a lot of
heat into the system we use it to test
our temperatures and I've also found
that heaven is some of the most at least
personally for me heaven has been some
of the most picky when it comes to
overclocks looks like we've been sitting
and bouncing around the 1860 to 1845
range right now it's at 1890 so that's
kind of a high and low we did wrap all
the way up to nineteen hundred and
eighty when it first started but of
course that's when the temperatures were
nice and cool now because we're an OC
mode the Strix has automatically a plus
10 on the power limit so it's actually
at plus 110 now if we take a look to at
our core GPU boost it only adds plus 15
and then the memory and stuff all stays
the same so we're going to do right now
is we are gonna go ahead and max out
this slider to 125 we're gonna hit apply
on that and we're gonna see what happens
to our core clock you can see
immediately jumped up into the 19:20
19:30 it's at 1905 right now back up to
1920 and i'm gonna give it a little bit
more fan speed too I think so the
settings that kind of landed on is plus
155 on the core plus 0 on the voltage we
know this is
the slider is questionable at what it
really does I mean they say voltage
overhead but it didn't change at all on
my testing when I tested it plus 900 it
says plus 1800s really plus 900 on the
memory merits 900 times 2 because double
data rate Asus just shows it in the
actual effective frequency fans are at a
hundred I didn't notice any power draw
changes by dropping these so these fans
are fairly efficient they're probably
not pulling enough wattage to make any
difference to the total TDP in this
because this is like 330 watts I think
when it's fully overclocked to the plus
125 or plus 25 for a 125 power limit and
are everything else is just kind of left
external fans beat so this is where you
would actually control the external fans
if it had any it seems to think that
there's fan headers on the card which
don't actually exist so interesting you
can see now we're sitting around 2040
2010 it's bouncing around it did spike
220 115 for a minute that's where it
would go to if we weren't hitting power
limit but unfortunately as you can see
down here as is the our TX 2080 standard
we are just hitting the power wall
before we ever hit our core limit so
that's a little bit unfortunate and then
our GPU temperature right now is sitting
in the mid 50s 55 56 because the fans
are at a hundred percent so we're gonna
do right now is I'm gonna go ahead and
compare this in 3d mark x by extreme so
the 75 54 that was with my msi card and
that beat my previous 7507 so that was
what I was kind of comparing to with the
Asus card but unfortunately after
several tests we just weren't able to
get the core speeds as high so the first
test was a 73-68 adjusted settings a
little bit got it up to a 74 29 then the
last test I ran we got is 74 47 and then
past that we just kept crashing and
crashing now this comes down obviously
all the way to Silicon Lottery and this
is performing much better than even the
founders Edition card that we were given
because that card was hitting power
limits even sooner so let's go and have
some final thoughts about the Strix card
all right so the Asus Strix is pretty
much giving you what you would expect a
card that is giving you better cooling
better well not so much better acoustics
to be honest the fans on this I found
once
around that 80% or above they sound very
choppy it's the best way to describe it
so the card is sitting here right now at
its default fan curve and the noises
you're actually hearing are like the vrm
fans on the motherboard and the radiator
fans you can't actually hear the GPU but
as soon as we turn the fans to a hundred
percent you'll see what I'm talking
about when I say they have a little bit
of a choppiness to them instead of being
a real consistent woosh it's kind of Oh
at least that's what I hear whether the
mic here is it I don't know so it goes
one of those things where when it comes
this is gonna be just like Pascal the
card that you should buy quite honestly
is going to depend on the aesthetics
these are all gonna probably perform
very very close to each other because
they're all gonna hit the same power
limit and when someone does come out
with one that just pushes that power
limit to the extreme you're just gonna
hit core limit right above where the
power limit was that's been our
experience so far anyway any crash that
we've experienced on any of our r-tx
cards has been specifically when it kind
of kicks up to that high number for a
split second before power limit was a
problem that's where the crash happened
every single time but what I love about
the Strix cards is area they are very
minimalistic black IO shield right here
black cooler black fans black everything
black PCB allowing you to with the RGB
included on the you know the lighting
software and being addressable RGB in
here you can set it to whatever color
you want or just leave the modes that
are on there past that guys tell me what
you guys thinks I mean Asus is a brand
that has been around for a long time
they've definitely set the bar high with
their custom designs and this one is no
exception although it didn't take the
leaderboard for our studio here
that's probably coming down just to
Silicon lottery lottery but that just
comes down to the silicon lottery so
guys sound off in the comments below
tell me what card you're interested in
us taking a look at around here we've
got a few more they're still making
their way in custom PCBs are still being
designed by many of the AI bees and
obviously we'll be taking a look at them
as we always do every time there's a new
graphics card so I'm gonna go guys
thanks for watching this review of the
very high level click review of the
GeForce r-tx 2080 ti Strix from Asus and
as always we will see you guys in the
next one
allergies way to burn up tape you have
much money it cost per minute to run
production around here is just something
about the way new electronics smell I
don't care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
