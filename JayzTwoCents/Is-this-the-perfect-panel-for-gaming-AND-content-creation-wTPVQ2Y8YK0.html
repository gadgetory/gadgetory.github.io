two cents here and you guys remember
that video I TS where we talked about
how hard is it to run a qHD panel ultra
wide panel well this is it right here
we're gonna finally talk about this
panel talk about specs talk about color
accuracy and of course gaming
performance because we've reached an
interesting time when it comes to panels
they're becoming affordable or
definitely a lot more affordable than
they were a couple years ago back in the
day you could spend $1200 on a panel
like this but not today and we're gonna
talk about it
of course there's new light loop RGB
fans features 16 independent RGB LEDs
across two separate light loops allowing
users to create unique and custom
lighting effects perfect for both air
cooling as well as radiators the corsair
light loop RGB fans are an excellent
choice for that ultra custom look learn
more by clicking the link below so this
panel is the vast 35 inch wqhd ultra
white panel being offered by mass drop
you guys can find a link down in the
description below mass drop has
sponsored this video so a huge shout out
to them for sending this our way to kind
of take a look at but what makes this
one a little bit unique is the fact that
it is a V a panel now VA is interesting
because it's not a TN and it's not an
IPS but the advertise it's kind of
giving you the best of both worlds
well the TN panel you tend to get very
fast response times very fast refresh
speeds so you could get you know high
refresh rate which is how fast the
picture is able to refresh itself on
screen and the response time is how long
it takes the pixel to go from gray to
white to gray again now the specs on
this are fantastic in fact on the
surface you'd probably think it was a TN
panel just based on the specs because
it's a 100 Hertz refresh rate freesync
panel so AMD GPU owners rejoice oh you
can get your free sync technology with
this panel and it is a two millisecond
graded gray so that is extremely fast
typically IPS panels were not good for
gaming because of the fact that they
were slower at but you know they had
really good color correction and color
accuracy the problem is for gaming that
meant a little bit less vibrant colors
but much more accurate so the colors
didn't pop as much there was a little
bit of ghosting on the screen and so
over time IPS panels have improved as
well but the problem is as I
yes panels got better the price of them
stayed pretty high because now you were
having a gaming performance IPS panel
which is why the other ultra wise that
were on the market were IPS and over
$1000 fact you could easily spend a
thousand dollars today so what makes
this panel already exciting is the fact
that this is five hundred and
ninety-nine dollars on mass drop right
now so this is about half the price that
these debuted at now VA is known for
giving you a much deeper black level and
a much better contrast where IPS tends
to usually be a little bit less contrast
even more true to life that has to do
with the color accuracy of IPs but this
has a 178 degree off viewing access or
access axis I always say access access
access whatever you get I'm trying to
set hopefully but it's 178 degree
viewing angle which means you can look
at it from the sides and not get huge
color shift which is a downside to TN
panels so you can already see that we've
got the color accuracy of 100% RGB or
Adobe RGB color gamut and we've got 178
degree viewing angle with a two
millisecond graded gray and a hundred
megahertz refresh rate so that right
there spells an ultra smooth stutter
free gaming experience without ghosting
on the screen there is nothing more
distracting than ghosting when it comes
to a gaming panel basically that means
as you move your image the read the
pixels cannot change color or brightness
as our redrawing the image fast enough
and so you get the image kind of looking
like it's separating or ghost you kind
of like a dream sequence in a movie it's
very distracting there's nothing gamer
about it in terms of build quality this
is probably one of the most solid panels
I've ever felt it is a full aluminum
bezel so unlike plastic bezels where
typically they'll creak and Bend this
this is metal this is
solid I mean who would do this with a
monitor I just did it's metal it's
deciding to be beat on and let's face I
don't think you should beat on your
panel but I've got kids so things are
bound to hit it at some point so the
full metal construction on this
definitely makes it feel robust the bass
is a very non intrusive
I think it's stylistic it's not the
typical game or panel you'd see with RGB
everywhere and flashy logos and red
bezels or orange bezels or whatever it's
just a very my fingers really hurt right
now from hitting that that hurt a lot if
that tells you anything but this is a
desk or a monitor that you could put on
your desk in your office or in your your
mancave your nerd cave or whatever game
on it looks professional it's not gaudy
and you could build a whole style around
it now the contrast ratio the true
contest I'm doing quotes again the true
contrast ratio is 2500 to one you see
these extremely out-there numbers like
it's 5 million to one I mean that's not
a true you can't have 5,000,000 to 1
contrast ratio on something that is
backlit there is a light turned on back
there so the real contrast ratio on this
is 2500 to 1 which is great now let's
talk about picture quality though I did
notice that there is a little bit of
blotchiness to the screen especially
when it comes to gray gray is one of
those things that's kind of hard for a
panel to give you a perfect uniformed
color black black usually has to do with
light bleed so when when black is being
displayed we just have a black screen
here then what you'll notice is whether
or not there's light bleed in the
corners because remember most of these
panels that are LED LCD are edge lit
where there's the light that goes around
the edge of the panel shining across it
and it's reflecting and that's how
you're getting your backlight but when
it goes black the gates closed on the
LCD and then what happens is you just
get the light being blocked so you would
sometimes see bleed in the corners this
panel is actually pretty good I'm not
noticing any light bleed in the dark
scenes we did notice gray though tends
to have some blotchiness
but it's only noticeable if you're
looking at scenes that are really dark
or they're very solid uniform color like
dark gray you know medium gray black
whatever so that's going to be something
you'll notice more if you're watching
movies and stuff less if you're playing
games games as things are happening so
fast and stuff it's not that noticeable
but if you're watching movies like let's
say the Dark Knight or something like
that where they're always dark scenes
because they're very cinematic and
dramatic then you might notice that a
little bit but when we notice it with
this panel that's a little bit different
than the norm normally you see light
bleed where it's light around the edges
this monitor has a little bit of a
vignette II almost where the edges look
like they have a dark fade to them so
they almost look like they fade the
black on the edges ever so slightly now
we've used this panel to edit last
couple of videos the color accuracy on
it seems pretty good so we bring up the
Vectra scopes when we look at color we
we noticed it doesn't seem to be too out
of whack but you want to be careful
though with VA though with it being a
little bit more contrasting a little bit
more punchy with color because you could
find yourself under saturating a little
bit because the panel has a little bit
of natural over saturation versus like a
straight-up IPS panel so that's
something worth keeping in mind so it
has some pretty sweet built-in picture
profiles for things like movies games
fps what's cool about the fps is it
actually reduces the contrast and brings
up the darks that way you're not that
guy that got killed by the guy in the
shadow that was right in front of you
because you didn't see him aka me
anytime I play any game especially
insurgency I die a lot from shadows but
the FPS mode will reduce the contrast
and bring up the low lights that way you
can easily see things in shadows it's
got a built-in crosshair so if you want
to I guess technically cheat if you want
to like you know 360 noscope bro then
you can just bring up the crosshairs on
the screen it's got audio pass through
so it'll pick up audio through the the
DisplayPort or HDMI and you can plug in
your headphones directly to the monitor
it has one HDMI 2.0 two HDMI 1.4 and a
display port so you can have multiple
things hooked up to this your consoles
whatever else multiple sources DVD
players and of course if it's something
that's not 21 by 9 aspect ratio then it
will just black bar on the side one
thing that's kind of nice about this
panel though and given the fact that it
has so much screen real estate is it
does have hip or picture-in-picture so
you can have one of those other HDMI
sources displaying on the screen at the
same time so we've got another streaming
PC or something like that you could
actually have a small window in the
corner showing that PC and you know care
to keep tabs on that without having to
have a separate screen obviously picture
and picture has multiple uses on that
but it's kind of nice too
something like this so I feel like the
value that you're getting for this panel
for five hundred nine dollars is hard to
compete with so you're getting the speed
and the color of VA so you're kind of
getting the speed of TN and the IPS
color accuracy kind of melded into one
at the VA panel you're getting this
super solid construction adjustable base
so of course it can rotate you can
adjust the height you can rotate this
some sort of like a development machine
so you can rotate it portrait and keep
an eye on your chat and stuff if you're
you know a streamer or something like
that and of course it's got a very solid
base on here and it has tabs on the back
that you can route your wires through so
as a ton of well-thought-out features on
this panel I do have one complaint
though because nothing ever seems to be
totally perfect and this is something
that I can personally overlook because
the height of the panel doesn't really
bother me our particular unit though is
not maintaining its height there's a
there's a spring in there that's
supposed to be a kind of a counter lever
or counterbalance to hold it in whatever
position you put it in ours
unfortunately will not stay well it
stays at the very top the problem is it
will then want to slam it down but it
will see it won't stay so either stay at
the very top or the very bottom but it
won't stay you guys kept I'm trying to
say they're right I mean it probably
needs a little more tension on that
spring but I couldn't find any where
there where we were supposed to adjust
that but that's the only negative I have
to this I mean you get freesync hundred
Hertz two millisecond response time
color accuracy of VA and the response
time of a TN panel you even get on
screen display SD fake crosshairs all
kinds of stuff
no you guys tell me I think this is a
panel that is definitely worth taking a
look at so the link is in the
description below check it out we'll be
using it in fact people in the studio
I've already been calling dibs on it
fills the first one I got to use it for
content creation Nick's already shopping
for one now he wants one it's too bad
I'm probably taking at home guys
all right guys bring it out here thanks
for watching let me know what you
thought about this panel if you use any
of their panels we should check out make
sure you put it in the comments below
and as always we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
