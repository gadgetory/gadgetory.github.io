skunkworks
it is possible to bottleneck this whole
computer the entire thing most people
get caught up on graphics cards being
bottleneck by the CPU but they never
stop to think they can bottleneck their
entire computer by hooking up to a panel
that sucks I don't think these panels
actually suck I'm just pointing to the
panel visual aid expensive visual aid
but one nonetheless water cooling parts
for skunk works were provided by
performance pcs for the largest online
selection of PC modding and water
cooling parts head to performance pcs
comm there's a lot of information to
cover here today I don't want to bore
you with some information that I think
is irrelevant to the high level
understanding of how monitors work but I
would do the best I can the problem is
I've really started nerding out over
panels over the last couple of years and
I get very passionate and into this and
I can talk about things that are just
not important like I'm kind of doing
right now today I'm talking to the gamer
there are panels out there designed
specifically for content creators and
professionals with IPS panels and srgb
gama and stuff like that but that's not
the point of today's video i'm talking
to the guy who's built himself his first
gaming computer and he's like well crap
those are the things I need like a
monitor and keyboard and all that stuff
but I don't know which monitor to get
this is way more confusing the building
out the parts for my computer because
how do I know that this panel I'm
getting isn't going to suck hopefully by
the end of today's video you'll you'd be
able to tell which ones are going to be
good and which ones are not going to be
good just by reading some of the basic
specs now there's two major specs we're
going to talk about today and one of
them gets kind of confusing because it
has several names as are associated for
the same thing the first one being
refresh rate refresh rate that is the
number of times the panel can draw an
image per second and keep it stitched
together now a panel can actually draw
more FPS than what's actually rated but
what happens is you take that image and
you divide it more than America
currently is and you get what's called
screen tearing that's where the image
cannot be refreshed fast enough and
since the image is drawn in layers it's
drawn in layers like that ladies what
happens is the image goes live it gets
all messed up and it doesn't stay in
sync anymore which lead which has led to
the development of the technology called
vsync you ever wondered that stands for
vertical sync it means make sure all
those images are aligned down the
vertical so that they don't do that so
you can actually spend more
yes to your panel but you get a very
unpleasant gaming experience depending
on how far beyond that refresh rate is
so taking something like skunkworks here
with two Titan X Pascal's on water and
putting on a 60 FPS panel and turning
off vsync would be a virtually
unplayable gaming experience now the
reason why I say that figure can
sometimes get confusing to people who
are not used to looking up this kind of
stuff for for the first time or starting
to research panels and what all this
means is you'll hear it referred to as
several things refresh rate you will
hear it referred to as the Hertz rate
and you will hear it referred to as the
frames per second it just basically says
the number of times per second that
image can be drawn on the screen so if
it's a 60 Hertz panel it means you can
draw the image 60 times per second
without tearing apart never since the
introduction of TN panels you pretty
much have seen 60 FPS panels B what is
the minimum standard for gamers these
days 30 fps doesn't cut it for most PC
gamers and you know that so you want to
strive for a panel that's at least 60
fps
now the other number that plays into
this is called response time okay so
you've got you've got your frames per
second that can be drawn and you've got
your response time well what does that
mean well refresh rate as I said is the
number of times the image can actually
be drawn by the processing board inside
the panel to display the image over and
over and over and over and over again as
the image is changing when you're doing
games or movie or even just moving your
mouse that Mouse has to be drawn
wherever it's being told to go but
response time refers to the actual
pixels in the display and how long it
takes that pixel to go from off to on or
white and off again it's actually
referred to great a gray or g2g that's
the number you'll tend to see in the
spec chart now the lower that number the
better because what that means is that
light is turning on and off super fast a
quick analogy I can give you here that
you might understand is the difference
of an LED flashlight versus one with a
standard filament or a halogen
flashlight where you turn on the LED
flashlight and it's instantaneous it is
instantaneous light there is no heating
of the filament where it takes time to
turn on and kind of like pop in there
sort of like just fade in and we turn it
off the filament cool so it fades out
think of like a blinker on a car when
it's like blink blink blink blink
but then there's newer cars with LEDs
and it's just
like link like bleep Lee yeah someone
meme that do me a favor meme it go so
the same can be said for the pixel
technology inside of your panel where
the faster it turns on and off the less
motion blur you're going to get of the
panel there is natural motion blur that
happens on panels and that's referred to
as response time now the slower the
response time or the higher that number
is the more fading there is between the
movement of the panel and the redrawing
of images because it's taking the lights
time to turn on and off and change color
for the pixel gates to do their thing so
we're going to go back to the Hertz
rating here for a second 60 FPS versus
144 the most common argument you're
going to hear a million times regardless
of where you go the forums or steam or
the internet or YouTube is the argument
of the human eye can only see blah blah
blah FPS now why do I say a bla bla bla
FPS is because there's no standard
number that anyone's able to actually
been able to confirm the human eye can
see now that just triggered something
because I'm sure someone out there is
like no so-and-so said that the human
eye can only see kabab habla and he's an
optometrist or whatever it doesn't
matter because this is one of those
subjective things just like audio
certain people hear certain tones and
they may be responsible responsive and
reactive to certain tones and others the
same can be said for the human eye it's
a very integral piece of technology in
your face that does amazing things that
I think as humans we still don't fully
understand take a 60 FPS panel and take
144 FPS panel put them next to each
other displaying the same thing and tell
me you don't see a difference and I'll
call you crazy
okay so fair warning this next section
here if you have epilepsy is that I
believe it's called epilepsy where
flashing lights can trigger a epileptic
seizure you might want to turn away
because what I'm going to show right now
is probably going to look like a
flickering image and I really don't want
to cause you any undue stress so with
that warning out of the way
here is what 60 FPS looks like on a
high-speed camera we're talking 240 FPS
on the camera which is much higher than
the refresh rate of the panel but this
is what 60 FPS looks like now if we
switch this over to 144 FPS this is what
it looks
so there is a draw difference in a very
noticeable speed difference of the panel
so now that we've got that visual aid
out of the way here is what 60 FPS looks
like on a quote-unquote 1 millisecond
response time the reason why I say
quote-unquote is because most people who
measure gaming monitors with the actual
true calibration tools and measurement
tools to see the true response times
have found that a lot of times 1
millisecond gaming panels are really
more like 3 or 4 not a true 1
millisecond so that's why I say quote
unquote but anyway here is what 60 FPS
looks like on a 60 FPS panel with a 1
millisecond response time as you can see
there's not a lot of fading of the pixel
but what happens when you take a 60 FPS
panel and couple it with a slow response
time or a light that takes a while to
turn on and turn off well you get what
you see right here which is quite a bit
of motion blur motion blur is very
cinematic motion blur is all around us
turn your head right now I guarantee
your image just blurred every time you
watch TV the image is blurring you go to
the movies the image is blurring but
it's natural unfortunately when you have
motion blur introduced in terms of
hardware level like this it is very
distracting and in some games that
require fast movement the faster you
move that Mouse the more the pixels are
going to blur unfortunately it makes
some games like Battlefield 1 or TWiT
shooters counter-strike go completely
unplayable so that's what 60 FPS on a
slow response time looks like but those
two numbers are really the only thing
that gamers should concern themselves
with when it comes to buying a panel
sure there's other things like IPS
versus TN off viewing angles those
curved monitors 21 by 9 ultra wide like
you see here with the X 30 for predator
behind me 16 by 9 24 inch 30 for Android
those things are all secondary to the
two specs I just told you about which
are going to have the biggest impact on
your gaming experience so there you go
guys that's how you can unbuttoned neck
your computer by coupling it with a
terrible monitor that would not be
complimenting your system so moral the
story here get a panel that has a
refresh rate that's at least 60 but
hopefully higher than the one that are
the higher than the fps
that your system is able to send to it
now there's other things you talked
about like panel overclocking and
whatnot I don't wanna talk about that
today I haven't spent a lot of time
doing panel overclocking I'll be honest
I've I know how it's done but I don't I
don't do it so that's not something I'm
going to talk about today anyway this is
another one of those topics that came
strictly strictly they came strictly
from my inbox I'm asked all the time
about this topic I finally made this
video and I want to do some more like
this so let me know what you guys want
me to do hit me up Twitter my inbox
Facebook all that sort of stuff and as
always guys share this video with
someone you think it'll help you make
the community smarter as a whole as
always guys stay together be nice to
each other don't don't be jerks to each
other so many jerks in the world when
you'll need that we don't need that
anymore as under co5 the world but i'm
people still call me a dickhole that's
okay though it's alright alright guys
see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
