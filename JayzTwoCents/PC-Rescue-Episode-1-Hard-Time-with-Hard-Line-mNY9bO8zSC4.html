options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description my name is Chris and I'm the
owner of red mist
I just received red mist part two it
kind of inspired me to finally start to
try this on on my own I have a friend
Lindsay and she has a build that also
was put together by Jay with the AMD
water-cooling build she needs an upgrade
she wanted to upgrade to an Intel
platform so I decided this time I want
to do and I might have run into some
problems
all right when we start here show me
what you had in mind all right so what I
did was initially when you had this in
here this was flipped on its side so
write the headings if the fitting here
and the one that's the that screwed into
the res was actually facing that way
okay so you turn this so that you have
an EZ drain right okay and now your
challenges you've got to go from here to
here yes and then you were trying to go
from here to here correct initially
after I had all the hardware I started
practicing bends just that had no
purpose
they were just bends just seeing how how
it felt to bend the to being under heat
and that didn't really cause any issues
the problems I ran into were when I
actually had to start to bend with a
purpose
these tubes needed to start in one area
and in the other and I was having a
tough time measuring without using
really anything other than my eyes and
just trying to make this soft malleable
plastic tubing pretty much work the way
I wanted it to and unfortunately more
times than not it didn't we could also
get this a much sharper 90 foot what did
you do this one here - yeah okay and I
think the thing that people really
underestimate is just how precise these
tubes really have to be when you're
putting them in anyone can take tubing
and bend it but when it has to start
somewhere and end somewhere
and they're facing totally opposite
directions I think people underestimate
just how difficult that could be so
there's a couple things you could do
here it depends on how anal you want
this to be like being an angle going
back or if you wanted to actually put a
like a bend in it so it kind of goes
back and then straight even with the
reservoir that's up to you but obviously
the two hardest bends you have going
here is this one and that one on the
flip side though the nice thing is
there's really no right or wrong way to
doing a build like this they're all
unique because they all have their own
specific imperfections people ask me all
the time to do a bending tutorial and my
response is the same every time they say
it I would be the worst teacher because
I'm literally like just look at the
thing and bend it and put it in it is
much more complicated and much more it's
much more of a talent and almost an
artist in our artistic skill than it is
just bended to put it in a hole and
you're good to go
he watched me do some bends to see
obviously what am i doing and he could
see that I wasn't using all the
techniques I was using some when I was
bending the tube I was kind of afraid so
I ended up bending more of like Mora on
the on the sense that I don't want to
ruin this tube so I'm just gonna let it
do its thing and when I saw Jay bend the
tube I could see him kind of forcing the
tubing to do what he wants it to do
rather than rather than the tubing
telling him what it's gonna do I'd
learned you can be much more creative I
also learned that even the most
experienced PC builders you know can
make a few mistakes all right so I want
to show you something because you talk
about being frustrated with the bends
not being perfect and such right these
are the failed bends on red mist version
- going from the radiator to the CPU
but I keep these scraps does I never
know if I'm gonna need another like like
we could probably just cut one of these
to use on your GPU if we want that
tighter been rather than wasting another
right piece of - I think it would be a
lot less daunting if you look at it with
that approach that it doesn't have to be
perfect it's okay if this 90 is a little
bit wider than this 90 or this isn't
perfectly straight because if you if you
try and get that level of perfection in
these builds you're you're gonna go
insane it's never gonna happen
I think that might have been a first try
see so I'll hang on to this one and I'll
let you try it because we said one more
Bend on this oh yeah right I said one
more Bend that would have to make it in
but that's just
as it breaks well well it's kind of like
Nick showed me this thing where if you
put Slean be honest my heart will go on
to like it makes any scene perfect yeah
I think I got him I don't see me I felt
it oh you probably fell in the box I'm
pretty sure I got him I felt up it's
just you ain't get hard you're not gonna
tear it off take a lot to break the
silicone what and this was you know your
original idea so we'll see an imagined
that would be a chrome fitting so yeah
all the black ones are a mock-up yeah it
requires a lot of patience I had to step
away from it a few times even here
because it can get frustrating when when
it's it's not that it's expensive I mean
yeah you got to buy more tubing but it's
not very expensive it's it's more of a I
just I just used an entire ream of
tubing and I'm nowhere further than
where I started so I'm much more
confident now I'm gonna have to keep up
this practice though because I you know
over time I'm sure if I don't do it I'm
gonna lose it
I need them I need a drink that's where
I do this drink
so that's way off yeah so let's do this
then let me see what I know I'm gonna do
is I throw it down they bounce pretty
far and kick it and that's pretty okay
so that's off when I started this build
i ieave until j i think i want to be
done with all these bends in a day and
after that I'm gonna start the next step
and I believe his response was a laugh
via text it doesn't have to go all the
way against the wall obviously you just
have to line it with that fitting on top
of the reservoir so is that pretty solid
now really pretty so and get this out of
here and that's if you're happy with
that I mean I'm fine okay so what I
would do now then is I would trim some
of this off to get the height proper the
nice thing about the fact that you
haven't locked down the tube yet is if
the height on this isn't perfect you can
fix it here by sliding this up and down
right right you just gotta you got to do
that with I firmly believe that for
anyone who's planning to do a build like
this that a lot of time for just
planning and mistakes is is going to be
is going to be crucial and never give
yourself a time frame where you're going
to cut it short and start to need to
rush that's one the best part about DTG
right is it's so soft
don't worry about it it'll still seal it
doesn't seal inside the fitting it seals
on the o-ring on the collar that's yeah
we're good yeah yeah I think that gives
a little bit of like it has a little bit
of angle to it right yeah it makes
anything else it's not perfectly square
kind of you kind of dance up for it yeah
when there's fluid in there it you'll be
able to see that bend a little bit
better and you'll see that it's gonna
add a little depth to it I think that
looks better in my opinion than what I
had then it just going straight back a
tan on it wasn't parallel in any way at
any point of the tubing right it's all
just parallel at some point then the
bend makes sense but that's kind of the
cool thing with this so right you see
some really cool builds they're very
abstract yeah they're I mean I was
trying I told you I was trying so hard
for everything to be perfect right but
most of the bills I like aren't you know
they have these like things that even I
wouldn't think of to do right I would
try and find sometimes I try and find
the shortest distance between the two
fittings but some folks have have come
up with really cool bends that kind of
make a path around the case to get to
something and it really works and it
really works like Kyle with awesomesauce
wolf bit wit now his build his pink
build I think was phenomenal because he
didn't just take the shortest distance
between a and B he really like filled
out the case with the fluid and the
tubing and fir that being his first
build was absolutely amazing no I was
very impressed cuz obviously that was
his first build hell it was this tendon
still impressive man
yeah with redness there was there were
hangups with parts and such that
everyone knows about but that really
wasn't the biggest hang-ups the the
biggest part is is the what what do I
want to accomplish how am I going to do
it and do I like it I mean unfortunately
with all of us who are enthusiasts of
anything you start to become like I know
I am you're you're extremely anal you're
a perfectionist but by fault and it's
very hard to sometimes accept that
you're not perfect at everything we try
to do one more bin to straighten up that
backbend which I actually don't dislike
I think it's well that's and that's what
makes being off but it kind of gives a
little bit of character to be fair it's
not off it's just everything else is
straight up 90 right and that's like a
15 right
but once the RAM is in there and you
have the power plugs in here yeah and
everything is going Edwards in there
it's gonna look great I think I'll be
alright
so yeah Chris had been texting me while
he was doing this undertaking oh let's
call it an undertaking and yeah he he
had wanted to come here initially to
start it and thought he we could get it
all done in a day and to be fair we
probably could have gotten the whole
thing done in a day since it's not a
scratch build we're using quite a few
parts but I really wanted Chris to
experience this type of build on his own
because I think that that is definitely
what gives someone a level of
appreciation for any sort of trade and
make no doubt about it this is a trade
for sure
to be fair right I've known you for a
few years now yeah you didn't ask me to
do this i straight-up said bring it over
because I could tell you were like super
frustrated yes and if you're anything
like me when frustration reached a
certain level things get broken so I
figured you know yeah like it was last
night right I'm like alright bring it
over tomorrow right yeah
when I got that text I was like I thank
God only because it's not your computer
it's are you doing this for a friend and
like now the law of the longer it takes
you and the more overwhelming it became
the more it's affecting their gaming
time yeah and and and it's also it's
always it's always frustrating when
you're you're trying to be good at
something and during your in a rushed to
learn a skill yeah and and that's how I
fell because this is a skill and you
know I I see how you can eyeball you can
just eyeball a bend and you get it
pretty right on
i eyeball event and it becomes a trash
bent so it's like it's like a mile long
yeah so it's just I mean I spent a few
nights you know so I would wait till it
cooled off and then I would spend an
entire evening wasting tubes well yeah
yeah the feeling of I spent three hours
on this and I'm no farther than where I
started failure after failure after Penn
every time you you you may not be
expensive but every time you waste a
piece of tube you like there was four
bucks down right and and it's just the
fact that I'm not getting any better I'm
I'm I'm making the same mistakes what am
I doing wrong
yeah and so there's kind of the thing
that most people I'm really fortunate to
be in my perspective that where I can do
this all the time as a hobby and a
business both together but most people
are like this is kind of a one-shot
attempt right and I'm doing this and
when it's done I'm just gonna use it and
that's it well hope what I hope you took
away from today was that you know it
patience obviously number one and I'm
guilty of losing it during some of these
bills but that if something starts to
get too hard move on to a different part
of the bill back to it and by way more
to me than you think you need like
double yeah if you think you need six
tubes get twelve it's not that expensive
it's like an extra thirty bucks and it's
worth
no have you like oh crap now I need to
rush order something in I bought an
entire ream of tubing and it is now all
gone I learned that I can do whatever I
want and the only thing that can go
wrong is a bent tube so in the end it's
supposed to be fun it's supposed to be a
passion and it should never be a chore
so I guess try and have fun
laughs don't lose your temper too much
and just know that in the end it's it's
gonna be your little piece of art it's
kind of the whole point of these videos
and these in these series is anyone can
do it and I'm trying to show that to
people so wouldn't folks tell me like
wow that's so awesome you know I bet
that was really hard it's like well you
know it's actually not as hard as you
might think and you can do it too so if
you guys take anything away from these
videos just know that I'm a regular guy
just like you guys and there was the
first time I ever bent tubing and I was
scared I was worried and just like
anyone else I think I had too little
materials because I ended up having to
buy more so yeah that's it and I hope
the fly comes in right on my forehead
I hate this season
I know right this isn't cheese so this
is why everyone should pay me money</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
