actually heading up to Canada but this
is kind of a first for me because in the
last six years I've been doing this my
wife has literally never traveled with
me anywhere and there she is
we are actually leaving the house right
now to go up to Linus tech Expo because
let's face it I'm actually the start
okay so we are in Vancouver technically
we're in Richmond so hey we're gonna
head to the hotel and then we are going
to actually do a little tour of Linus's
studio tomorrow of course I've been
there scrapyard wars and all that stuff
season five I believe a season five we
did champion right here
don't forget and she's never seen the
studio so she's gonna get a look at what
a real YouTube operation looks like when
you grow up you mean when I grow down
because I'm way taller than okay here we
are they have not opened the gate yet -
Lambo is obviously here there is right
there all nice and pink and yeah this is
a much bigger space and I thought was
gonna be so it looks like we have Mini
Putt there's a bunch of different like
PC builds and stuff here obviously has a
bunch of vendors here we've got alpha
cool right over there a company that
obviously I know and it used quite a bit
as a deal how's it feel to have the
camera in your face I've had the camera
in my face
yeah but not as much as everyone else
it's honestly kind of when they're
whelming I feel like well I feel like do
you feel like you read material no I'm I
feel like I'm letting everyone down
already
do they bring this on the wrong side is
there a right side okay so this is
design your own t-shirt win prizes I
think maybe you get to win a Titan X P
or maybe just the box obviously it's not
in their Crayola markers and crayons
yeah I found Luke and so where you
decided that at some point today I have
to try the case toss which is a shot put
overhand style or free-throw so no but
I've done a crap ton of tricep workouts
will see
it looks like Linus is doing some sort
of a V test up there this is main stage
grandstands the the guy himself is up
there and then obviously main stage is
back here behind me but the line again
right now is literally going all the way
around like the entire I want to call a
convention center this is the Olympic
Oval or Richmond Olympic Oval it's
pretty big
but there is over a thousand people in
line already you can't see them because
they were outside that wall and they go
all the way down to the other end of the
building way down there and then like
wrap around it these are the very first
people in line who are obviously the
most dedicated of all fans he did look
that happy though he's just kind of like
I'm here okay so we're at the Alpha cool
area we obviously we got BS mods here
and they have got a hands-on tubing
bending station so you guys can actually
hands-on and feel it's like to binge a
tube and check out some of the hard line
tubing if you want actually made a
spoiler for the Lambo how long does it
you do then a day
two V's two evenings he made this so he
made this spoiler to go on to the Lambo
because apparently what you can do with
the Lambo this year is take advantage of
the glitter paints and sparkles and all
kinds of stuff and decorate the car and
I will tell you firsthand having been
here now with Linus for a couple of days
he drives that thing everywhere that's
his daily driver
okay so we're actually backstage right
now I just spent like the last two hours
signing autographs and taking pictures
with a huge behind that I was not
expecting I did the case toss thing I
don't think we got any video that turned
around and then there was a massive line
of people that wanted to meet me which
is freaking fantastic because I've never
been to an event where literally most of
the people here probably know who I am
and it was just like unexpected and very
different for me
but right now I'm backstage and Linus is
doing something so they're going to poke
the camera through the little hole here
and just sort of troll him a little bit
so let's see how that goes
yeah basically I think he doesn't see us
at all he doesn't care
so lines getting ready to give away a
graphics card right now I have no idea
what kind but obviously everyone is like
losing their minds right now I guess I
don't know
now he's assaulting people attacks
okay so he's getting ready to give away
that graphics card but where he wanted
the question he's been asked is what is
my most viewed video so we had to
confirm which one it was and it was like
I was about to be wrong it's actually a
different video than I thought
I'm on is a good guess though I want to
see jazz hands are not up here
I'm on I want it
[Laughter]
it is not it was until literally like
last week it's not final yet almost
though
would you said that I'll be fair the
number one most viewed video on my
channel was the post Malone turned PC
gamer which was the interview where we
announced our collaboration so that's
why I went ahead and took that answer
also - apparently Alliance Tibet - get
trolled on stage with some unboxing that
he or his wife and his team have come up
with so I have no idea what it is so I
will share that with you
Wow
[Laughter]
alright sounds a little crazy we started
I started at 10 o'clock with the line of
people signing autographs and signing
stuff and talking to people and well
lighting Lighting's bed it's now 406
p.m. and with the exception of when I
jumped up on stage with Linus without
his permission and had some fun there
I've been doing nothing but fan meet and
greets and stuff and it is it is
completely mind-boggling how many people
have expressed their admiration and
appreciation for what I do so if you
were one of those people a huge thank
you and if you're one of the people that
would like to express that you weren't
able to come it's the case tossed
together hearing yeah you guys should
get the throw cases here inside of LTL
TX Expo to see who could throw it
farther but I just want to give a huge
thank you to you guys for watching this
content and making it fun and exciting
and I'm gonna go find some water now
because I literally have the driest
throat and vocal cords ever
alrights je versus Jerry it's a Mini
Putt never be the ball put in its home
oh you're really kind of screwed there I
think I'm in a better spot than you are
on that look at that that I'm here he's
trapped in there
Jay socks oh you're in a better spot
than Jerry use the other get fun death
dragon dragon The Strokes here The
Strokes were playing other ones we're
having I know right so we are literally
doing the prize stuff right now up on
stage I have no idea what he has in
charge for her wants me to do what he
called me up here so I figured we would
film this at least there's a lot of
people here though I think gene is
