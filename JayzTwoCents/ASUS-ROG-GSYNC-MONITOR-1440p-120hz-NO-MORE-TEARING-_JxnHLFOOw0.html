insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys Jason cent CES insider coverage and
as you can hear I'm bringing you this
coverage death or alive we're gonna
bring you this coverage guys I'm still
here with Jay Jay and we're gonna take a
look at the 4k TV the 1440p g-sync
hundred twenty Hertz rog monitor that
was displayed yesterday at the asus
press conference you guys saw me
tweeting about it now we're taking a
look at it so I'm going to turn it over
to Jay Jay so he can tell me exactly
what this monitor is all about so this
is you know it's really actually a lot
to digest when you first hear all the
specifications get rolled out for this
monitors like you said 1440p so wqhd
2560 by 1440 one millisecond response
120 hertz refresh rate six millimeter
thin bezel design right you know
integrated USB 3 hub and then on top of
that you a dingy sink and you're just
like wow you just built the ultimate
gaming log it sort of feels like Asus
said oK we've built the ultimate
component line now our bottleneck is the
monitor and that's that's actually how
we look at it I mean if you look at our
entire kind of component division
everything from our motherboards toward
GPUs to our sound cards to our routers
to you know our monitors we carefully
really evaluate everything that we're
looking at to try to give you the gamer
the absolute best experience possible
and we had already done an outstanding
job with a range of monitors the VG
series has really become well-received
you know across the gamer demographic
but here we really wanted to give
something that gamers had been heavily
asking us about which was q HD
resolution that ultra-low response and
how to achieve that actually required a
huge amount of investment this panel
didn't exist we actually had two
specially develop and source the panel
for these specifications and actually
was slightly delayed because you know
about 50 60 % into the course of
development Nvidia told us g-sync and
all of a sudden we said hey that's the
only good
make this that much sweeter but it
required even more time to optimize and
design and work with the panel to get
logistically everything working right
and we still also wanted to ensure that
we had a great experience regardless if
you were an AMD user or an Nvidia g-sync
I think is an absolute game changer if
you're a first-person shooter guy and
you're looking for the absolute best in
terms of response and an overall
fluidity in gameplay but at the same
time for taking advantage of the latest
generation Radeon cards you're still
gonna be able to take advantage of that
qHD that ultra-low response and that
high refresh rate yeah I mean you guys
heard it here I saw some comments of
people saying well this was just a
rebranded g-sync Nvidia g-sync no guys
has a GC component in there but the
monitor was developed from the ground up
from from the ROG engineers to bring you
the ultimate gaming monitor now you guys
can't really see it this monitor here is
centering really really bad I'm sure the
camera can't pick it up but this is
smooth as glass right here now what's
powering these monitors right now this
resolution they're actually the same
exact systems here so we've got of
course Nvidia based graphics cards in
here but you're pretty much running
parity but you're just seeing of course
the the frame rate differential that is
occurring due to the fact that the
g-sync panel of course is running a
synced refresh rate between the GPU and
its frame buffer to what's being
displayed on screen whereas here of
course with the vsync enabled you're
getting that tearing you're getting that
inconsistency you're getting over all
that that not great gaming experience
that you're looking for now one thing I
do also want to touch about on the swift
monitor and we've had some people ask
about well I'd love to see something
that's IPS and that was another question
I asked is that IPS what was asked of
and it's it's not IPS because once again
like I said to be able to meet all the
characteristics that we wanted to it had
to be TN derived but we had to like I
said specially tuned the actual panel to
meet the criteria of it being an RG
monitor because energy monitor didn't
exist and if you know RG products we
take them very seriously so the actual
performative gamers
truly prefer a TN panel over IPS at
least from my experience IPS if you're
doing video production photography you
want that cut that accurate color
correction but a lot of people gamers
want their their colors to pop and TN
panels seem to be really widely accepted
so yeah I think I think that's the other
thing you know I'm definitely a prosumer
you know I've got IPS I've got TN both
of them but you know we did spend a lot
of work to actually have this be a very
very good quality performing
it's comparable to an IPS based display
in terms of its color reproduction it's
addressing its tonality and I definitely
feel that anybody that's been really
satisfied with our VG series of panels
is gonna be even more impressed by what
the quality that we have with this panel
so I definitely think that you know
don't be worried that it's not an IPS
you know if you're a hundred percent an
absolute diehard guy in terms of the
absolute best color reproduction the
best plaque levels then of course we
still have great IPS base panels and
we've got evenly got other panels that
aren't IPS based like the 4k panel that
we were talking about earlier that you
always want to keep in mind that the
panel is only one part of the process
there's things like the electronics
package the firmware tuning that all
affect image quality as well so panel
gets you a certain percentage there but
there's always a bit more to the
layering process so don't always just go
by that baseline specification there's a
lot more to the process right it is a
whole there's a whole world when it
comes to monitors and it's more than
just what you see on the spec sheet
because you can have identical monitors
from two different brands with identical
specs that look completely different
source panel and you can have different
pictures and different response due to
the different firmware packages and
electronic packages that are used by the
vendors and so there you go guys JJ is
showing us here the rog gaming monitor
here from asus make sure you check it
out and as always make sure you're
following us on Twitter for all of your
insider exclusive coverage here at CES
2014 and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
