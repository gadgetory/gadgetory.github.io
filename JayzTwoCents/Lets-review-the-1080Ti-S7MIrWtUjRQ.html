that delivery and I just want to make
sure that we're all cool with that
offshore Swiss bank account before we
get going
yep that's the one okay so we're good on
that
cool all right guys thanks Allah talking
about I'll let you know when the job's
done
alright now we can continue so what you
think you know I'll be honest I'm uh
kind of impressed by its proportions I
know right alright let me show you
something here I kind of like the thin
ones but this one is about form-factor
yeah but mine can fit in tight spaces
with girth you could open tight spaces
it's like a master key whether you like
thick or thin the ITX lineup from
fractal design is sure to have something
that tickles your fancy remember it's
not the size that matters it's all about
how you use it not instead leave the
girl no thinness garrett david scary is
no contest though there's contents
obscured okay all joking aside guys
let's go ahead and talk about the newest
addition to the Pascal family of NVIDIA
GPUs and I'm gonna go ahead and say it
right now cuz some of you guys are going
to say it anyway I was wrong
I said on Tech Talk and Jerry will
confirm that I said there was no room
for the 1080 Ti in the already pretty
cluttered Pascal lineup and one of the
cards it's not even here is the three
gigabyte GTX 1060 it's a very cluttered
stack in my pants I didn't feel like
there was room for this obviously I was
wrong
ten months into a lifecycle of a
graphics card is still perfectly legit
to introduce a new top dog now AM Andy
now invented around all this AMD should
have been doing recently nvidia touted a
couple of things that i want to check in
this video the first being that the 1080
Ti is up to 35% faster than the GTX 1080
and then they kind of made a quick
little reference but didn't have any
charts to support it that it's faster
than the Pascal Titan X now obviously
I've got
neck's peas in skunk works and this
titan right here is actually one of
Terry Cruz's Titans I have yet to put in
there so of course the claim that a 1080
Ti is faster had me kind of sitting on
pins and needles a little bit about CREP
did I did this take too long now but
anyway
we're going to check all of that okay
now I don't want to talk a whole lot
about specs we've already done videos
about specs I did a quick little video
at GDC there's me tons of videos about
this that's actually not under embargo
anymore so you guys should already know
by now so I'm do a little bit of a
high-level here now typically what a
video will do is they'll take their
Titan X card shave off a few CUDA cores
have a little bit less memory a little
bit maybe slower memory and then they'll
call that the T I know this is different
they actually have the full 30 584 CUDA
cores in the 1080i which already has you
kind of going okay so what's the
difference now the 1080i does have a few
less ROPS in the Titan X coming in at 88
versus the 96 over here on the Titan X
but the 1080i actually gets a boost in
memory speed over the Titan X coming in
at 11 gigabit per second versus the
Titan X's 10 gigabit per second strange
it also has 11 gigabytes of g5x
versus the 12 gigabytes of memory on the
Titan X so what really happened here is
it's exactly the same core why is the
same GP 102 core but they gave it a
memory speed boost a thousand megahertz
of memory speed boost the question is
how much is that going to make up for
robson things now before we talk about
the benchmarks there's a few things I
want to lead in with one I am using
press release drivers so these are not
the official game ready drivers these
are early access the other thing to
mention too is all of the cards I use in
980ti 1080 1080 and Titan X are running
with a static fan speed of 70% and the
reason why I did that all of these cards
hit their thermal max which means that
GPU boost basically shuts down you no
longer get any of that benefit because
in order to keep the thermals under
control it starts to slow down the clock
to where the base clock is or not the
base lock the base boost clock of
whatever these cards are so you do get
the boost clock you just don't get the
benefit of GPU boost 3.0 that takes the
speed-up and above
beyond that I think most people are
waiting for the add-in cards which you
can have custom coolers anyway but like
I said full transparency 70% fans feed
on all the cards tested
as you guys could see the 1080 tea I did
indeed best the GTX Titan X and pretty
much all the tests interestingly enough
though the tight net performed better in
fire strike and in time spy then the 10
ATT I did but then the 10 ATT I did
pretty much better across the board in
all the games and we're talking a
difference of like one or two fps
sometimes maybe up to like three or four
which is not a huge difference but
obviously the huge difference between
these two is the price we're talking
1200 bucks
versus 700 bucks so what do you get for
the extra $500 on a Titan X well you get
eight extra ROPS you get eighty-eight
Rob's versus 96 on the Titan X and you
get one extra gigabyte of slower memory
they're both running g5x although the
1080 TI due to its improved power
delivery and its dual Fett power
delivery they've also found a way to
squeak even more performance out of
their memory the 11 gigabytes of g5x on
here has a throughput of 11 gigabits per
second now what do you get for 500 extra
bucks with the Titan X while you get one
extra gigabyte of slower memory and you
get a extra ROPS
those two things are not worth $500
especially for gamers
now let's talk about the memory because
it's really the memory that's making the
1080 Ti faster than the Titan X remember
the exact same kuduk or count and they
are I pretty much the same speed when
you start looking at GPU boost now GPU
boost on both these cards will kind of
put them to the same frequency but as I
said the coolers will start to
dynamically bring them down because
they're just the founders cooler is the
loudest and the hottest of all the cards
but one of the reasons why the 1080 Ti
is also faster than type next that I
found through a lot of sanity testing
because I was going nuts trying to
figure out
what is actually making this card faster
the 1080 TI up over here actually but
1080 TI has a slightly improved cooler
and because of the removed DVI port on
the back and a little bit more surface
area on the cooler and better airflow
this is able to keep the frequency a
little bit higher before it starts to
hit that dynamically controlled thermal
limit so the Titan X was slowing down on
the frequency more so in the 1080 Ti so
faster memory and slightly faster core
speed even at 70% fan speed the slightly
improved cooler is indeed up to the task
of keeping this faster than the type
next now obviously when we see custom
boards designed for this you guys all
these cards you see behind you me here
is custom cards it's going to be way
faster than the type next because the
type next they don't allow custom cards
and custom coolers to be shipped with
them attached some brands have come up
with custom coolers you can put on here
but they don't ship that way you got to
do it yourself so as you guys solve
speeds out of the box no overclock
supplied to this the 1080 Ti does indeed
beat up it's bigger brother a little bit
these are pretty equally matched cards
what's not equally matched about them is
their price the nice thing about the
1080i though is it does come in two MSRP
pricing of $6.99 s there's no more
artificial inflation of the pricing of
the card because add-in cards are odd
add-in board partners obviously are not
going to price themselves under a
founder with MSRP because they feel
their cards are better et cetera et
cetera there's really no compelling
argument to even consider that anymore
which really kind of sucks because I
have two of those and even though this
is only a little bit faster and minor on
water I still go damnit I want the
latest or greatest one and not to
mention this one right here this is this
is one of Terry's cards it's okay just
the name alone makes it appropriate for
Terry because the guy is kind of a Titan
himself and it's like yeah you've got
Titans and again his are going to be on
water but yeah I mean it's just it's
it's interesting to me that Nvidia has
completely cut off one of its own
fingers over there and I think
personally if it wasn't for the fact
that these were sponsored by Nvidia
again thanks for sending these over for
Terry Crews because I sure as heck can't
afford $2,400 with the graphics cards I
think people who got tight Nexus might
be feeling a little bit
pointed because typically the Titans are
shaved or the 1080i zorty is are shaved
down Titans with less cuda cores and
whatnot not this time so the question is
why is NVIDIA feeling a little bit of
pressure from the upcoming launch from
Vega are they seeing what's kind of
happening between the performance can
cost ratio of AMD's risin versus the x99
offerings on Intel are we seeing an
answer to something that's not even out
yet
well time will tell and of course I'll
be doing Vega launch stuff as well and
of course add in card partners are
add-in boards whatever you want to call
them ai sees AI be their one cause it's
I'm a little different when they start
launching you'll start seeing them and
we'll see how much in game there is to
be had once you keep the cooling down
and the clock speed up guys thanks for
watching I love doing graphics cards
reviews these are fun it's the only
chance I get to play games anymore
granted I only get to play the same
benchmarks on the same missions over and
over and over again damn it I'm getting
good at those missions it's not like I
have enough video cards as it is right
anyway guys there's one more thing I got
to do here before I get out of here me
uh just bigger quick hey video what's up
J here yep so the deed is done
now you guys just gotta you know kind of
keep up your end of the bargain there
alright funds have been transferred
great
so also - I may need to ask how the kids
doing the the kids I gave you last year
for the Titan X's that are there
currently in skunk works now oh I see
Missy you know the great thing about
kids you always make more
all right thanks thanks again that was
stupid
