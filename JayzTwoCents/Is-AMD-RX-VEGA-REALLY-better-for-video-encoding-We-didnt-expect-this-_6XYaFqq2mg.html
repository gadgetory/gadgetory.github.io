I'm gonna ring every single ounce of
content out of Vega than it possibly can
because you know we talked a lot about
gaming performance a lot of people
focused on gaming but I'm one of the
ones who said it's more than just gaming
with this card it's all about compute
performance and there's a lot of
different ways you can leverage of that
especially in CAD drawings live CAD
renderings stuff like that but what
about video encoding I've talked about
it being a great card for video encoders
and content creators alike so I figured
what we do today is we would just go
ahead and compare Vega 56 and 64 versus
the gtx 1070 and 1080 and see which is
actually doing a better job for content
creators do you want to be cooler do you
want to be more desirable well you're in
luck because right now you can own your
very own JS to sense swag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below now this is an
interesting matchup because on paper
pricing wise these are pretty equally
matched right 1070 versus 56 they're
roughly the same price 399 and then
you've got the gtx 1080 which is matched
on paper versus the vega 64 and he I
took the waterblock off to make this
fair and as you can see they're all
reference coolers so that's important
but we live in the real world where the
problem is Vegas 64 right now is
actually being priced competitively
against the GTX 1080 TI which we know
this absolutely dominates this in games
what about in a professional environment
so in order to try and appease both the
MSRP which we're hoping the graphics
cards will actually come back down to so
I'm comparing them 56 versus 2 and 70 64
versus 1080 and then 64 versus 1080 TI
to basically account for the way things
are right now at the time of making this
video and in the future let's just hope
that's completely irrelevant test but
even on paper it shows that the Vegas 64
should be beating the GTX 1080 Ti in a
more professional environment when you
look at this the raw single precision
teraflop numbers so I want to see if
that actually plays out so with that
said let's talk about the way we're
gonna do the test I'm using an adobe
premiere test project it's the bald
eagle test
we're gonna do is we run to a baseline
because I've got my i9 7900 X on water
with 32 gigabytes of Dominator Platinum
3030 200 megahertz memory ddr4 of course
and then the CPU is overclocked to four
point six gigs so I'm gonna do a
baseline test to see how it does with no
OpenCL and no CUDA to see how you know
are we're gonna be doing without a
graphics card then we'll run the same
test compare the logs with each graphics
card no over clocks or anything just
setting them to their turbo clock and
letting GPU boost 3.0 do its thing on
NVIDIA side and then we are going to see
what the results are so with that said
enough talking and let's do it
so we did quite a fit okay we did a lot
of testing on this and I'll be honest
we had some results we weren't expecting
we added some extra tests I'll show you
in a minute because we were trying to
figure out some of these results now the
perspective of this video the proof the
perspective the perspective of this
video suffering succotash
I actually spit I saw it fly didn't hit
you so we did our baseline test with
just the CPU and it was about five
minutes and 26 seconds you guys saw the
graphs and then we put on the Vega 56
and used open CL and we saw it come down
to exactly half of that about two
minutes and 13 seconds which was pretty
impressive so we put on the biggest 64
expecting to see it to come down even
more because we know there's more stream
processors more compute performance on
the 64 and the price it was pretty much
the same and we weren't really expecting
that we thought wow that's interesting
okay what happens when we put on the gtx
1070 exact same results I mean one
second difference put on the gtx 1018 it
was slightly slower than the 1070 even
but again within a second so then i
thought to myself this is very strange
1080 TI same result once again so what
we found here was all the graphics cards
were pretty much the exact same result
within one second so I really started
thinking about this and I went okay what
what's the big picture here so I decided
to end up taking my gtx 1050 which was
something i didn't even mention at
beginning this video because we added it
later and guess what exact same result
now I decided to go to probably the
slowest card I have here which is kind
of sad to mention I should I wish I had
some older cards but I don't
my gtx 660 and again the same result two
minutes and 13 seconds so that guy does
thinking here what what's happening we
are seeing that obviously with a high
end cpu like this 20 threads overclocked
lots of ram that we were seeing a pretty
much exactly half of the cpu performance
when it comes to rendering time when you
add a GPU any GPU it didn't matter if it
was a high-end vega car to hide an
Nvidia card or something that you can
get for around 100 bucks it didn't
really seem to matter so what we did was
we ended up going into the BIOS N and
disabling hyper threading turning this
chip effectively into a
core 10 thread CPU now we ended up
trying to do actually four course eight
threads turning into a very high-end
7700 K with a lot of cash for some
reason the BIOS wasn't letting us do it
it would be disabled but the windows
still saw it so once we disabled the
hyper threading we did another baseline
run and we got seven minutes and 47
seconds up in code time with just the
CPU 10 threads no hyper threading but
once we hooked up a GPU any GPU 660
versus the 1080 Ti
we got three minutes and thirty four or
three minutes and 35 seconds with the
660 and three minutes and 34 seconds
with the 1080i so once again that showed
us that although the whole thing slid
kind of as a whole bracket longer with
less cores available to it to the CPU
adding a GPU made a significant
difference in render time but it didn't
matter what GPU we used so that was
something that was a little bit
unexpected now I tell you this part
right here that's obviously not the
whole story when it comes to CUDA versus
OpenCL right we're talking OpenCL here
this is not a specific AMD technology
it's an open-source technology but you
know the amount of teraflops and compute
performance really doesn't seem to make
a difference when it comes to Vega
versus CUDA on video rendering where it
seems like the most important thing is
that you have the most powerful CPU you
can get and then any GPU whatsoever
hooked up to it okay so yeah that's
that's our results and it wasn't what we
expected I had expected Vega to win I
really did
now unless you're gonna be doing
extremely high-end Pro workflows with
things like real-time auto cad rendering
and 3d modeling which I don't have to
actually have a way to test that and
maybe I'll try to do that in the future
I don't think you're gonna see the
benefit of Vega whether it be for games
or content creators which is really
disappointing until the crowd the price
comes back down it's not something that
really makes a whole lot of sense at its
current price point and unless the guys
that are that are doing cryptocurrency
mining and I'm hearing rumors that
they're they're actually cracking this
card using OpenCL and doing some amazing
stuff when it comes to hash but no one
will actually talk about how they're
doing it I have no idea I have no idea
who's buying up these cards so anyway if
you guys think that we should do future
testing on GPUs for performance and
professional workflows and let me know
what
sweet two guys think we should do I'm
not actually all that sure because I'm
not sure the best way to compare it
apples to apples but if you're content
creator looking to create videos and you
want to get the least amount of render
time that obviously doesn't matter which
GPU you go with it's still all about CPU
anyway guys with that said I'm gonna go
tell me what you guys thought about
today's video these results were highly
unexpected but they were fun to test
which is why we ended up throwing more
graphics cards at it because we were
trying to find some rhyme or reason for
it but whatever guys time to go thanks
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
