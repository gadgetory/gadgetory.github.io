thought I would take this opportunity
that we're about to do with skunk works
where I'm doing all kinds of new
water-cooling stuff with it then I would
take the opportunity to go ahead and
show you guys some more stuff when it
comes to water cooling end of all of the
water cooling videos I've done I've
actually never covered how to do a water
block on your motherboard we'll talk
about is it necessary do you need it and
then we will do kind of a quick
demonstration of how to install the damn
thing it's really not that hard but some
people get a little freaked out we'll go
ahead and put your minds at ease if you
will today's video is sponsored by

anyway open another tab and do it now
just don't just don't leave this video
you still want to watch this one just me
so anyway first I'm gonna do here is I'm
just going to go ahead and take this
motherboard out I should have probably
done that in preparation for the video
huh
hindsight I guess also - fair warning
what this is on my wrist this is
actually an adidas activity tracker I'll
be doing a review on this I just started
it up and we're using it for the first
I'm it's not an anti-static now you guys
might want to use an anti-static
environment when you do this
I have personally never used an
anti-static strap and any computer I've
ever built now some people would say Jay
you're stupid for doing that that's okay
so I'm going to tell you right now that
recommended you use an anti-static strap
especially if you're sitting on carpet
or something like that but I personally
don't so that's up to you now anyway
we're going to be doing here with this
block is we're going to be removing this
heatsink and this heat sink right here
which is actually all of these are
connected via a heat pipe you can see
the heat pipe right here there's nothing
actually under here being cooled it's
just right there and this is additional
surface area being used by the heat pipe
so when we take this off some folks were
concerned that there's going to be too
much orange with you know the orange
fluid and the orange Ram and all and
this but this is coming off we're going
to lose this orange here we're really in
that up there we're only going to really
retain the orange on the slots otherwise
everything else is going to be pretty
much black now it would also be
recommended that you make sure this
motherboard works before you do this now
gigabyte has already tested this
motherboard for me I'm going to take
their word for it just simply for the
sake of time
so do a component test put in your CPU
putting some rampant in the motherboard
hook up your power supply and then see
if you if it posts and gives you you
know an error that there's no hard drive
if it does then you're good to go
anyway the other thing we're going to do
to is we are going to look at the back
of the motherboard and get familiar with
what tools we're going to need to remove
the heat sinks now on this one here you
can see they are sprung Phillips screws
right here right here right here right
here and on the back of the vrm which
has a little support plate on there so
all we're going to need for these is a
Phillips head screwdriver I've got my
multi-tool which you guys have seen tons
and tons of times actually it's not a
multi-tool everyone gets mad calling me
a multi-tool it's like a five in one
find whatever it's a screwdriver that's
got a lot of and it's bent actually I've
used it to pry things so it's a little
bit anyway this is this is my lucky
husky I've used it so many times once
you are familiar with all of that then
we are going to make check the contents
of the block and we also want to get
familiar with the instructions
prior to actually starting the work now
I know that sounds very unmanly like and
we mean check the instructions J we're
men wrong you know as tend to two men
Taylor would say we don't need
instructions
we don't need directions well that's
true if you can afford to break this and
start all over then by all means go
ahead so well I'm gonna inspect the
block real quick I've actually not taken
this out of the packaging yet this is
the chipset block right here and that's
actually going to end up going right
about there like that and then we have
also got the vrm block right up here
which is pretty obvious that it's also
going to go right up there
so these actually look pretty good they
give us some thermal pads here and all
of our screws and offset or spacers and
plastic spacers that we need to keep
from blowing things up you know one
thing that I find kind of interesting
and it's not common for UK water blocks
to do this but I'll go ahead and engine
it right now they do not include any of
the thermal grease that you need
normally they would give you everything
you need even just like a small you know
a couple of grams of thermal grease
which we are going to need for this guy
right here which is going to be
contacting the chipset chip so I guess I
have to go grab some of that like
there's nothing else in here they did
not give us any grease that's strange
all right I'll be right back
now a couple of other things we're going
to need here for the sake of getting
this done is some scissors to cut our
thermal pads and the thermal grease as
we already said so these are the tools
you technically need right here scissors
screwdriver and thermal grease other
than that it's pretty straightforward
this isn't a very difficult install
whatsoever now the cool thing about the
standoffs are the rubber standoffs here
is they've pretty much already glued
them in place although this guy here is
a little bit off there we go they pretty
much already glued the rubber or plastic
spacers on here so that's kind of nice
not to worry about that these are
important these isolate metal from
touching the motherboard so you don't
get anything that grounds out so that's
important to keep in mind same thing
with these on here on the vrm these are
already glued on there so that is good
news so we're going to go ahead and do
here is we're going to
start by removing the stock heatsinks on
here now depending on the motherboard
you have you're going to want to kind of
see what's connected because you
wouldn't want to unhook say just this
guy here and start trying to pull it off
because as I've showed you already these
are connected with a heat pipe to the
main vrm cooler and over here to this
guy and then down here to the chipset so
you need to undo all of these screws and
take it off as one big piece but also
keep in mind like I've said there's
nothing under these they're pretty much
just floating in mid-air to get up into
the airflow space of your either your
CPU cooler or your case fans to give you
additional cooling to the VRM into the
chipset now I do plan on doing you know
obviously overclocking with this so
that's why I'm going with the
motherboard cooler it's not really
necessary do you really need motherboard
water cooling no but since it's already
CPU is already being water cooled and
it's only about 120 bucks for this block
might as well go ahead and do it on here
for extra insurance so I'm just going to
go ahead and start taking off these
screws now
you're also going to want to take off
any rubber spacers that are on here for
the stock heat sinks because those can
add thickness which would make our block
not make contact properly so make sure
you're only using the hardware that is
supplied with the ek block
now one thing you want to do - and what
I like to do so I don't lose any of this
hardware is just in case you want to put
this back to stock someday you're going
to want to keep track of all of these
screws and things so what I would do is
I would take the Ziploc baggie here that
you've got with the thermal pads in
there and then just put all the screws
and stuff in here including the back
plate for the vrm cooler that way you
don't lose any of this as I drop it all
over the place do as I say not as I do
god it's like Jay became your dad that's
a scary thought don't you think if Jay
was your dad that's terrifying
alright now that it's all unscrewed be
careful when you pick it up because
literally the cooler might just pop
right off and I can already feel it's
very very loose and like I said this
thing is going to come off in one giant
piece now it is going to be probably
adhesive to the VRMs there so you see
how I rocked it just a little bit to get
it loose and then everything else like I
said comes off in one piece so that is
what the stock cooling looks like for
the vrm and that's why I said you
couldn't do just one piece at a time
because as you can see the heat pipes
are keeping this thing together now just
like I told everyone not to freak out
about the amount of orange as you can
see there's a lot less orange on here
already the color theme that I'm going
with this is it's very it's very
subjective you either like orange or you
don't and putting too much orange on
there would definitely be a bad thing
but I knew that by taking this off would
lose a lot of the orange and then the
color balance I think would be would be
pretty good so right now I'm just going
to sort of test fit this make sure it
doesn't interfere with anything because
that would just kind of suck so that's
where that block is going to go and then
this one is quite literally just going
to go right here and it's going to make
contact with the chokes right here
because this is a one two three four
five six seven eight phase power we've
got MOSFETs down there and we've got
chokes right here so we're going to
adjust
test fit that so that's how that's going
to go it is actually going to be a
really tight fit because I'm going to
have to have obviously a graphics card
is going to go on top of you three
graphics cards are gonna go on top of
this block and we have the fittings here
and we had the CPU here and the VRMs
there so I'm going to have to have the
tubing come in and all this connected
and then go out so that's going to
actually be a bit of a challenge but Jay
loves a challenge and we will we will
get it done I'm not sure how much Ben's
I can actually put right here
considering the fact that there's not a
lot of room for that radius but anyway
I'm ahead of myself
now what we have to do is take our
alcohol I know I didn't mention we
needed this in the beginning but if you
do water cooling and custom blocks you
know you should already have this or
even you should always have this on hand
anyway because this is how you remove
thermal paste and we're going to want to
remove the thermal paste here that's on
the chipset chip so we're just going to
kind of dab that use something that's
fairly lint-free most people would say
micro fibers aren't lint-free but really
depends on the quality of the microfiber
cloth this one right here is going to
leave any fibers a lot of people also
like to use coffee filters for you know
machine copy machines you can see this
one's really really hard and caked on
their this almost makes me wonder with
how easy it came off if it might have
given us some cooling issues so this is
a good thing we're doing this there we
go I was really surprised that was
actually really hard to get that thermal
paste off there was very very hard
usually when thermal paste gets really
hard like that and it came off really
easy the the heatsink did means it
wasn't very good bond a surprise that
might have gotten hot on us alright so
this is gonna be a little bit of a hard
part here because it's a really small
chip that we want to put thermal paste
on so I'm just gonna literally do like a
tappy tap tap tap tap tap ooh they want
you to kind of try and do an X that's
gonna be nearly impossible so that's all
it's getting right there from me quite
literally if you use non conductive
grease it'll be okay if it gets a little
bit on the I don't know if those are
causal circuits right there just make
sure that you don't go too crazy on it
obviously but I'm using the Eco therm
which is non conductive so that's a
that's a bonus there alright so we're
just going to kind of dump out our
screws
and we're going to also put washers on
the backside so there's gonna be washers
on either side of these holes so right
now I'm going to just sort of put this
in place and hold it there we go I can
actually feel it push down on that
thermal grease that's a good thing you
can also see the holes lining up on the
back right there so I'm going to hold
this in place with my hand I'm going to
line up one of these washers and then I
get one of these screws here started
you're also going to install these in a
cross pattern just like you would any
other block or heatsink that way you get
even distribution of torque it's also
going to keep us from warping our
motherboard or cracking it or anything
like that these motherboards are pretty
robust though they're not very delicate
like some people would be afraid that
they're so delicate they're going to
break them now I don't worry about it
motherboards are really really strong
all right just make sure you don't over
tighten it just go until you've got some
resistance and then like maybe a half
turn past that you can strip these
threads that are very very small you
don't want to do that but there is our
chipset block let me use this a little
bit of alcohol here to clean the top
here where I was touching it with my
dirty fingers don't ask me where they've
been that is none of you bays wex called
about alcohols it evaporates really
really fast so there's that one right
there now we need to do the vrm block
which is a little different because
we're not using thermal paste for that
we were actually using these thermal
pads now you want to pay attention to
the manual because you have two
different thicknesses here a half
millimeter and one millimeter and that
depends where they go depends on which
one you know where it's going so you
need to consume consult the manual and
it's going to tell you which one goes
where so in this one here looking down
number one which is the half millimeter
is going to go down there on the MOSFETs
and then right here number two which is
the one millimeter thick it's going to
go right here on the choke
okay so this really sucks and I'm gonna
go ahead and continue this video anyway
because you guys know that I've always
continued to keep my screw-ups in these
videos because I do it with the hopes
that my screw up will help someone else
so there are two versions of this block
the ek FB kit GA x99 and then the GA x99
SOC champion so this one's slightly
different than the SOC Force which means
right now this block does not fit up
here on where the VRMs are because of
the fact that it is narrower the holes
don't line up so I'm assuming the only
thing that's different in the upgraded
kit is this guy right here and that
really sucks so anyway to keep the
installation you know at least the
tutorial going so that you guys could
finish with the idea of how this works
is you would take your thermal pads
basically line them up where they would
go and then you would cut them with your
scissors into size and then you would
apply them to the underside here of the
block you know basically where they go
the other thing you could do is you
could just cut it down to where it fits
the under part of the block here without
hanging off and then you would apply it
and screw it down the same way I did
here with the chipset block and then you
would end up having you know your
water-cooled motherboard where your VRMs
and power delivery is water-cooled
that's a big deal because especially as
you overclock these things go under a
lot of stress and then your chipset is
nice and cool as well which can also
introduce you know some instability with
temperatures on your motherboard temps
because these parts are just passively
cool that's pretty much it for this one
uh well that sucks but oh well you know
I it happens it's really easy when
you're ordering all these parts to miss
something minor because they showed a
picture of the SOC force which looks
very similar except for it has eight
DIMM slots instead of four and it's
really easy to mess up by not paying
attention but it is what it is so anyway
guys I hope this videos helped you in
some way maybe it made you laugh if it
made you laugh they click the
but I'm I'm always going to keep my
mistakes in these videos because it
keeps things as real as possible and
that's what I'm all about I'm all about
the reals being the real all right guys
see in the next one thanks for watching
and like I said click like just out of
pity all right catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
