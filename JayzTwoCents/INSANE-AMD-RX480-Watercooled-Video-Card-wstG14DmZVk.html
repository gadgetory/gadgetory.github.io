don't want to sacrifice performance well
I have good news because the new desk
mini from asrock features Intel's 6th
generation CPUs USB 3.0 type C multiple
m2 slots and Wi-Fi all while maintaining
an extremely small footprint learn more
about as rocks new desk mini by
following the link down below so how
many of you have found yourself in this
position before you get your nice new
AMD graphics card does really good a
1080p gaming even does some 1440p stuff
it's got reference cooler on it and it
gets pretty damn toasty well what do you
do oh you know what you do you just you
just get yourself a custom board partner
card you know one that's got a big
cooler and stuff on it it's got a big
cooler and stuff on it and then you find
out it actually runs just as hot as this
guy right here finding out that they've
kind of let you down I'll tell you what
you do you water cool that son of a
bitch that's what you do
damnit editing J knock it off it's not
that dramatic well it is kind of cool
though I have to admit
someday I'll actually get a little bit
unlace and actually hook up a capture
card so I don't have to keep pointing my
camera at the screen like a noob we want
to see what this does out of the box
don't touch anything we're going to use
heaven here this is not a benchmark run
guys I'm not benchmarking all my games
and stuff I'm curious as to what the
temperatures and the power is going to
be I made this as big as I could
I know pink is kind of hard to see but
white was even harder hopefully you guys
make this out
anyway voltage is sitting at 1.05 and it
went to 12 66 immediately which we would
expect because that's the boost clock of
the 480 100% GPU load 34 C is where
we're running right now on the
temperature but look at this we're only
pulling 105 point 8 watts
do you remember when I did the gigabyte
review in the last video where that was
pulling somewhere in the neighborhood of
like 125 to 130 on air at stock settings
and this was still throttling down a
little bit like that I mean that's crazy
this was never at 1266 on the gigabyte
even at stock settings look at the
wattage here 103 104 that's pretty do
you mean how much energy is the fans
actually using remember this is a total
TDP that's that's the whole package the
card the fans everything so you take the
fans out of the equation look at how
much power reduction there was already
Wow okay all right obviously we want to
see how far the single overclock so
let's go ahead and see how far we can go
on stock voltage let's try 1366 with
stock memory let's see if we can get a
hundred megahertz overclock on stock
voltage okay so it didn't crash
immediately that's a good thing stock
voltage actually bumped up a little bit
to 1.08 709 3 so it's a little bit
higher than the O 5 but it is dynamic it
is going to change we're at 1366 that is
a 100 megahertz overclock but look at
this look at
once again 100 18.9 119 120 37 c is we
running at temperature-wise
look at the I think I'm more impressed
with this number right here than I am
with the core clock or the temperatures
but without touching a damn thing on the
voltage we're up to 1366 all right let's
let again let's see how far we can go
without this thing immediately crashing
on stock voltage 1375 again voltage is
at 1.09 3 again the temperature is at 37
c and the core TDP is 116 hundred and
seventeen so we'll call it 121 watts
121 gigawatts 141 to go once ok 1375 out
of the box didn't do nothing but put on
a water block man that's kind of a big
something it's a hundred and ten dollar
water block but what I digress alright I
digressed are you happy are you happy I
did it I tried thirteen eighty and see
if we can what and I don't believe this
now I know some people were saying in my
video with the gigabyte card debt some
folks under volting or leaving their
volts at stock was actually giving them
better results but with that gigabyte
card that wasn't the case I had to up
the voltage to get any sort of overclock
going because it didn't want to
overclock again this is a card sent by
AMD but it has better components in the
gigabyte card did the gigabyte card kind
of cheaped out on the MOSFETs and stuff
25% weaker MOSFETs all around but that's
not going to change its overclocking
ability that's only going to change how
much abuse those MOSFETs could take
before they finally blow up stri 1390
see if that works
it didn't immediately crash that's what
I'm looking for here's where as where is
it going to just like not even load holy
hell do 1390 stock bolts again 1.09 3
it's even come down to 1.08 7 vrm is
being actively cooled so the prm's I
don't have a way to monitor that I don't
have a vr and monitor tool I mean I'm
sure people are curious but the VRMs are
also being actively water-cooled
although a water bubble keeps appearing
in that part of the block but that's
because the way I have the block
oriented in the way I should have
switched the inlet and outlet on
block that's my bed that's naughty case
ball oh my 14 up there goes it finally
crashed on stock bolts okay let's go and
do this I'm just going to max out the
core voltage I'm going with the plus 100
millivolt and imma leave it at 1,400
that is typically where on an air cooler
that for ATS were just like screaming
for mercy because they were so damn hot
so I'm gonna apply that so now the
voltage as you can see one point 187 so
it did go up point 100 like we wanted
but look at the TDP look how much it
jumped to 144 but when I wet plus 100
millivolts on the gigabyte card that
went up to almost 190 here's what I do
now I'm just gonna push it as far as I
can when I see what the final numbers
are and we'll see what we get - with
stock bolts are not suckles with the +
100 volts it's kind of fun okay here's
what we got fourteen hundred and seventy
on the core fourteen seventy five
crashes nearly immediately so I don't
know how stable this will be in the long
run holy I was thinking for a
second there I was going to hit 1500 on
this would be absolutely amazing but
still fourteen seventy that is no joke
in legis 40 C 40 39 to 40 C holy
man
152 153 155 up and there's a crash okay
so we'll pull that back to say 14 60
curious as to if it's gonna at 1460 Pass
fire strike normal so I'm going to run
it real quick we'll see if it passes if
it does we'll compare what the score was
when I did my previous test what the
fans ramped up at max at twelve hundred
and sixty-six we'll see how much of a
benefit there really was adding a water
block and overclocking 200 megahertz
well just just under 200 makers right
1466 would have been 200 megahertz
alright so on the second test here in
fire strikes so far we have not crash
but what I want to point out though is
the clock as you can see right here is
adjusting a little bit but it's not
thermal adjusting so we're at 42 C under
100 percent load but what I believe is
happening here is we are hitting the TDP
limits or the power limits because even
though I have the + 50 percent on there
it can still only pull so much power
through the power to the PCIe connector
75 watts right with the PCIe 6 pin and
then 75 watts pull through the
motherboard so that 6 pin can still only
apply so much additional power
regardless of would you put the power
limit too that's why I believe the clock
is adjusting itself slightly in some of
these tests I believe its power limit
obviously it's not thermal throttling
you cannot call that thermal throttling
because it's hit 42 C so yeah we go all
the way up to 165 Watts right here so
I'm pretty sure that that's why this
clock slows down a little bit because I
think 165 is going to be the max power
that this card is allowed to pull so as
you can see it's gonna obviously depend
on games how much power it's pulling how
much GPU load is it going on it to
determine whether or not that clock is
going to change so water doesn't change
that we got a graphic score here 14,000
746 and I do know for a fact that that
is quite a bit higher than the twelve
hundred and sixty-six run as you would
expect but Wow I mean fourteen hundred
and fourteen thousand seven hundred
forty signals hired at GTX 1060 as well
even though I was able to achieve an
additional 100 megahertz overclock over
what I could do on air this exact card
when I got it when it first came out I
took it i over clocked it I want to see
what how far I could go and I was able
to achieve about a thirteen hundred and
60 megahertz overclock just shy of a
hundred megahertz and that was
disappointing to me although it was
still a very good overclocker compared
to like the fury cards I could only get
like fifty or seventy-five megahertz I
was hoping for more but what's I what's
really strange about this is once I took
those fans off put it on water I
achieved a fourteen hundred and sixty
six megahertz overclock yeah guys like
off-camera I did the 1466 it was bugging
me that it wasn't a perfect 200
megahertz so I did validate that it
tests are that it passed so 200
megahertz overclock on this guy here's
the question that begs to be asked
though and I don't think it's a simple
answer and that being is it worth taking
a 280 dollar graphics card like the 8
gigabyte 480 and put another hundred and
ten dollars worth of water block on it
I'm the kind of guy that would say no
it's not worth it to take a $280
graphics card and throw another 110
dollars with cooling on it because now
you're in gtx 1070 territory where you
can actually find some 1070 graphics
cards in that price point believe it or
not I know they're hard to find but they
do exist if you keep your eyes open MSI
makes one I personally would not take a
480 and water cool it when I know that I
could for a few extra bucks above what
this cost mow another lawn or wash
another car or just don't eat out twice
could buy a gtx 1070 giving me much
better thermals not been on water but
then this thing was on air and way more
performance i can't necessarily
recommend that unless you have a serious
size constraint because this card on the
water block is extremely short it's very
very short you could fit this into a
small form-factor water-cooled build if
you want it but again it's just i have a
hard time recommending a card that I
know is slower when the overall price of
it is is the round the same as a card
that is much much faster like the 1070
so that's why I usually would never
recommend water cooling a mid-range card
because ok you don't want to get a 1070
fine you could get a 390 or 390 X for
the same price as what this cost is a
total package with a water block on it
so that's where you have to decide if
it's worth it to you personally I
wouldn't do it that's just me though so
it is what it is but performance wise
you can't deny that this our X 480
certainly does wake the hell up on water
and I don't know if anyone else has
already done a water block for 80 but I
don't care you guys wanted me to do it
there were like 800 likes on Twitter
saying do this so I did it you guys tell
me what you think
time to go as always I will see you in
the next video and of course thanks for
