here in my shop because I'm gonna do
little bit of a build vlog II thing yeah
if that makes any sense I'm covered in
cardboard let scoping a cardboard box in
it
it's shed on me shed then on me
it's shed on me same thing whether
you're looking for a pump reservoir
custom GPU block or a complete loop and
a box alpha cools wide range of products
can make your next water cooling
adventure an easy one click the link in
the description for more details of
course dry when I start to record the
neighbors or like cutting wood some
so anyway you guys are probably here
some construction and stuff going on
because again I'm outside in my shop but
I digress so as you guys can see I have
got my old test bench right here which
is a case labs case this isn't even
available anymore in fact it's been a
very solid very faithful test bench if
you will but it's got some drawbacks to
it in terms of ease of use of changing
out parts and stuff and I'm going to be
switching that over today to a practice
wet bench as you can see right here and
this is made by primo chill so it's
designed to be an open-air test bench
with water cooling in mind and so
obviously they thought of me when they
built it probably not but um yeah well
we'll go with that so I'm gonna do today
is I am going to be taking out some of
the parts from here the water cooling
loop from here putting on the practices
I'm gonna be changing out my motherboard
as well I'm not gonna be using the
gigabyte in board anymore bees and x99
classified not the cage is the regular
old classified from EVGA still by far
one of the most stable boards I've ever
used this gigabyte board has actually
been pretty good but I'm actually
changing it specifically because of the
aesthetics I'm just I'm cheesy and and
shallow like that so as I said this is
the case labs s3 test management as you
can see it's pretty big it's big it's
not too light damn neighbors jeez anyway
here's the cables right there over the
years I had this nice and managed but
over the years and using it over and
over I did eventually just like I
stopped carrying on something even just
fell out right there what over the years
I just stopped caring about it so much
so as we're going to do today we're
going to tackle this we're going to move
over the parts I want to reuse over to
the Praxis we're going to build the
Praxis and then yeah so it's sort of a
vlog II vloggy build review if you will
well as you can see hanging that over
there is the EVGA DG 87 we'll be doing a
full water-cooled build in that thing
but this came in first so I got to get
this done alright so one of the biggest
issues I always had with this particular
case was that you can see I started
taking it apart a little bit out of
order here actually but the motherboard
tray split apart and I had the hard
drives mounted to the bottom of that
because in order to have room here for
all my cables and then of course my
water cooling loop on the other side
with the radiator and fans I had to
remove the hard drive cages so because
of that I had to mount the hard drives
to the bottom of the motherboard tray
here and I'll show you that in a second
which really made it kind of a bitch if
I wanted to make any sort of changes to
hard drives that's one of the deciding
factors for me to actually change out my
case here see there they are at there
mounted to the bottom I mean it's really
not that you don't change it a lot when
it comes to test being a test bench but
just having it pretty much locked down
the way it was had to go through all
that to get to it it's just not I'm not
too happy with that one of the things
you'll notice I never installed in this
test bench is a drain loo or a drain
port and that's because as you can tell
by all that dust I don't take this apart
very often fact this has been together
with the same fluid now for I think two
years it's been about two years fluids
turned a little bit darker red than it
used to be but not much actually this is
the EK fluid this is all the EK loop
that came with the cryo venom 290
actually which was a EK collaborate
collaborative effort with visiontek so
anyway this has been together all that
time and the way I basically drain this
is I just will hang literally this over
the edge like that put a bowl or
something under here to catch the fluid
and undo that port and then just let
drip out that's literally how I drain
this guy
and then of course I undo a bleeder cap
on the top right here that guy right
there
that way air can get in the system and
push the fluid out it's kind of a messy
way of doing it but yeah I didn't plan
on taking this apart very often I will
say this though whatever tubing ek had
put in their kits man this stuff is good
look at this zero clouding after about
two years same fluid never swapped
obviously it's some sort of a non
plasticizer tubing but it's not labeled
so I don't know exactly what brand it is
but my god that is so clear after two
years you guys have seen tube before
well we're turned cloudy after two
months back two weeks sometimes yeah
good job on the tubing so here it
is right here I went with a white with
black that way I'm not locked down to
any particular color theme I'm going to
be using green coolant actually testing
out some of the green color here then
we'll be using for skunk works moving
forward but you can see some of the
other color options on their website
they got blue pink gray orange red I
mean any colors you can think of as well
as the white metal right here you can
choose black or white and obviously I
want the white I went with white because
it shows up dust a lot less but anyway I
believe Kyle and Paul both have these as
well I could be rondo Paul has one Kyle
has one but check their channels as well
because you guys will be able to see
some of the other options and things
that you can do with this but it does
come flat packed which means you got to
build it so let's go ahead and do that
now they also went through a lot of
effort in the way that they packed this
to make it you know one presentable too
easy to manage and three easy to find
really so all the hardware is there
we've got our PSU mounting bracket here
and then everything it's individually
scored and aquas heavy duty
double-walled cardboard as well as all
that foam so the chances of something
getting damaged in transit are very very
thin instructions are pretty nice
they're all Illustrated and makes it
easy to understand
and then of course here are the acrylic
accent pieces I was telling you about be
delicate with this normal bending it and
stuff it's acrylic it will crack pretty
easily
you also want to over-tighten it but
anyway you also want to pull off this
paper this protective paper before you
put it on otherwise the accent side
that's against the metal isn't going to
show up anyway and you can see right
there that's a lot of craftsmanship in
this obviously they have a really nice
cutter to cut all this up okay I wish I
had these these sort of tools and as you
can see it's starting to take shape the
only it's going to kind of suck about
the acrylic though is it will scratch if
it gets dusty and you wipe it acrylic
scratches especially glossy acrylic but
anyway that's besides the point here
this at least it's not on the outside or
would be even worse this is all steel
right here series I'm gonna do I'm gonna
go ahead and put the rest of this thing
together and then before I do a loop and
we'll go from there so far it's a lot
smaller well number the Witch of a
smaller footprint it definitely seems
like more usable space on here
the air conditioner just kicked on so
it's trolling me hmm well the Praxis wet
bench is completely together you can see
I've got my classified x99 on there type
next Maxwell card just for the heck of
it right now
and now I've got to do the water cooling
loop but you can see it's pretty well
thought out so here's the radiator
bracket and you can fit three sixty
millimeter radiator or four twenty
millimeter radiator on there I'll be
putting a 360 on there as you guys have
already seen take took that off the
other bench and yeah it's pretty well
thought out this area here is pretty
much wide open I chose to hang the
drives underneath instead of going up in
here I'm gonna try and keep as much of
the wiring down the bottom as I can but
I can also use this area to kind of coil
up wires and set them aside if I need to
but they've got a pretty well thought
out like cutout right here for the power
to pass through same there for the two
and a half inch drive and normally this
is where like you could put the reset
and power buttons right here on both
sides you could even set one right here
on the top if you want it or you could
set it over here on this side and here
are
Oh buttons right there however I'm not
going to be installing those because the
motherboard I have here has motherboard
mounted power and reset so I don't need
any of those buttons but they're there
in case your motherboard doesn't support
it like the the other motherboard I head
on here the gigabyte x99 you d4p did not
have any of these buttons so anyway
there's that so now I'm gonna get the
water cooling loop together so I'm
trying to figure out right now the best
way to mount I've got this obviously
upside down I'm kind of frankensteining
together some parts here if you will
yeah I don't need this anymore out here
this is the part where the water cooler
in me as being very particular on the
way I want things to go so here's I'm
going to do I'm gonna see how far I can
get on this right here it might end up
being a part too I apologize I don't
really want to do a part - let me see
how far I can get it I got a lot to do
today
little Jays first day of second grades
today she's gonna be home from school
soon I got the gym to go to that's have
to edit this video yeah so I'm gonna
stop talking now and I'm gonna get to it
well guys unfortunately this is going to
be a two-parter and I apologize for that
I tried really hard to get it all done
today in one day but it just didn't
happen mostly because I was trying to
figure out where I wanted to mount
things so let's talk about this for a
second here and they've taken my lame
DDC and mounting it to the Alpha cool
reservoir here that's a reservoir top
combo right here on the side which is
nice because I can fill it up here on
the top nice and easily and I can drain
it with that port right there if you
guys can see so I'm going to hook my
drain port up to this right here and
then you're going to be able to I'll be
able to drain it and fill it all from
right here but anyway this is the
radiator here I'm going to flip it
around because right now I have it set
up so that as it goes on there the
fittings are on the inside but I want to
flip the radiator around so that the
fittings are poking out that way I can
have easy access to the in out here on
the back of this going to the radiator
and then going to the CPU and then back
to here I also need to sleeve this right
here because obviously that's not going
to work for me but as you can see I got
that same gigabyte 1200 watt orange PSU
that they seem to
sent to everybody so I'm putting on here
to 1200 watt Platinum rated and I'm
taking the thousand watt that was on
here and I'm putting it in the DG 87
bill so yeah guys I think it's a pretty
damn neat bench I really really do and
it's a pretty overkill for being a you
know this is an old Titan not anyone I
think it's a pretty damn overkill piece
of a machinery but that's how we like to
do it around here anyway once again ice
so I feel really bad about the
two-parter I don't like doing multi
parts when I can avoid it but this time
I couldn't avoid it
alright guys the next part here will be
me putting together the rest of the loop
so it will be all water cooling related
on the wet wet bench aspect of it and
then we'll do a review of the formal
review of the case once it's all
together I just thought I would vlog
today it is the best part of putting the
two putting two things together that we
love making a video and of getting work
done and doing the build at the same
time alright guys thanks for watching as
always I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
