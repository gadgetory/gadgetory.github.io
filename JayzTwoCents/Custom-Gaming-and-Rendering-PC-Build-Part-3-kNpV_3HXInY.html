know what's funny as I'm trying to cram
just about as much work as I put in to
read miss well maybe not as much but I'm
putting quite a bit of time into this
build in a very short amount of time I'm
working all day and most of the night to
get this done like I said because I want
to be down very much but a couple of
things happened since my last video so
let's go ahead and talk about that
here we go guys day three of project
skunk works now I'm puttin there's a lot
of time going to this build in such a
short amount of time see with red mist I
got to work on it for a few hours and
then walk away from it for days at a
time depending on what my workload was
but this computer is my workload so I've
been working day and night on this thing
so I'm cramming about as much work as I
did in two months on red mist into about
four days here yeah I got to take a long
enough break last night to go enjoy some
fireworks on some skydivers and some
aerial flybys and stuff over at the
fourth wood fourth of July celebration
the University of Redlands and then from
there came back home went to bed woke up
and here we are again so let's go and
talk about what's changed since part two
okay so here's where we left off we've
got the upper rad unfortunately we
couldn't do the push pull as we
mentioned but that's okay
lower rad installed as the reservoirs
we'll be doing today but you know these
labels are these logos right here on all
the fans
I hate Corsairs logo and I don't want it
anywhere near this build in fact the the
entire logo just clashes because it's
white and everything has that logo all
the fans so I've got some 3m die nock
carbon fiber paper or sticker paper
people use this on cars and stuff and I
basically took an inch and a half
scrapbooking hole punch or round punch
and punched out inch and a half stickers
here that I can now stick on to the fans
and as you can see they will cover up
quite nicely on there so I won't have to
look at these logos going around anymore
we'll have some nice carbon fiber in
there so I cut enough of them to do the
front of all the fans that show and then
fronts and backs of the the other fans
so as you can see right there
it's not too blurry so it's going to
cover up all those logos like that so we
want to look at that crap anymore so
let's go ahead and get these things
stuck on and see how it looks now the
reason why I'm doing this is not like I
hate course--a or anything like that I
mean I have some things I don't like
about Corsair but their fans are not
theirs their logos and their stickers
are not centered on the fans so when the
fan is spinning you see that how it's
all off-balance and that bothers me
now here's what I just put my
sticker on right there and you can see
that when it spins that is a lot more
desirable than the one on the right fact
a little bit shimmer even looks kind of
neat so yeah I'm not a fan of that at
all well it set me back about two hours
and the time it took to go and get the
the circle punch from the craft store
and stuff but I think it was time well
spent not having those white Corsair
logos just made everything look so much
cleaner alright so today we're working
on getting well I guess done so we're
gonna get the reservoirs mounted we're
going to get the hardline ran and I've
got a pretty cool way of doing this I
think I think it's a little fantastic
the way I'm going to do this so we've
got our our holes marked right there for
being able to know where to put the
pass-through fittings and then I've got
to yank all this out so I can drill in
there without actually getting metal
shavings everywhere and then so I don't
know exactly what I'm gonna do next
I guess hand gestures are cool well that
will just go and do it and figure out
what happens next one other thing - I
forgot to mention what came in the mail
today my loot row customs round SATA
cables - and yellow and - in black as
well as some fan extensions so yeah
these are going to really add to the
look of the build these round citas love
round cables are so much easier to route
so yeah that's gonna look good in there
- okay remove the motherboard and
everything out of there the bottom rad
pretty gutted case now because we're
gonna drill some holes
okay so the pass-through fittings are
installed these two are for the GPU and
you'll notice this one's slightly off to
the side and not quite as linear as
those you'll see why in a minute why
that fitting is slightly off but I think
you guys are going to like it now I'm
gonna get the reservoirs mounted so I
can get these pass-through fittings done
and then we can start actually plumbing
up the hard line alright so put the
motherboard and the graphics cards back
in for a test fit and you can see how
these fittings right right here are
going to pass straight through into the
bottom through this pass-through
fittings and they're going to be tubed
up down there but I think you can see
now what this one was is for the CPU
loop I'm going to have an extremely
efficient just one tube out and down
through there so there's only three
tubes coming down here and then one tube
going from the inlet there to the red
and the rest of the red stuffs me behind
the motherboard tray so the only thing
visible over here is going to be these
tubes right here it's going to look
really good I think so now I've got to
get my reservoirs ready to go and I'm
just going to basically boring mount
them to the back wall because I'm too
lazy to do anything custom there so I'm
using this of this t-square it's not
really a tee but using this square ruler
right here with my leveler and stuff and
we're just going to be marking out the
holes there to make sure everything is
straight and squared so time to mount
the reservoirs do their pass-through
fittings and then we can get started
down here all right there we go now the
reservoirs are installed nothing
exciting here really it's just mounted
to the back wall now I got to do the
fittings in the past through is one two
three four more of them it's hard to
drill into this aluminum even though
it's aluminum it's really thick and it's
it feels like drilling into steel but
it's not it's just K slabs uses such
high quality aluminum that it actually
takes a lot of effort to drill through
this you can kind of see how thick it is
if you look right here you see that
right here you can kind of see how thick
this hole it is actually pretty thick
it's not just that then
crap that main manufacturers use in mass
production this is all built by well
pretty much to order all right I got the
lower pass-throughs done for the
reservoirs right here and I realized
something I was doing my counts based on
red mist and I forgot on red mist I only
had one tube on each reservoir going
through the ground right there and so
I'm off by two fittings so I'm too
fitting short to finishing this build so
now I'm going to do a rush order with
frozen CPU and as soon as it will get
here is mid next week so getting this
thing done this weekend is not an option
but I can get pretty much everything
done except for two of those fittings so
I'm going to keep going anyway but man
just the importance of checking double
checking and counting and counting and
counting again can't even stress how
important it is and I'm mad right now
because now I have to pay rushed rush
order and expedited shipping for
something I already bought from the same
company few weeks back so all right well
like I showed now that I have all the
pastures done these are the two fittings
that are missing right there so babe Oh
anyway you can see it all coming
together now it's looking pretty dang
nice so getting my passes down here fit
it out I use Chrome or nickel plated
fittings down here on the bottom where
they don't really show for the ridge or
the soft tubing that's going to go to
the back and plumb up down here because
it's cheaper for my sponsor to send me
these this bits power was obviously Hunt
sponsored but that's a mine there but
I'm also getting this one here ready to
go so I'm going to start getting some of
the some of the work down here on the
bottom ready to go some of these tubes
connected that I can do now without
mounting the pumps and then I think I'm
going to be done here for for a bit so I
get kind of tired and since I know I
can't be done till mid next week now I
guess I'm not in that big of a rush
anymore okay so I'm pretty much done for
the day
just kind of show you how the loop is
going to go now
so this reservoir right here is for the
graphics card or graphics cards this
reservoir right here is going to be for
the CPU now you can see under the bottom
here I showed you earlier I had some
black fittings here those have been
changed out for
the 45 in chrome right here like I said
I don't care that they're chrome because
they don't show so that I started to
plumb right there now let's go ahead and
show you how the loop is going to run
and I think this is going to look really
sleek because hardly anything is going
to show now graphics card is going to
this is the graphics cards GPU or the
GPU loop got a game and talked my brain
is so fried from all the work today so
it's going to come down through here and
that's going to feed into the pump the
pump it's going to go out to the
radiator which is going to be over here
the a radiator is going to go out to
here this guy right here
it's going to go up through the cards in
parallel come back out and then go all
the way around and up into there now the
middle guy here is the CPU loop and it's
going to go right through here through
into the pump it's going to go out of
the pump behind the motherboard tray
through soft tubing into the right
radiator it's going to come out of the
radiator down over straight into there
it's going to come out up there come
straight down through that fitting and
then through that fitting it's going to
meet up over here with this guy in fact
I might have to make this a 90 an
extension and a 90 like I did there so
it can go straight across up into the
reservoir then back through so that's
going to be the loop so anyway you guys
are pretty much done oh and there's the
let it be a look pretty hot so there it
is starting to look more like stealth
mist instead of skunk works but either
way I like the way it's turned out
alright so we're done for today I'm
going to order up the fittings and then
hopefully we'll be done by Wednesday of
next week probably tomorrow mount the
pumps or something like that not sure if
I'll grab the video camera for that
simply because it's such a simple thing
to do but guys it's been part 2 of
project skunk works I hope you guys have
enjoyed it I've got some other little
custom things in store for this just
tiny little things that I think will
make a difference but as always guys
follow on Twitter you can see some
Instagram photos of this on Instagram as
it's happening and I will see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
