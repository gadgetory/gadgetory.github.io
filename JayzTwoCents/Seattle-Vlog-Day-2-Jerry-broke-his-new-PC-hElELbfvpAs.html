there I'm just playing on my 3d printer
look with what seems to be the problem
ah just do driver issues drivers too
must be new AMD close robo or that's a
long DSLR you got there yeah but it's so
incredibly stable is it now oh my god
extreme plus so Jerry has easily one of
the nicest cameras on the market 5d mark
3 is dirty they don't judge me his
follow focus is extremely hard to turn
oh my god I could never do this oh
somewhere a canon fanboys crying
meanwhile he's still here just had to
get the Robo r1 to work he's trying to
print me a GoPro Hero 3 plus like an
open-air mounts I can access my power
cord and memory cards and microphone
he has my V turned into an Ultimaker
video yeah so everyone keeps saying we
want blogs so I just edit it oh is it
done it is done I just edited day 1
travel vlog it was kind of boring and
uneventful but you guys wanted it so I
guess this is the start of tomorrow's
vlog tonight yes uh this is a success ok
so here's the man cave I'm not gonna do
a 45 minute room tour like Jerry did but
oh God probably a million maybe I don't
right oh so here's his a boob auto
racing simulator which line is clearly
copied so here's his
a 346 inch monitors with this 27-inch
monitor price 4k I like that monitor
I've got one myself I do only test
benches on it
GT Omega chair GT Omega chair clearly
they send this guy a check Jesus oh yeah
and the old computer versus the new
computer that's sexy engraved yeah RC
over there no no you don't that's of my
camera stuff there and then here's his
uh his other computer where his alright
now I saw the video of when Jerry like
showed off this computer earlier in his
YouTube career the coolant was not that
shade of blue
no it didn't yeah it's pretty grody dude
I topped it off today because I had foam
there was actually like faux white
mucousy looking foam floating on top of
the fluid so I saw the pictures you put
up what the inside of that thing looks
like and I'm just gonna pretend that I
never saw them probably shouldn't it's
grown it's terrible for her and then
here's his big ol LED ring lights here
him falling over and tripping over here
oh no okay that's good he
probably would have killed my lens and
then all his random stuff so you guys
get to see what's behind the camera all
but all the stuff that's not cleaned up
yeah that's what the room looks like
what I'm not doing the room tour you
know and all in all though like it still
is seems like organized clutter to me
yeah but I had three days to get it to
this point you already spent more time
than I know three days ago I had to
climb over stuff together my chairs and
in the Star Wars collectibles oh here
that he and mr. Parrillo like to geek
out over and then he's got his retro
gaming stuff down there and has got his
Xbox games and his porn and I got my
meter helmet gee I'm not your father or
am i let's do it
I'm just looking at my P DX land layout
to see we're all be sitting down
I saw loot row we're right there you
Lutra Lutra is that's a sleeping company
- did my original sleeves puget there we
go there we are do her right on the date
no they got two spots
23:24 yes oh my cup is fogging huh now
she's being weird here I kept us fogging
it was ah I am Groot I am Groot
I am Brian prisoners we are root oh
sorry to mean to spoil the ending okay I
need to find what am I looking for this
is where I've been working over here
yeah on this old piece of and she's
not a piece of oh look you can
totally see me in the reflection there
dude do I look like I've been wearing
the same clothes non-stop but all I
brought was a hoodie for warmth and
guess what it's a bit colder here than I
anticipated it to be it's not bad though
this is how fast I can type on this
keyboard but if it was different
keyboard I could type a lot faster
because this keyboard sucks
objet I love with you woohoo we're doing
doer doing the tuber footsteps doing the
to her
dude that's good I'm getting dizzy so
last night Jerry was trying to print me
a GoPro mount for my GoPro and the
rowboat was not playing very nicely now
you guys saw that he was fumbling around
with that trying to figure it all out so
we're going to go ahead and go with a
true tested method that will work with
the Ultimaker is that right yeah
indirect yes that is right Jay that is
exactly what we're gonna do tell us how
you really feel boners
so I want to point out that Gerry is
actually renewing his xsplit licenses I
am does that mean you were gonna
actually be doing some streaming yes of
some sort yes now that now that you have
the new system it's not going to be
streamed simulator with Gerry two and a
half hours or trying to get it to work
well I got a computer the works now so
you know hoping oh man
well all right so we're gonna where he
is trying to get set up for tech talk
over there we're going to host it on his
channel and then I'm going to be over
here researching some topics and stuff
and then I don't know we're going to see
what kind of content we can bring you
today but I guess I better get off this
thing and do a little PSA video for the
channel saying hey come over to barn
achlys nerdgasm for the whatever this
eliza what everything works flawlessly
I'm plugging back Center raining it's
all angry right before we livestream
pieces like the highest stress point of
my egg this esta cub is the plug life we
youtubers know what you're signing up
for the problem is the branding on the
front yeah they pick up our uh there you
go keep your ear got cross fingers J
yeah run zoomed in on it
oh baby come on
I don't want you're just hoping to catch
that irq HotList and they charge it wait
for it uh-oh I think it's a bug check
yeah it's gonna reboot there goes Jesus
dick hole it's ironic only because I
already put the video up saying we're
going live on your channel today Oh on
my channel I think that's the problem
right there not the puget part just the
branding on the front operator ears with
disease all preparing automatic repair
what a world because you took out the
array uh actually I switch this out of
work I'm hoping it's just like a bad
sound of Hoarders really there shouldn't
be the word bad on anything right now
I agree here we go okay ready sig ready
you ready
don't you turn oranges on bitch
do it ah let it repair it I'll just keep
it and continuing ice already got it
everything just worked for all the time
like the world I guess not laughing
because of the amount of people who are
like you're doing their justice as their
computer I'm only coming up here to see
what you could possibly do to break it
thanks bug jacked right there so wait a
second so the SATA or the SATA
controller and this computer does not
appear to be compatible with my my Sam's
digital hardware raid array but you just
unplugged it didn't you yeah no no it's
uh plug-in what are you I'm not smart
enough to actually troubleshoot yeah
so I'm plug it you don't have a choice
now you can't get in the operating
system unplug it detected precious on
the computer right there so yeah it's
off doing no more yeah it stopped going
man this is the part that people love to
see though the real world behind the
stuff like behind the scenes really
human problems well the good news is
that race supports USB 3.0 so if this
doesn't work I can still plug it in USB
3.0 it's just I would have preferred to
use a faster faster throughput yeah but
not by much I think USB 3 and SATA 3 are
actually pretty close and throughput on
yeah but over the course of the year how
much time you get away some slower
transfer rates oh ok ok you don't think
about that kind of stuff like here J I
don't care this is this is clot this is
gold this is gold
it's really weird I for the record I
don't I don't think this is Puget sprog
no it's nice sprites and digital because
they're there shit's pretty yeah but
this is what happens when you go with
like brand-new cutting-edge
bleeding-edge stuff like that how many
people do you think have this dual Xeon
system on that board running that array
to have troubleshooted this dude if I
have to reinstall the system before we
go down there I will shoot myself we're
gonna do we're gonna think the why
are you not working we're gonna do tech
talk on this computer over here I guess
it's rebooting again something got
corrupted I mean what else could it be
there's nothing else bugged into this
thing okay this time let it actually do
a repair don't you just keep hitting
continue let it repair I've done this
plenty of times on next 99 where you
gotta let it go through the motions have
it be like nope everything's good then
it'll boot okay so which option do I
select all I've done is push continue
okay so oh
so say an exit and continue to anyone
that's my only option restore point it
restored Zanu oh and all this from that
and all we did was install I explained
plug in webcam ah all right I'll stop
torturing now I'm gonna turn this off
and we'll see what were you try to fix
this out hey we had a choice or a crunch
time okay so all I did was turn off the
camera we did nothing and it booted but
now we have no center display
it did turn off yeah actually probably
right yeah
okay yeah yeah we booted the computer
hmm okay here we go Center just like I'm
back so do you want your around tells
work quickly what happened I don't know
well no J I rebooted as several times
unplugged everything and it somehow
managed to find its way back into 8.1
alright so now we're actually gonna get
to have Tech Talk after all yeah yeah
now we have to make some graphics only
that you can totally see me back there
did you do try not to fall over break
your cherry yeah don't break my
