bringing you another video here on the
tech channel about well tech because
that's what we do here at least that's
what I try and do now when I built skunk
works a few months back a lot of people
recognized and kind of called out the
fact that I just sort of glossed right
over the hard drives and I didn't really
mention the hard drives when it came to
skunk works and the reality is the
storage situation on my main rig is
pretty atrocious to say the least
now just to answer some questions here
about what hard drives I'm currently
running guys I'm telling you right now
it's disappointing in fact I'm probably
going to lose some community respect
with what went in there because I'm not
running any raids or anything like that
in fact I've got two SSDs a 256 a data
SX 900 which I will be replacing with a
Samsung 840 Evo a 500 gigabyte pretty
soon here a Plextor 256 gigabyte that's
the m5 I am running a 2 terabyte Toshiba
Drive and a 1 terabyte Toshiba Drive and
that's it and as you as you can probably
imagine I'm running out of space very
fast when it comes to the amount of
storage I need to bring you guys this
lovely HD content in fact on average a
10 minute video takes about 35 gigabytes
of raw footage we're talking about the
b-roll and all the outtakes and that
sort of stuff about 35 gigabytes per
video and considering I have over 400
videos you can do the math on how bad my
storage situation is so recently I was
contacted by Western Digital and they
said hey J we love the channel we love
the content is there anything we can do
for you and it was all of a sudden like
the clouds opened and everything just
so Western Digital said yeah man we got
you covered we'll go ahead and send you
one of the my cloud ex2 Nazz servers it
is a network accessible storage and it's
got its own processor and it's actually
pretty cool now this is the four
terabyte version it's got 2 2 terabyte
Western Digital Reds in there
and it's got its own software you can
access it from iPad or Android or iOS
devices from other computers from
obviously your main computer and it's
pretty neat has its own software you can
do raid configs and whatnot so we're
going to go ahead and crack this bad boy
open take a quick look at it and then
we're going to set it up and see if it's
really as plug-and-play as they claim
that it is now when you first open up
the box right at the top there's a
concierge service card here with a 800
number or 855 number right on top to
give you some support if you need it you
have your actual nas drive right here
let's just upside down so she packed in
there pretty tightly so we've got a box
of accessories and we've got the navs
itself now as you can see the nez it's
pretty small in fact it looks bigger on
the box this is it right here it's
pretty damn small it looks really nice
actually it's it's almost like a
gunmetal color hell it even matches
skunkworks that's pretty awesome right
on the top you can see you have got your
plug in place storage hard drives on
there I'm sorry your hot-swap drives on
there I'm going to go ahead and leave
these in there for now guys I've read
the manual but - 2 terabyte Western
Digital Red's pretty awesome if you ask
me
and then I'm assuming this is probably
going to have maybe a cat 5 or a cat 6
and some power yep there we go we got a
power brick right here and we have got
our Ethernet cable right here so that's
it that's all that's in the box I'm
gonna go ahead and plug this thing in
now and we will see just how easily this
thing is set up on the network and we'll
start archiving some data although you
guys won't get to be a part of that
because I take data security very
serious serious business transition
well guys I gotta say that the Western
Digital my cloud ex2 is very very simple
to use in fact I've been playing around
it for a while now which is why the
sudden wardrobe change because I was
like oh I forgot to record the last part
of the video because I got so involved
in setting up the nez and I was having
so much fun with that right setup is
very easy you can do J bud you can do
striped you could raid 0 raid 1 you can
do spanned and I went ahead and moved it
from a raid 0 which it came pre setup as
a raid 0 into a spand setup now I don't
need the super fast transfer rate of a
raid and I don't need the redundancy of
a raid because I'm not actually using
that as my operating system drives
obviously actually want as much storage
as I possibly can since it really is
going to be nothing more than storage
and archiving of my youtube videos and a
lot of my raw content that I use when I
do my editing so I want all 4 terabytes
available to me not to terabytes in a
raid setup but you can set up multiple
users you can allocate which parts of
the hard driver there's give them access
to certain files you have shared files
which are public and it's really cool so
if you want to give different file
folders availability to different users
in your family or maybe your office they
you can even lock them down to only
having accesses to the folders that you
give them access to so it's really neat
there's actual data encryption on there
is automatic backups there's even
automatic like HTTP file fetching on
there so that if you're constantly
pulling down files or something for work
you can even set a timer on there where
it will go to these HTTP settings with
these usernames and you can actually set
it up to go and fetch files and download
them automatically you can hook up USB
storage devices to this so that you have
some more redundancy when it comes to
file backups and there's just so much
flexibility in this it's more than just
a network accessible storage it is
really a mini server that is just
accessed on your storage it's so much
more than just a basic nadz it's got
full functionality the dashboard is easy
to use it's very intuitive updating the
software is very simple in fact I needed
a firmware update all I did was click
one button and off it went it did
everything by itself so guys if you're
looking for having a very simple nav
solution you've got to consider looking
at the
iCloud from Western Digital I mean guys
that's what Western Digital does this is
what they do this is their thing storage
I loved everything about the software in
fact there's not one thing I found in
this software that can't do that I wish
it did in fact actually there's one
thing and it might even be able to do it
I just haven't found a way to do it if
there is a way oh if there's a way to
set up users to where they have access
to their own folders but if you can
limit the amount of access they can have
to the Nazz in terms of storage you
could say user a only gets 200 gigabytes
of storage and user 3 gets 100 gigabytes
whatever that would be really cool I
haven't found a way to do it it might be
possible but I recommend heading on over
to the Western Digital website or look
down the description you can find some
Amazon links if you guys are interested
in purchasing this drive for purchasing
this drive for yourself or somebody else
so guys thanks for watching this video
going head on over to Facebook or
Twitter if you have any questions it's
the best place to get ahold of me as
always guys I really really appreciate
your views it helps us channel a whole
bunch you guys have no idea where this
channel would be right now if it wasn't
for you guys actually I do would be
absolutely nowhere now I got you guys to
thank for the success of this channel so
as always guys I hope to see you in the
next one
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
