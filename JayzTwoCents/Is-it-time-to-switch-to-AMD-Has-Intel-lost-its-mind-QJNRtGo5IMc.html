if you ever wanted that downtown feel
where you're going to get it in this
video because I'm done stopping and
waiting for these loud asses outside
anyway we're going to go guys the title
of this video has never been more
relevant than it is today and it's not
clickbait it's a real question I want
you guys to start asking yourself
because the Intel X 299 launch is
literally just like the collective what
the fuck heard round the world from the
people who are covering this now last
week at Computex intel announced
officially announced its X 299 lineup
now it's something that if you've been
paying attention to had your ear to the
ground or looking at leaks it looks like
the leaks were pretty accurate
specifically regarding 2k be like X CPU
so we're gonna talk about a few things
very high-level I'm not going to go into
a lot of depth about feature sets on X
299 we'll be doing reviews about that in
the future to talk more about what you
get with X 299 but my concern here is
Intel's strategy that's the point of
today's video because let's start with
cable a KX KB Lake X guys is the exact
same CPU plopped on to the more
expensive 2066 socket which means you
now have to use an X to 99 platform or X
to 99 motherboard to use main stream CPU
the 7740 or the 77 40 k NV 76 40 K they
also removed a GPU which really kind of
sucks because that was a really good
tool to use for debugging bad GPUs
reflashing BIOS on GPUs allowing you to
even get your system up and running and
all of your drivers installed and your
OS installed without even needing a GPU
if you were say waiting for that part to
come to mail or you're just holding off
on buying one for whatever you could
still be up and running not anymore
they've removed that feature it even has
a higher TDP at 112 Watts versus 91 on
the mainstream platform so why they've
made that move I guess I don't
understand I guess I can kind of see why
maybe in a stretch this is the case
let's say you buy X 2 9 9 platform but
you can't afford one of the new skylake
X CPUs which can cost upwards of $2,000
we'll get to there trust me
but you just only have 340 bucks to
spend on a CPU you can get the CPU have
the motherboard and then upgrade it
later whereas if you
we're on mainstream anyone to go into
the extreme platform you'd have to
upgrade everything but that doesn't make
any sense to me that seems really stupid
because I would personally want the most
for my money I could possibly get at the
time of building my system then
sacrificing on something like buying a
motherboard full of features that I
can't even use for the sake of buying a
CPU that I'm just going to upgrade later
heck no I'd rather save a little bit of
money on the motherboard and then buy
better GPU if you're going to be doing
gaming but that really doesn't make much
sense because I would never recommend to
someone to buy a motherboard full of
features that's more expensive but they
can't use on a thought that they might
upgrade their CPU in the future now
let's talk about future upgrades here so
it's obviously very weird to me the
mainstream i7 and even an i5 without
hyper threading it only uses dual
channels going to exist on a platform
designed around quad Channel and all
sorts of features that you're not even
going to be able to use but let's talk
about coffee Lake here real quick we've
got rumors of coffee lake s being pulled
in three-quarters it was supposed to
come out in the beginning of 2018 but
rumor has a guy this is rumor I have no
information I'm not in cahoots with
Intel I have none of this information
I'm breaking in the NDA's here but rumor
has it that they pulled it in all the
way to August well what month is this
this is June this is June right now and
the other rumor is that coffee lake is
going to have six core 12 thread CPUs
existing on mainstream platform so now
you've got KB like X with 4 cores 8
threads existing on 299 X 299 that's
going to be slower in terms of
computational power with all of its
threads then something is going to exist
possibly in two or three months on
mainstream platform essentially
obsoleting your CPU and making the
argument I just made that maybe you want
to upgrade you CPU in the future too
like the extreme on the X 299 not make a
lot of sense because you could save more
money by just staying on main stream now
we know no pricing up that's going to be
and we've still that's a rumor whether
or not to pull it all the way to August
but that's just a hypothetical like what
is Intel doing now the whole rumor about
them pulling in coffee like
three-quarters could potentially mean
that yeah although they would never
admit it
they are definitely concerned about the
slight market share that AMD is gaining
back with Rison especially with thread
Ripper now let's talk about the Red
River Red River is supposed to be up to
16 cores 32 threads
what for gigahertz ish on the core clock
is we still have to wait and see it that
is a pretty big deal on there x3 99
motherboards which is going to be an LG
a motherboard just create pretty cool
the pins are on the seat on the socket
not on the CPU anymore which is
something that's always been like an AMD
thing showing us now that AMD is here to
play they mean business and Intel I
honestly feel like they have no idea
what to do because they have experienced
more than a decade of just being on top
by themselves head in the clouds and I
think just blind to what was actually
sneaking up on them all along so now
they're panicking another thing that
seems like panic here is the fact that
the 18 core 36 thread CPU that they
talked about at Computex most of the
motherboard manufacturers I talked to
and I'm not going to name any names but
let's just say a few of the few of the
reps that are in the know told me they
were like we didn't we were like what
the fuck is this we had no idea this was
coming so that's why you're not seeing
it potentially coming out with the rest
of the launches whether it's kind of a
staggered launch because that to me
tells me it is a direct response to
thread Ripper obviously there's two
extra cores on there because they have
to stay ahead right but a price tag of
$2,000 let's just say hypothetically
that thread Ripper 16 core 32 thread is
$1,000 now I don't want to toot my own
horn but I was like spot-on with the
pricing on my anticipate pricing on the
1800 X and $500 competing with its
thousand dollar sixty nine hundred K CPU
of that was on X 99 is it's a no-brainer
if you're buying a new system it makes
no sense to not consider the 1800 X over
the 1600 K more so today than even when
I made that video the reason why I
didn't stick with the 1800 X in my day
to day was because at the time when it
first launched there was unfortunately a
lot of stability and compatibility
issues with bios's between the
motherboards and memory and memory
support and memory validation it was a
whole new platform that needed time to
mature well guess what we're like three
years or three years three months
removed from that the motherboard
manufacturers are assuring me that the
stability is there and
that they have we have nothing but the
out loss of confidence recommending of
course you know their mother were
manufacturers are going to say that but
I told them about some of the issues
that I had and they were like nope those
problems are gone trust me they're fixed
the problem was we didn't get enough
time to spend with the working CPU
samples between when we got them and
when launch was it was a disaster and
they're begging AMD don't fuck up the
red ripper but yet so I'm probably going
to start playing around with the rising
stuff again which has me very excited
about the idea of Red River especially
as a content creator being able to do
things like render videos and have
massive amount of course or live
streaming and other things all at the
same time now let's just say
hypothetically that cost half of what
this 18 core 36 thread is going to cost
from Intel it makes very little sense to
even consider it
admittedly one of the drawbacks though
to the current rise in lineup is the
fact that it's only dual channel I would
have liked to have seen it be quad
channel because then it would directly
compete with everything that Intel
currently has to offer but thread
rippers will get to 16 cores quad
channel memory in 64 PCIe lanes check
this out even the top tier offerings
from Intel are only going to be 44 PCIe
lanes now I say only but when you've got
things like n dot to being able to be
utilized now on raid cards on PCIe
you've got your expansion cards I mean
all kinds of things use PCIe interface
now because it's just faster and better
than using things like theta so now that
you've got more PCIe lanes available on
AMD that's obviously a bonus and a plus
and a give this checkmark to AMD on that
one here's the problem though we're
going PCIe lanes check this out B 59 60
X the first extreme CPU that was
available on the X 99 was a 40 Lane CPU
a 59 30 K 6 core 12 thread 40 Lane CPU
5820k was a 6 core 12 thread 28 Lane CT
ok that makes sense
even at that time three years ago two
years ago whatever was we were kind of
scratching our heads going that was a
weird trade all that was a weird way to
reduce the cost of cutting off PCIe
lanes ok well strange fast-forward now
the 6900 K again D 8 core 16 thread has
40 PCIe lanes and then of course the 69
50 X the 10 core 20 thread 40
and then down the stack they would
reduce down to 28 towards the more entry
level to the extreme platform but check
this up the new eight core right
whatever they're calling a camera with a
calling guide Sumi numbers I'm sorry but
the new eight core 16 thread has 28 PCIe
LAN
so that means that means Intel has made
a conscious decision to take something
that's been supported all through the
years and now suddenly chop off things
on it that force you into buying a more
expensive CPU making it just obvious
that intelligent or cash grabs that's
really unfortunate it really is
unfortunate because there's lots of
trade-off when you go down to 28 PCIe
lanes if you want to start using things
like a PCIe interface for MDOT to drive
sound cards network cards capture cards
whatever your your workflow may be so
that's a trade off that was just like
Intel which is like whatever we don't
care that they know obviously because
it's it's in your face it's it's obvious
that they did this but the crazy thing
is that it looks like the 18 core CPU
variant is only forty four lanes giving
AMD another checkmark when it comes to
winning again the PCIe lanes over Intel
so that's why this particular video is
just I wanted to plant the seed in you
guys's mind I wanted you guys to be eyes
open to this and go yeah what is until
doing so if you're currently on Intel
though even mainstream or x99 it
probably doesn't make a whole lot of
sense to even consider upgrading now
obviously I have not got my hands on any
of the new stuff from Intel it's not
even out yet or the thread Ripper stuff
from AMD but you can bet I'm going to
even if I have to buy them myself it
been till decides like we don't want to
support that J guy anymore he said
things that we don't like whatever I
don't care I'm going to go buy the CPUs
it makes no difference to me because
these reviews need to be done once I get
my hands on it guys you will see some in
depth comparisons but all I wanted to do
with this video was get you thinking I
want to get you thinking that this is a
good time because Intel had a Intel
needed to respond to Eisen but I think
their response is a yeah I don't know
they've been getting into grandpa's
medicine cabinet
liquor cabinet if you ask me because
they just really seem to be kind of lost
over there which is a good thing I guess
is good thing for AMD as long as they
don't screw it up on there and with
their marketing and their availability
whatever you
tell me what you think tell me in the
comments down below if you think I'm
being silly with this or if you think
I'm actually asking a question that's
valid this is not a fanboy ISM thing
this has nothing to do a fanboy fanboy
isms aside I don't do fanboy okay so
this is I've always been asked Jay would
you use AMD again my answer has always
been if they have the better product
absolutely so anyway food for thought
guys tell me what you think subscribe if
you've never been here before please go
to Twitter whatever just let me know
your comments I want I kind of feel like
I don't know if I'm the crazy one here I
don't think so
but anyway you tell me alright guys
thanks for watching we'll see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
