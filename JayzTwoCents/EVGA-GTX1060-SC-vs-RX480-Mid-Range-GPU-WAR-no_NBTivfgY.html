and I've got good news for you because
if you're a mainstream gamer and you've
got about 250 dollars to spend on a
graphics card and you just haven't known
what to buy the RX 480 or the rumored
gtx 1060 i've got good news for you
today's launch day whether you're
looking for a pump reservoir custom GPU
block or a complete loop and a box
ALPA Kools wide range of products can
make your next water cooling adventure
and easy one click the link in the
description for more details so let's
get some of the business out of the way
first this is a gtx 1060 founders
edition it's got a price point of 299
dollars and an MSRP of 249 I hope to see
more board partners down around that
$249 price range it's got 192 bit memory
bus 6 gigabytes of gddr5 19 or 12
hundred and eighteen nineteen twenty
twelve hundred and eighty CUDA cores
1920 was on the 1070 in 2560 was on the
1080 yeah they're kind of trolling us
with the resolution matching CUDA cores
right but anyway and it's got a boost
clock of 1.7 gigahertz out of the box
obviously if the temperatures are in
check and the power limit is in control
then it will boost much farther than
that as you'll see in this video check
this out though it is a very very short
PCB which the cooler overhangs like
almost half and another length of the
Carter that it's like almost 50%
overhang which i think is kind of a
missed opportunity in my opinion when it
comes to this card because although they
want to keep the founder style cooler on
there and the blower blower hangs off
the card so the entire card is a giant
heatsink this card would be perfect for
small form-factor builds ITX builds and
other things where you want to keep the
package small ah how much you guys
thought I was going to make a joke there
didn't you ha I can control myself but
anyway this card unfortunately does not
support SLI stay tuned into the video
we'll talk about that a little bit
deeper but first we're going to go ahead
and get into the benchmarks before we
saw the benchmarks or something I want
to say one yes I've got the founders
edition card right there at $299 but
fortunately I have the two hundred and
$59 EVGA GTX 1060 superclocked which is
the same exact PCB
as this one right here but they didn't
make the cooler longer they kept it nice
and small it's got a single ball bearing
fan on here doesn't have any flashy LEDs
that light up it doesn't have a
backplate I don't expect any of that
stuff at this price point at $259 if
they had added a bat a back plate and
LED it would have pushed the price up at
least 2025 more dollars which I don't
think makes sense at this price point
let's get as much performance as we can
for every dollar we spend and let's make
it count especially if you are the
budget gamer that's got a very very
specific budget you have to stick to so
for the benchmarks this is the card
you're going to see it is the exact same
PCB but it is a super clock version so
it boosts up to eighteen hundred and
sixty megahertz and so again with this
cooler I expect it to boost even farther
than that just like all of my other and
video cards did but I'm expecting
extremely low thermals very low power
draw with a single six pin power they
advertise 120 watt TDP I have no way of
testing whether or not it's pulling too
much from the PCIe lanes guys I don't
have equipment to do that but I will say
that the 120 watt TDP means that it's
not pulling the max power from either
the socket which is rated at 75 watts or
the six pin which is rated up to 75
watts for 150 watt TDP so fortunately as
is same boost farther this TDP is going
to go up so as it goes up it does look
like it's actually going to stay well
within spec but again I have a way of
testing that one other thing to point
out before we move into the benchmarks
is I don't have my rx 480 right now so
the benchmarks you're going to see for
that are the same benchmarks I showed
you in that video at launch with launch
drivers my card right now is uh with
Edgar over at Tec source who's doing his
crossfire video since he was kind enough
to send me his card I sent him mine
which unfortunately for me landed during
the GTX 1060 launch so I can't go and
test out the new drivers at AMD has
launched to kind of correct the PCIe
power draw issue which they say in some
instances could actually raise the
performance a little bit I have no way
of testing that right now so it is what
it is I don't have the newest drivers
but I don't expect performance to be
much different all they did was change
the way the power is drawn from the
power plug versus the socket so anyway
what all that said let's move in to the
shootout because I know you guys want to
see this transition
so there you go guys those are the
members um I - if you're surprised by
those numbers you're not alone I'm
surprised as well I expected this card
to be a lot closer to the RX 480 I
really did not expect it to outperform
it to the level that it did at least in
the titles that that I've got in my
testing suite and the fact that it did
it much quieter much cooler much less
power draw says a lot for the Pascal
architecture especially the GP 106 core
considering this thing never Quinnie pub
the 60s whatsoever even in 4k and it
stayed in the low 60s at 1080p in 1440p
but this thing is more than capable of
1440p gaming again all the benchmarks
you saw were like higher map either high
or max settings which is really going to
tax the card even
msaa on on the high resolution so that
ought to tell you something so I'm going
to put on my subjective hat for a second
here let me do that real quickly I think
this one actually matches a lot better
the card isn't perfect and let me tell
you why it doesn't support SLI no SLI
fingers right there there's been a lot
of rumors about why that is in fact
there was so much buzz on reddit about
this that Nvidia actually came out with
a statement saying that they did not
feel that mainstream gamers were
interested in SLI and they were
basically leaving SLI is an exclusive to
their enthusiast level graphics cards
1070 and 1080 I find it kind of
unfortunate because I think a lot of
people find themselves in a situation
where they can afford one of these today
and maybe Christmas time or birthday
money or graduation money or whatever
they can buy another one of these and
get a lot better performance I mean SLI
two-way SLI and two a crossfire tend to
actually scale pretty good as special n
triple-a titles today micro stutter is
not as much of an issue as it used to be
in driver support is a lot better so why
did in video lock it out well like I
said they they are leaving that as an
exclusive now for the 70 and 80 series
graphics cards moving forward which is I
think unfortunate but I've got a little
bit more of a tinfoil hat Theory here
and I think the reason might be two of
these might outperform a gtx 1080 I
would assume that the GeForce experience
feedback given to Nvidia lets them know
you know the profiles and the setups
that people are using just like the
Steam
hardware statistics show I guess in
video would know how many people are
actually SL lying lower in graphics
cards I have no way of seeing that data
so I don't know if what they said is
true
that's up to you guys to decide but if
you're looking at buying one of these
and one of these in the future and
putting them together unfortunately you
can't do that but if you just want a
single graphics card that can absolutely
blow the doors off of triple-a titles at
1080p and 1440p and high or max settings
it's definitely a card worth looking at
it does it quiet efficient and pretty
much silent anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video sound off in the
comments I really really want to know
what you guys think about the SLI thing
I think it's a mistake personally but
then again I'm not the company so what I
say is just my opinion
I want curious as to what you guys have
to say about it sound off in the
comments or hit me up on Twitter or
Facebook you can find the links to those
down below and as always guys thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
