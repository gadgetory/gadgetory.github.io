coming at you with an amazing
announcement more amazing than any
announcement I've ever announced in the
announcements of all the announcements
on this channel have been announced no
I'm not getting another sponsor it's
smart asses it's the fact that Jays two
cents is now followed by dot-com I have
an official website that's right guys
Jay's two cents com is now a real thing
it is live right now you can head on
over there and register sign up for the
forums you can read the tech blogs you
can read get them information about the
videos you can see teasers of what's
coming up on the channel and there's a
couple of things that's gonna be
happening over there I'm gonna be having
some articles going up on a regular
basis we're gonna be talking about
things over there that I may not
necessarily get to do a video on but I
could at least bring you guys
information about but on the forums
which I'll admit they need some work I'm
not a huge fan of the way the forums are
set up right now but I wanted to get you
guys in a community that you could go to
now so when it comes to the content on
the website it's gonna be growing over
time so bear with it and give me ideas
of things do you think that should be on
the website but it's also gonna give you
guys a place to help grow the community
and help each other out
you're gonna see in the forum's places
where you can go and talk about your
hardware to talk about problems you may
be having when you need some help on
fixing something and you don't know
where to turn and there's also a place
for you guys to make video suggestions
on things you think J's two cents or
this community should be covering here
on YouTube so go ahead and head on over
there and register this entire process
would not have been possible without the
help of a fellow youtuber here that has
just been I don't even have words to
express how friendly he's been with me
and helping me through this because I
have not built a website in at least 15
years that particular person is Logan
over a text syndicate he reached out to
me and he's been just an absolute
amazing advocate through this whole
process I have him to thank entirely so
please do me a favor look down in the
description you'll find a link to his
channel if you've never heard of him you
need to go over there tech syndicate as
anim√©es
channel and a link to their website
trust me guys Logan is a stand-up guy
and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be
bringing you this website right now so
I'm done talking head on over to the
website I hope to see you guys over
there and as always I'll see you guys on
my website</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
