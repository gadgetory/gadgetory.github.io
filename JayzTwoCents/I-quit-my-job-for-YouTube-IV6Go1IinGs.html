just going to want to have a chat with
you here no bullet points no scrip no
nothing just me talking so forgive me if
this gets a bit fragmented and tends to
kind of go all over the place which I
tend to do I tend to ramble a lot and
it's kind of difficult when I don't have
some thing in front of me keeping me on
track but that's kind of the point in
today's video I want to talk about how
the last year being self-employed in
this YouTube space has actually been how
its treated me some of the plans moving
forward and basically just have a chat
with you guys it's been a long time
since we've done a video like this and I
think it's time
next time we had the talk so some of you
may know the story already some of you
may not so I'll keep it really short but
in August 26 2012 I started my youtube
channel on a dare because a friend of
mine Josh aka holiday doc and the MLG
Call of Duty Cod casting seen someone
across one of my live streams I was
doing to show close-quarters expansion
for battlefield 3 to coconut monkey
while he was on a family vacation it
could be home to play it
I had one viewer it was coconut my
detective technically - I was watching
so it said - but anyway Josh happened to
stumble into one of my streams and
thought I was hilarious and entertaining
and he said I should start a YouTube
channel and I was like dude that's
stupid who the hell would watch a
YouTube channel about computer stuff I
mean I know there was that that that
Linus guy out there but I know he
clearly bought it all of his subs but
after spending a couple months
convincing me I finally decided to go
ahead and do it
basically like I said on a dare
fast-forward now three and a half years
later it's my job so obviously when I
started my channel on August 26th and
then fast forward to April 2015 when I
actually left my job in between there I
was constantly asked by followers and
fans of the channel if I would ever quit
my job for YouTube and something I said
over and over and over again was I would
never quit my job for YouTube
that's stupid people who do that are
stupid why on earth would you put your
financial security in the hands of
someone else and I one other thing I did
say though was I would let my wife quit
her job long before I would ever quit
mine and that's kind of the way it went
my the channel ended up far exceeding
what the wife was bringing in full time
with her job and I I told her when you
when you have our second child which she
was pregnant with I said don't go back
to work making more than money on the
channel to make up for your income and a
lot extra and taxes so stay home be a
stay-at-home mom and I was that was like
the highlight of my channel that's still
I think the pinnacle achievement in all
of this is not being able to be home you
know home working on my own channel as
an income it's allowing her to be home
with our kids which is something we
always wanted but she was a working mom
for little Jade and I told her I said I
really want you home for Minnie J and
that's exactly what we achieved and that
is still going to be my crowning
achievement in all of this is her dream
of being a stay-at-home mom is actually
come true and that's again because of
the sport of you guys on this channel
but then I really started thinking is
this something I could make work is this
something that I could do and actually
make a living at this comfortably and
have enough of put aside in savings so
that at the floor ever dropped out in
this whole platform that we're not out
on the street and then I started seeing
people around me get laid off Jerry got
laid off you know and people who work
for companies that were that seemed very
very stable
we're losing their jobs and I got to
thinking working for someone else is not
financial security working for someone
else does not mean at the end of the day
you have a guaranteed income it doesn't
matter if you're working for the
government it doesn't matter if you're
working for Microsoft Google if you're
working for a software company like I
was that was a small independent you
know privately owned company but still
made very good income it doesn't equal
financial security and a lot of folks
told me that I was crazy at the idea of
quitting my job oh my gosh what are you
gonna do what do you do buy the
financial security working for that guy
over there is not security working for
that guy over there is a liability if he
ever needs to save money I become an
expense I can easily be cut so I started
thinking if I don't try this if I don't
take a chance and I never know what
could have been to me inside that would
have ripped me apart over the years
because I'm a risk taker and it's
something that would have just eaten me
and eaten me and eat me and I couldn't
live with that so I finally out during
the night I spent a lot of nights not
able to sleep and the wife would get up
at 3:00 4:00 in the morning
and I would just be awake just laying
there awake my brain would not shut down
I could not stop thinking about what
could be so I got up in the morning and
I wrote my resignation letter this was
this was like February or something of
last year and I showed it to a friend of
mine who I trust very much and he said
you know what he said good right he said
right you wrote the letter and this was
his advice by the way he says write a
resignation letter but then set it aside
don't turn it in anytime you're feeling
those feelings late night during the day
whatever and you just can't stop
thinking about the idea of working for
yourself take out your resignation
letter and read it again on a different
day different emotions and see if you
still feel the same and every time I
took that letter out and I read it I
felt exactly the same as I did the
monster prior so one day I turned it in
and the rest is history so I get my two
weeks notice and then became
self-employed and I think one of the
things I love most over the last year is
the amount of freedom that I have I can
try things and I can take the risk and I
can fail and recover you fail at your
job too many times they're gonna fire
you and that I'm not gonna fire myself
although I probably should sometimes but
I don't like complacency and I don't
like repetition and that's something I
don't have to deal with working for
myself now my goal moving forward I
definitely don't want to continue to
rely on a monetized platform like
YouTube other folks have diversified on
like YouTube and vessel and some other
platforms but the bottom line is even
though YouTube is only one of like five
revenue streams that I have I if YouTube
ever disappears or goes away and I lose
you know a huge chunk of my income then
that's still not financial independence
and I want to moving forward I don't
know how I'm going to do this yet I
really don't know how I'm gonna do this
yet I want to be completely financially
independent from YouTube and where if
they ever screw up over there which
seems like they're constantly trying to
do then I'm set because I have my own
space that's bringing me money and I'm
working towards that but obviously the
advertising that I that I integrate into
these videos and the pre-rolls and stuff
has definitely been something that has
allowed me a lot more financial freedom
and to get away a little bit from worry
about the constant what if YouTube this
what if YouTube that you guys hear about
these channels getting these false
strikes and they lose weeks of income
and they're like oh my god now we're
going broke you know we're going to go
bankrupt I'm not in that situation
because I have a lot of money set aside
thank God because I built this business
up on the side and then slid into this
once I was ready it wasn't some I didn't
just wake up and go boss I'm out and
then have to hope it worked because I
didn't have enough money to get to the
end of the month yeah that's not the way
it worked out at all but I really just
wanted to sit down with you guys and
tell you that the last year has been
absolutely phenomenal and it keeps me so
excited for what's coming in the future
and for the first time for the first
time ever I think that the concept of
this channel being able to reach a
million subscribers might be possible
and that I didn't think a hundred
thousand was possible if you've been
around long enough you remember me
saying this channel will never hit a
hundred thousand it is so amateur hour
it's not even funny well now we're about
to hit six hundred thousand subscribers
which is why it's like I'm over the hump
of being halfway there it might be
possible it's just blowing my mind I
mean seriously but you guys give me so
much support that you don't even realize
I mean if you know me personally you
know I don't have many friends and I
think that might be truth true for a lot
of youtubers which is why we talked to
cameras oh well I guess is is I have
like three friends that's it and I've
always been that way I've always been a
bit introverted I don't like going to
parties I don't like going to like CES
and I like going to the after parties I
don't like mingling and I'm an introvert
it's the way I've always been my entire
life if you watch my drive my life you
already know my story and I just have
never been very outgoing and YouTube has
really cracked that she'll that she'll
still there but it's really cracked it
and it's falling off and I'm starting to
feel a lot more comfortable when I go to
these events and things and one of the
things that I really wanted to be able
to do when I when I went self-employed
was be able to go to events I was being
invited to things that would seem so
cool but I couldn't go because I had
work and a lot of these events came up
last-minute like within the you know
several weeks before the event like hey
here's your invite come visit
it's like I only get so much vacation
time of year and I've got to give well
advance notice for my boss so sorry
can't go but that's not the case anymore
and and that's really exciting in fact
I'm getting ready get on a plane next
week to go to an undisclosed event that
I can't tell you guys about but I'm
really really looking forward to this
event I can't wait to tell you guys all
about it your guys's support has really
changed my life more than you will ever
know and being able to say it and say
you guys have changed my life everyone
says that all youtubers that are that
are making you know they're living on
YouTube or saying that you guys have
changed my life you can't possibly know
but the best we can do is just try and
tell you that things for us at least
myself here have been better than I've
ever been and I have you guys to thank
for that
so with your continued support I'm gonna
do everything I can to make this channel
entertaining fair honest and everything
that you guys expect from me I want to
deliver because obviously as a content
creator I expect certain things from you
I expect you guys to be you know fair
and and cordial in your comments which
for the most part
trolls are never going to go away but I
have a commitment to you guys to bring
you the best content that I possibly can
that's entertaining and without
sacrificing integrity because integrity
to me is everything but just a couple of
things I really want to say that I'm
grateful for I know it sounds like
Thanksgiving in April but that the last
year has allowed us is an amazing family
dynamic I'm always home with the family
now instead of being gone all day coming
home at 5:00 p.m.
spending maybe an hour with the kids and
then working until 2:00 3:00 in the
morning and doing that over and over
that's why my eyes were always so
bloodshot and jacked up because I never
got sleep but I get to spend so much
more time with my kids and I ever did
we've really been able to improve the
home situation I now have a dedicated
recording and office space upstairs and
a rededicated recording and build space
in one of the garages is a split car
garage here and now I have a workshop
where I can get things done
simultaneously I can do business
upstairs and not have to work where I
record and it's it's so freakin amazing
it's something I've never been able to
experience before and that has just
upped my morale so much
part I think when I'm most grateful for
quite honestly as your guys's continued
support because without an audience
watching these videos are nothing they
are just it's just data on the server
that's just sitting there not being
called by anybody to view but because
you guys are watching it gives me the
freedom to continue being creative and
moving forward and being independent and
for that I just want to say thanks more
than you'll ever know so anyway that's
it time to get out of here I want you
guys to do me a favor hit me up on
Twitter or comment down below or
facebook if you guys are following on
facebook this is not one of those like
you know hey come and follow me because
I want to bloat my ego know I like
having a lot of followers it's fun but I
want to know over the last year or even
just as long as my channels been around
what's been your favorite J's $0.02
moment because I've got way too many to
list that's why I've never done those
year end videos like you know J is 2015
best of I I can't pick my favorite
moments because there's so many so I
kind of want you guys to tell me as long
as I've been doing this YouTube channel
what's your favorite moment tell me what
it was and why and heck even link it so
others can see it if it's a video or
something like that anyway time to go
guys thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
