Jays two cents and today we're taking a
look at the tilt Tunes wireless
Bluetooth speaker by tilt products and
that audio you heard in the beginning
was being played by the speaker it was
not dubbed in this saying is really
incredible and not only does the device
sound amazing it's got all sorts of
features that you would expect from a
product like this it's rechargeable 2800
milliamp battery it's got one amp output
for charging your device hands-free
calling it's touch sensitive buttons and
it sounds pretty awesome on top of all
of that the construction of it is very
solid it's not too heavy it's easy to
carry or put in a backpack it's got nice
silicone accent ring around there but
let's go ahead and dive a little bit
deeper into the package here and see
exactly what you get from tilt products
on the tilt Tunes device you get a bunch
of different accessories you get a
little carrying pouch you get your
instructions you get a three-and-a-half
millimeter male to male connector so you
can connect it to a microphone output or
a speaker output if you want from your
device if it's not bluetooth you get
your USB charging cable for the device
and you get black blue and red rings I
like blue so I'm going to go ahead and
stick the blue on here on the back of
the device you can see you've got your
input/output your USB charger and your
USP
output for charging your devices on the
back here you've got your power switch
and when you push that you hear that
little sound to let you know that it's
powered on syncing the device couldn't
be any easier you hold the button for
six seconds it tells you that pairing
mode is on it's going to show up on your
device touch it there's absolutely no
code you have to enter it's just
automatically paired to your phone or
your iPad or whatever you got and then
you can start playing music I think one
of the coolest features of this tunes
device is the fact that it also doubles
as a wireless portable battery so you
can charge your phone and your iPod or
your mp3 player while playing music it's
really cool now it's really difficult to
let you know how well it sounds well
go ahead and take a listen to this
device with a couple of different songs
and see just how well the camera's
microphone can pick it up
so there you go guys the tunes by tilt
