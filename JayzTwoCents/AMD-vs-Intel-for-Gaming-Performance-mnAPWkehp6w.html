really you
sorry I don't have air radar I don't
have lock-on you know what I
have never get any good Gatling gun hey
you're watching Jays to sense where the
advice is always free and today we're
gonna go ahead and discuss AMD versus
Intel and PC gaming performance I got a
lot of messages asking me okay you said
that we don't need the latest and
greatest processor but you didn't say
whether or not you need AMD or Intel
you're right I didn't mention that
because it pretty much warrants a video
all of its own it's a very debated topic
and I think it goes without saying that
Intel is almost always the clear winner
when it comes to gaming it's pretty sad
the way the core i5 2500 K is
outperforming the FX 81 20 in stock
speeds which is what I currently use
however if you look at the charts that
measure pure processing power of these
processors it tends to be a different
story the eight core and six core
processors or the i7s and the FX series
or 8000 series are definitely beating
the i5s however the questions that I was
asked were purely gaming questions most
of these people that are asking me
questions are not asking about doing
video editing or encoding or Photoshop
or any of that kind of software they
want to build a gaming machine so they
want to know do I go AMD or do I go
Intel but I gotta say if you're building
purely a gaming machine the core i5 2500
K by Intel is a beast of a chip for
gaming downside of the 2500 K is that
it's not available anymore
most places either have it as a refurb
or some sort of a back stock and if you
can find it they're typically on sale
extremely cheap we're talking 160
dollars I've seen it as low as 150
before it micro Center if you were to
buy it with a motherboard and it was
just an amazing processor the equivalent
to the 2500 K an Ivy Bridge is the 35 70
K the 35 70 K is roughly 10% faster than
the 2500 K so
that's just amazing but if you truly
want to go all out and you don't have a
budget constraint definitely go for an
i7 I know that contradicts a little bit
what I said in the other video but hear
me out but if you have absolutely no
budget constraint and you're just asking
me what is the baddest computer I can
build today you're going to want to go
with the Intel i7 3770k it has the four
physical cores as well as the four
logical cores giving you eight threads
of processing power so that means you
could have all kinds of programs going
while you're gaming in the background
and you're not going to see any slowdown
whatsoever in most instances you're not
going to see a slowdown with a twenty
five hundred K or the 35 70 K either now
up until this point I've only talked
about Intel so why do I have AMD because
I know people were going to ask me dude
you're pitching Intel your pitching
Intel so why do you have an AMD to
answer that question we got to rewind a
year ago a year ago I had to build a PC
on a budget I had 1,200 dollars to spend
and I had nothing to reuse I was moving
back to PC from Mac and so I had to
build everything from scratch we're
talking every cable every screw of
everything I needed had to be bought so
I went with AMD simply because at the
time I was able to get a 965 Black
Edition which is a phenom 2 + x4 for
$100 flat now if we compare the phenom
x4 965 Black Edition for a hundred bucks
with the equivalent I 5 or i7 of the
time which I believe was the 920 was the
i7 and the 720 was the i-5 and if I'm
wrong just tell me in the comments what
they actually were so people don't get
confused it doesn't really matter but
it's nice to have the right numbers out
there the phenom ii x4 especially the
965 itself was like the golden chip for
AMD when it came to gaming I love that
chip I was easily able to overclock it
to 4 gigs there was no problem there
didn't even have to run water on it to
do it and my games ran smooth now yes it
was being beaten by Intel however it was
just unbeatable in the FPS per dollar
range it was a it was an amazing chip
now someone might be asking themselves
ok so fine you had your 965 you loved it
and you upgrade it why did you not
upgrade to Intel in between upgrading
the processors my previous motherboard
took a
so I had a decision to make I've got to
buy a new motherboard anyway so if I go
Intel then I have to buy a processor too
which would then say okay I'm back on a
budget because I don't want to spend too
much money which means I'm going to buy
bottom shelf Intel and my 965 was
already beating the bottom shelf Intel
for the same price because the only
thing you could buy for a hundred bucks
at the time was an i3 and I wasn't about
to go high three so I went ahead and
stuck with AMD now when I upgraded the
processor if I wanted to go Intel I had
to buy a new motherboard so I already
had across an Asus Republic of gamers
crosshair 5 which is their best AMD
motherboard you can possibly buy when it
comes to feature set I was pretty much
stuck in this path so I'm sort of
convincing myself it's worth it to hang
out with AMD and just wait it out for
Piledriver
which is AMD's next generation processor
and if it is a complete letdown
i've already decided that my next
upgrade path will be an Intel and it
will likely be an i7 because as I
mentioned I need the power so here it is
here's my recommendation if you're going
to early gaming this is a gaming machine
and you were on a budget and you need to
buy a processor that's a hundred and
fifty dollars or less go on Amazon go on
Google try and find yourself either a
used phenom ii x4 965 or even a 975 you
might even find a 98 v out there which
are all great they're all unlocked you
can overclock all of them or find
yourself a 1090 or 1100 T those were the
next generation between the FX and the
Phenom force they were great processors
and not to mention their six core
processors so you get a little more
power and the gaming performance on
those are great you'll see on here the
chart for the Phenom 2 x6 1090 T is
beating my FX 80 120 at stock speeds
when it comes to gaming performance if
you need the extra cores you can get the
80 120 but the only way you're going to
really see the performance out of it is
to overclock it at stock speeds I was
less than thrilled with it I was going
to take it back then I decide
let's go ahead and just overclock this
bitch and see where it goes and I'm
extremely happy here we are now going on
shoot six months later and I'm as happy
as can be
now if you're looking for a processor
that's over a hundred and fifty dollars
it makes no sense to go with AMD for
instance you can get the i-5 35 70 K for
220 bucks now the equivalent from AMD
today would be the fx-8150 and it's $199
so you spent $20 more and you're going
to get the i-5 which is going to do a
million times better in games then the
fx-8150 if you have to spend between 150
and 200 and you just do not want to go
AMD but you don't know what to buy
you're probably gonna be stuck looking
for a 2500 K that's stuck in somebody's
inventory however that's an early 2011
chip and they're just not really around
anymore and I know that's going to
ruffle feathers because the discussion
of AMD versus Intel is just as heated as
console versus PC Ford versus Chevy
Honda versus everybody else so there it
is that's my advice so there you have it
my two cents regarding AMD and Intel on
gaming machines I'm using AMD and I'm
happy what are you using and why put it
