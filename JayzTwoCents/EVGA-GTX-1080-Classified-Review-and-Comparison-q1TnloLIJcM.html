going to be doing another GT X 1080
review you don't gotta throw stuff at me
there's been a lot of GT X 1080 reviews
around here but you just don't pass up
the opportunity to do a classified
review when it comes your way so anyway
we'll be take a look at that we'll be
putting it up against their hybrid card
which is right around the same price
point and seeing how they compare like
badassery on an air cooler and almost
just as badassery on water I'm kind of
curious to see which is going to reign
supreme if you're sick of all the gtx
1080 reviews and you're just like jay
would you give it up already
enough is enough well I've got something
for you too it even comes in three sizes
including super absorbent to absorb all
your tears what are you doing I start
it's time for an upgrade that's little
Jays Xbox ah much better
how did you even get in here I made a
key last time I was here no big deal
well I could go for a drink right about
now though I kind of feel like you've
already done this whole living room
thing before no a different channel
these are horrible man well you are
breaking and entering
no not I've witnesses
the new defined nano s from fractal
design supports full size power supplies
full length graphics cards room for a
complete custom water loop and heck even
room for a couple of freeloaders click
the link in the description for more
details
tractor josh not included we should
order pizza in all of its gunmetal black
and red goodness here it is right here
now red is a kind of always been the
color for the classified cards it looks
almost more pink ish because it's
against the white LED background which
is kind of unfortunate but anyway the
back plate as you can see is nice and
red the grills show through on the back
plate but yeah anyway this card right
here is no different than really any of
the other classified cards they've made
in the past it's got a shit ton of power
faces 14 plus 3 for the memory so 14
powerfully paid now it's really no
different than any of the other
classifieds we've looked at in the past
here it's got all the features you would
expect it's an oversized card because
the PCB has to fit fourteen plus three
heat power phazon that's why it's so
tall I've got to fit all those power
faces and chokes on their butt so we're
getting extremely clean power delivery
which should give us stable overclock
nor the power faces aren't about getting
more clock it's about getting I said
clock guys it's about getting a very
clean and stable power delivery to try
and keep the maximum speeds as stable as
possible if you see any sort of power
fluctuation when the core is running at
its absolute limit that can lead to
crashes so that's why you see all these
extra power phases on here it's not
about more power delivery because
believe it or not the voltage on here
and is locked at 1.09 2 volts just like
the founders as as far as it will go if
you push the voltage to its limit so
you're not gonna be seeing the extra
power voltage coming out of this thing
but anyway there's there's debate on
whether or not that seemed and
beneficial anyway we'll talk about that
later but anyway it does have to eight
pin power plugs on here because it has a
245 watt TDP up from the 180 referenced
design I'm not going to call it founders
it's the reference design from Nvidia
now as you would expect from any other
classified card that you've looked at in
the past it has also got on here
harnesses that you can plug in so
monitor Hardware monitoring of voltages
and things like that so that you're not
relying on software which can be fairly
inconsistent and inaccurate when you're
doing software level voltage monitoring
so this does allow you to plug in a
harness and hook a voltmeter up to it
so that you can monitor that at a
hardware level which is the most
accurate and of course it's got dual
BIOS on here in the second bios of the
slave BIOS giving you a more aggressive
fan curve out of the box it's not going
to try and shut off the fans to keep it
nice and cool or quiet we want it cool
right in these instances and it's also
going to give you additional power limit
I believe I'll look at two hundred and
thirty percent that's that's a pretty
big deal they should have just called
this GT X 1080 gargantuan addition
because the classified cooler is so
freakin huge now the out of the box
specs on the GT 104 cords the Pascal is
the same as all the other ten 80s but
it's got a seventeen hundred and twenty
one megahertz base clock and an eighteen
hundred and sixty megahertz
booze clock identical to the hybrid that
we took a look at last week so it's one
of the reasons why I'm really interested
in comparing this to the hybrid to see
how it actually holds up so I think it's
kind of it's gonna be kinda like a
battle of the Titans only they're not
Titans they're they're GTX 1080s but of
course it's got the other things that
you would expect on there like RGB
lighting control there are no lights
that light up on the back plate which is
kind of a good thing I don't personally
like back plates that light up I think
it looks a little bit extra flashy and
gaudy but you can control the LED color
for the logo and the face right here and
the nice thing is when the color
actually shines through the red on the
face really no longer shows like I did
green and green shows up just fine blue
white it really the red just is flushed
out but unfortunately if you're doing a
color themed build the red on the
backplate is always going to be red so
this will obviously look best in a red
build but I guess it's up to you whether
or not the red is an issue but the last
thing to mention spec wise here too is
this is this doesn't have any sort of
factory boost to the memory speeds it's
five thousand six so ten thousand twelve
effective out of the box but of course
we've already seen that the g5 x is
overclocking very very well you can
expect to be able to push this up to
about eleven thousand with no problems
whatsoever alright enough chatting let's
go ahead put this thing through the
paces it's compared to the founders and
the hybrid and then let's see just
how well it does of course we're gonna
put the Titan in there but that's just
because I mean I don't know that's not
even really like a real benchmark on
this just like let's just take
ridiculous and compare it to realistic
but anyway yeah let's do it guys go
EVGA 1080 classified does it live up to
the standard well out of the box
settings it's really like any other GT X
1080 they all pretty much go to at least
2000 megahertz out of the pucks which is
just crazy to say last year a graphics
car that could do 2,000 megahertz out of
the box was kind of unheard of but we're
there but what really differentiates
them is the coolers because as they
start to warm up the core clocks will
start to come down slightly now right
now heaven has been running here for
quite a while and we're sitting at 1974
megahertz at 70 C so that's why I
included the hybrid benchmarks in the in
the charts because they're fairly
comparable pricing there's about twenty
or thirty dollars difference between the
two cards and they have two very
different approaches obviously the
hybrid is built on the for the wind PCB
with a hybrid water cooler on there and
the classified being a little bit bigger
card with a little bit bigger fans and
the standard for the wind card and
bigger heatsink but this has extra
features in there like the hardware
monitor probes for things like voltage
it's got 14 plus 3 power phase versus
the 10 plus 2 on the for the win and
it's kind of curious as to how this
would stack up against the hybrid card
considering water cooler versus a giant
air cooler out of the box the they both
ramped up to the same core clock of 2025
but this one here obviously as it
reached 7dc it's running at 7 DC right
now this one came down to nineteen
hundred and sixty two megahertz which is
still 100 megahertz faster than the
advertised boost clock so I wouldn't
call that thermal throttling well I'm
gonna pump the brakes here for just a
second because I know someone out there
just got rustled a little bit because
what I just described many people would
say no dude that's actually thermal
throttling why are you being such a
shill
well actually what I just described is
dynamic frequency control it's actually
quite different than thermal throttling
thermal throttling according the
definition on overclockers calm and even
semiconductor manufacturers will tell
you that thermal throttling is a
safeguard
when TDP and temperatures exceed rated
limits in order to keep itself from
damaging any components it will slow the
core and the voltage down to safe limits
what I just described at 70 C is clearly
not causing damage to that Jeep
you nor is the TDP exceeded it's nothing
more than a dynamic frequencies control
to keep things as cool as possible so in
the terms of definition of thermal
throttling that is not what is taking
place so y'all gotta stop throwing
around that terminology man it's it's
getting people confused like bottle
necking and future-proofing anyway
editing J is is done ranting let's go
ahead and get back to the show
now all the settings you saw on those
benchmarks are out of the box between
the hybrid and the for the win and the
founder's there is absolutely no
difference whatsoever it's it take it
out of the box plugged it in didn't
touch a damn setting and there you go
but if you were to take the fan curve
and just add a little bit more
percentage to it because it's extremely
conservative it's super quiet fan is
running at 50 percent right now it makes
no noise because of the ball bearing
design and ACX coolers you can get more
performance out of it with acoustics
still not being intrusive especially
considering I can't hear the thing right
now in an open test bench in a case it's
only going to be even quieter so you can
get more performance and have the core
clock step down less by adding more fan
curve and what happened at that point
was this was actually beating the hybrid
card at the same frequency which I
thought was kind of strange considering
you would think a GPU 104 core running
at 2025 versus another one running at
2025 with the exact same memory speed of
5,000 six out of the box or 10012
effective you would have thought that
they would have been identical results
but the hybrid was losing to the
classified even though the classify was
a little bit hotter at the same speed so
I don't know what kind of voodoo magic
they're doing here but yeah whatever it
is it's working so anyway I'll be doing
another video specifically about fan
curve only fan curve no power target or
anything because I've done overclocking
videos and I've shown how bumping up the
fan curve can help with dynamic clock
adjusting but I've never shown how much
gains you actually get by simply messing
with a few clicks of a program to make
your graphics card perform better so
that's actually going to be the next
video look for that on Friday I'm
actually I've actually already filmed
that video and that's going to be going
out Friday so I think there will be some
good information to be had there and
that's cool thing about this is that
applies to any graphics card with a fan
so
doesn't matter if it's Team Green Team
red whatever if it has a fan it will
benefit from from adjusting the fan
curve but specifically in that video I
plan on a just comparing blower style
coolers like on the reference cards
versus these open-air style coolers with
the multiple fans and seeing do you get
the same benefit with these you know
multi fan configs versus a blower cooler
so look for that now the last thing to
talk about here is voltage because I
think some people might have been
expecting to see additional voltage
available to the core on the classified
cards but I'm here to say that the
voltage is still the same as founders
voltage actually doesn't go higher than
1.09 - and that's if you bump up the
voltage actually right now it's running
at 1.0 for 3 and the core clock is at
962 as we already talked about
so 1.09 2 is the hard volt limit for GP
104 and if you go to the plus 100 you
might get there if you overclock the
graphics card to the max frequency
stable you will probably never see 1.09
2 if you stay around safe ranges around
the 2950 2000 range you'll probably
never see that voltage so I've talked to
some folks in the industry and they've
all pretty much said the same thing GPU
104 or Pascal FinFET design period is
not benefiting from the extra voltage in
fact it's kind of getting harmful in
some cases where it actually
destabilizes the core a little bit and
doesn't give you any extra core clock
whatsoever so it's kind of interesting
though that a card is based on all of
these additional hardware voltage
monitoring stuff you know 130 percent
power limit right now we're sitting at
78% of that power limit and yeah it's it
kind of makes me wonder how much benefit
there is to all those features if you
can't push the voltage any farther but
again I'm not a modern I don't go in
there and start soldering stuff so I
really don't know I just don't know I've
seen some mods floating around out out
there already but I'm wondering if you
guys would buy this card and then start
like doing solder mods and things like
that who knows it's maybe some of you
guys are I'm not brave enough to do it
you guys do it report back to me I'm not
going to do it and one last thing
obviously I did change LEDs to green
because again green testbench but it is
RGB so you can change the LEDs to any
color that you want to match your build
which
it's kind of funny though considering
it's got the red grills in there and the
red grill boots into the back plate so
if you're doing green like this and
you're looking at it in a standard case
you're still going to see red in the
back plate which is kind of unfortunate
in my opinion I think the color scheme
they put on the for the win with the
gunmetal II color and it's black that
would look better on the classify to my
opinion rather than the red again
that's my subjective hat but I digress
bet you guys thought we were gonna make
it through a whole video without getting
digressed upon whatever anyway guys time
to go thanks for watching here
skunkworks v4 0.62 or whatever it is is
very soon I've almost got all the parts
I need to start that build and I kind of
feel like a dirty whore but I yeah we're
going with too tight Nexus I know I know
I know I'm so fickle I can never make up
my mind but you guys told me it's a it's
skunk works it's the centerpiece of the
channel you gotta put the best in there
yeah so we're gonna do tight next to ASL
I could put a third one in there and
just call it a PhysX card title probably
pissing people off hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
