wanted to do this
and not a single was given right
there I have to try harder next time oh
we're finally on the road but you know
California and all traffic it's about a
two-hour drive normally a little bit
less than two hours but in this
condition as you can see it's going to
take us probably two days maybe yeah
probably about two days guys detour
dinner time we slept place that I came
to a million times while growing up
called Tom's farms old fashioned
hamburgers I'm telling you right now
this is probably one of the only places
that ever make me excited for a
hamburger I don't care about hamburgers
not in the least this is probably one of
the best you would ever ever ever eat at
least am I kidding look at that mm-hmm
fat guy like again I saw here you see
were by the little lake and stuff sorry
little man made pond there's a little
rubber ducky over by the large bomb uh
yeah so when we're done here we're gonna
go to the general store buy some dried
fruit snacks and things and the bird
will come back for another fridge oh
yeah we fed up with these birds are come
running up to you kind of like
Disneyland Birds watch see if one will
do it oh there he is see ya see if he'll
come you ready ready hmm
I know let's try to get up there is see
steal your food around here vultures
we're in the country store and have a
dilemma um you guys know I've been
trying to you know watch the waistline
i'm watching to grow mostly look at this
everything you see me surrounded by
right now is all sugar-free chocolate
covered stuff everything you see here
sugar-free chocolate really sugar-free
everything it's just I want it all I
want every bit of it was that place
called it's just the farmers market and
candy shop we got out of there with
dried banana chips sugar-free dark
chocolate covered almonds and sugar free
English toffee that's mine you can't
don't touch my toffee or I will break
your hand off what I didn't say breaker
I said break your hand off you don't
need your hand to give birth God women
these days well we were on the road
making pretty good time to the wife
decided she wanted to stop at some
gourmet cookie place here in temecula so
we are not even halfway to san diego yet
and we've already been on the road for
two and a half hours we finally made it
to our room the kids doing the potty
dance she's she's really really gotta go
so not a bad room huh it's a Hilton so
it's not so bad but a little desk here
pretty decent view outside you know no
it only took us I think four hours to
get here it could have been worse right
I don't know we're gonna do tonight we
have absolutely nothing to do probably
go to sleep and watch her do the pee
dance back there this is what I put up
with it every single day well as you can
see I'm exhausted cuz that little one
forced me to share a bed with her and
kicked me all night long at one point
she almost pushed me off the bed this
little twerp
you shut up and get back to your studies
shut up but only the one is cycling some
action movie inside the basement where's
the car we have lost the car the hell
are we it don't look the same not over
you Luke oh so it feels like 19 hours
with the driving at least over the last
two days of being stuck in a car we're
here at Legoland California somebody's
excited okay I'm not gonna lie it's I
should a lot busier here than I thought
it was gonna be never be here before I
know what to expect my I looked at it
online a little bit but it looked kind
of boring but you know I guess for your
kidney hook Legos this place is pretty
damn awesome but it's a lot bigger than
that I was gonna be so hopefully bring
it to the day they're only open till
five I'm gonna find some big leo
something big and Lego and go breaking I
kind of thought this place was going to
be boring I mean they got some kids
rides and stuff but if you take a look
behind me just the amount of effort that
they put it did his little Lego cities
are just like jaw-dropping I mean
they've got New York City Las Vegas
there's over a million Legos that make
up Las Vegas right here alone so it's
just like holy cow me look they even got
you know pull back there I've got the
dolphins swimming around the Mirage is
pretty much to scale this is this is
pretty intense I'm not gonna lie i got
the MGM grand over there the Venetian
all that in the back it's just so if I
look at this in ago this is just a
little bit intense I don't know how
great it but I mean look at new york new
york hotel behind me right there that is
just crazy you like it can you build
this at home

home no way we don't have enough Legos I
mean like they even have a little Lego
Las Vegas police officer officer that
pulled over a drag queen I mean that is
just totally Vegas right there and what

company and whatnot but we were meeting
friends and i only had 500 subs when he
sent me some headphones to do review on
