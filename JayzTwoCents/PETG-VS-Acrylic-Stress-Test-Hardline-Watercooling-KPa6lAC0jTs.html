and you might notice that my set looks a
little different than normal oh well
that's because I completely broke into
Paul's hardware's place while he's on
vacation and we don't need him to know
any of that but anyway the fool hahahaha
I'm asked often because of hard tubing
videos that I've done one to do a how to
bend hard to being video we're going to
be doing that and to the difference
between PE T G and acrylic so I figured
this would be a perfect time to actually
demonstrate you guys how my phone goes
off the mill video destroying a take the
new EVGA silent series power supplies
offer excellent silence and efficiency
through their new EVGA Eco mode
technology and also features a seven
year warranty for worryfree gaming click
the link in the description to learn
more I hold here in my hands a very
special tube and some acrylic and hard
ptg stuff but you guys can't tell the
difference by looking at it can you can
tell the difference can't smell the
difference
we're talked about today what makes
these tubes different now acrylic tubing
was one of those things where it was
like oh wow it's you can heat it you can
bend it that's awesome but acrylic is
inherently very very brittle so you fast
forward a couple of years or quite a few
years actually from when people started
using acrylic tubing which is this guy
here with the bend so away can keep
track of it too using a material called
PE TG I'll be honest I have no idea what
the acronym stands for feel free to look
it up yourself don't bother telling me I
really don't care because it doesn't
matter what it means but anyway we're
going to talk about why you would want P
DTG over acrylic and why I hate working
with PE TG to be honest alright so first
things first acrylic as I mentioned very
very brittle in fact if you get in close
here you can see there are a lot of
spider cracks in this and if you see the
end of this right here is actually
broken
there was a reason for that before
shooting this video actually a while
back I wanted to test the durability of
acrylic so what I did was I heated it
and I bent it and I did a 180 Bend right
here so it wasn't just a 90
180 and the wallet was still hot I took
it and I don't get in water just like
that it went dunk holy I'm making a mess
over I dunked it in water and those
spider cracks formed and then I said
well I wonder how brittle it is and I
barely pulled it in a broke apart so as
you can see the acrylic is takes more
heat to bend it's bit more sensitive and
as you bend it it gets a bit more
brittle now we've got PE TG tubing you
can actually tell that this is a bit
more dense of a material it's actually a
little bit heavy or even though the
measurements are the same this is a 10
by 13 millimeter tube which is a 3/8
inch outer diameter I believe so I'm
going to tap these both on the table in
fact these are both the same length
minus or minus an inch and a half and
listen to the difference in tone so
here's PE TG and here is acrylic spree
plate btg acrylic so you can hear
there's already a difference in density
between the tube again as I mentioned
weight wise it's quite a bit different
now there are some drawbacks to PE TG
one thing that I don't like about it
when you cut acrylic effect that's due
right now when you cut acrylic as you
see it bounces off everywhere looks
pretty easy but do you see how that
piece actually broke off right there
there's a little demonstration as to how
brittle it is you now have some chunks
on there and a crack so this is probably
already slightly weakened because of the
amount of times I've cut it but let's
say we were deburring this thing this is
a deeper tool from monsoon you use it to
do outer and inner burr burr whatever
you can see it actually cuts pretty
easily into it and you get a nice move
nevermind the crack you get a nice
smooth Bieber on there when it comes to
PE TG you hear the difference in tone
much deeper
but as you can see it's very rough like
very very rough I don't how well the
camera is picking it up but it's it's
rough Paul feel that how rough is that
that's really rough J it's like
sandpaper rough isn't it so yeah but
we've already talked about its strength
and stuff so let's do a little
demonstration here we like science we do
this all science so I had here a hammer
it's not a huge hammer but nonetheless
it's a hammer do you hammer in the
morning hammer time
do you have her in the evening I hammer
all summer time I don't know where this
is going
this is Peter Paul and Mary that that's
probably okay folk music reference
totally not picked up on that's ok let's
move on
sorry ok so I have the PE teaching I got
to go look this up punch it so we've got
the PT G tube in here let's go and hit
it
do you feel better now gee I say that's
pretty durable
what do you think Paul that's pretty
durable you flattened it out pretty good
how many hits do you think the acrylic
to take uh at least at least double at
least double that right okay yeah no now
watch yourself you want me to put my
glasses on your glasses great hold on
hold on wait let me we get a little
closer
I'm actually hit it more here in the
middle where it would be stronger
because it's going to be loot this would
actually be you know more brutal men do
you ready that's why we use PTT to be
now do you want that to be your system
prayer this is actually good shank to
Lila's you weren't expecting it to break
that dramatically weight J's like here
and help them this video for me Paul and
think I was my expecting shank sure so
yeah it looks like glass and stuff now
here's the thing some people are gonna
be like well that was clearly weakened
of course it was it was heated and bent
already so that and that's not just
because it was heated and bent actually
if you took a straight piece of acrylic
we don't have any more hanging around
here because we've seen the light but I
could have taken the new piece of
acrylic and hit it the same way and this
I missed that one oh if we got a little
bit more lefty right that was fun I
apologize for the vents I'm even
live-streaming like next week and
acrylic pieces like pulling out of my
hat alright though so I know this wasn't
8 how to bend but let's at least do this
this is the PE T G oh it did shatter how
disappointing but you bent it so this is
actually a little bit about how to bend
video oh yeah hey wait keeping promises
here over there in Paul's our grant I
mean Jay ste sense wherever we are
yeah I don't even know so you gotta ask
yourself which would you rather have in
your system look at these pieces here
it's like then around
it's carnage so guys that's why I'm
moving forward on the channel that's one
of the reasons why skunk works is
getting its water cooling loop
completely redone all of the tubing
right now in my system is this brittle
stuff so yeah we moving over ptg tubing
at that time I'll probably do a complete
video on how to do the bending how to
heat it how to get the temperature just
right how to tell if it's too hot too
cold how to put a gently insert your
tube and well have a great time so Jay
are there any negatives to PE TG any
things you don't like about working with
it the only thing I don't like is trying
to get the ends nice and smooth once you
do BRR because it does cut it is really
soft that's the thing that's what helps
this be so malleable is the fact that
it's soft but because it's soft it makes
it hard to cut sandpaper would actually
work really good here on the end but I
don't have any here and usually I have a
really fine file that I'll use but
normal tools like this which were
designed for acrylic they just don't
they don't cut very well you know you
don't need this to be perfect you just
don't want any sharp end sticking out
otherwise you could cut a rings as you
put these in but yeah I mean I it smells
really bad too as you cut it especially
if you're in a small space as you're
cutting this and it's heating up it
actually has a very nasty kind of a it's
a very distinct smell over acrylic
acrylic you don't really smell too much
but the ptg definitely stinks the ptg
also has a little bit of a blue to get a
hue to it just slightly especially if
you look at the ends where a curl like
tiny little pieces left here you look at
the ends and it's perfectly clear so it
does have slight coloration on the end
but when you look at the actual tube
itself it's it's just fine and ptg is
starting to become available in much
more colors and things UV infused so
they blow I actually have blue UV to utg
under black light it lights up blue so
you have some some cool options they're
green
is available there's also white with
blue so yeah it's becoming much more
widely adopted
primo chill sells like an entire line of
it then they're actually like the
leaders in this heart bending tubing
stuff so there you go guys what we
covering some more on this topic but I
thought while we're here and I had the
opportunity to put pieces of sharp
plastic all over Paul's studio I've
heard you don't you don't say no to that
so alright fallen code if you guys have
any questions Facebook Instagram all
that fun stuff and as always guys hope
you had fun and thanks for watching
easy video people and what if people
want to see more of this awesome build
to your left J well then you want to go
ahead and head on over to Paul's
hardware and make sure you follow him on
Twitter Paul Hardware unless you want a
great deal on maybe some lumber or hot
dog sales or I mean maybe you can get
your plastic tubing over there at there
Paul's heart that's different place in
Arizona they actually get quite angry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
