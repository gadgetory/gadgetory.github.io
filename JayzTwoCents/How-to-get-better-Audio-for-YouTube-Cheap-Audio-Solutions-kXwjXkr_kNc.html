here bringing you a video today all
about audio and capturing some audio and
some really cheap alternatives you guys
can use to really step up the quality of
the audio on your channel believe it or
not I get asked this quite often and I'm
no audio expert just like you I didn't
have a lot of money to spend and I
really wanted to increase the audio
quality of my weekly podcast Tech Talks
with JC cents and Barnacle E's so I'm
going to show you guys what I picked up
how it sounds how much it costs we
rarely talk about cost but damn this one
it's worth talking about all right so
first things first if you've noticed the
audio quality right now is pretty much
Boop I mean it is just one big cow pipe
you know what I'm saying a lot of times
people when they start out their
channels are so interested in video
quality or trying to get the best video
quality they can they don't stop to
think about the audio quality and a lot
of times people will listen to a video
more than they will actually watch it so
if your audio quality is garbage people
are not going to stick around and watch
your video okay so first things first
guys take the built in microphone in
your cameras and just throw them out the
window say whatever your garbage I don't
need you it doesn't matter if it's a
DSLR Canon 5d Mark 3 whatever the best
DSLRs have the crappiest microphones
built in because people know that you're
not going to be using onboard camera
mics for most if not all situations so
what am I talking on then and how do I
recommend getting good sound quality
well what I had been using in the past
is my Sennheiser II 835 mic just off
camera through XLR into a zoom h4n audio
recorder into my DSLR but the problem
with that for a lot of people is that's
actually not a very cheap set up the h4n
is still well over $200 the microphone
itself is a hundred bucks the cables of
twenty-something bucks and so you're
talking about well over three hundred
and fifty dollars with tax and stuff to
get decent audio into your camera and
most people starting out channels that's
just not in the books it's not possible
it's way too expensive so what do I
recommend well obviously I'm not talking
on this right now as you can see it's
not plugged in not to mention the
handling of it would be massively noisy
so I'm actually talking on my birthday
present that my wife bought me my visas
in a couple of videos and that is the
road smart laughs now some people may
pronounce this red
I guess that's an accent oh it actually
changes that from road to red I don't
know okay
Road pronounces it Road on their own
website and their own videos so I'm
saying Road don't correct me if you do I
don't know all right
you an angry comment okay so this is the
smart lab and here it is right here and
as you can see is just clip to my shirt
it comes with its own clip it's got a
lot nice long cable so how am i
capturing the audio well it's called the
smart lab because it's designed to work
with your iOS device now I say iOS
because that's what their app is
designed for I think they're working on
an Android app it may already be out I'm
not sure but if we take a look at the
phone right here you can see I'm
actually capturing all of the audio
right now on my smart phone completely
independent of the camera so when I'm
doing my editing a video this is clearly
going to be synced up and put into the
video you sync it by clapping and then
you line up those peaks on the editing
software and so that everything lines up
and then you just mute the track you
don't want there you go you've got the
audio from this thing well how much is
this well this lab setup is actually $60
on Amazon yeah link is down in the
description I think for $60 it's going
to be very hard to find a better
solution than this and of course you
know it's not a fantastic lavalier but
for what it is it's really hard to argue
with it now I wanted to increase the
audio for Tech Talk I've been doing Tech
Talk now for about a year and a half and
I really wanted to start to give you
guys better audio quality and I had been
using a blue Yeti which is a USB mic
which is another great mic in fact I
even recommended it in my previous
microphone video but now we're stepping
things up a lot further now I love my
e85 from Sennheiser so much I don't
think there's another mic you can get on
for a hundred bucks it sounds as good
even the shure sm58
not convinced is as good as this mic
I've listened to both in fact I bought
the sm58 first and returned it for this
mic so I've listened to both this is my
opinion right here 400 bucks is the best
mic you can get the problem with it is
that guy right there that is an XLR
input and the problem with XLR is it's
just an analog signal and it needs some
way to get into your computer now the
zoom h4n you could use that as an
interface problem is for me I got a
bunch of crackling sounds when I use it
as an interface so it wasn't feasible in
fact I've been trying to make this
transition to using this mic for Tech
Talk for quite a while so I thought well
you know I know that there are USB
mixers and eq's that I can buy that I
can use to get to the computer and the
sound into the computer where those are
just way too expensive I just was like
I'm not going to drop hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of dollars just to
do tech-talkin and that's a horrible
waste of money so I started looking over
the internet and started looking reviews
and I found this guy and this is the
alesis multi mix for a USB EQ mixer it's
actually a four channel mixer it
integrates through USB into your
computer it has its own power source it
even has phantom power even though I
don't need it this is a dynamic mic it
doesn't need power it can power your
mics that require power like the at2020
and whatnot if they need to until I
don't recall they do but whatever if you
need a something to power your mic this
can do that and thing is this thing is
not expensive
in fact I'll tell you the price at the
end so I want you to hear it first now
when it comes to settings you have to
you know two band EQ on here you have
the highs which are 10,000 Hertz you
have your lows which are 80 Hertz I
would have liked to have seen maybe a
mid a mid range like a 2.5 k Hertz
filter on there EQ but you know whatever
for the for the price point this is I
have no complaints but it's got a
low-pass filter on there it's got a its
own gain controls for channels stereo
it's got DP meter right here so you can
see if you're clipping or whatnot it's
nice and weighted and it's got great
reviews on it in fact it's you know it's
got power you can turn it on and off
when you're not using it so yeah the
features set on this is actually pretty
good considering the price point now
enough talking about it
let's go ahead and turn around let's
hook it up to the computer let's set up
the webcam let's kind of look at this as
if I was doing my channel with a webcam
like a lot of people are going to be
let's see how this thing sounds and you
might agree with me that it's definitely
worth taking a look at now I'm and I may
have mentioned I may not have mentioned
that this is a high LPL 2t boom desk
boom I do not recommend it if there has
ever been a product that J has said do
not buy it don't buy it
ignore my example and learn from my
mistake don't buy this desk boom way
overpriced there are so many better
options on Amazon and eBay I'll even
link a few down the description to get a
cheap way of mounting your mic to your
desk ignore this one behind me just
pretend it doesn't exist please for the
love of God worth purchase I ever made
let's go ahead and it into the computer
now we're back and I think immediately
the first thing you have to notice is
the audio quality of what you're
currently listening to now I want to
point this out I am doing absolutely no
post-production whatsoever to the audio
quality I'm not adding any EQ I'm not
doing any sort of smoothing on any of
audacity or anything like that I am
capturing the audio straight into
audacity exactly as eq is spitting it to
the computer now here's the kicker this
amplifier or this nut amplifier but this
eq and mixer was $61 that's right 6:161
dollars and I think for the audio
quality that you're getting is a for
that price I just I had to I had to do
it I think you guys would agree that the
audio quality is fantastic so if you're
looking at doing podcast or doing game
commentaries or anything like that I
definitely would recommend getting an
XLR setup like this over some sort of a
direct USB mic now that's my opinion
because it's the EQ I mean as you can
see here I can pull the bass out so now
we don't have nearly as much bass in
there or I can add some more highs too
I'm sure everything sounds different
right now go and put it back up was
because I like that nice warm radio
announcer voice and the cool thing is
that I can control all the audio
this now if I want to input music or
something from a straight from my phone
or something like that I could do that
through one of the other channels that's
a cool thing about it mixers your you've
got so many options now
the only drawback to this mixer I've
noticed is that the noise floor is very
very high now the noise floor is that
hissed or that just that kind of a
background noise if you will I guess
that the actual current noise that the
microphone and the line and all that
picks up it's actually really really
high in fact I've currently got the
windows levels for the USB device for
this amplifier why don't you call in an
amplifier for this EQ set at 7 of 100
and this is what you're hearing yeah 7
of 100 is where I had to put the audio
levels because if I went any higher than
it was clipping unbelievably bad in fact
right now I'm getting I'm getting all
the way up to 0 DB and I think I might
be clipping just a little bit so I just
pulled it back but a little bit that's a
cool thing I just reeked down I turn
knob so I can be like uh-oh
so I definitely recommend if you guys
want to bring your audio or your your
channels up to the next level if you're
doing game commentaries or a podcast or
something like that
save yourself a couple hundred bucks and
do something like this I mean this whole
setup the EQ mixer mic and the cable and
even an inexpensive boom you guys could
have that for less than $200 and that's
the thing 1/8 in at2020 USB mic you're
talking 130 bucks already and our the
USB Yeti USB Yeti mic was 150 when I
bought it so we're not talking that much
more money and a hell of a lot better
audio quality so guys JSU Sens hope this
videos helped you in some way hope it's
going to help me in some way quite
honestly we're going to find out how
well it does on Tech Talk but if you
want to ask me questions about this
setup I'll do the best I can to answer
them you can do it on Twitter Facebook
all the social media stuff and as always
guys listen to this mic see how it does
this Thursday on Tech Talk there'll be a
live event link right in the front page
of the video on Thurs or the channel on
Thursday
afternoon 6 p.m. Pacific time do the
math figure out when it's on for you
there will be a replay an archive as
well and tell me what you guys think of
this mic setup as always guys I hope to
see you next one and well stay classy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
