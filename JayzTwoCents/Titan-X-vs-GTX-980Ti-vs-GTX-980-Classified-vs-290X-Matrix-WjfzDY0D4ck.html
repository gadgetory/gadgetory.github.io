lot of questions a lot of rumors
regarding the suppose of 980ti we're
really floating around and people really
wanted me to talk about it and I
basically said that I didn't think that
the 980ti had a place in today's market
I was worried that it was going to kill
the custom 980 market that we've already
got like the classified and the kingpin
and the Hall of Fame and the maintenance
matrix platinum and the gigabyte g1 you
know gaming I was worried that those
cards were all going to get displaced
because the only place to 980ti really
fit what's between the Titan X and the
980 well that's currently where all
those cards are in terms of price point
so I was pretty convinced that this time
around we weren't going to see a an 80
series ti because last series with the
780 Ti was the first time there had ever
been an 80 series ti in the Nvidia
lineup usually the TI was slated for
things like to set the 560 Ti and the
660ti this 650 Ti boost and things like
that it had never really made it over to
the 80 series models so I said that the
980 TI really didn't have a place and I
was pretty hell-bent on standing by that
opinion and I said that if one came to
market I would eat my words well I've
got one right here
I have eaten my words for lunch and let
me tell you right now they taste salty
the built in resin water pump mounting
locations improved air flow and massive
radiator support make the define s from
fractal design the obvious choice for
water cooling enthusiasts the S doesn't
stand for sexy but it should now the
night atti is probably one of the worst
kept secrets really of any graphics card
launch it was pretty known that it was
going to come I mean people were just
expecting it but it came a lot closer to
the launch of the Titan X then even I
was considering I mean with the Titan X
launched in March and here we are in
what June first technically and Taipei
it's June first and that's when it
launched it's May 31st here yeah Mather
I don't remember what day it is anymore
so they launched really close together
which is why when people were heckling
me asking how I felt by putting Titan
X's in my system and at the 980ti was
going to come out and
faster I didn't think that that would
make a whole lot of sense why would
NVIDIA obsolete its top to your card two
months after launching it
well the 92 TI is just that it is
basically a shape down type or gold are
you okay you okay I don't see any okay I
don't see any bumps or bruises obviously
these two share a very well close
lineage where the Titan really the only
thing difference between the Titan X and
the 980ti in terms of appearance is the
black cooler versus the silver cooler
now let's go and talk about the Titan X
for a second here the Titan X has 3072
cuda cores it's got seven thousand
megahertz effective vram twelve
gigabytes of it and the thing is just
absolutely a behemoth 384 bit memory bus
complete dx12 compatibility I mean RAM
chips all over the front and back of the
card it was just an absolute monster and
the skunkworks benchmarks as you guys
saw made it just that so what question
was was the 980ti going to be faster
well as I already said I didn't think
that would make a whole lot of sense
so the 980ti has 2,816 cuda cores i've
got 256 cuda cores shaved off of the GM
200 GPU which is in both the Titan X and
the 980ti now really the only other
place you're going to see a difference
is the fact that this has six gigabytes
of vram on here at 7000 megahertz
effective as well as the same 384 bit
memory bus so this card really is
tailored more towards the mainstream
gamer now obviously at a price tag of
649 dollars it's more expensive than the
980 was a heck of a lot cheaper than the
Titan 350 dollars cheaper than the Titan
and even though I said it's for
mainstream gamers even though a lot of
people won't be able to afford this card
this card is a heck of a lot more
affordable than this card you have to at
least give me that
now considering these things are both
using the same GM 200 core and one of
them is 256 CUDA cores less when it
comes to boosting the 980ti is actually
boosting up from one gigahertz base
clock to 1200 and 2 megahertz boo
clock that's a GPU boost 2.0 went up to
1200 and 2 whereas the Titan X went from
the same base 1000 up to 1291 so the
Titan X even though has more CUDA cores
also boosted higher under GPU boost to
0.0 but you guys know the way I do
things I'm not going to just let GPU
boost have all the fun
I push both these cards to the same
respectable yet not max overclock both
these cards were able to go farther than
the 14 hundred megahertz overclock that
I put on them both of these actually
we're pretty damn near 1500 but the
reason why I did 1400 was because both
cards could handle it 1400 is very well
within the range that most people buying
either of these two cards would be able
to achieve so you guys can compare your
results if I went for some astronomical
fifteen hundred and fifty megahertz
overclock and achieved it most of you
wouldn't get that high chances are so I
went with 1400 if you guys get a similar
card or one of these cards you can
compare your results and I thought that
it was something that was going to be
you know much more effective in terms of
keeping temperatures from going to high
and noise getting too loud on the cards
so what we did was we took the top tier
AMD r9 290x which in my case that I have
available to me is going to be the r9
290x matrix Platinum from Asus we've got
the EVGA GTX 980 classified which was
still the highest clocked 980 that I had
in the office except for the kingpin
which I have up there which we'll be
doing soon which will probably go higher
than this but this was able to achieve
fifteen hundred and eighty megahertz so
we ran this one as high as we could to
compare it towards the 1400 of the other
two cards then as I already said the
Titan X we compared that at 1400
megahertz as well as the 980ti at 1400
megahertz so there is the ideology here
behind the benchmarks let's go ahead and
jump into those and then we'll talk
about final results with the 980ti
transition
hey guys before we do the benchmarks
let's want to make a quick note
especially for the AMD fans out there
that are nine to ninety X matrix
platinum that I have might actually be
faulty you're going to notice that the
frames per second and some of these
benchmarks are a little bit lower than
what some of the other reviewers are
showing with their 290 X's and upon
reviewing the logs for MSI Afterburner
and fraps when I was doing my benchmark
show that even though it has a 1050
megahertz turbo clock and I overclocked
it to 1075 mega Hertz only a 25
megahertz overclock I was actually
getting throttling down into the mid 900
s on the megahertz for the core with the
fans running normal and without it
overheating not sure why it was
throttling like that and it was
definitely affecting the scores so I
just want to put that out there before
we actually do the benchmarks so the r9
290x might be a few percent higher than
what you're actually seeing here I'll
have to look into it and maybe we'll do
a little video about what was wrong with
that card but without that or with that
said let's go ahead and roll those
benchmarks
well there you have it 980ti performance
is actually very very close with the
Titan ex like way too close
so CUDA cores aside the six gigabytes
versus twelve gigabytes of vram really
isn't going to be a performance
differential between these two cards at
least with current titles at current
resolutions even 4k maybe 5k it would
have mattered I don't know none of the
benchmark Suites that I ran none of the
games I ran even in 4k used more than
about 4,800 to 5 gigabytes of vram and
so maybe in the nearer future with 4k
and 5k we would be able to actually
start pushing the limits of the six
gigabytes but I don't think that were
there yet in fact the only way we were
even able to get close to the five
gigabytes mark was using Crysis 3 which
has a much larger resolution textures
than most other games but you guys will
notice that really across the board the
980ti is within ten percent of
performance of the Titan X and sometimes
as narrow as four percent behind the
Titan X o'clock four o'clock at 1400
megahertz that really that to get that
additional four to nine point eight
percent that I saw differential between
these two cards depending on the
benchmark for an additional three
hundred and fifty dollars that's a
terrible return on investment I mean
unless you're kind of like I have to
have the top of the line I want the
twelve gigabytes of vram I've got money
burning a hole in my pocket I own a
mansion a Lamborghini and a helicopter
and I just want to have the best the
twelve gigabytes of vram should not at
this current time be a selling point for
you to consider the titan x over the 980
TI in fact you can get two 980 t is for
only three hundred dollars more than the
price of one titan x and you know what
two 980 t is would end up doing to a
single Titan X I mean that that
shouldn't even really be mean in terms
of mathematical and financial just
maturity you owe it to yourself to get
to two 980 t is for 300 more than a
single Titan X if your budget will allow
for it with that said
the 980 itself is also a great option if
you don't have a budget for for a six
hundred and fifty dollar card you can
see the performance is still very very
respectable as very few games or titles
right now they're going to push anywhere
near the limits of a 980ti let alone
Titan X so you're going to be able to
get great gameplay in fact they're
reducing the price down to $4.99 and
again with the price of the 980 coming
down it probably makes a lot more sense
for people to buy a 980 maybe if you
were considering getting a 970 and
saving up a little bit longer the price
of the 970 is not changing that's still
going to be sitting right around the 350
dollar mark depending on the board that
go with the GM 200 is not just about raw
brute force which obviously it's
demonstrating even with 256 less cuda
cores nearly keeping up with the Titan X
the full DirectX 12 support precision
has been updated to now fully support DX
12 and the Windows 10 beta or release
client whichever you want to call it so
we're moving forward towards DX 12 and
that's something that I cannot wait to
see because as you know 59 60 X is
bottlenecking my three tight Nexus which
is one of the reasons why the fourth
Titan X isn't going in there but we're
moving forward NVIDIA has been working
on some amazing VR technology that I got
to look at in LA a few weeks back I
didn't actually feel sick for the first
time I was pretty wobbly in fact I think
that those those guys were like what
we're gonna catch J is going to fall I
was kinda like I was drunk that's
probably been a lot of 980ti stuff in
your inbox here on YouTube you know
probably not all that much different
from mine and you're going to even see
some people reviewing the EVGA ACX 2.0
version of the 980 TI since we know they
use the same cooler the PCB layout on
the board is identical it's freakin
identical side-by-side every little
transistor every little diode every
little solder it's exactly the same so
the a CX 2.0 they made for the Titan X
clearly mounts right onto the 980 TI so
that was a card they were able to get
out right away unfortunately I won't be
reviewing one I know with how much I
love EVGA and how much they love me I'm
not actually reviewing one that's
because I'm going to be the only
reviewer on YouTube checking out the 980
TI hybrid I nailed an exclusive Booya so
for that probably well probably next
video honestly guys I hope you've
enjoyed today's video it's always fun
doing these graphics card reviews it
gets a little tedious doing the same
benchmarks over and over and over again
and I would love to do a lot more games
but you know it's it's difficult getting
the right games in there and you're
never going to please everybody and
everybody is always going to want this
game benchmark toward benchmarks csgo or
benchmark minecraft or benchmark
minesweeper or a benchmark my mom I
don't know it's like I can't keep
everybody happy so these are the
benchmarks that I've chosen to stick
with and I'm going to start slowly
getting all the graphics cards here in
the office benchmark through the same
Suites and then I'm going to start
showing you guys more comparative as
GPUs come out yeah I'm finally going to
get on board with you know some of the
standard ways of doing things so that's
all for today on the 980ti coverage I
hope you guys have enjoyed today's video
if you're new around here and you've
never done so go ahead and click on that
subscribe button it won't hurt much if
you've enjoyed the video go ahead and
click the like button if you just hate
the video or you hate me or you hate it
video or whatever click the dislike
button because believe it or not it
actually helps in fact once you even
head on over to Twitter to tell me how
much you hate it today's video if that's
the case otherwise guys I'm going to get
the heck on out of here and as always
