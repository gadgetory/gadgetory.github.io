myself in the studio today if you guys
recall last time i was by myself cuz
Phil's off today I basically did a work
log where I kind of organize some things
and created some piles and as you can
see the piles are still there so I'm
gonna do this opportunity today to bring
you another one of these work logs of
what it kind of what kind of goes on
behind the scenes a little bit around
here to try and get some work done
and hopefully make it semi entertaining
for you because yeah this this place is
a mess this is normally the angle you
guys see the set just just kind of like
that but if we take a look at the floor
back here yeah it's just right here talk
too bad but yeah we've got so much just
crap I'm you look at my tool box this is
pretty embarrassing just everything's
such a such a mess and in shambles so
we're gonna try and get this taken care
of today do you want to be cooler do you
want to be more desirable well you're in
luck because right now you can own your
very own Jase 2 cent swag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below so this is actually a
trash pile well not that that's not
trash that's a computer with to
disassemble or finish disassembling this
pile is going to storage with the
exception of that stuff right there and
these are boxes that need to be broken
down the kitchen definitely needs to be
cleaned up because you can see it became
sort of catch-all that's also trash
right there all of the temporary loops
and things that we've been building over
time needed to be handled so yeah
there's definitely some things around
here I need to be done so one of the
things we'll be doing later is taking
this stuff right here to storage the
problem is my storage unit is is also
looking a lot like this like very full
so I might have to talk to them about
getting a bigger unit but I think what
ladies get it bigger
I get it so this is also like our intake
it area over here this is where product
that has been sent for review or to use
them builds and stuff as you can see
this is all in shambles equipment down
here in shambles and then I want to make
room for a lot of our shooting gears
we've got lots tripods and sliders and
big lights and stuff everywhere and more
camera gear and mics and stuff trash on
the floor so this is just what it's like
when you are trying to bring people
mediocre YouTube videos and you think
you're semi-professional at it I'd like
to be able to kind of see my million
play or a million sub button again at
some point and do something with this
area so I'm gonna start with breaking
down these boxes because this is
technically this is this is some recycle
old trash all that stuff did you guys
know that the corn-based packing peanuts
are actually edible it tastes like
tasteless rice cakes I feel hungry you
could um you feel like putting you know
germs in your body but hey so it's
already a ton more room now just with
the trash and recycling out of here and
yeah looking forward to I'm kind of mad
I'm moving everything on this cart
I forgot my big flat dolly at home
because I'm dumb which would be nice to
stack up these boxes on and make one or
two trips rather than like 18 with that
whatever I digress
anyone let's watch my work logs in the
past is probably going this is like the
same thing you're doing the same thing
you did in all those videos only the
mess is different but you're doing the
same thing and today I'd like to say
you're right
a lot of what we do around here is
extremely repetitive so that's the
challenge of running a channel like this
and having the videos seem kind of new
and exciting when you're doing a lot of
the same thing over and over the funny
thing is you get people that say hey J
do this kind of video and it's like well
I've already done that and they go yeah
but you haven't done it in a few years
refresh it do it again so then I do the
content again and then people say you
already did this why are you doing it
again
so yeah whatever six-one way half a
dozen the other it's always a different
side of the audience talking I think I'm
going to go ahead and partition the
kitchen again I don't you guys remember
I had these curtain rods that were up
there that went across right there it
had great curtains that hung down so the
curtains were
or the kitchen was out of the shot I
think I'm gonna do that again because
the kitchen is the thing we have a hard
time keeping organized because I've got
so much water-cooling crap sitting in
there and at least I can block it off
and go back to it later I guess right
the mess doesn't exist if you can't see
it that's why kids always push all their
crap under the bed and in the closet and
by kids I mean me so I'm gonna go ahead
and take this pile to storage now which
isn't exactly efficient or ideal
considering my storage unit is not close
by it's by my house because when I got
the storage unit I got one near my house
and then I got a studio not by my house
but that's okay because I kind of want
this stuff out of the way so I can sort
of see how I want it we're gonna exist
that way I'm not working around this
pile so let's do it so the trucks loaded
now I've got a lot more space to deal
with now look at this
that you can't really tell on camera how
much space that really is this building
is very narrow and so it's not a lot of
it's like 14 feet wide so it's not a lot
of wit I just put the tripods and stuff
there for now but I'm thinking by
putting a couch back there at the rug
and all that I don't know I just don't
know after I get back from the storage
unit I'm gonna hang the curtain back so
that we can see how that works out but I
think it'll look nice with that
segregated because like I said hide the
mess you know you don't see it it
doesn't exist it's like take calories
and fat if you don't acknowledge that
they're there you don't gain weight
at least it's what I've heard I swear I
look like the biggest PCMR fanboy right
now
so yeah here's a storage unit I think
it's time I had a yard sale a lot of
this stuff is just empty boxes some
stuff from the house old IKEA desks and
frames and legs for that lots of cases
TV boxes Pelican cases but I think it's
time to ask for a bigger unit but I
stuff to fit this stuff in here starting
look like the Tower of Babel in here
like PC Edition this is probably not
safe that mess has probably been sitting
there for at least a month maybe more
but I remember when I did that last work
log video I guess I have to look at the
date but that's finally taken care of
now so maybe we can actually make some
progress
my biggest goal with this is to have
Phil walk into the office tomorrow and
be like whoa who'd you hire to come in
and do this and I could be like it was
me I did it all myself because of
because of a general leads his troops
into battle sup my man all right so it's
lunchtime and I'm go ahead and give you
guys a little bit of a health update
here Casino on the second channel over
the years I've talked a lot about
struggles with weight gain and weight
loss and just general health and stuff
you guys have noticed over the years I
have slimmed down and plumped up and
slimmed down and going back and forth a
lot of you guys have noticed again that
I'm losing weight once again and I'm I
lost 16 pounds of July actually I lost
almost 4% percentage body fat and I
gained 2% lean muscle mass and I'm
feeling better than ever because of the
new routine proper eating in fact this
is what I'm eating today so we've got
some broiled Brussels sprouts some
southern greens a little bit of sausage
here some beef brisket very lean not
really any fat on there and then a dry
rub BBQ chicken without the sauce on the
chicken obviously my struggles with
weight have definitely been something
I've been very open about on this
channel some of you know I think a lot
of you dolt I used to weigh almost 500
pounds makes me very emotive life has
definitely improved and the sink is
making funny noises because I'm filling
the sink I'm actually doing dishes for
like the first time in six months in
this place yeah
gross right so yeah guys it's important
to take care of yourselves and the mind
follows the body and vice versa so if
you don't take care of one or the other
then you're just asking for problems so
let's kinda want to share that little
bit of tip with you tidbit with you guys
because I'm pretty proud of the fact
that I actually lost 16 pounds solid
pounds in July not water and stuff like
that and we are continuing obviously
this routine
through hopefully the rest of my life
but I know we'll see where this goes so
here's what it looks like now
with the curtains up blocking out the
kitchen I just threw a rug down here
because we have the cables back there
along the wall they need to be hidden
got some of our rigging there and I'm
still not convinced I want to turn this
into any sort of a set so I guess we
will we will just see what happens
upstairs is still a huge mess but I
think what I've gotten achieved by
myself is definitely not bad so now I'm
gonna go ahead and tear this the rest of
this system apart this is the
monstrosity that Gary built when he was
here so once I finished that I will
probably wrap up the day but I honestly
feel like I have gotten a whole lot
accomplished I really except for the
trash bag that's we gotta do something
with that so it's actually the next day
I forgot to end the vlog yesterday so I
figured what better way to end it than
to catch Phil's reaction coming in today
to seeing the fact that I actually did
something productive while he wasn't
here yeah plus today's his birthday at
least a day we're filming this something
day you're watching it so what you guys
go ahead and give Phil a huge happy
birthday in the comments below or him up
on Twitter it at frickin Phil I'll
annotate here so alright let me just go
wait for him to get in hopefully is not
running late
dang dude it's been really bored
yesterday so what are we doing family
your reaction to me actually doing work
I like got my candid reaction was you
must have been really bored huh did no
seriously I now let's see how we can
mess it up
alright guys end this video thanks for
watching I know the work vlogs are kind
of boring and stuff so anyway we're
going back to some real work now trust
me the next video is going to make you
cringe alright guys as always we'll see
you in the next one and happy birthday
Phil he's 30 now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
