know that inland is quickly becoming one
of my favorite case manufacturers for
unique they should really call it UD
quit in my opinion because they are
always out to just kind of set a new bar
come up with some sort of a new crazy
design what we're looking at right here
is their new 905 full Tower as a full
aluminum construction it's it's a very
unique kind of a style it's not a square
it's very rounded it's all completely
blocked off on the front which you would
think oh my god there's no airflow we'll
show you how that works in a second the
back has got this really neat milling on
it it almost has a very sort of a Star
Wars II feel it might be I saw this and
I kind of thought Star Wars we've got a
tempered glass on the side right here
very interesting kind of a mechanism
here to keep you from breaking it and
hopefully I don't break it I guess
anything's possible there we go so it's
got this little knob right here and I
don't want to break it but see that's
supposed to keep you from dropping the
glass but this is how you release the
glass it slides in down from the bottom
then you just pull it out like this if
it's in wind it's got to have tempered
glass right but check this out
in wind like I said likes to do crazy
and cool stuff this right here is your
top fin it's also tempered glass on top
three sixty millimeter radiator support
but it's also got an actuator motor in
there so you can close this off it's
also got RGB on top I'll be honest they
asked me what I thought about that and I
said that that's a neat function but I
don't know anyone that's gonna leave it
running without it being open because
that does completely seal off the top
compartment so you're gonna have only
the exhaust right here exhaust any of
your air out of your case if that's
closed every time you turn off the case
it also closes that vent so if you
forget to open it you start gaming that
a water-cooled rig in here your
temperatures are going to rise you
forget to open this so I told them be
neat if they could make it some sort of
a autonomous function so that when you
launch a game or that maybe it has a
case temperature sensor in there and as
the temperature rises in the case the
device opens up automatically on its own
so I'm kind of curious though you guys
tell me what you think about this neat
and unique but what I basically told
them was if it's a if it's an expensive
cost or feature to implement the
I don't know anyone that would I don't
know you guys have to tell me but it's
got a lot of support I hear three sixty
millimeter radio support on the front
three sixty on the top two fans that can
pull an air from the compartment on the
bottom when it comes to airflow like I
mentioned the front is sealed off but
that's because it doesn't pull in any
air from the front at all all air
intakes from the bottom of the chassis
trying to promote a more top-to-bottom
airflow and then of course you do have
an exhaust on the rear so it's not
available yet this is kind of an early
peek of something that's coming we don't
have price or availability yet as much
as I pushed tried to get the info they
weren't giving it up but anyway that's
that's one of the new towers that you
can expect to see in 2018 from n1 that's
the 905 I'm really curious what you guys
think sound awful of</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
