actually visited by our friends NZXT and
they dropped off the n7 motherboard
which I'm kind of glad I didn't do a
review right away because there's been a
lot of now let's see development but
there's a lot of discussion about this
motherboard it was obviously very very
ambitious for a company that's known for
making cases and all in one water
cooling units to jump into the hardware
space this has actually been a somewhat
controversial piece of product I'm kind
of I as I'm kind of glad I waited to do
a review on this because some things
have changed and we're gonna kind of
talk about this we're gonna see whether
or not this was really a good idea do
you want to be cooler do you want to be
more desirable well you're in luck
because right now you can own your very
own J's to send swag and immediately be
the cool kid on the block max out your
sex appeal by following the link down
below I'll be honest I kind of hate
doing motherboard reviews they're boring
they are the unsung hero of your
computer the GPU gets all the gaming
glory and the CPU gets all of the hype
and other than that your motherboard
doesn't really get that much attention I
mean if you're overclocking obviously
it's an important part of your system
and the only time it even gets noticed
is when it fails and then everyone loves
to curse the motherboard manufacturers
but we'll kind of circle back to that
here's your motherboard obviously this
is a white version set that aside for
now SLI bridge some long screws we've
got some LED strips right here because
unfortunately the lighting control on
this specifically requires NZXT cam
which let's kind of love hey I did a
video on cam many of you didn't like it
there has been some improvements to it
for sure that's kind of want to see the
layout here they look like just standard
RGB strips though but this is where you
learn that it is proprietary because it
has got not just your standard see most
of the time RGB plugs terminate like
this that way you can just plug this
directly into your motherboard these on
the other hand terminate to a keyed plug
which is
pretty much NZXT cam only which like I
said it's unfortunate I don't like when
companies force you to use their
software like you have to use cam to use
functions on this motherboard SS so
right on the box though so I guess you
know whatever so here's the motherboard
itself I do believe that a black and a
white version white is obviously the one
that we got here and in terms of just
build quality I mean it feels sturdy
it's not the thickest PCB I've ever
taken a look at you can see this is a
white motherboard right here it's almost
got a bit of an eggshell color too it's
not like a like a pure white it's more
of an eggshell even has a texture to it
we've got a kind of a ghost at NZXT logo
right here we've got a heatsink so
you're pretty beefy heatsink
now in terms of the OEM for this this is
an ECS motherboard which has kind of
been conversation point number two on
this is the fact that ECS is not known
for being the most high-end motherboard
manufacturer but they they did say in a
press release that the the motherboard
manufacturer built this to spec with
NZXT is not a rebrand of another
motherboard it was built from the ground
up in collaboration with NZXT
so there is that this is of course an
8th gen socket so we are gonna be
running our 8700 k in here to test now a
couple of things I'm not a fan of one
we've handled this already so it's
starting to look a little dirty right
here trying to have dirty hands but hey
left here to release this is where your
m dot 2 drives go so if you're not using
M 2 then that stays on top but what I
don't like is you see how I just
uncovered that and now you can see the
little Q the little Q code readout what
I don't understand why they would cover
that why would you cover that if it's
something that you could still use when
you don't have an MDOT to drive in there
put that visible somewhere down here
again dirty I need to clean this thing
man you handle this a little bit and it
starts to get it's dirty but anyway
there's also another cover right here
I'd open it from this side these are not
necessarily the easiest covers to get
off
yeah there we go there's nothing under
that one so I think that's just more for
symmetry but as you can see there's
there's literally nothing under that one
so I thought that was an M about 200 ere
no I was wrong
now the log screws that are in the bag
right here these are specifically for
you to be able to mount down your
motherboard because you've got this bit
of an armor on here you can't actually
get the screws down in there too easily
so these are designed to go in there
like that and then you just use your
Phillips head screwdriver to tighten
them down you got some short ones for
it's a little shorter over here got the
longer ones for its higher over there so
it's nice if they include that you just
really got to hope that whatever case
you're using actually use that thread
because there are a couple of different
there's two different thread sizes that
standoffs tend to use so fingers crossed
on that one in terms of the cover
there's one other thing I want to kind
of point up and amount a fan up it's
this cover right here for the chipset
that's the heatsink which we've now
covered up with this very lightly
perforated piece of metal and why we
would want to suddenly just create a
situation where we could be overheating
our chipset is beyond me so yeah I guess
if you're gonna care about your system
you're gonna want that off we got a USB
3.0 for SATA ports our 24 pin we have
one band no it's not a fan header that's
the RGB header we've got another RGB
header right here again they have to use
if you use their cable and then we've
got a i/o pump CPU fan system fan system
fan system fan ATX power and on the
bottom here we've got our front audio
connector and then we've got one two
three USBs another USB 3.0 and tons of
fan headers though lots of fan headers
so cool on that but we got a water pump
header to another system fan it's
advanced this the fan alright so we've
got another lift to release right here
and this is where our other MDOT two is
right there which goes above the top GPU
right next to our 4x PCIe so before we
plug this into the test bench a couple
things worth noting I'm not sure exactly
what the power delivery system on this
we've got one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen chokes
on there one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
capacitors right here next to the vrm so
it seems beefy but again it's one of
those things where it's time is gonna
tell in terms of how well it holds up
but a couple of things worth pointing
out on the motherboard surface itself we
do have surface mounted power and reset
buttons these this is nice especially
since we're gonna use it on our test
bench that way I'm not gonna jumper pins
together on the back of the motherboard
we've got one two three four USB 3.0 I'm
counting to four USB 2.0 is a BIOS
resource CMOS clear switch this is nice
this is it I love seeing this because
when you're doing a lot of overclocking
you need to reset that CMOS quickly
there's no reason this shouldn't be on
every motherboard as far as I'm
concerned
but then again I'm bit uh I'm bit of an
elitist so whatever we've also got our
our Ethernet port on here HDMI and a
display port which is nice for Intel's
internal you know iris graphics it's
good for troubleshooting bad graphics
cards and things we've got our spit of
yeah it's such a funny acronym right but
if that's that is our optical output
right there and then we've got our seven
point surround built-in so anyway looks
like I missed the USB port we got one
right there as well so we've got plenty
of USB connectivity on this we'd like to
see more USB 3.0 but before we can draw
our final conclusions we have to get
this set up on the test bench to see how
well the BIOS is constructed BIOS can
make or break a motherboard especially
if the UEFI BIOS is terrible let's go
ahead and set it up and see how well it
is so this is what the motherboard looks
like we actually removed the shell it
just has these little pressure clips
that push in there just be careful when
you go to take it off though because
yeah I stabbed the out of myself on
one of the solder points I was talking
about earlier when I grabbed it from the
bottom of the board
split my finger and then I proceeded to
bleed all over everything so we've
cleaned that up
fortunately we get any on the white part
of the motherboard but there is a piece
of me on this motherboard forever now I
do you think that's blood right there
can't get to come off
oh well that's fine we don't need to do
one on my blood yeah let's just say
blood sacrifice has been overpaid and
anyway this just tops loss so it doesn't
make it kind of neat though that she
could mod this right you could paint it
do something custom with it saying this
one's unscrews but underneath it's just
a basic looking motherboard there's
really nothing all that special about it
I mean just looks like any regular old
black motherboard the real reason why I
took this off though is I couldn't
actually mount it down on this test
bench because it's got studs a stick up
with these aluminum nuts and because
this has that long screw like I showed
you like it would go in a standard case
with standoffs I couldn't actually mount
this down but since I popped that off
now we can actually do that and we can
just snap it back down
unfortunately Nick that means now I have
to pop this off again to actually take
it off the motherboard or the test bench
potentially though see this blood right
there there was blood hurt the blood
see it's bleeding through the band-aid I
cut myself pretty good other blood out
there too you know these guys know when
they go through for these videos nick
has remedied the problem so actually
looks pretty good on here because it's a
white and black test bench with a white
and black motherboard it looks pretty
awesome but we're gonna head and do its
first boot to power it on it's always a
good time alright so here's the BIOS
whoa it's interesting looking it
definitely looks a lot like like sort of
like cam okay so we got our water pump
rpm set up right there that is correct I
do have my pump wire set up to the pump
down here it's some rpm wire for the
pump so it is seeing the pump which is
good CPU temperature is at 23 system
temperature at 20 so we've got these
one-click settings here for different
performance values and stuff so if we go
over here to our main CPU
hyper-threading so all the settings we
expect here hyper-threading active cores
virtualization technology we'll turn
that off because we're gonna try and
overclock this see States enhanced c1
where is our overclock settings turbo
boost
oh here we go so we had to go to CPU and
RAM not advanced CPU and RAM is where we
can do our over clocks and you can see
these are the individual core ratios
right there so let's just set this to
like 48 you're gonna do it all
individually huh so instead of just be
able to lock all the course together it
looks like we have to do this
individually voltage settings ok so
that's easily identifiable so we'll make
that like oh geez so this like provides
me the old legacy BIOS we had to
actually select from like a drop-down
why you can only adjust these by 50
millivolts at a time so we'll do it 1.3
let's see if what even boots up these
are settings that I know worked on my
asus board so I guess we'll see if that
works still booting there we go now we
got video CMOS settings wrong what do
you see my settings wrong it's this mean
CMOS settings wrong doesn't look like it
save any of our overclocked settings
either so a couple things I'm noticing
here with the BIOS is the very same
settings I run on my Strix board right
here this is the Z 370 - East Rick's
from Asus we've been running this on the
test bench ever since we got our 8700 K
and we were running 3200 actually on the
Strix board
29:33 won't boot 2667 I know I guess
we'll find out right now it's it's
frustrating because I mean this is a
very easy it's a very easy CPU to
overclock and the memory is pretty
simple things I'm setting here are just
are not staying which is frustrating
there's a 1.3 and AD core we don't know
where but on Cori now so I'm just gonna
try saving that let's see because what
happens is it turns off like it's
supposed to it's readjusting its
voltages and it turns on tries to boot
and it turns off and reboots again so
well it doesn't seem to be having luck
overclocking the memory like I wanted to
remember 3000 megahertz or the XMP
profile is indeed an overclock 21 33 is
the base clock on this memory and that's
how we went to Windows so it's it's a
little bit more picky I think we're
going to need to see some BIOS maturity
on this again I don't have
a lot of experience with ECS a lot of
people seem to think that ECS is a
terrible brand again I don't know I've
not dealt with ECS enough but in terms
of value though I really have a hard
time swallowing 249 for this board $2.99
was absolutely outrageous
249 I think a lot of people still feel
is outrageous but it says something that
the company listened to the crowd and
reduced its price I just don't think
they reduced it enough I don't think
they can reduce it more cuz they
probably are not getting any profit in
this as it is at 2:49 motherboard
manufacturers have had a long lasting
relationship with the OEM have been able
to get the price down to get the value
up for their motherboards get the prices
where they need to be for the public
they can still make money new companies
against txt getting into the scene
aren't getting that kind of we'll call
it discount to that manufacturing rate
which is why the price has to stay up so
that's why something like the Strix
board makes a whole lot more sense
because you can get this one for $1.99
and it has built-in wireless sure it has
less USBs I would like to see more USB
3.0 S on this board but it has built in
Wireless which we have to use a dongle
right here this is $80 dongle for our 5g
to get our full fiber network going
wirelessly but you know what though
honestly at the end of the day this is
just sort of a quick overview of the
motherboard showing that hey it works
but you guys as buyers you guys are the
ones that the company needs to listen to
not me and sound off in the comments
below what you guys feel about this I
know I'm not the first youtuber to do
this I mean like fourth or fifth in the
list actually do reviews of this but you
guys tell us what you think I'm curious
I I don't think I would personally spend
$250 on this motherboard as it sits
right now but anyway time to go guys
thanks for watching and I'll see you the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
