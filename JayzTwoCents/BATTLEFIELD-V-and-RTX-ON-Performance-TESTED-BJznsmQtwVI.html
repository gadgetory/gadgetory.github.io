an idea for a great video because today
is the official launch day at
battlefield 5 one of the launch titles
foreign videos new well Simon there's
actually it's just ray tracing ray
tracing in games and we've been waiting
to see what's the performance gonna be
like new cards with features that
weren't even available on launch day
well they're here now and ray tracing is
something where me checking out in
battlefield 5 not the first to do it the
first time we're doing it on our channel
we thought what if we do sli because sli
right in d-link we've got all this
renewed focus from Nvidia and Tom
himself saying sli is gonna be a new
focus of theirs and then we found out
that you have to have DX 12 been able to
have DX r or rate racing happening in
the game and unfortunately DX 12 for
whatever reason dices decided not to
support sli so you can do SLI without
ray tracing or ray tracing with no SLI
then we also found out that they don't
even support DL SS yet which is one of
the other functions that you're supposed
to get with the tensor cores in here and
you're gonna have AI super sampling
where it's gonna be offloading that from
the CUDA cores making a much better
gaming experience that again no titles
currently support so a video idea that
went completely out the window because
of the fact that once again here we are
with tech that was touted about for two
whole hours on stage that most of it
still isn't even available Metro Exodus
not out yet shadow the Tomb Raider still
doesn't support any of it so instead
we're gonna show you what the baseline
performance looks like with a single
card in this case the 2080 ti Strix I do
have two of them that's what we were
planning on doing SLI with the other
ones over there on the bridge so yeah
the card for whatever reason is still
not available on the market but I
digress that's besides the point
we're gonna see what happens when we
overclock and can we get a playable
experience in battlefield 5 with ray
tracing on ultra do you want to be
cooler you want to be more desirable you
know what guys I got new merch it's
available now Cod me calm /jc sense we
got zip up hoodies we got tri-blend we
got a new logo I digress
since 2012 it's at the wrist logo you
guys been asking for that anyway well
guys live it up we could all kinda stuff
zip up hoodies have beanies polos
don't take my word for it cuz obviously
I can't do this ad so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks okay so here are the
settings we're gonna start off without
ray-tracing turn or DX are turned on and
I want to address something here real
quick the reason why were you're using a
1080p panel and we are not capturing
this we're pointing a camera at it is
two reasons one we are running a 144
Hertz panel which our capture card caps
now at 60 and it's DisplayPort not HDMI
second we're using 1080p and not 1440p
because if you look at the Steam
Hardware statistics of I what millions
of computers that have actually been
Hardware scanned and they have a
database of what hardware is what there
are sixty two point four percent of
users on Steam still using a 1080p panel
three percent are using 1440p and one
percent are using 4k in the 16 by 9
aspect ratio this is reminiscent of the
user experience if people are
complaining about the other reason
technically a third reason is a lot of
people said that with 1080p and all
settings maxed and r-tx on we're seeing
a drop to 30 fps in battlefield 5 so I
wanted to test that and to do that like
I said we're using our Strix card at
stock clocks and then we are going to
overclock it to see how much we can
improve the experience and can we get to
or stay above 60 fps and to do that here
are our settings in the advanced menu
here we can see that we have DX 12
enabled DX our is disabled because we
are again testing this with just DirectX
12 first and everything else is
completely capped out frame limiter at
200 which is the the Frostbite engine
cap protocol C goes off no upscaling
GPU memory restriction technically we
make that off because we have 11 gigs of
ram such a few plenty graphics quality
and everything else is as high as it
will go we are going to actually go into
the campaign we found a mission here
that has lots of water lots of shiny
stuff where we can go in there and check
reflections that's in war story and
don't worry we will be doing multiplayer
a little bit later in this video because
that's where people are going to spend
most of their time as soon as we're done
with the campaign so let's go and get
our baseline this is all stock settings
out of the box
twenty-eight ETI non tenser corers
nothing's happening so let's see how
this goes so here's a good example right
here watching this player runs by you
could see him he's there right he's
upside down but this is an example of
screen space reflection this is not
actually ray tracing because watch what
happens when I scroll to the right this
is a reflection of the back of the car
what's happening here I hope Wow a body
okay hopefully I don't die cuz it's the
perfect spot to be what's happening here
is this truck and this world is being
just flipped upside down and then drawn
on the water there's no perspective
watch what happens when I block this
truck with the back of this truck watch
what happens in the water now it's
blocking it off because if that now
rendered the back of this truck upside
down right there that would be
physically wrong so instead of showing
you something physically wrong it just
removes the thing and the player is
doing the same thing to see how that's
just a big block of whatever running by
so what you're seeing right here
although looks great this is what ray
tracing was designed to kind of give you
is this more realistic reflection of
things that are happening in as viewing
angles bounce and that's exactly what
happens with a reflection you were
seeing a bounced angle of something else
I bounced image so here's another
example of screen space right here my
gun is creating its own straight line
down so as I turn the gun left look at
the water see how my gun is creating
this sort of a buffer right there in the
water so that's an example of
rasterization screen space reflections
this is just a bright image drawn on the
ground to say oh something's on fire
right there but it's not an actual
reflection and my gun will probably
block that too not a little bit you can
still kind of see it but it's shining
through but that's not a reflection of
the truck on fire in fact you can barely
see the truck as I get closer to it you
can see that's just a pinpoint light
source that's drawn in the reflection as
part of the screen space so let's go
ahead and restart now with ray tracing
enabled and compare so our FPS will go
back over here to the same truck scene
so that we can get our baseline fps
so kneeling right here at the back of
this truck 150 FPS so very same scene
just reloaded with ray-tracing enabled
on ultra you can see our FPS
significantly dropped 6463 is 62 but how
before how I showed it was just sort of
a glowing effect on the ground you can
visibly see now this is animating this
is a true reflection of the fire now if
we come over here to the truck you know
where the truck look like before later
the detail now you can physically see
the truck and do you see how it's still
rendering that truck in the reflection
even though it is out of sight now that
didn't happen before I make shot outside
to move to the side that didn't happen
before because the way screen-space
reflection actually cheats is it only
shows what's directly being rendered
with line-of-sight it doesn't render
things that are behind objects that's
what ray tracing does and so that's why
this is actually impressive from a
technological standpoint so regardless
of what your view is on FPS or playable
or realistic or whatever you own videos
estimated that just the technological
advancement of what ray chasing is able
to do to me is really impressive in fact
if I kneel down and kind of start
scooting back here we should see the
truck appear in the reflections before
we can even see oh yeah this is a truck
right there that's behind this object
see that do you see how the perspective
shift happens in the reflection so now
as I scoot left you should see the truck
there it is are we still in ultra let me
see wait we're on low yeah make it ultra
we're gonna get a huge performance hit
yeah run low holy crap
do you see what I mean you can stay you
could still use low and get a pretty
good FPS experience
here's ultra oh wow this so what happens
is it's really a resolution change and
it makes everything a bit sharper gives
you more depth I guess it kind of
renders off in the distance a little
more like I showed you with the fire
like hell they're looking at me like yo
Dawg what are you doing oh yeah it's all
dew points trip at the sky you're good
124 FPS 41 43 I mean yeah this is oh wow
this is laggy that's certainly the 34
fps 35 I was like I'm up here into the
larger world look at this oh boy this is
taking a huge hit
if you understand what's involved in
ray-tracing that's not terrible yes I
know I'm well aware that sounds like J's
shilling for Nvidia Nvidia had nothing
to do with this video this is purely my
opinion but we're gonna go in a
multiplayer now because why don't we
experience we played this beforehand
multiplayer was not as hard to render as
the single player normally it's the
other way around normally single players
like not that hard and go into
multiplayer with 64 people in an open
world and it's just like a chug fest oh
here's a car here so well with that
there it is right there I want someone
to go running by but leave the flag you
see the flag right here you can see it
in the reflection no I don't think the
player model is oh crap there I am hi
ray tracing is very distracting do that
I guess that makes sense I am an entity
that's it that's being rendered right
look at the glass look everything's
sharp in the glass so you actually have
an orange peel effect on the paint but
sharpness in the glass alright let's
play for real now let's stop looking at
reflections and let's see okay so but I
mean that was I guess I'm just a nerd
for this stuff maybe maybe that makes me
a shill I don't know I just love this
nerdy advancement in technology and I'm
sorry if you don't but I'm getting 86
FPS while there's a fire burning to the
right of me and showing off showing up
in reflections okay so here's the bottom
line we're getting a lot better than 30
FPS in battlefield 5 multiplayer and
what a lot of people are complaining
about I don't know if this is just one
of those people are trying to get hits
and views based off being super negative
holding it this time it's like here
here's the fucking car you're looking
for there you go really reflection right
there look at that dude and we're
getting a hundred FPS while doing it so
there's your proof that the glass was
reflecting okay I don't know if people
just like to to get off on negative news
and and whatnot I'm a nerd for this sort
of stuff I think it's amazing I'm
running around right now the reflections
is suffer amazing I'm not saying the
performance is amazing I mean obviously
we can get well over 150 FPS with a
single card we drop down below 100
with everything on ultra down to around
70 80 with it on low I'm getting 100 FPS
at the moment it's unfortunate that
there's a lot of people out there that
are just super negative rather than
seeing the advancement technology that
we're getting here but at the end of the
day there's two kinds of people people
like me who really get off on the
amazing advancements that we're getting
with graphical you know enhancements and
and detail and then there's the guy that
just wants a high level of FPS doesn't
care about that doesn't stop the smell
the roses and both are perfectly fine
this is obviously not the card for you
if you're the latter and unfortunately
now that I've seen real-time rate racing
in person screen space reflections are
just good all right guys I'm gonna go I
just want to take a look at RT X and
share this with you and see was it is it
playable for me the answer is personally
yes for you it may not be sound off in
the comments below on what you think of
this and whether or not this is
something you even care about weird love
to have tested SL lies we can get back
way above 100 FPS but unfortunately dice
has no plans to implement that guys
thanks for watching as it always will
see you in the next one
eventually I'll kill a guy okay before
we die we found a room that has all
polished tile floors look at the
reflections on this watch what happens
when I shoot the wall look down here in
the reflections that is okay you guys
can go now I'm a thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
