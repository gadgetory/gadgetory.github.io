let's take a moment to just pause and
reflect over the things that we have to
be grateful for this year and it's also
take a moment to remember those that we
may have lost this year's those whose
lives may have been taken tragically too
soon are those who have passed due to
old age and have lived long and fruitful
lives whether you celebrate Christmas or
another holiday it's important to
remember those that are important in
your life those that are close to you
and those you may have lost as we ring
in the new year 2013 let's all make an
effort to be a better persons and live
better lives and enrich the lives of
those around us as you formulate your
new year's resolutions I challenge you

lives of those around you my resolution
is to spend less time in reaching my
life and doing what I can to make life
better for those people close to me and
