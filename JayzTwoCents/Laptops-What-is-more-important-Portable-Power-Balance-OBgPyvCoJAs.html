there's no topic I can talk about that
doesn't polarize the audience as much as
laptops but take it from someone who
spent almost a decade working IT working
in satellite offices and a gamer laptops
are necessary they're a necessary evil
according to some but I think they're
just damn cool so that's why I teamed up
with MSI to get some laptops here that I
borrowed to show you guys a couple of
different categories of where laptops
are and hopefully make some of your
buying decisions just a little bit
easier I did my back to school video
where I showed how to build an
inexpensive desktop then the top comment
was why just build a laptop it's it
back-to-school build you should buy a
laptop and if I talk about high end
laptops then it's always why would you
buy a high end laptop buy high end
desktop so the three different laptops
were taking a look at here this is the
gs-7 t3 VR and basically the GS stands
for stealth this is their stealth series
it's a very thin lightweight laptop as
you can see right here and I've actually
took a look at this earlier this year
but there's been some generational
upgrades and we'll talk about that in a
second it's the same laptop that Nick is
actually using now full time it's a
great laptop I absolutely love the form
factor of it which is what really sold
me on it now this is the G e series
which stands for enthusiast this is
their 15-inch model this is pretty new
they also have a 17 inch version it's
important to note this is a 17 over here
on the stealth also but this is a 15
inch mainstream laptop which is still
pretty light and portable and packs a
lot of hardware in there but if you're
the kind of guy that's like you know
what I travel a lot and I want all the
power I can get and I'm not willing to
sacrifice any of that power well then
you look at the Titan series because
this guy this is the successor to the
one we took a look at earlier this year
if you guys remember that Titan I took a
look at when I first moved into the
studio this is the successor to that and
trust me when I say they held nothing
back now this may look like the same
stealth we took a look at earlier this
year it's got the same chassis the same
brushed finish which is looks amazing
but unfortunately it's a fingerprint
magnet it's got the same 120 Hertz 17.3
inch gaming display with 7700 HQ 32 gigs
of ram 1 terabyte SSD with a believe of
the two terabyte 7200 rpm Drive in there
steelseries keyboard RGB it looks
identical but what's different
the previous model had GTX 1060 and this
one steps it up to a 1070 max Q now the
max Q is somebody that's new this year
for Nvidia it launched back in May with
Computex
where the max Q has a design focus on
efficiency and acoustics while
maintaining high performance so what
it's going to do is it's going to
automatically adjust itself dynamically
to stay within a certain efficiency
curve as well as a student certain
acoustic level and they do that by
enabling something called whisper mode
which is inside of GeForce experience
now what they found is that as the curve
gets a bit higher there becomes a
diminishing return where to get the next
bit of performance takes a much more
exponential amount of power in a much
higher acoustic level to maintain things
like temperatures in you know laptop
chassis that's the challenge here when
you're dealing with these laptops is
getting as much performance as possible
but maintaining heat especially on a guy
like this look at how thin that is there
is not a lot of room in here for heat
pipes if we look at the bottom you can
see we've got quite a bit of ventilation
at the front we've got our events for
speakers but on the back we've got our
intakes we've also got some exhaust
right here on the back so we've got a
lot of ventilation on the sides right
here as well but what that allows NVIDIA
to do with the max of the 1070 max Q is
actually dynamically control itself to
stay within that efficiency curve so it
allows the 1070 to stay right around 115
Watts total graphics power draw which
means less heat and less noise so you
can actually not be sitting there
annoying everyone next to you and like
the coffee shop right you take you take
a gaming laptop to a coffee shop you
start gaming everyone knows you're
gaming but this Dera here actually stays
pretty quiet now moving on to the ge 63
this is their enthusiast lineup right
here this is a 15-inch model but this is
probably going to be more of the sweet
spot 7,700 HQ 32 gigs of ram although
this has a 512 gigabyte SSD versus the
one terabyte SSD in there so nvme
storage but it's actually got a my
opinion a better keyboard than what's on
the Stealth cuz look at this perky RGB
lighting which we don't actually have on
the Stealth that's a zone lighting thing
it's got some really cool features on
there but the 15-inch is going to be
probably leaning towards this one right
here also being yeah I still think it's
my favorite honestly but that's not
enough for you you're a die-hard gamer
you want as much power look at that
top gently you want to miss as much
power as you can get well I've got
something for you yes well this is the
Titan and that's its power brick this is
pretty much desktop components crammed
into a laptop look how thick it is
ladies look at the ventilation on this
guy even now one of the reasons why
ventilation like that exists is because
once you start putting high-end desktop
components into a small form-factor
this is a small form-factor PC guys I
don't really think we should call this a
laptop anymore listens to be fair it's
got a 78 20 HK it's got 64 gigabytes of
ddr4 but it's got a full-blown GT X 1080
GPU in there now it's not this although
that could technically fit in there if
you might be technical about it its base
it's the same components the same chip
the full eight gigabytes the full speed
and overclockable this guy is
overclockable where these two over here
are not you can overclock the GPU you
can overclock the CPU and get a massive
amount of performance but where this
one's different than the one we took a
look at earlier this year is they've
changed the keyboard it's a steel series
low profile mechanical keyboard so you
you've got your clicky click on the keys
you've also got pur RGB or perky RGB
lighting again the thing I'm kind of sad
that mine doesn't have but I digress
it's a behemoth now this does this this
version of the 1080 is actually not the
max cube but they do have a max acute
1080 as well that are available in
laptops this one you can even get in a
full-blown gtx 1070 sli if you want it
so that's a bit incredible this right
here is probably not going to fall under
the category of travel friendly yes you
can travel with it but you know I've had
the Titan now since earlier this year
the other tightness now Brian's computer
hi Brian say hi Brian's over there he's
been using this now for work and he
likes a big laptop he's a big strong guy
but if you're on planes and stuff a lot
I used to try and use it when I was
traveling it's not very friendly it's
it's extra deep it's a little slide-out
tray with a guy my height it's just
there's not a lot of room for it that's
where something like this in my opinion
is definitely the sweet spot 15 inch
it's gonna
in any laptop bag this account I think
to laptop bags while shopping that
actually fit it in there so that's
something worth taking you know keeping
in mind when you're shopping for that
17.3 inch display but this has two
displays available this is the 4k
version that they sent however it's also
available in the high refresh rate 1080p
version as well
now what's performance like on these why
now let's play let's play some games and
see what happens so I was gonna do GTA v
as a benchmark but for whatever reason
my external it won't recognize it won't
let me migrate but a sistema stupid
sometimes
and so am i but whatever so we're gonna
do 3d mark time spy instead because you
can download it for free and I just I
think it's free and you guys can compare
it home to see how your results are
doing to these laptops so we're gonna go
ahead and just run it in two configs
because remember I said that this is an
overclocking laptop it's currently in
sport mode and we're just gonna leave it
that way the fan is at Auto there's no
overclock applied to anything yet but if
I took an overclocking laptop and I
didn't you know actually run both
benchmarks with overclocked and non
overclocked I think you guys would tear
me apart so we're gonna do both and see
if there's any gains to actually be had
okay so we got a combined score 6391 a
graphic score 6944 and a cpu score of
4400 for so imma take a picture of that
because I don't want to forget I always
need to forget these numbers and then
I'm like what was the first number again
so what kind of options to be actually
available here if we go into the dragon
center and go to system tuner we can go
to turbo and then to turbo we get this
little wheel that we can click and then
we can adjust our GPU offset and our CPU
offset what happens is we go to GPU
let's offset let's see we can do a 200
megahertz offset let's try 150 and then
the B Ram clock
let's do let's do 250 these are numbers
that I can typically get on a desktop
GPU like the wherever it went the one I
had out here but we also are gonna have
to we're gonna have to give this thing
some airflow so once you click cooler
boost or that basically says annoy all
your neighbors for the sake of
performance because screw your neighbors
it's all about the fps
so we saw a pretty significant
improvement we have from a 6391 to a
69.95 and our graphics court went from a
69 44 to a 74 91 and our CPU score
actually came up even from a 40 404 to a
5809 so obviously we went from 4.0 which
is where defaults to 4.2 so 200 extra
megahertz on the CPU 150 extra megahertz
on the GPU core and 250 megahertz on the
GPU rim so as you can see we clearly saw
some improvements here while
overclocking this laptop obviously at
the sacrifice of acoustics and if we
look at our temperatures where our
temperatures do our temperatures max
down the GPU at 68 C in an overclocked
1080 and a laptop I think that's pretty
damn acceptable so next up is the GS 63
which I find really to be middle-ground
it's kind of like if the Titan and the
Stealth had a baby but because it's got
the same 1070 mxq you're gonna get the
same efficiency benefits the power draw
benefits right it's not as much power
draw from the plug and you're gonna get
better ku6 and performance when it comes
to tailoring itself but you still get
overclock ability with this because why
the heck not it's Nvidia you should be
able to overclock it but you don't get
CPU overclocking with the 7700 HQ that's
unfortunate but at least we can control
our GPU so I'm gonna put the I'm gonna
put it back up to the same frequency we
had with the other Titan there 250 150
and 250 because why the heck not we
could probably push that farther but it
also has a pretty decent amount of
cooling on the bottom as you can see
right here and there's a lot of air
that's actually moving through this
laptop so we're gonna run time spy again
and see how it does
so yeah the audio on this is pretty damn
good the I wasn't expecting that to be
honest so we've got a 55 84 on the
combined test a graphic score of 59 79
and a cpu score of 40 66 so remember a
1080 higher end graphics card and a
higher end i7 versus the mainstream
stuff and it's actually performing very
very well what are max temperatures get
remember we are overclocked our max GPU
temperature looks like we reached right
around 75 that's 75 Oh like we hit 77 as
a max temperature and that's overclocked
remember that that's important so the
max Q design is definitely working
pretty well which brings us back to the
stealth which is again like one that we
took a look at earlier this year as well
now if we go to the system tuner what do
we get access to here so there's no
turbo mode on that so already even
though we have the same hardware in the
stealth what we're giving up for the
smaller form factor the thinner form
factor it's actually a larger footprint
15 versus 17 but because of the depth
restraint we have more cooling
capability in the GE than we do versus
the GS so that's why all we get sport
comfort eco and power options which is
like high performance you have a high
performance power option so we can't do
any overclocking on this whatsoever we
still have fan control so you are
sacrificing some on that so I'm
expecting this to actually score a
little less than the GE simply even
though we the same GPU simply because we
are not going to be getting any sort of
overclocking ability also to audio wise
the reason why I saw the audio clip on
the GG I've been running the stealth for
a while personally the audio is amazing
on the GE vs. the stealth in fact we'll
do a little bit of a side-by-side
comparison right now
so it's no surprise to get a lower score
with the stealth a 44 86 combined 55 45
41 to graphics and 4201 cpu simply
because we were not able to overclock
the GPUs know the path back
so I'm aware that this wasn't like
in-depth reviews of each of these but
this was just kind of an overview of
some of the lineup that you can expect
with laptops especially from MSI's G
series I mean it's kind of like a small
wait no small medium and large
right uncompromising overclocking big
heavy before bearing is that the right
word dictionary Brian some is forbearing
what does forbearing mean why is she
laughing at me or I guess it kind of
works out this way like I would I would
be the Titan Brian would be more like
the GE right he's smaller but he's
strong right and then we got Nick over
here who's just kind of like the more
agile the little thinner than us kind of
thing we hate him
but at the end of the day laptops are
here for a reason it's good to see that
companies are innovating like the max-q
technology from Nvidia and then MSI for
incorporating this stuff and giving you
a decent amount of options my favorite
of the bunch is still the GE 63 I love
this right here I'm gonna I'm gonna I
wanna I want it I want it the sound
quality of this alone was like oh my god
wouldn't expect good sound out of the
Titan there's lots of room for big
speakers in there but compared to the
stealth the stealth right because it's
so thin doesn't have a lot of depth to
deal with putting big drivers or
anything in there but the sound was just
so full and rich out of the GE so anyway
guys thanks for watching today's video
and a huge thank you to MSI for let me
borrow these laptops so I could do this
video for you what laptop would you
choose and why sound off in the comments
below and let me know what it is you
look for when you're buying a new laptop
are you guys can more concern with
portability are you more concerned with
uncompromising performance or do you
kind of want something more in the
middle ground like price is no no object
for you guys what would you buy and why
anyway thanks for watching guys and as
always I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
