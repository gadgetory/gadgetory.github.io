we're going to talk about how to take
this boring looking AIO cooler and make
it look awesome with cable wads new AIO
sleeping kit they're calling it their
mod sleeve and they're already known for
making power supply cables and sleeves
but now they're taken to the next level
with a IO sleeping so that you can
really tie in a theme to your whole
system even if you're not using custom
water cooling loop which I think you
should be but if you're not you know you
can make it look cool this too so what
I'm holding right here is they're series
two and this is advertised as working
with the EVGA closed-loop cooler the 120
of the 240 as well as the NZXT kraken
series of coolers so I've got my NZXT
cooler right here this is the crack in
what x41 negative we use this on the GPU
loop a little while back and we've got
five different colors right here so
they're all pretty much the same they're
just different colors we've got this
carbon
white green light blue and red I think
I'm going to go with white white seems
to be the color that a lot of people are
really kind of bringing back there was a
while there were white builds were kind
of thing and then they went away and now
they're back but this is very similar to
the type of sleeping material you would
find on a sleeves power supply cable kit
but as you can see it's not solid it's
basically a wrap so it wraps around
itself and it basically advertises being
too lit you don't take your loop apart
you have to drain it you just wrap this
around the sleeves that are already on
there the tubes and then you put the
clips on the end and it sounds pretty
easy it shouldn't be too bad hopefully
it'll work but somebody else I'm going
to do too is I'm also going to take one
of the kits and I'm going to try them on
a loop or a kit that's not advertised
because I'm curious as to how well this
will work on other AOS on the market
that are not necessarily on the list so
let's go ahead and start by taking a
look at our crack in here it's already
sleeved this is more like a paracord
sleeve so it's more of a fabric where
this is definitely a plastic so it's not
going to slide around at least on this
and it shouldn't slide around on even
rubber tubing on something like and h100
but yeah let's go ahead and try this and
see how well this works I think it'd be
easier to have this basically as
stretched out as possible so you're not
working with the loop or at least some
sort of a curl in there but I also feel
that this might be easier if it's
already
in the system but whatever it's not
installed it's definitely a lot of curl
in this though I mean it's definitely
going to curl up on itself so you're
going to kind of open it up get it
started and then you're just going to
sort of work get kind of back and forth
as you're just sub like a tutorial for
something else but yeah see it's not
that hard to get on there you want to
make sure it's straight you don't want
it to be kind of I know twisted so that
one side is like that you want to try
and make that as free as possible and
then you want to sort of stretch out the
length see how we're kind of getting
this right here how it's longer on one
side we don't want that so we want to
try and work that out much as possible
and there's that so you kind of get an
idea of how it's going to look if you
have black tubing it's going to sort of
be visible through there and you can
also rotate this too so that the seam
which is right here obviously you can
see it's going to be darker right there
we can rotate that so it's sort of out
of view so however it's going to be in
your system you can make it look the way
you want but once it's put together you
can twist it so also in here you're
going to find some instructions I've
already started kind of showing you guys
how to do that but the instructions are
right here and then on the bottom you're
going to find the clips that are
basically clamshell clips what that
means is they are two halves that are
going to snap together to hold this into
place also tubes can be kind of hard now
this might be kind of hard to pick up on
camera there is a little bit of a lift
inside of there you can kind of see and
what you're going to do is you're going
to take your sleeping leave that about
two millimeters away from the end of the
tubing right here and then you are going
to make sure that the lip side is facing
down so that gives the sleeving
something to kind of butt up against to
want to stay into position and you're
going to put on one half just like that
this is the part here where you've got
to have some finesse and let's face it I
don't have a lot of that
yes they will click into place because
they have a little barbs they're going
to catch on it so there we go we got
half of that on there right there and we
can rotate around the clip and it's
going to be under quite a bit of
pressure though because these are stick
but we want it to hold tight you don't
want to pull out there's a joke there
there we go let's go check out and
there's one half just like that so
here's what the final product looks like
right here and again they have multiple
colors for this I'm not a huge fan of
the retaining Clips I mean so far they
seem to be remaining in place every now
and I got to kind of lift one but once
it's in place and it's not moving around
there shouldn't be any issues and
obviously this allows you to just add a
bit more splash of color to your build
when using something basic like an AIO
my voice suck at unboxing so much you
know the only thing I can think of that
actually makes these you know design for
system coolers is that the length is
going to be specific to the length of
tubing on those coolers but I want to
try it now with something like this that
has this SVP tubing that is absolutely
awful
I hate SVP tubing brands keep using them
I keep telling them to stop it and keep
doing it I mean essentially what we're
doing here is the exact same thing you
would do with a PSU power cable except
for doing it with tubing right so we're
going to measure our length and it looks
like we are just barely too long which
really kind of sucks so that means we're
going to have to trim it and after we
trim it it means we have to remelt the
ends that way they don't unravel now
we're going to go to go melt these ends
now I pretty much already know that the
caps are not going to fit on these tubes
because they are thicker so we are going
to pretty much do this the ghetto method
of using zip ties but you know what this
is one of those things where I would
rather use a zip tie on this and have it
look a little bit ghetto than to have
the full ghetto of fbp tubing I I mean I
know I probably sound like I'm getting
really caught up on how much I hate FTP
but I can't really put into words just
how much fep tubing bothers me we just
cannot describe it that wasn't that just
a whole lot better to look at the net
FTP tubing I mean yeah the zip ties you
know but this is to bring it back the
ghetto mod days no honestly those I
think that looks a whole lot better so
that is it tell me what you guys think
of cable mods new AIO sleeving kit you
can find links on where to purchase it
in the description box below this video
and I wouldn't be surprised if we see
this available in longer spools of raw
material format because you could use
this on any tubing including your custom
water cooling loops so make your a iOS
look awesome make your custom loops look
awesome without having to use colored
dye and yeah so I think there's a lot of
purposes to this it's basically just
like I said like fatter versions at PSU
cable sleeting so with that said I'm
going to go tell me what you guys think
in the comments below like this video if
you liked it and if you're new around
here wants you consider subscribing and
you can see all kinds of computer stuff
and that's what we do Renny we do
computer stuff yeah all right I've said
enough guys thanks for watching I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
