plenty of my videos now I'm excited
about our air conditioning getting
installed up there like with their but
before we can do that we have to prepare
for them to be able to bring their lifts
in here and install a big AC unit which
probably in hindsight would have made a
lot of sense to just do that before we
ever built anything in here but now
we've got to kind of unbilled some stuff
- then do it
sure you could DIY anything but why do
this when you could have this available
in both 120 and 140 millimeter sizes the
new Prisma fans from fractal design
features six individually addressable
hub mounted RGB LEDs that are compatible
with most motherboard addressable RGB
headers to learn more click the link in
the description below so here's our gay
ghetto a/c setup that we've had for a
while now we've talked about it before
those ducts coming down right there are
coming off of a three-ton unit designed
to cool about 800 square feet or so of
office space maybe even less than that
and so what we do is we crank that AC
and then we put this height let's high
high pressure industrial fan in the door
and we blow all that cold out there out
here making it warm in there tolerable
out here and then that a/c never gets a
chance to cycle and that's bad you don't
want an AC you you don't want to a see
running non-stop you also don't want it
oversized where it's turning off too
quickly because then it never gets in to
again cycling so what we are going to do
today is we have to clear space for them
to bring their lifts and stuff in here
which means it gotta move to the
workbench in those tables and you can
see we kind of already put all of our
lights over here out of the way but let
me tell you the way it's gonna be
because we're filming this right now
ahead of them getting here technically a
few days from now and I'm curious is how
they're gonna do this so if you look in
our office here real quick you can see
and you saw this on our networking video
as well this is a drop ceiling which
means it's being suspended it's
suspended by all those wires and then
this cork material just kind of pushes
up and out of the way I'm sure people by
now are familiar with how drop ceilings
work but if you look up there look at
all those wires the reason why that
matters that's a packaged unit on the
roof
the whole thing is contained as a single
unit so it's called a package unit the
HVAC is the heating ventilation and air
conditioning it's all handled in one
unit that then handles the air from
outside and blows it in down here we are
not doing a package unit here we are
doing a split unit a commercial split we
thought about doing a package unit but
because we're going with a seven and a
half ton unit out here so I don't own
this building I've already said that in
the future I will probably own a
building but that's not gonna happen for
at least five years that's how long our
lease is here so do I really want to
spend the cost of putting an HVAC system
out here and if I'm not gonna say what
it cost but I will say that anyone
working in the commercial hvac knows how
much it's gonna cost us to put a seven
and a half ton unit here in a warehouse
what we're doing is we're doing a split
unit so we only have to drill a small
like six inch hole that goes up into the
roof where the condenser unit is gonna
be on the roof and then the actual air
handler is going to be inside the space
here so it's gonna be suspended on a
cradle that is being that's going to be
coming off of those steel beams up there
and it's gonna be over here to the right
of these tubes and the reason why we're
doing that is we don't interfere with
any of the bracing you see how the
office is being braced by these steel
beams right here because again these are
just tilt up office walls or they're not
load-bearing at all so that's why it's
not like when you build a house and it's
got all this fully frame structure just
those steel beams are holding it up so
what the steel beams there and just
guy-wires over here for the drop ceiling
we decided it's going over here at least
the the estimator and the the project
manager decided that would be the best
place to put it so they're gonna be
removing those guy wires risa porting
off of the cradle er building putting
the AC there and then we're going to be
bringing the main duct over here above
the store where it's then gonna be
coming all the way across the center of
our AC or our warehouse nearly to this
wall where it's then gonna have what 12
registers shooting down at a 45 a 14 by
8 registers shooting down at 45s here
here here here here in here right so
we're gonna have a crap ton of air
mixing and then this supply for the AC
unit is gonna be up there high where
it's pulling hot air out of the ceiling
cooling it off and blowing it out here
so with the seven and a half ton unit
and our in our summer is getting
110 plus which is 44 see and higher we
should be able to keep it under 75
degrees Fahrenheit in here at all times
which is more like what twenty-eight to
see some like that yeah so that's a
pretty significant amount of cooling so
one of the convenient things too is the
fact that our panels are right here
inside the warehouse and because we have
a like I said in our other video we have
a 208 120 volt and a 480 277 volt they
have to pull power up like just like
they did here right so they've got to
run conduit up and over which means
we've got to clear this space out and
I've already talked to them fortunately
I don't have to take down our shelves
and I don't have to take down or other
set because that ain't happenin they
have to work around that fortunately
they say they're just gonna drape
plastic over it they'll be fine they can
to be able work across it just fine
so anyway which means we have to tear
all this down so we're not gonna talk
about this this is going alive in
another video you guys already seen when
we played around the overclocks but yeah
so stay tuned for that I think it's the
next video going live after this one so
one of the things we did in our our
wiring plugs had triggered so many
people and I guess rightfully so was two
things one when we fixed this socket
right here which is a which is a 20 amp
saga you tell it's a 20 amp it's got the
teeth right there on the eyeball right
it's a petite well we use 14 by 2 wire
and every was like you should use 12 by
2 12 by 2 you're gonna you have a fire
hazard and you shouldn't have used romex
which i guess is not actually the name
of that's a brand name of the cable not
the actual cable type so it's this type
n em - Bugis 14-2 with ground 600 volts
we would have probably never exceeded
this but the problem here is that where
we've got it taped down and stuff I
guess something could still accidentally
kind of gouge it because this is
designed I guess to be in a wall I'm not
messed with or handled or any of that
sort of stuff and so a lot of people
were like hey J that's a serious hazard
you really need to replace that with a
proper like 12 by 3 or they some people
even sent me links to proper like
industrial extension cords that we can
build our court court out of like we're
trying to do right here so to make
everyone happy especially all the
electricians out there
we are gonna go ahead and we are gonna
take it off oh no oh they called it a
gorilla tape on Gorilla Tape fire hazard
removed you guys happy you know the real
reason why I did it I have to move the
workbench it's okay now I have extra
romex to use elsewhere where you guys
can't see it and get mad at me all right
so I'm gonna do now that I'm a man I'm a
man so now I'm just gonna kind of tear
it all the loose stuff put skunkworks in
my truck and finally take it back home
get all this out of the way and over
there and yeah we'll come back when
they're actually here and starting the
work
they started the installation and I like
boats so much I made a big old barrel of
a boat in my warehouse that's not an
air-conditioning duct it's a turret so
slight change of plans you realize that
these are actually low these walls over
here this half of the office are
actually constructed in a manner that
could be load-bearing and so what's
happened here is a platform has been
built on top of the women's bathroom
where how many women here so it's okay
if it crashes through there's no women
here and then there's kind of support on
top of it because this is the air
handler for our seven and a half ton air
conditioning unit so this guy is
actually pretty heavy I don't know how
they're planning on getting it up there
but that's their problem that's what I'm
paying them right so it's a split unit
as you can see the other half is over
there that's the seventh half ton
condenser right there so that's gonna be
removing all the heat and stuff and then
this is gonna be handling all the cold
air and blowing it out into our
warehouse so it's gonna go up here
they'll be manufacturing a 90 degree
duct that connects to our main 24-inch
duct right here and then it steps down
to believe 20 inch right here where we
then are gonna have more events right
there blowing down to us and then it
steps down to 18 inch down here that is
then gonna be having more vents blowing
down at us that's how it works okay air
conditioner blows down on us cool us a
little fun fact here that's an 18 inch
duct on the end it's a spiral duct
basically its rifling for the air it
makes it spin have more velocity a
little less turbulence that right there
is also the inner diameter of the Barrow
found on the Amato from World War two
you guys can also check out the Yamato
by using my world of warships code down
below no it's not actually not but I
could have I could have made it one
sorry our panels off right here you can
see they're actually grabbing power from
here conduits run right there you can
see where it's gonna come into the panel
so they're actually grabbing 3-phase
from over here on this panel we've got
the conduit up and over and that's going
all the way across so I can't wait for
this to be done now one of the things we
need to do and now I'm totally nerding
out over each back and stuff one of the
things we need to do is lower the heat
load so heat load is the calculation
that you use to determine how much
cooling you need into space it's not
just throw the big o unit at it throwing
a big o unit at the problem only cost
you more money and then it cost you way
more electricity and stuff when you
could sometimes shrink the demand rather
than growing to meet the demand so in
the afternoon the Sun shines directly on
that door as you can see and with it
being metal and the fact that we live in
the desert you can imagine that that
gets to be pretty darn hot so what we
had constructed here to just try and
control some of the heat back when we
first got in this place this would be
bearable is this wall of insulation this
insulation right here isn't even
honestly like what we bought it for it
was for more of those panels which I'm
actually taking those panels off the
wall and redoing it actually we're gonna
be using and so quilt which is a type of
stuff you using a soundstage it's a real
thick heavy insulating blanket that's
designed to absorb and deaden sound and
reverb it's what you would use and it's
used in Hollywood and so we're putting
that on the walls in here but this right
here is just a foam with an R factor and
it's got a radiant barrier on it and
it's insulating foam so I just went wool
man six of these is about the size of
the door so why not just go and tape
them together I stick in front of the
door and that worked really well but
since we have another set that's gonna
be built over here fairly close to this
door at least three or four feet off of
it we're not going to get anything big
through this door anymore so what's it
matter it's not gonna be any more open
than this people door is gonna be in
fact we'll have more room on the people
door because it swings all the way out
of the way so I'm gonna also be building
a frame for the front of this that's not
only using insulation we're probably not
gonna even use the foam to be honest
because the foam offers us insulation
offices absolutely zero sound barrier
I'm gonna do my research to find out
what the best material to use
is to deaden the sound because when we
get deliveries of stuff in this alleyway
like the neighbors and stuff is like a
food cold food storage bla bla bla back
there and so everyday at like 9:30 to
10:00 they get a delivery and it's a big
rig that comes down here and to let
everyone know they're here they could
just go now Phil had a very good point
he said Jay aren't you leaving for
vacation and day after tomorrow you know
I was like yep he's like isn't this
gonna be done after you're back or after
you're gone and I was like yep and he's
like so how you plan on filming the end
of this
a bunch of people suggested that we make
a roof for this to help with the sound
the problem is I'm not I'm not talking
like this when I do my videos I'm
talking like that and all those sound
does go out and nearly 360 degrees we've
already talked about building something
up here to help with the sound but I
want to see how the insole quilt does
first but anyway yeah I'm not gonna be
able to show you guys in this video what
the AC is like when it's done
because as Phil so eloquently pointed it
out I'm gonna be gone before it's done
Phil will be enjoying my AC before me
and I'm the one that paid for the damn
thing all right well by the time you
guys see this I'm on a boat out in the
Caribbean just like a pirate
