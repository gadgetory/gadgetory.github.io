insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and why
sennheiser the pursuit of perfect sound
and of course by generous viewers like
you so strapped in with j's two cents as
he takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys you're watching Jays two
cents we're continuing our exclusive
insider coverage here at CES 2014 I am
with Jonathan here at the cooler master
/ CM storm booth and we've got some
really cool products here we're gonna
take a look at he's a product manager
here and he's gonna tell us what's new
this year for cooler master when it
comes to some cases and some things so
Jonathan go ahead and tell me what we're
looking at okay thank you well this is
something new for this year we're
actually offering a lot of accessories
for the half stacker system you've seen
the half stacker last year but actually
this year we're going to be offering a
few accessories to actually make your
life a little bit easier make you able
to do a lot of new things I see a 915
side window that makes me very happy yes
we'll have a full windowed side with
panel available and we also have a
stacker accessory kit including a
storage kit the storage kit allows you
to fully populate all your hard drives
in your 915 and if you want to build
expansions you can have as many hard
drives you want awesome so it kind of
fits the gap between if you bought a 915
f i believe it is that's a standalone if
you want to add more hard drive cages in
there you can do that so is it's just
directly because of customer feedback
that you're putting together this kit
and in fact yes we've been active on the
forums we've been active watching your
videos and looking at your comments
people want these kind of things they
want to really expand their imagination
yeah it's really important that you know
manufacturers listed in to the customer
feedback and that was definitely a big
one was you know hard drive cages and
accessories when it comes to I front
input when it comes to the one that
comes with the 935 that doesn't have the
buttons on there going to a standalone
system okay so what else are we looking
at over here on this side this is
something brand-new and you've never
seen it before this is our half XE
project what we've done is we take in a
full tower and we shrunk it as small as
possible
what this has is that has a wraparound
fully acrylic side window and this is
one of the features that we'd like to
keep on the inside you can see the full
tower spec include the full ATX
motherboard tray and that includes eight
expansion slots for the people who like
mine and video card yeah guys not just
HDX is full ATX so you can go I mean
look what kind of graphics card looks
like we have plenty of length in there
without it coming anywhere near the
front of the case and if you take a
closer look you can actually see in the
front behind this beautiful 3d mesh that
we're have right here we have three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
support yeah so front mount radiator
support so you can bring a nice fresh
air for your water cooling okay so
what's on the back side of it here well
on the back side you can see a little
unique feature that we can actually
rotate this chassis so if you like to
have the traditional test bench style
you can take off the top window and put
all your graphics card and your
motherboard from the top just like the
half XP but if you like to save a little
space you can use it in the tower mode
just like it is right now right so no on
the top what kind of support do we have
up here for radiators and fans Oh glad
you asked we actually have support for
our new Neptune to 80s as well as the
standard to 80 millimeter to 40
millimeter radiators awesome okay so
when you're looking over here this tiny
little guy so many people on my channel
are really into small form factor I mean
it seems like over the years we got
bigger and bigger and bigger and now
we're going back to the ITX and small
form factor and people are really
interested on what the options are now
to keep it small but also powerful so
what are we looking at well we're
actually having a very successful series
with elite 130 and 120 and people have
always asked for something smaller we
brought the elite 110 and compared to
the 26 to 29 leaders of the elite 120
120 130 you're looking at 15 litre
design and that's supporting the
standard power supply a standard video
card and water cooling that's important
a lot of ITX cases make you compromise
on either video card length or on your
power supply length and the two in a
combination you know obviously we can't
put necessarily a full-length graphics
card in here I mean but you can put ITX
tile cards in there but the full-size
power supply i think is what's really
important because there's such limited
market for short power supplies so ok so
for cooling here
what do we have what's in here right now
oh well what you have a site in 120v
which is a typical 120-millimeter style
all-in-one water cooling radiator you
have a aftermarket M ITX motherboard
with large heatsink ram and you have a
full height graphics card which supports
8.25 inches so you're looking at a very
full amount I mean your top eight
graphics cards available on the steam
survey so right now there's a lot of
companies that have started making short
PCBs for this very reason there's no
side panel here is this vented or a
solid panel massage actually all vented
with filters so you'll be able to have a
filtered mesh the side panel is one
assembly it comes off just like the
elite 130 and 120 awesome what guys this
has been coolermaster showing some brand
new stuff here for CES 2014 make sure
you follow us on Twitter same thing with

this exclusive coverage come in here

you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
