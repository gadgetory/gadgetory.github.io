and I have teamed up with ek water
blocks to bring you this video about
their new custom loop configurator
designed to take all of the guesswork
out of building your first custom loop
so if you want to follow along head on
over to ek W be calm and click on the
configurator button and let's go ahead
and get started now the cool thing about
this is ek has spent a lot of time
building a database of chass√© ease so
that you can know that whether or not
you have full compatibility based on
your case that's the hardest part for
most people who have not spent a lot of
time building custom loops is making
sure they're going to fit in their case
so you start off here by putting in your
chassis I'm going to say I've got to
define let's say I've got to find s
let's do that as you can see by just
typing and defined s because it's a
wild-card search it comes up with any
result that matches the fine
or s so here's our define s right there
motherboard let's say I have got a
gigabyte z170 what comes up with that so
we've got all our model numbers here are
different revisions so that's pretty
important you can see anything that
matched gigabyte in z170 showed up so
let's say I've got a gigabyte z170
gaming k3 let's go with that one and a
graphics card you need to be diligent
with the part that you put in to make
sure the part numbers match because for
instance some folks would say oh I've
got an Nvidia 1080 but maybe they really
have an asus strix 1080 so if I put in
Nvidia 1080 it only comes up with the
actual Nvidia brand of 1080 which would
be the founders Edition card which is
not the same as say Strix card or an
extreme card from gigabyte or further
win from EVGA they are different PCBs
and your block is not going to fit so
you have to do some legwork here to make
sure you put in the right card so if you
have a Strix card type Strix 1080 and
then you will see the results for the
various tricks cards and then you can
match the model number which they put on
every single block to make sure you have
compatibility it's up to you to make
sure these numbers match please double
check so you don't end up with a mistake
now the number of RAM sticks that's
because they do offer RAM cooling as
well but you don't have to cool the RAM
because the next page here is where you
tell it what you want to cool so CPU is
selected by default but you could turn
that off and say I only want to build a
GPU loop but we're going to do a single
loop here with CPU and GPU included now
when you move on to the next
here it wants to know what your desired
use for this system is going to be if
you want silent operation do you want
silent and overclocking or do you just
want maximum overclocking with the
maximum heat dissipation potential well
I'm going to say I want silent and
overclocking that way it can make a
recommendation based on that and the
information we've already given it tells
it we've got 275 watts of heat that we
have to dissipate from the system
because of this number it's selected the
X III 60 triple radiator to go on to the
front of our case you can see it gives a
little representation here of our case
it's saying that we're going to
front-mounted rad obviously it's going
to fill out the whole front of the case
that's just a little that's just a
little diagram don't think the radiator
is going to be that small in your case
but it also anticipates a twenty seven
Celsius water temp for our loop now if
you want to know a little more you can
click the expert mode you can see the
other radiators that will fit in your
system now they've selected the cool
stream XE which is a sicker radiator it
gives us 512 watts worth of heat that we
can dissipate with that radiator so it
happens if we select one that's too
small ah look at that we've selected a
120 which only has 149 watts of
dissipation that's telling us here we've
we've turned orange because we're not
exactly we're not exactly doing
ourselves any favors here by having a
radiator that can't handle as much heat
as we're going to be sending into it as
you can see our expected liquid
temperature is going to increase quite a
bit up to 38 C so it says right here
we've selected a radiator that will
sufficiently cool our hardware but the
temperatures will be higher what I think
it's funny a little side note what's
funny though is if you deselect a
radiator it says our temperature is
going to be infinity
well that's hot hotter than the
temperature of the Sun let's because we
have 0 watts of cooling power which
means we are going to basically blow up
our stuff we don't want that so anyway
moving on I'm going to go ahead and go
with their selection move on to the next
step and just kind of carry all that
over now we get to tell it what type of
tubing we want to use so if we select
soft tubing it's going to also give us
some options regarding size and fittings
and it's going to make sure that they
are compatible and the same thing for
the rigid tubing the only difference
with rigid is it's also going to add to
the cart a kit for both a silicone
insert so that you can bend the tubing
as well as they saw so you can cut the
tubing down to link it's not going to
include a heat gun though so you're
going to have to have one of those or go
pick one up at Home Depot or whatever
your local hardware store is we're going
to do soft tooling because I think that
is the friendliest way to start getting
into custom loops you spend a lot less
time building it and actually enjoy it
much sooner now we've got radio buttons
here and we've got options over here
that we can select they both do the same
thing if you select the radio buttons
here it kind of scrolls through the
different tubing sizes and it makes sure
that it applies fittings that are going
to fit it as well you can also click
here and see a visual representation of
what those tubing sizes actually are and
you can make a selection there now you
can also change the color of the tubing
because they do have colored tubing even
for soft tubing so you can select that
as well and you go with a clear I like
to see the color of the two of the
coolant inside
speaking of come on you can even choose
coolant that you can add to this kit if
you want to use theirs or you can remove
it in cart later if you don't want it
I'm going to go with UV blue I think it
looks really nice fish young on the
screen right here I like bright vibrant
colors now let's go with green divide it
green and skunkworks
and we could change the color of our
fittings what if I go with let's say
nickel because that's what I've got in
my system right now and we can change
the pump top material as well let's say
so if you got black you can't see there
it's a solid black kit red plexi dean
plexi blue so the plexi means it's kind
of translucent you can see through it
I'm going to go with clear because I
want to see the fluid in there and I'll
leave it with a nickel plating on the
bottom but you can go with bare copper
or even a gold plating to they have a
gold one I don't know what that's going
to do to the price but I'm gonna leave
it at nickel it was just pretty much how
I've got skunkworks set up right here
exactly like that now the cool thing is
it's also going to show us what the
coolant would look like flowing through
the block if we have a plexi clear block
so you get an idea of what it's going to
look like if you go to the black acetal
you can't see through it so there's
representation of that and we could also
go to the nickel backplate actually
clear this is this is literally exactly
how skunkworks is set up right now with
these same blocks this coolant and the
back plates and everything else so there
you go now the next step here is we have
to tell it what type of pump and
reservoir do we want to use we want to
use a combo unit which is I I highly
recommend the combo units they're very
easy to use especially for first-timers
or you can separate it as you can see
right here you means you have fittings
and two
that go between the reservoir and the
pump I'm going to go with a pump combo
because I again I think they're very
friendly this is the one they recommend
right here it's the extra as 100 it's
got a PWM pump looks like a DSC pump
it's got a very small reservoir on that
I don't like that I don't like the small
reservoir because I think big reservoirs
make up for big cases yeah we'll go with
that
anyway expert mode these are the other
options you could go with I'm going to
go ahead and say I want to go with let
me go with this guy right here I'm gonna
go with the big d5 with a bigger
reservoir just looks better looks more
manly
as we're going to go over there so we're
adding that or it only gave us options
for pumps that it's going to be able to
fit in that case because they've already
done all the legwork and determined that
that's something fits so here is all the
stuff that we basically put together
right here you can see we've got a seven
hundred and thirty four milliliter
capacity or just under 3/4 of a leader
when it comes to how much fluid it can
be held in the system so it's only going
to recommend that we have one bottle of
coolant because it's less than the 1
liter that comes in the bottle we've got
eight fittings required because it's two
fittings per component 275 watts worth
of heat we have to dissipate n 277 liter
per hour flow rate so everything is good
everything we got plenty of cooling
capacity everything's going to fit in
our case everything's going to fit
together tubing and fittings are going
to fit next step is to see what all the
parts they recommend are and it's going
to basically take all those and create a
list it's got fans here they use their
guard our fans we've got our block our
pump our radiator
we've even got check this out we need to
included a jumper and a three pin
splitter a three header splitter so that
you can have one PWM header supplying
power to all three fans and the jumper
is important it's only two dollars and
fifty cents don't take it out of your
cart this allows you to bleed your
system without having to turn on the
motherboard it's a big deal
leave that in there so now all you guys
do now is well look at the price and cry
a little bit because custom loops are
not cheap but boy are they worth it and
addicting once you get into it you can
add all this to your cart so here's
everything in our cart right here
they've added fans like I showed you
because obviously you need to answer
your radiator but let's say you already
have fans and you don't want to use the
bar DARS way to just click the little X
right there and you can remove it from
your cart but the configurator is pretty
much coming from the standpoint of you
have nothing for your loop in your
need everything which is good because
you want to make sure that you have
everything you need if you don't have
fans and you're going to have a bad day
trying to cool your stuff unfortunately
we can see the back plate I chose is
currently out of stock so we could have
we could switch that for the black one
and see if it's in stock but let's say
we don't want the back plate at all
maybe we want to save the 52 bucks and
we don't want to put a back plate on the
card you can simply click the X we're
going to save a little bit of money
there as well and since we took the fans
in the back laid out you can see our kit
came out way down to five hundred and
ninety dollars still a little bit of a
crunch to the wallet but cheaper than it
was so there you go guys that's the
custom loop configurator go ahead and
head on over to ekw be calm play around
with it put in your chassis see what you
come up with and if you built your own
custom loop once you go in head on over
to twitter i'm at JS two cents and tweet
me pictures of your custom loops i
really love to check out the work that
you guys are doing and believe it or not
sometimes your builds turn out to be
inspiration for me on various things
that i do moving forward on the channel
so you guys have some really good ideas
and some custom stuff i would have never
even thought of which is what makes this
community so damn awesome there's so
many people doing so many different
things there's literally an infinite
amount of ways that you can do this
thanks for watching today's video again
thanks for ek water blocks respond sory
in today's video and making life easy
for those people wanting to get in to
water cooling thanks for watching and as
always I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
