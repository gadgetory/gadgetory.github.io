gonna do something I haven't really done
before and I'm gonna do sort of a
year-end recap when it comes to the tech
anyways when it comes to the PC genre
the PC space because I've done these end
of your kind of recaps with my channel
but this has been a very interesting
year 2018 is one of those years that
probably go down in the record books as
one of the worst for PC gamers and let
me explain why in this video why I say
it's the worst although we saw some
great innovative tech come out there's
some reasons why I think this year is
gonna go down in history is one of the
worst so hear me out on this I got new
merch it's available now Cod me calm /jc
sense we got zip up hoodies we got
tri-blend we got a new logo I digress
since 2012 it's at the wrist logo you
guys been asking for that anyway well
guys little bit uh we all kinda stuff
zip up hoodies beanies polos don't take
my word for it cuz obviously I can't do
this edie so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks alright so 2018 I'm
probably gonna talk about this a little
bit out of order and I'm probably gonna
be a bit more scatterbrained it's just a
talking head video so do me a favor feel
free to minimize this you aren't being
inconvenienced by this on your screen I
wouldn't want to cause your pixels to do
any extra work to render this face
okay so 2018 man where to start alright
let's go and start with GPUs because if
we're talking about PC enthusiasts
graphics card they get all the glory
right everyone cares about the graphics
cards they brag about their graphics
cards and this and that well this has
been the most expensive year for
graphics cards ever there's quite a few
reasons for that one lack of competition
that's no surprise we've all talked
about it before we talked about the
dangers of lack of competition years ago
a couple years ago we were making videos
on this all of us Paul Kyle Linus myself
Hardware connects all of us talked about
the dangers of having no competition why
although we may have preferences and my
personal preference obviously is Nvidia
I love the performance from Nvidia many
of you have a preference of AMD which is
perfectly fine but the problem is when
you have no competition in that space it
affects everybody now the problem is we
started off the year with the incredibly
spiking price of crypto currencies we
had Bitcoin within the last year
reaching what $20,000 per coin and
people looked at as a quick easy way to
get rid
they ran out and they bought up the GPUs
and stuff not necessary because of
Bitcoin because Bitcoin had moved over
to ASIC mining where that really you
know surpassed what GPUs could do but
because of aetherium aetherium was
looked at as the next coin that was
going to break the market in terms of
changing things with digital currencies
and stuff so and it did a fantastic job
at leveraging the gddr5 found in
graphics cards because it was a very
memory intensive type of mining so GPUs
of all shapes and sizes were getting
sold out across the board when Bitcoin
was using GPUs the rx4 80 was the card
that became extremely difficult to find
because that was the sweet spot per like
hash rate versus price and it was a
complete moneymaker but etherium didn't
care what kind of card you had you just
had to have the G DDR and as long as you
had that you could create these crazy
render farms and his mining farms and
make stupid amounts of money and
everyone was buying into that because
aetherium was climbing at a very sharp
rate making it look like the next
Bitcoin so we saw one hundred two
hundred three hundred percent price
increases when it came to GPUs and the
problem is although the manufacturers
claimed they weren't selling direct we
had plenty of people involved in the
industry telling us that that was a
bold-faced lie that they were indeed
selling direct to the render farms
because they could increase the price
versus what they were selling them to
their merch or their merchants fixed
pricing because he I understand when
they sell these GPUs and stuff they have
a price a wholesale price but they could
up that wholesale price sell direct and
make a ton of money which meant the
supply chain completely dried up when
you finally were seeing graphics cards
making their way to new wake Amazon at
the time NC NCIX is that it and NCIX
yeah I want someone NC is like the TV
show yeah I guess that's besides the
point when they finally made it to
market they were so jacked up in price
the man you were paying over a thousand
dollars for a GTX 1080 you were paying
fifteen hundred plus dollars for a 1080
Ti the problem is people were buying
them by the hundreds and you would see
these tweets when people driving around
all the micro centers and going in there
one after another with various people
like entire clans of people whining
graphics cards
at a time and then they would brag about
their photos of 200 cards sitting in
their living room haha
look what we got that was a problem
because the card was no longer available
for retail availability a supply and
demand made the prices go up
ridiculously I'm sure someone here
watching knows and was probably trying
to buy a card during that era which made
it seem like man I finally saved six
months or a year to build my system and
I've got everything I need except a
graphics card even the used card market
was extremely inflated but the problem
with that is we also didn't have
competition in the space so once it
started to normalize and come back down
we then had new graphics card launches
coming up unfortunately nothing from AMD
this year well we did have the rx 590
which is just a slight increase in
improvement and a bit of an architecture
change when it came to the RX 580 but a
single 590 is not going to change the
market last year showed us Vega which
unfortunately there were no updates to
Vega this year and that mostly being
because the project manager for that
Rajat Kotori moved to Intel because
Intel wants to get into the space and
compete against Nvidia but we're far off
from that where I can see anything from
that in terms of retail availability to
probably 2020 at the soonest and that's
if it doesn't get pushed back so you
have Nvidia left to just kind of control
the market all they wanted which is why
we've now seen the most expensive GPUs
come from Nvidia yet that being
obviously the RT X line so this is the
2080 ti the card that when it launched
everyone was like oh my god $1200 what
is happening here with an MSRP of $1000
that's a bargain-basement right well of
course the AI bees or the board partners
didn't want to be you know basically
outshined by Nvidia so they come out
with their custom boards which cost them
more to make which means they cost more
than $1200 in most cases so now you had
the TI n of graphics cards which used to
be around the six hundred and fifty
dollar range now costing double that
well double that once again with now the
Titan launch that although they say it's
not a gaming card has the exact same
technologies that are in here which is a
gaming card with just a little bit more
memory at the price of $2,500 we haven't
seen a mid to mid to your card yet these
cards were teased back in September
officially came out in October here we
are now rolling into January and we
still haven't
a 60 series card or a 50 series which
usually debuted within a month or two
after the main launches why they haven't
done that no idea
probably competition and stuff but you
could probably expect those cards to
range somewhere in the three or four
hundred dollar range where they normally
would reside in the 200 to 250 dollar
range so as you can see we have a bit of
a conundrum here with GPUs and pricing
where it sucks this year because it's
just too damn expensive
now moving on to CPUs it's been an
interesting year because although the
GPU markets been a big stagnated and
then Nvidia waited like almost 20 months
to release this card you know the the
Turing GPU the CPU stuffs been moving
very quickly the problem is it's still
extremely divided in terms of
performance and cost it's all over the
place because we are finally seeing
Intel habits caged rat a little bit I'm
showing an i3 here when it never opened
oh I guess I did open it whatever I
digress
AMD launched its Xen architecture 2016
and we saw some amazing IPC improvements
where it caught up to Intel for the most
part but it still was lacking behind in
single core performance or just overall
because of its lackluster speeds and I
say lackluster I mean by that Intel has
really worked hard on getting the ins
the IPC's of course where they are but
also getting the clock speed up where
now we have CPUs launching here in 2018
with boost clocks at 5 gigahertz
something just a couple of years ago we
thought the silicon wasn't even gonna be
capable of it now we've got mainstream
CPUs with more cores and sitting at 5
gigahertz which is amazing the problem
is AMD is having a hard time scraping
past 4 gigahertz at least with Zen and
Zen Plus Zen plus was able to get us
about 4.2 4.3 on a couple cores but Zen
2 which again isn't coming out until
2019 is looking at giving us that 5
gigahertz number which means more
competition in this space now AM D Rison
probably should be on the list of things
that were great for 2018 because more
gamers could get CPUs get great IPC's
get multi-core performance of course
they had their SMT or simultaneous
multi-threading the same thing as hyper
threading and we saw them catch up
great when it comes to Intel the problem
is Intel came out with the exact same
type of philosophy and line up eight
cores sixteen threads but as they
increased the thread count and as they
increase the clock speeds instead of
competing with AMD they then just
continued to raise the price where the
ninety nine hundred K which is their
current mainstream flagship CPU is
costing about five hundred and fifty
dollars if you look at AMD right now you
could actually get a thread Ripper CPU
for that price now yes there's a lot of
debate on which is better for which
application thread Ripper versus
mainstream Intel versus X 299 the great
thing is we have competition there and
we have choice unfortunately for new
builders that choice is very confusing
where it used to be very cut and dry you
want a good bargain CPU get value
performance per dollar you want with AMD
if you wanted just the most performance
you could possibly get at any price then
you went with Intel but that doesn't
hold true as well today as it used to so
if you can't tell there's a common
thread here that 2018 sort of sucked
because of pricing speaking of pricing I
didn't even talk about memory yet that's
been going on for a couple of years now
with the suspected price fixing coming
from the couple or what two or three
manufacturers in the entire world that
make Ram and apparently there was some
coercion coercion collusion they were
working together at price fixing causing
the price to go up fortunately that's
been investigated it's been proven known
I guess there's like litigation
happening and apparently lawsuits now
happening out in China where the price
fixing has been uncovered and that's why
we're seeing prices of ram start to come
down so we're overpriced GPUs we have
rising prices of Intel CPUs and
obviously the super inflated pricing of
both used and new GPUs because as people
started going why don't want our TX
cards are too expensive I'm just gonna
buy used card the used market went hey
people want Pascal and pascal's going
away so we're gonna raise the use price
of Pascal it's supply and demand it's
just markets it's a it's kind of a
shitty situation but 2019 should
hopefully be a whole lot better because
we've got hopefully Navi coming out
which we've been waiting for from AMD
which is supposed to compete directly
with what we're seeing here with RT X
it's supposed the rumors have it that
there's going to be a new GPU from AMD
coming out early in the year probably q1
q2 that's supposed to give you
RTX 2070 performance which don't forget
is a $500 graphics card from Nvidia at
$250 so if you can actually get our TX
2070 performance at $250 RTX aside you
can't turn on our TX for the 2070 in my
opinion it's no good you can't even do
it with the 2080 Ti and 1080p while I
guess you can now with the updates but
it hasn't been optimized enough the 2070
is not going to give you a good gaming
experience with RT X so if you can get
that level though of rasterization
performance or just standard dx11
performance that 250 bucks that's what
we need we have no major mid-range or
low range from Nvidia that's where AMD
has always resided and I would love for
them to come out with a card and a
product stack that can compete with
Nvidia across the board because then
prices will have to come down and if
they don't then NVIDIA is the one that
will kind of suffer because NVIDIA spent
1 billion dollars to belt developing
this technology over the last 10 years
and they're trying to get that money
back as quick as possible
that's why pricing is so high but we're
also gonna see rise in to rise in to the
next generation Rises and not just then
Plus architecture which is supposed to
as I said bring us near that 5 gigahertz
number which is gonna put the IPC on par
with Intel as well as the clock speed
which means Intel will either have to
adjust or lose market share that's how
you bring pricing down market share has
to shift but AMD stock prices over the
last year have skyrocketed versus where
they were even two years ago in fact
Jerry and I on Tech Talk made a joke a
couple years back about you should buy a
nice table because it was $1.00 but now
it's way more than that and if we had
actually taken our own advice back in
like 2016 we probably be rich today
because it's gone up like 15 or 20 times
that since then obviously Lisa sue who
was the interim CEO has done a fantastic
job
I think she's permanent CEO now she has
righted that ship and she has up righted
it and clearly they are on a collision
course with am hope they're not in a
collision course with AMD they're on a
collision course with Intel and NVIDIA
which is exactly what we need so I'm
hoping that Zen to really changes things
in 2019 and that navi and whatever their
next-generation GPU is is going to give
us the performance that we're hoping for
at the price point that we need it and
I'm also hoping Intel does something
with the GPUs because it will only force
AMD to get better and in mid
needs to start to feel a little bit of
the pinch in their own wallet so guys
that's just my list as to why 2018 sorta
sucked when it comes to PC early in 2019
we're gonna see a lot of this new stuff
teased and shown off at CES especially
from AMD we will be checking it out
we'll be going to the AMD booth and very
excited about that and seeing what
they've got to show but if you guys
think there's something that should be
added to this list as to why 2018 such
won't you guys do me a favor and leave a
comment down below I think the best one
will deserve a pin so guys thanks for
watching and hopefully you didn't leave
my face on your screen the whole time I
hope you just minimized it and went on
about your business because this is not
worth looking at for 15 minutes or
however long we talked alright guys
thanks for watching and as always we'll
see you in the next one it's overpriced
but it's already not gonna lie in my
mouth typically in the past so if you
can't tell though wow I coughed up a
hairball</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
