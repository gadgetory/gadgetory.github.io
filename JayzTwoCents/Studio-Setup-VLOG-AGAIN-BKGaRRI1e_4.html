following the links down below Oh work
work work what's up guys JC cent here
and I'm gonna phone one in with the
vlogs I got a lot to get done today got
a visitor coming over today as well and
I wouldn't say the place is a mess that
I still have lots of things to do got
some lamps put together cabinets put
together for my desk and I don't have a
lot of time to do it yeah I'm also going
to be kind of asking for some of your
help because I'm I'm bad at this I'm
really bad this let me let me tell you
what I'm dead at actually before I tell
you what I'm bad at guys it's not a
marijuana plant back there it's just a
fake bamboo tree thing that like all the
tech youtubers have because it's from
Ikea that's a problem with IKEA is
everyone Shops at IKEA so you've all got
the same crap
just like the lamps of suddenly putting
together you guys have seen these on
other people's channels but a while it
does kind of look like a marijuana plant
though doesn't it I'm actually at it's
conversation with my wife the other day
because I'm just racking my brain in
this studio for let me tell you why I'm
good at analytical thinking I'm good at
problem-solving I'm good at like science
stuff math stuff computer stuff car
stuff I am terrible at decorating I just
I don't have the mindset to decorate so
although I think we've we've come a long
way this looks pretty good there's still
a lot of emptiness so that that wall is
completely empty the walls of here
completely empty and obviously that's
causing the echo that you're hearing in
here now I know about acoustic treatment
and stuff no the room this size a roof
that high and the corrugated roof uh you
know the metal paneling is creating a
reverb nightmare in here now no I cannot
do anything about the roof I can't touch
or change the roof it's part of the
lease agreement and I cannot go mounting
a much bunch of crazy on the wall
now Jonathan Morrison from TLD today he
had a suggestion of hanging acoustic
panels above me for like my set area so
that right above me are you know those
cloud foam like home cloud panels
ceiling clouds that's cool and all I
might do that but then it blocks
backlighting that I have up there see
there's track lading that was
pre-existing I'm not going to always be
in the same same place so I'm going to
be putting probably some acoustic panels
up on the flat walls here because that
needs to help bounce or that needs a
stop so in the reflection but the
problem with that is if I don't get the
right kind of foam it's going to block
out all the mids and highs the bass will
still make it through and then it will
sound worse than before I put anything
up so I'm researching that but what I
need your guys's help with though is I
need some ideas I need some ideas for
this place it's going to take time and I
expect this place to take a few months
to get fully kind of ready to go but I
need I need your ideas on making this
place just badass I thought about having
like a display with like my custom
systems up on the wall but I don't have
a lot of room for that either though you
can see I've got my slider there my
lights and things yeah I don't have a
whole lot of room one thing I thought
about doing was actually moving that
table the table and chairs upstairs so I
can have more room right there for
another set of some sort and then
putting making like a fake wall to block
out the kitchen
so the kitchen is kind of separate and
then I have like a whole nother set over
there so time I just need some time to
get all this together anyway we've got
things to do like I said on Instagram
you can't be a tech reviewer without
having some sort of a fake plant on your
desk or in my case four of them I also
pick this up this is the three volt
starter kit for the Phillips you 819
sighs it's RGB fun fact those two lights
back there in the corner those are also
Filip used but I'm stupid and I got the
ones that are just white and not RGB and
not even the adjustable white it's just
that harsh white which is why it looks
so yellow on camera yeah because it's a
2700 k lamp it's very warm and so yeah
it looks very yellow on camera not
exactly what I wanted so I had to switch
that out I did add another rug though
the more carpet I can get on the floor
the more it will help with some of the
reverb in this room having the big
concrete floors and this giant wall this
wall is massive and also that giant wall
is not helping with the reverb
unfortunately though the hues are not
this is a 199 but yes I paid for no it's
not sponsored plus the price like that
70 bucks I paid for those two so yeah
anyway here they are here they are again
a nineteen replacements although they're
not exactly in a nineteen shape they
almost look like a almost like between a
par 28 of power 30 almost like a car
lamp anyway yeah we're going to play
around please we got to have our RGB RGB
everything all right there we go so
they're in there I think that color
temperature looks pretty good I love the
hue because you can change the color as
you consider different scenes who had
Spring Blossom about sunset it goes was
very Sun setting this is day two
yesterday's vlog ended rather abruptly I
was actually having lunch with mr.
fractal Josh who was in town this week
and I got a call from my wife that she
opted the tire well something about she
ran over something tire wit flat and had
to go do the husband thing which she was
like help me help me how I got the wrong
remote but I did get the hew installed
yesterday one of the things that sucks
though about the Philips hue software is
you can't you can control colors of each
individual lights and you can set up
schedules and things like that but you
can't make them animate in any way which
is it just makes you feel like one of
the whole purposes of the hue is to have
that neat kind of animation and stuff
but there are lots of third-party apps
out there that you can use and one of
them that I'm using here is called Thor
Thor lights one called Thor light that
one's called MB you can kind of wait
here until me seem right there anyway
slowly around this or a sec so I've got
one right there one right there and one
right there and it's kind of neat you've
got a lot of different things that you
can do with it in fact I'll point right
here so you can see the lights but there
as we do different things now these are
a loft you have to like buy these scenes
which kind of stinks I'm not going to
pay a lot of money for these let's say
say you want to have a partay you do
color strobes it's kind of neat so you
got this one over here scope in to see
you have white strobe
apologize if any of you are epileptic
you might not want look at screen yeah
that's very part it's got a lot of party
feel right they're probably playing with
those as we move forward at the studio
kind of getting more of those set up I
think it'd be neat to have some
spotlights with those for like b-roll
and stuff like that speaking of life I
also got these guys right here you've
probably seen these in every youtuber
that ever lives near an Ikea they to use
these like discuss it some kind let's
like a studio light was tall and big and
yagna these IKEA they're like 60 bucks
to each you're 59 bucks something like
that I got two of those how to decide
where I'm going to put him yet beyond
diggin upstairs 20 I'm blogging today
too because I actually have a crunch for
time because it's afternoon I have some
guests coming over to do some filming in
my studio so much to get done stop
vlogging to do some work here I am
talking about how short I am on time and
I forgot to bring my frickin tools to
put together the little pieces of
furniture I'm trying to put together
all right now that that's out of the way
I'm telling you right now I am such a
sucker for the Phillips hue oh yes I've
always wanted them could never really
afford them and didn't really have any
place to really put them but now that
I've got the studio I've been like
Phillips you all the things and the cool
thing of Adam is even if you don't want
like the RGB spectrum thing going the
point is I have full control over the
color I mean that's the point that's the
point in all of this okay there's the
lights and I think I like that one of
the things that really sets this little
conference table is there's no light
directly above it like you'd think the
fan would be a have a light but nope no
light right above it there is this old
Edison bulb right here like a hipster
bulb but yeah that doesn't really do
anything something else I also added was
this strip right here behind the TV that
is also a huge strip so there's that
yeah I kind of like this right here I
think this makes a good little set sort
of a set as well
I guess by new post tripods for the
slider and kind of got in there like
that or something I don't know something
like that maybe what play around it and
see this place is definitely coming
together nicely something I need to do
here is underneath the stairs I want to
get some shelves or cabinets or
something put in so I can have my AV
closet this is just some of the stuff I
have so much gear tonight money mostly
it's still at home I might get a
wardrobe kind of like Jonathan Morrison
did where I can put everything in the
wardrobe so I can get it out of the way
when I don't want it here like so I've
kind of cleared up some space here I
don't think I want to use my lights but
like I said a special guest coming in
this evening to record here and this
space is already what balance on this
camera really doesn't know what to do
with all these colors everywhere it's
just like I don't know what to do with
the light I also got these down LEDs
from Ikea the LED Burgh you never say
these names anyway they this is the
evolution of the GPU shelf you guys
remember in my old videos I had the
Shelf with all the GPUs on them this is
now like a really nice glass case that's
got some cool GPUs I just sort of
grabbed him at random as the kingpin
it's a 580 that's a 6 6
skee the 680 this is not a 7990 this is
actually a fire pro card right there you
can see it right there it's a W 9000 x2
essentially a 7990 with a fire profile
and then this right here is a 390 from
MSI so yeah but I need to get some I
need to get the light in there shining
down through the case so it's going see
if I can get one of those in see how it
looks there we go much much better now
they are lit and accented I double-sided
sticky tape the little switch right
there it's running in a channel right
along the edge of the glass because the
challenge here is as you can see this is
all glass on all four sides so it's
actually running in a channel that I put
in there and here's the other I like
that a lot
this place is starting to look a little
too classy for me alright guys that's
about it for me today thanks for
watching these vlogs you guys make my
life fun and I hope you find these
somewhat entertaining it's a way of
getting work done and producing content
at the same time it's kind of phoning it
in but yeah it allows me to kill two
birds with one stone anyway thanks for
watching guys and as always I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
