today but it's already running bug it in
music today we're gonna do a vlog
because this is not a video that I can
just like set up oh baby as we got kids
running around downstairs this is my
oboe revolution bracing cockpit you guys
have probably seen this on social media
already but I've got this guy that I
want to add to it too which is my
phonetic hydro brake for drifting and
stuff as you can see I've got nowhere to
mount it here we're gonna make a way to
mount it we gonna talk about this
because this isn't even the shifter
mount that comes with this seat yeah so
it's kind of a mini-review sneak peak of
things to come today's video is brought
to you by Daryl axe dole a stubborn
stool ruin your day take the crab out of
crappy day with your dual acts maximum
strain you get that spool slide okay so
this is my fan of tech shifter here this
arm that's mounted to the frame we got
lucky at the holes lined up this is not
even the shifter arm that goes to this
this is the shifter mount for it as you
can see there are no holes in it
I mean I don't understand what the hell
they've got the base is drilled for
Fanta Tech for the pedals
it's drilled up here for the servo base
for the steering wheel but they were
just like and drill your own friggin
holes for the shifter doesn't make any
sense even the cheap GT Omega cockpit
has holes pre-drilled for fan attacks so
why went up the other thing I don't like
is they use round stock and there's a
set screw that goes in there that you
have to tighten it on and no matter how
much you tighten that screw because of
how long this piece is there's a lot of
leverage on that so it still will move
on here like this so that's why I ended
up going with literally right off the GT
Omega I've got these extra arms and
stuff here they bolted up to the same
bolt pattern here on the frame which is
where the shifter would go
you know just sticking in the box but
just digging your box of notes
well this is all stuff that was left
over from the GT Omega because these are
actually these are meant for mounting
like rear speakers and stuff too and
also to speaker mouth but I'm just
trying to decide like I thought about
drilling holes right here and mounting
the brake somehow to the same arm at the
shifters on that way if I move the
shifter it moves lirikten it moves you
brake - but I only have so much room
here between the shifter and the
steering wheel so when I'm turning the
steering wheel I don't want the wheel I
don't so I don't want the wheel to be
interfering with that like when your
hand is on the same wall oh it's a
circle it wasn't gonna get any bigger as
you're returning it just saying talking
about knuckles and stuff when you're
holding it you just want to see if that
circle got bigger when you turned it
yeah like my knuckles I don't know yeah
okay but when you shift in the first or
reverse and all that stuff right he
starts getting really close to that
liver well oh I start to come up with a
way to mount this to that so listen TB
well oh my gosh I should have got
someone else for this video jb will
that's what happens new week when I pick
up a copy still setting in the problem
is I keep looking at this hoping it's
gonna just bolt up some way that's not
gonna happen like it's not going to just
bolt up the only place I can mount it is
I got three screws right here
three holes are here I could technically
mount it like this
and then flip the handle around so it's
up but then the cables coming off
towards me and then as it making a big
loop I don't think it'll be long enough
that it's not a very long cable so it's
like a headphone extension like a jack
so he just like take an extension cable
no no for this part maybe I don't know
okay so here's the other thing if I take
it say I mount this up right
that you break that's gonna hit on my
leg in my life right here yeah it's just
probably not use that but what else you
have that circle man that's too small
fits in between the holes I can just cut
it and put a bolt through it and tighten
it down and then it won't move so I
could I could shorten this just go
really tall wrong with people these days
I don't get you for Christmas
sandwich I want to shift up for a new
shift on for my car I want to weighted
one cat weight shift knows what I got
away to chip no food I say it's a joke
yeah they're like the same tone we're
like we're matching something won that
fight baby and maybe our Reno in mind we
straight up like oh cool a assured
destruction John John you were just like
captain planted that eyes are
burning notes is Britney oh the time I
don't would not go as far as to say good
times you can't do this with anyone else
you know that I think it's a good time
No turn that off
you're not going to acknowledge then I
was like mine didn't come with this and
yeah they all right we just found a
youtube video of a guy who side-mounted
it to the side of reaching across yeah
why
so these holes are here because it's
made for you to be able to mount it
to the side of your shifter if you want
that's not the side that's the front
well I can see that right now but yeah
so yeah you can actually mount it all
day a guy like there's still plenty of
room there
yeah so let's go and give this guy a
shout out real quick shout out to TJ RS
or TJ our sim he's the one that has this
video up but I didn't even realized that
he's showing like yeah I just slid the
little screws in there mine didn't come
with those I was getting met and they
guys mind and come with those and open
the box of hardware I'm like oh look
what I found
God knows that's too wide huh it
definitely needs to go like here and
said yeah I want to put inside could be
ready to plate it was it clear with your
leg well you sit there real quick okay
I'll sit you and I are similarly sized
people I'm taller my thighs are a little
fatter than yours though yeah it's not
that big of a deal I just use the rest
man there you go I feel like that's too
high I mean if you have your hand on the
wheel you want to quickly right yeah you
don't want to be all like yeah I think
right here is very gonna want to be as
in price scratching I don't know
thinking that's how you're gonna want to
be see this is why having that's why
they put in sequential an eight-speed on
both sides yeah they thought about
things they really did they don't I
didn't do things sorry that made me love
you going higher to reach me look pretty
much I will not argue with that this is
the the mechanism right here and then
it's just that little sensor right there
that how it determines how much you
pulled it so this is going to end up
mounting so it's gonna end up going like
it's take seven to think about where
you're going
a little bit let's go the other way
there you go
I was just testing you okay man a TDM
ego's it needs to be straight you mean
OCD whatever they Co DD DD so then these
guys these guys I hope you clean that up
mister it's almost like Fanta Tech
thought about this I think they did cuz
they kind of gave you
well I guess oh because I don't want to
have to deal with making more brackets
you know I mean mm-hmm like he's just
like straddling my chair like you've got
to take a dump line maybe I said I've
talked to your mom about your behavior
before it cussed me she's sick oh yeah I
remember when Nicholas was
blablablablabla yes such a wild animal
because I need the to any defense crews
like they give you these thingies here
but they don't give me they don't give
you any screws well maybe they do and I
didn't check yet yeah this is all the
extra hardware for the pedals and stuff
that have like different stiffnesses for
the springs and whatnot anybody want to
buy a kid okay so we could take this one
thread it through here mm-hmm now I
thought of this idea all by myself guys
yeah okay at least I see I could have
been life check this out guys here's how
this thing works you know this is really
cool I could have been like that but I
didn't I really wish I had real allen
keys that fit all the way through there
I'll get me so you know
but but but but but but but bad crabs Oh
No as a bad turbo I fixed that do that
you stop it oh I don't know yes firms oh
this feels so good
as he as he pulls his knob now if I
lower the shifter where I want it to
ebrake something too low ha this feels
fine did a ship that doesn't feel too
high it does it feel - how do you yeah
because I'm used to shifting where my
knob is next to my knee my knee is up
here so you go toward the heights of my
knob you've driven the car before can I
have a serious conversation with this
guy nope so we should use something to
make it complicated but I don't know
what the hell we can make this in no
idea that's squeakings bugging me
really wha no we're sweeping yes if I
actually work like this is that one
thing that I said you'll finally make it
was propagated what that reinforces
that's a man on a mission you don't get
in his way
there you have it
look at that face just like that
that's who nice possibly but still not
working I think it's alright he just has
to get used to race car noises I was
like I took like on the track I know I
mean seven I must go next not here maybe
went bye-bye
the only thing I could think is try
switching to one of those other arms and
see if it's the same way really take
them and you can sanitize a stat and bag
uh here not to record this part this is
boring I'm just gonna be I'm hooking
this thing from the thingy to replace
the arm I replace the army like I said
it's just maintain tolerances see this
one doesn't squeak oh look at that what
you look at that
it pays do that so I thought just trying
to find the hole with my finger
hey I should do my deal yeah there it is
Oh in the hole oh man game stopping so
uh this is what we call a Caltrans
operation one person chillin a person
working very watch that foot mister
okay we know it works to do the games
nope we're done
alright guys thanks for watching like
we'll test it next week
oh look at that so proud of you
yay
No
better huh yeah all right
yay he chose working the camera now I do
that there that angle right there
reach a shifter for the ship competition
I mean the break
yeah we have a decision go with others
finish awfully should do
you break I want to get yeah yeah okay
easy
where you going where you going went
that way
oh yeah I found Minnie
that the wrong way
yeah yeah
first place 257 yeah it bumps you up to
57 to 64 see if I can beat it
57
49 sumbitch hey it's a built wing may be
thinking what's the turn tools and
so what why did I do this video because
I wanted to that's why no you get do
that this is done part again don't
forget this video was brought to you by
Daryl axe don't like constipation ruin
your day take the crap out of a crappy
day with Daryl axe maximum strength and
get that stool slide or else I'll just
take us out of here just we're gone if
there's really a puppy relax it's gonna
suck yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
