today that's probably going to seem like
it's being done by either a drunk or
someone high on drugs because I am tired
I have spent I don't even know how much
time anyway I stayed up pretty much all
night last night finishing up the Terry
Crews bill which gets delivered in two
days you guys will of course have a
video on that hopefully next week but if
my eyes are bloodshot and my train of
thought just seems to derail really
easily
at least that's why so what's a thing
you know I'll be honest I'm a kind of
impressed by its proportions I know
right all right let me show you
something here I kind of like the thin
ones but this one it's about form-factor
yeah but mine can fit in tight spaces
with girth you can open tight spaces
it's like a master key whether you like
thick or thin the ITX lineup from
fractal design is sure to have something
that tickled your fancy remember it's
not the size that matters it's all about
how you use it
not exactly the girl open Garrett David
skirts is no contest though there's
content stirred by now you've probably
heard that risin 5 is launched
unfortunately this video today is not
about risin 5 even though I have it I
haven't had a chance to even take it out
of the box yet because I've been so busy
with the other project that I just
mentioned but I what I am going to do is
I'm going to tell you what the last 30
days have been like using Rison as my
daily driver and although the previous
video about that went up on the 20th
since I said I'm going to be using it
for 30 days I was actually already 10
days into that 30 day challenge having
moved into the studio on the 10th of
March and it's now the 11th of April so
I've got a good 30 days base of what it
was like using Rison for 30 days I'll go
ahead and say the three things I'm going
to really focus on on this video are the
video live-streaming video creation
content creation editing things like
that and of course gaming if you're into
things like compiling development work
and virtualization I don't do any of
that in my day-to-day workflow so I
don't have any experience talk about
with that that'd be more like something
you'd want to ask Wendell about so with
that out of the way in the fact that
this is just a talking head video feel
free to minimize this so that my face
isn't inconveniencing the pixels on your
trust me wouldn't want to stuck pixels
because of this face that only a mother
could love
now let's talk about live streaming real
quick unfortunately when I did my live
stream and you guys can watch the replay
here at least some of it go sample it so
you can see what I'm about the reference
here a lot of people just didn't get it
I think people failed to realize
although it mentioned this tells blue in
the face I think a lot of people just
didn't realize I don't use a capture
card i was not capturing something
happening on a different machine
I was capturing captured caption and
capturing what was happening on that
machine as it was happening I was live
encoding 10 megabit per second h.264
1080p 60fps on the same machine I was
gaining on on a game like Ghost Recon
wildlands which is extremely taxing of
any system so being able to maintain
60fps was an extreme chore for any CPU
and rise in 1,800 X at 4 gigs did that
for me now of course we had some low FPS
at times we had a couple of dips down
into the 40s well a few dips down into
the 40s but it's honestly not that
surprising given how taxing Ghost Recon
is and there still loved optimization
that needs to take place and
optimization and risin over the last 30
days has been happening and things are
getting better and in only 30 days time
it's not that bad I would have liked to
have seen that happen before it launched
but the fact that we're seeing it is a
good thing now I moved on to GTA 5 which
we know is extremely CPU bound and still
is able to maintain a 60 FPS average now
fortunately again we did have some lows
down into the mid 30s on that one
depending on what was happening in the
game but the important thing to realize
on these games as I was running them at
their highest presets at least in Ghost
Recon I had turf effects turned off
because that wrecks any GPU but these
were being rendered 10 megabit per
second as I said 60 FPS live encoding on
these games that are demanding at their
highest presets that is something you
could never dream of doing with an FX
CPU so that shows how far AMD has come
and tried doing that on the 7700 K and
what about content creation well I'm
going to shamelessly plug another video
of mine that actually did pretty well a
lot of people watched about using Rison
for things like Adobe Premiere Pro I
no problems I would be hard-pressed if
you had a blind taste test of what it
was if you had a 69 hundred K system set
up next to a Rison system and had a
sheet over them and then just had a
mouse a keyboard in a timeline and said
edit in this timeline and try to
identify which towers which I wouldn't
be able to to be honest with you in fact
when it comes down to encoding the exact
same timeline as you guys saw in that
video it's about a two minute
two-and-a-half minute difference over
the course of what it was at 11 minute
video I think it was I could tell you
right now those two minutes some would
argue over the course of a year and how
many videos you render how much time
that adds up to you're like that's just
wasted time no I don't look at it that
way because while the videos encoding I
don't just sit there twiddling my thumbs
waiting for it to be done i multitask
and I do other things while that's
rendering so it wouldn't affect my my
workflow now if it took like 50% longer
for Rison to render then yeah I'd
probably noticed that but I can tell you
over the last 30 days I have not been
sitting here going I miss money until
machinima Intel machine I've actually
been perfectly content using Rison over
the last 30 days and of course we are
talking about the 1,800 X though for 500
bucks it should be a good experience it
is the fastest of the rise end chips
currently now yeah you can overclock
1770 hundred x didn't get near that
performance but I'm just for the sake of
simplicity it's the fastest chip that
they currently offer now the thing about
that video is it wasn't very crazy when
it comes to the timeline a lot of videos
you guys have seen have had heavy color
correction especially since I shoot an S
log here on my FS 5 there's a ton of
post-production that has to be done on
these videos a ton of color correction
which can add a lot of render time to
any CPU and I'm proud to say that the
render time on the rise end has stayed
right in line with the Intel offering
like I showed you in that video so it
hasn't been noticeable to me now it's a
little bit noticeable when it comes to
something like the 69 50 X because
that's 20 threads of processing power
but when it comes to encoding on the 59
60 X compared to the horizon it hasn't
been noticeable so I can confidently
recommend the Rison 7 CPUs any of the 3
to content creators now what about
gaming I think most people would agree
that using an 1800 X for the sole
purpose of gaming wouldn't exactly be
the most efficient use of funds but I
can tell you right now that gaming on it
with too tight next Mac
well cards here that are pushing two
years old now at this point it's more
noticeable than I'm using older cards
and it is and I'm using an AMD CPU
versus an Intel CPU yeah I say the tight
next Maxwell's are old or dated they're
two years old now based on an older core
and it's definitely noticeable GPU cores
are moving extremely fast these days
especially with Nvidia time line but
gaming on them in the ultra wide qHD 34
40 by 1440p piano behind me hasn't been
a problem as you guys know as resolution
scales higher it puts more of a load on
the GPU than it does on the cpu so again
no issues are no complaints there in
fact I found myself wanting to kick my
own ass for putting the tight next
Maxwell cards in there and being lazy
and using cards that already have blocks
on them then putting my 10 80s in there
Pascal 10 80s because there are a lot
more power-efficient in just as fast
because that's why you guys see the side
panel open here they get really hot and
that evolve case unfortunately is not
very well engineered when it comes to
air flow especially for water cooling
and radiators and stuff yeah I find
myself taking the top off from the side
panel off often to keep the GPUs cool
not the CPU but the GPUs and speaking of
CPU though it really sucks that AMD
decided to do the whole twenty degree
offset because in none of the marketing
material and none of the reviewers guide
that they sent I checked and triple
checked after you guys pointed it out
mention that there is a damn 20 degree
offset in there to make it more
consistent with the temperatures of the
1700 when it comes to the fan profiles
that's stupid it just left people like
me going why the hell is it ranks are
damn hot how am I getting 85 C on water
which then of course left the jokes of a
cooler furnace no it's actually running
pretty cool overclocked at 65 see no
complaints there anyway that's just a
rant I have no idea why they did that an
AMD just stopped it but anyway to wrap
up this talking bobblehead video from
the perspective of a content creator and
a gamer I have no problems recommending
this CPU to someone who does both
I would probably if you're purely a
gamer would wait to check out what they
15th or the fork or eight thread variant
has to hold I haven't been for hands on
with that I'm sure there's tons of use
reviews on the internet already
haven't watched a single one so I'm
going to be completely green and new
when it comes to checking out risin five
I would probably see what those CPUs
hold in terms of gaming been blowing
money on something like a four or $500
CPU if you're only gaming it doesn't
make sense to spend that much on your
CPU especially when eight threads is
more than enough for gaming it will be
for a while anyway I hope this video has
had some meaningful substance to someone
out there trying to decide what to do or
maybe on the fence about riot I have not
been in a rush to go out and create the
new studio pcs I guess that I've got
several 6900 kay is to use I've got
another 69 50 X to use I'm doing some
more builds for the studio another
centerpiece boutique build like
skunkworks put to use here at the studio
and have a big over-the-top unnecessary
PC as another centerpiece of channel I
have not felt the need to run out and do
those I just haven't because this PC has
done a phenomenal job at keeping up with
the aggressive workflow that I need from
day to day now we've got multiple
systems to build here in the studio
we'll be building some Rises on systems
systems for display and of course Nick
needs his system because he's going full
time next month so he's gonna need a
system to sit at and work at anyway guys
let me know if this videos helped you in
some way this has just been one person's
perspective and experience in using this
now for the last month it's actually
been nice it's been really nice I could
have never done this with FX Rob
probably would have thrown myself off
the second-floor balcony if I had to go
back to using FX with the aggressive
workflow that I have now with running
this channel anyway thanks for watching
guys
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
