little bit of a vlog because today I'm
heading over to the new egg hybrid
Center where I'm meeting up with fractal
Josh and the new egg guys over there and
I'm gonna be doing a live mini ITX build
video or not video but demonstration
with you guys attending at least like 25
of us signed up that you guys are coming
and we're just gonna hang out have a
good time and of course I'll be hanging
out with that fractal Josh guy god
everyone's sick at him with it
specifically tuned copper base and
maintenance free plug and play
operations the EVGA 980 TI hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
really know to expect I've done a lot of
public speaking before but I've never
did any or I've never done any public
live building so this ought to be good
probably be more like a monkey screwing
a football but hey I guess that'll make
it a little bit more interesting this is
what the face of super car rental looks
like hey least I don't mind kind of this
race that I think I bought half of it I
know the exhaust though okay I'm gonna
go I got that what the new egg hybrid
center here in fractal design is showing
off its new kind of a kind of display
kiosk here too actually pretty neat with
that kind of looks like you walked into
this this frozen thing except for the
crap on this blade it's 30 degrees it
actually is in this room it's very cold
was it that cold before you set up I
know I brought outside it's like 90 I
know you got people showing up hope you
guys don't mind being on camera
because you're gonna be on camera
whether you like it or not five we are
going to be doing a how to build a PC
and I'm sure most people here already
know how to build a PC but we're gonna
do it anyway we are here at the new egg
hybrid stand everyone say hi we are
gonna be showing some guys here how to
build a PC and with that you guys can
all comment like hey I see me when the
video goes live probably know maybe the
next couple days but anyway let's go
ahead and get started
you
all right so would you would you think
of that live build demo it's sucked
right out there dad it's terrible did
you win anything I didn't win anything
either
that's what laughing oh gosh raffle off
used underwear
oh yeah if not his by the way you try
raffle your camera you tried to also
give away my computer all right so what
you think if Linus or anyone else was
here Jerry should've been here
all right you wanted to be on video
how's it feel it's weird isn't it I
don't know what to do with my hands I
don't know what to do with my hands yeah
I was just I was just watching Talladega
Nights the other day and he's doing that
first interview he's like I don't really
know did you win anything yeah what do
you win design nanos his his prize has
more meaning because it was given with
love right because it was taken with a
quick snatch I saw it and like gimme all
right man what you think that's pretty
good it's very good you knew more than I
did though so next next one you're gonna
run all right cool it sounds good and
then of course there's mr. anti-social
all the way over there
well that's pretty much Hana today's
vlog at least here at Newegg I'm not
sure what's happening the rest of the
day because whenever this guy is in town
shenanigans always seem to ensue
shenanigans I think it's a red head
thing might be red oh my god he sees me
uh-huh all right and we're gonna knife
we're gonna cut this off with my knife
my knife away already
we're gonna frame it so what are you
doing jumping up and down behind your
knife remember
unless you know you have an open
relationship with multiple sexual
partner he looks a little on the on the
pedophile side as well I might say I
don't look I don't want to I don't want
to accuse anyone of that so that's a
serious accusation
okay the head of files on worst people
they don't you just accused him of being
a swinger what do you call that the sort
of serious swinger is is engaging in
consensual sexual relations with other
you know also adults who can make their
decision
sweet Jesus we're being attacked is that
is it is your wife home no what I'm
saying is he's probably a swinger that's
a fast car that they drive outside
before I was walking job damn it son of
a bitch all right guys so fractal jocks
just showed up we haven't confirmed that
yet but just from the the douchebaggery
noises outside and the fact that nori
hates him already and he hasn't even
seen them we're gonna assume this is
josh from from good ol fractal a good
good buddy of ours and Jay Chase
is here too so we have some company guys
notice we've got Jay from Jay's two
cents here hi Jay beautiful and we have
Josh from fractal design
hello welcome so well guys that's all
for today I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video I had a lot of fun at the
new egg center is about 20 people that
showed up and it's always refreshing to
meet you guys because it's really nice
to see the faces of the people who
support your channel because you know
there's just so many people out there
it's really hard to stay connected and
every now and then when you get to just
hang out with viewers and fans in person
it really really makes you kind of
reenergize is
when it comes to wanting to do these
videos which was why I love to do these
events I want to do more of these events
where it's about meeting up with the
fans and doing things rather than going
to these conferences and these you know
dog and pony shows the vendors put on
like look at our stuff look at our stuff
and I mean that's cool and all but I
mean that's business it's really it's
really nice to get back down to just the
roots and hanging out with you guys and
talking tech and talking cars and
revving your engine in the Newegg
parking lot and pissing people off you
know driving over to awesome hardware's
livestream and you know revving outside
the garage and yeah it's just fun to to
kind of cut loose every now and then but
if you guys came thanks for coming if
you couldn't make it I hope this video
at least kind of made you feel like you
were there a little bit otherwise we're
gonna do more of these types of events
and maybe we'll see you guys in the
future
maybe even we'll do some stuff in other
parts of the country that would be fun
no reason why we couldn't do that any
guys I'm gonna get out of here I will
see you in the next video and as always
thanks a ton for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
