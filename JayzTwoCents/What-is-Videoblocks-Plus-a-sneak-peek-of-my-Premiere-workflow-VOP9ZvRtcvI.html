this might look a little bit different
it's been a while since we've done any
sort of a tutorial type video and I
thought I'd take this opportunity to
kind of answer some of the questions
people ask me about my workflow and what
programs I use so we're gonna kind of do
a bunch of things all in one right here
now this video is being brought to you
by video blocks which is a service that
I've actually been using for a while
since I'm a one-man crew and I don't
have an editor I don't have you know an
Etzel like Linus tech tips who can do
amazing work it's just me and I'm not
the greatest motion graphics designer so
I thought this would be a really good
integration on a project you know video
like this for a service that I actually
use so anyway let's go ahead and roll
that intro and get started now I've
actually been using some stuff from
video blocks here for a while
just you know one main piece that I kind
of use over and over and you guys have
seen it before if you look over here
this was the video I just put up the
other day which was the r9 390 review
from MSI and you see that motion
background right here if I push play
you're gonna hear the audio so and yeah
I can scrub pretty quick so you see that
motion graphic Specter movement I didn't
make that I'm not good enough to make
that so I actually downloaded that from
a website called video blocks quite a
while ago it's something I personally
had access to when you know you become a
full-screen partner and they give you
kind of like a free trial with it and I
downloaded a couple of things I've been
using it ever since so today's video is
kind of a two-parter it's just kind of a
quick showing you you know how I sort of
used premier and some of my workflow and
how I can make the workflow look more
professional by using stuff like this
because I have been using this now for
quite a while now video blocks basically
is just what it sounds like their blocks
of video stock footage aerial flybys and
templates that you can use to kind of
spice up you know your your projects if
you will I most of us are not graphics
designers but video box is actually a
place where graphics designers can also
upload their footage that they make on
their own and get a hundred percent of
the commission other sites will actually
take quite a bit
chunk of any of the sales kind of like
indie developers who upload their games
to steam you know steam takes a cut
while video blocks actually allows the
developers who upload their own motion
graphics here to take a hundred percent
of the proceeds of their work so you got
three different categories here you've
got footage now these are this is like
stock footage and stock footage just
things like aerial flyby is city views
just kind of random people and landmarks
and boats just things you might be able
to inject into your project to kind of
give it more of a dynamic feel this kind
of stuff is in movies all the time you
probably just don't even realize it
because it's you're just so accustomed
to it
but think Seinfeld you know how it kind
of does that don't don't don't
yeah don't make fun of my imitation is
there but it kind of does like the
little jazz you know base like
bumper-to-bumper home and it shows a
like a city scene and transitions
there's a perfect example of stock
footage backgrounds this is exactly what
I use over here on the right if I can
get the as I see using the wrong cursor
there over here this is an example of a
background the this you know blue part
here would be a motion background so you
can kind of pick from different types of
background fire love technologies always
of is a good one obviously now you've
got After Effects
now After Effects kind of has its own
category here because you can do so much
with After Effects After Effects is kind
of the industry standard for movies
television especially online content
creators when you learn how to use After
Effects you've got basically a magic
wand to do anything you want
now I'm not good enough really to use
After Effects much but these are
templates that are broken down into very
editable composite compositions that you
can edit the text you can kind of edit
colors and things like that to make it
your own so let's say you're a new
youtuber and you need an intro and you
know you make an intro or something with
say you know Windows Movie Maker it kind
of looked pretty bad but if you go over
here to something like intro or logo
reveal these are pretty good examples of
things that you could you know use to
make your logos or your intros look
really professional and really pop and
they're you know completely editable and
all rights are yours to use them so I
actually like this one down here
it actually has a sound that goes along
with it and if you hover over the little
thumbnail you actually get a preview so
there's an example of that one there
let's say you're into more of a spacey
thing here's a solar system logo reveal
this one doesn't have she actually have
any sound with it but obviously you can
add your own sound but there are tons
and tons of these I mean you can see up
here there's four four hundred and
ninety five of those now backgrounds
let's say you want a background for
something similar to like I did with my
you know benchmarks let's see look at
technology category there's all these
different things like you've you've got
your white noise white noise is always a
good one especially be doing like scary
music and stuff you know TV channel
static yeah you've got this kind of a
matrix looking things so whatever just
have a binary you've got this thing here
which kind of looks like a lot of
different test patterns you've just got
so many different things that you could
use so many things at your disposal so
here's what I thought we would do I
thought we would do two things one you
guys know I have my little you know
transition thing that I use quite a bit
look effect it will let play right here
just in case you've you've never seen it
so without further ado and enough
chatting let's go ahead and take a look
at those charts
okay so there is a transition now let's
go ahead and modify this transition here
let's go ahead and get the let's get the
minion out of there let me give me a
little bigger workspace I've really got
this like compressed down into a 1080p
panel I normally edit on a 4k panel so
this is really small so let's go ahead
and grab all of these smooth these out
of the way and I thought we do kind of a
country twang I figured I'm feeling kind
of in a country mood here so I have got
over here a bunch of files that I have
already kind of put into the workflow
here that I want to use so let's go and
grab this River landscape here and let's
drag it over to our project so if you
look over here I just dragged it in I
don't want to move over any of my
footage there so I just drag that in
place and this is how it looks now
chatting let's go ahead and take a look
at those charts obviously there's no
sound or anything it's just kind of
playing but it's a really nice kind of a
majestic River it's really coms very
backcountry feel but obviously that's
not going to work for us so we need some
music now I downloaded a from audio
micro which is actually what I use for
all my music here kind of a micro or a
Beck's country twang we'll go ahead and
add a little transition here I like to
use dips of white as you guys have seen
this is all basic stuff for premier
we'll do a dip to white on there and
we'll go ahead and take the rest of our
footage here plop that back against it
it doesn't look like I should have
snapping on I'm gonna zoomed out too far
all right so we'll do that now let's see
how that looks
so without further ado and enough
chatting let's go ahead and take a look
at those charts
and that's way too long obviously so if
this were the actual workflow I was
working on I think it would actually be
good to have you know kind of a little
bit of an underscore here what I mean by
that is where the music's still kind of
humming out right here you can see where
it's fading out but we would have the
other footage coming in on top of it so
let's do this let's go and grab all of
this again and then we can just kind of
bring it over like that bring up our
exponential fade and because it was way
too long so let's see how this does look
at those charts
there you go there's this low example of
how you could use you know some of the
aerial footage there now let's go into a
new little project here let's go ahead
and spice something up I downloaded from
audio or of audio blocks video blocks
here this times square and this is what
it looks like here it's going to start
this over so you can see it's just kind
of a static shot here of Times Square in
New York there's no sound obviously
you've got a you've got a guy towing
some Asians there this is I don't know
if I've ever seen that in New York but
hey so yeah we'll go ahead and drag that
into our project over here and here is
our project now obviously this is very
flat it doesn't do us any good it's got
no sound so how do you fix that
well I downloaded a couple of you know
downtown traffic day type of sound
effects we'll just drag this in crop it
so that it actually matches the length
let's see how this sounds oh wow look at
that do you think
yep so if you ask me it kind of sounds
like a real footage down right but this
wouldn't be in New York if you didn't
have some some road rage says we're
gonna do I downloaded a couple of
downtown car horn sound effects so we
got a short one here do you hear that
let's make it a little bit louder little
louder yet this is New York after all
all right but now nobody gets honked at
in New York where you don't have the you
know bligg Ettore you know guy getting
mad and honking back so let's go ahead
and pretend these two guys got into a
little bit of a honking match what do
you say and we'll stack this audio here
stagger it so let's go and see how this
sounds
there you go how dare you honk abhi you
don't hock it to me I humped back at you
yes so that's what we'll do turn it up a
little bit and let's go ahead and give
it a little bit of a fade-out that way
it sounds more like they're driving away
from us I could kind of happen behind us
and it's going to move it a little bit
sooner in the clip here
there you go now it seems like New York
doesn't it all right well there you go
guys I know this was just kind of a kind
of a short little thing here but if you
guys are looking for ways to kind of
spice up your videos whether you're
doing you know reviews or you're kind of
doing cinematic stuff stock footage is
definitely the way to go because this
stuff is already up there for you to use
you know when you sign up for
videoblocks it's basically an annual
feed you can use unlimited amounts of
stock footage all you want if your
content created yourself or emotions
graphics artist you can upload your
stuff there and make money on the
marketplace which is always a plus you
don't have to try and peddle or
advertise your stuff you can just put it
up there there there is just so many
things up here to use it's almost
overwhelming I mean you can it's the
only thing limiting what you can do here
quite honestly is your own imagination
so anyway guys thanks for watching
today's video
if you guys want to see more of this
workflow like the basic workflow that I
use my editing skills are nothing
special let me know down in the comments
if you guys want to see more stuff like
this maybe short how-tos for new people
getting into YouTube people who are
using premier I use the Creative Cloud
so it's fairly inexpensive it's a
monthly fee and you know you can you can
do stuff like this in fact let's let's
watch that little that New York scene
once again so remember we went from
let's do the before we went from this
just a real quiet clip no audio at all
which obviously has no immersion and
then we took three different sound Clips
here that I found on the internet and I
like I said I use audio micro for the
sounds and we just stack those on top of
each other and there you go oh it would
help if I'm you did it huh Jay is a dork
all right guys there you go JC since
bringing a how-to video I haven't done
in quite a while tell me what you guys
think down in the comments follow on
social media YouTube definitely follow
at YouTube that'd be nice Twitter and
all of that junk so guys let me get on
out here as always I couldn't do these
videos without you and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
