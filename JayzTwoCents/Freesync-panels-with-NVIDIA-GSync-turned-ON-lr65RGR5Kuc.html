talked about Nvidia going through and
kind of validating g-sync compatibility
with adaptive sync panels well that's
where when we taking a look at today we
only got to sort of experience that in
their little demo environment and they
were more or less showing us the
compatibility issues rather than showing
us kind of like hey here's how it works
with it where it actually works because
I guess there would mean and talk about
if it actually works other than the fact
that it works so LG reached out to us
and said hey we want to sponsor a video
we send you three panels you take a look
and show us show your audience how
adaptive sync and gsync can work
together flawlessly without issues and
that's exactly what we're gonna do today
and before you can just enable G sync on
your free sync right to sync panel you
first have to download the latest
drivers from Nvidia now we're running
for 19.7 teen which is the most recent
driver from Nvidia but once you run the
correct driver then you will notice that
the G sync option does indeed appear on
this panel so first up this is the LG 34
GK 950 F the F standing for free sync
there is a G option for this as well
which is G sync but we can go over here
to the little menu go to settings and
then you can see right here that it is
indeed in free sync mode it is an
extended mode with HDR on and all the
bells and whistles this I got to tell
you as much as I'm gonna sound like a
fanboy is my new favorite panel this is
gonna be my new daily driver if you guys
want to see a review of this panel
please let me know and I'll do it if
there's enough interest I'll do it but
it's a 34 inch ultra wide 144 Hertz 21
by 9 1 millisecond HDR nano cell IPS
gaming panel so one of the issues we saw
with adaptive sync validation with
g-sync was crazy color banding in the
sky especially on HDR panels there was a
lot of stuttering there was black screen
flashes there was white screen flashes
if you watch our video from CES I'll try
to member to link it down below
hopefully phil will do a little slide
out we saw a bunch of different issues
with some of the panels that they
identified problems with I don't know
what panels they were because they had
tape over the logos but I can tell you
right now
we're testing this with three different
LG panels I'm in battlefield five I'm
hopping in a plane right here I don't
expect me to do very well because I
don't have my joystick I do like to fly
with a joystick let's see what we can do
what we're looking for here is any sort
of weird funkiness and i don't
immediately see anything off the bat
you're going down buddy
gotcha even with the mouse all right so
we got HDR enabled obviously we're
running 144 Hertz look I just leveled up
as we're flying around here I'm not
seeing any flickers aim-down-sight
everything seems very normal is that a
bad guy bummer
i Spitfire respect for lots of guns Oh
21 by 9 HDR 144 hertz nano cell okay I
don't know what nano cell is it's
actually a new way of the LCD gate
technology working we did a video about
it in terms of the TV tech which is one
of the TVs we use here at the studio but
I made a comment there that I can't wait
for it to make it to desktop and well
here it is so that's a did you see the
HDR in the explosion now as I'm flying
around here I'm looking for things like
banding and glitches
there's no stuttering whatsoever so
obviously the sync technology is working
we are looking for banding in the sky
and I want to point out this is a
rendered video on YouTube so any banding
that might appear in the video on your
end could very well be through the
encoding and then the compressing on
YouTube but as we're playing right now
you're seeing very good gradient in the
sky it's not banding we're not seeing
the issues that we saw at CES and I'm
basically just playing here and I'm just
looking for any sort of wonkiness if
that makes sense
and so far I'm not getting any of that
at least on this particular panel what
ahem getting though is my first time
gaming at HDR it is just you ask
yourself how can it get any better and
then you start gaming in HDR and you're
like oh that's how and then it just
becomes like a whole lot of wow
oh well our bodies are playing together
uh okay so next up is the 32 inch
sixteen by nine this is the LG 32 GK
650f same thing G sync is enabled 144
Hertz panel gaming panel obviously it's
got all the same features that you would
expect from LG's gaming line and no HDR
in this panel so we're gonna go ahead
and just fire up battlefield 5 and do
the same thing we're gonna look for any
sort of crazy artifacts and sort of
banding any flickering which seems to be
kind of like the very typical thing you
find when there's validation issues I
got a tank can I run over friendly oh
that thing moves terribly slow I'm not
thinking about it so that means clearly
it's working right watch for movement do
you know but he didn't put the center
mass come on I put like three shots
right in his chest all right so last up
is the 24-inch
LG 24 GL 600 another freesync panel
obviously 144 hertz panel for i want to
show you right here with the control
panel is the way g-sync doesn't show up
but if you go into the panel go to
settings go over to free sync which is
in the game adjust and turn it from off
to basic or extended then it will
automatically show up in the control
panel as soon as it recognizes that this
is a adaptive sync panel there it is
setup g-sync click on it it's already
enabled and we now have all of that
buttery goodness ready to go so now
we're on rotterdam and the nice thing
about this test is every single time
we've tested a different map not that
the technology would really be map
dependent in terms of being buggy or not
it just at least gives us a good sample
of saying whether or not we encountered
any issues with different stuff so
Rotterdam is a pretty demanding map
they've sort of revamped it to make it a
little bit less demanding those are not
yeah I didn't think those were
friendlies to be fair I could miss all
those shots because I'm playing on a
different Mouse and a different keyboard
a different sensitivity and everything
than my home system which I is the only
system I've actually played this game
seriously on oh god no glitches no
issues well other than ice
hey where are these these random idiots
that suck at this game when we're all
squatted on I know right like that all
right well I've played enough we've got
eight and four in this round not too bad
I have not played this game in months
and I'm not noticing any glitches any
issues between g-sync
and adaptive sync had ability at least
in battlefield 5 so the three panels
that we took a look at that was he fell
oh all right well the three panels that
we've taken a look at so far today are
running pretty damn smooth and I got to
say that I really suck at this game
alright once again a huge thank you to
LG for sending us three panels to take a
look at one of which will certainly fall
into someone's budget the 24-inch GL 600
F is definitely a very full feature
filled 144 Hertz one millisecond gaming
panel that's definitely one you should
look at if you want a great gaming
experience without completely breaking
the bank we've got over here the 1440p
which is a very common middle ground for
gamers you get a high pixel density with
all the features that you'd expect from
an LG gaming panel that being the 32 GK
650 F and then my personal favorite like
I said this is this is my favorite the
ultra wide 144 Hertz
one-millisecond nano cell IPS HD R 434
GK 950 F my absolute favorite like I
said if you guys want to see a review on
this please speak up and I will do one
LG didn't ask me to do one but I kind of
want to because this is everything I
want in a panel right here but as you
guys saw through our gaming experience
there were no issues whatsoever with
battlefield v an HDR title that right
worked with this panel right here but
didn't give us any sort of funkiness
while playing no glitching no bending no
flickering none of that stuff so as you
can see these LG panels are completely
compatible with g-sync once again a huge
thank you to LG for sending us these
panels to take a look at and do our own
in-house testing with adaptive sync
freesync technology
used with nvidia graphics cards and
gsync if you guys want to know more
about these panels where to buy pricing
and full specifications click the links
in the description below a free sync
enabled okay so the three panels we took
a look at today the 24 GL 600 F the 32 I
could do this I sort of got watch it
watch the 32 GL you know GK the 32 GK
650f and the 34 no so once again now
budget-friendly but certainly
action-packed the mid-range 1440p panel
the GL why this is a hard I know I know
the number I know the format</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
