systems I thought this one would be
pretty cool this is when we took a look
at here from digital storm because sort
of an unboxing and overview a little bit
of performance but this guy right here
although it probably looks like a
monitor oh yeah it's so much more than
that great this is that part right here
wonderful plus it guys does need Celsius
s 3 6 from fractal design yeah so but do
you know what it does yeah makes things
cool yeah
cooler hey guys this is Austin and today
I am super excited to be doing a video
with the one and only NYX you said yo
I'm excited man so what are we doing
today we're going to review the Celsius
s 36 I get that a lot hey what's up sure
I could give you some workout tips how's
tomorrow sound awesome later
Oh
the new Celsius as 36 can make almost
anything cooler almost so cool I did
some research how to unbox things you
know that their line of tech tips
channel sure came up a lot would suck
that's by two damn box of accessories
trust me that was just as painful to
watch as it was for me to do it
so this is the digital storm aura
basically this is not your typical AIO
okay so this isn't all of one PC and
there's nothing new about that we've
seen these for a long time from
companies like HP I think even Gateway
did this way back in the day but digital
storm is packing a lot of punch into
this unit here so if we just kind of
stick this space down here for a second
guys don't cringe I promise it's not
under any stress here we have got a lot
of hardware packed into this open the
a lot of you guys thought I was
embellishing in my bad unboxing
abilities in the Red River video yeah no
I just suck alright I'm not even
positive that this is the way it comes
apart I guess we're going to find out
because I want to open the back of the
sucker up there we go
look it's that so there's an idea of the
amount of cooling built into the back of
this look at all this ventilation right
there and look at all of this crammed
into here so here's what makes it are
different than a lot of other AO pcs in
the past is we have got full-blown
desktop components crammed into this ITX
motherboard a full-blown GT X 1080
desktop GPU not some sort of a mini card
I mean literally if you were to take
apart an ITX small form-factor build and
shove it into a monitor this is what you
get
alright so where do we get in the box
here looks like we've got some RGB
cables there so we've got another fan
tip we got another exhaust yeah I'm not
sure where this goes stuff we've got a
foursome MSI stickers because we do have
an MSI board in here we've also got a
notebook with all of our information
probably something I could have read to
first to figure out how to take the damn
thing apart set up instructions all your
driver did this is pretty neat all of
your support information is all put
right here as well as your certificate
of ownership so this is going to be all
of your support more SATA cables here
another cold down of some sort our power
cable look at that we've got a USB so
this is what the usb on the top is for
we've got a built-in webcam
that so you can put that into the top of
the monitor and then you've got a webcam
I don't know much aspect about it
probably going to be a 1080p that's
pretty neat so that's proprietary one
thing that's really impressive to me
though is the way that they have managed
all of these cables in this I mean this
would be a nightmare if you tried to
take standard cable length and fit this
in here I'm not sure you even could so
all the cable links on this are custom
so everything's nice and neat and
airflow is optimal now some of you have
been cringing that I put this face down
if you like oh my god you don't put a
curved panel face down to the Flex but
that's where the other thing that
impresses me
is the build quality this thing has a
very rigid metal frame so there is no
flex in this when you put it face down
if you watch when I put it down there is
like no flex in that it is extremely
extremely tough and the weight is
definitely you know reminiscent of that
I don't know how much it weighs but this
thing is pretty heavy
before we start gaming on this let's
just kind of go through the specs real
quick it's got an i7 7700 K on an MSI
gt70 I Pro carbon mini ITX motherboard
where they custom-built a io water
cooler specifically for this application
so it pulls the air in here and it
exhausts it up towards the atmosphere
which is perfect through this really
thin radiator right here I don't know
what the surface area of this rat is so
we'll definitely be interested in taking
a look at what the temperatures are
we've got a blower style GTX 1080 in
here not a ti of it at 1080 that's got a
riser card so that they can orient this
the way they want so again it pulls air
in through the back of the panel and
exhaust it down I kind of feel like it
might have made sense to exhaust it up
just like we're doing here because this
is going to hit the bottom of your desk
and this is going to heat up your space
if you've got a keyboard under this I'd
be concerned about that they do have
this riser card or this riser cable
right here so this plugs into the HDMI
and it goes right over there
so I sense are using this cable I guess
I don't see why they couldn't flip this
around the other way
and then ran the cable internally to
make the exhaust make more sense so
again I'll be curious to see how that
works out we've got another exhaust fan
running right here the exhaust air out
the top so again why I would have liked
to see in the card flipped around so
we've got 3-way speakers right here that
our rear fire so we'll be interested in
how those sound and yeah I guess the
only thing I feel that's a little bit
lacking and this is the power supply
it's only a 450 watt so that means we
can't really upgrade our graphics card
to a 1080i or anything like that because
this simply isn't going to be enough so
that's a little bit unfortunate
oh then storage we've got a 500 gigabyte
Western Digital blue SSD and a one
terabyte 7200 rpm mechanical Drive
underneath that
motorcycles so let's go ahead and start
with performance because I spent the
last couple of hours playing around this
doing some benchmarking doing some
temperature tests and we'll start with
the CPU now I am actually pretty
impressed with the temperatures that the
really small AI oh and I have no idea
what actual size that radiator is it
doesn't seem like the same amount of
surface area as a 120 but then again it
thicker
it's definitely proprietary to this
build but it seems to be doing the job
because the 7700 K although a warm CPU
by nature is being kept around the
mid-60s while running things like
Cinebench back to back back trying to
get the thing nice and warm and even
when you run something like 806 before
it sticks right around the upper 70s to
low 80s depending on the type of test
that you're running now that's perfectly
acceptable in my opinion given the size
of the cooler and the form factor that
we're dealing with here but I think
given the fact that this is all crammed
into a monitor makes those temperatures
perfectly acceptable
now the GPU on the other hand that's a
little bit of a different story I don't
know if it's because of the orientation
like I mentioned I think it should be
exhausting the air ups to be a little
more natural and have a riser card
designed for that no the PCI Express
port is on the side facing the
motherboard but they still could have
come up with some sort of device I think
to reroute it because I don't know if
it's fighting the natural radiation of
heat or heat wanting to rise but our
temperatures will reach whatever we put
them at so if I put the fan curve up and
then even increase the temperature
target to something like 92 we will
reach 92 C even right now while we are
doing heaven benchmark on loop it is
sitting at 84 C because that is the
default target temperature and even if I
increase the fan speed it doesn't do a
whole lot to reduce it below that
temperature which the founders card can
do now this is a blower style carbon at
the plastic shroud I don't think it's a
vapor chamber style cooler on the MSI
blower cooler as like you would find on
the Nvidia card so I think a future test
I want to do is to put in my Founders
1080 and see if I get improved
temperatures let's go and talk about the
panel because that's obviously we're
going to spend all your time looking it
doesn't matter what's crammed in the
back of it you're looking at the front
of it if the 34 inch ultra wide 20 1 by
9 aspect ratio PST
it's not an LED it's not an IPS it's an
LCD TFT now the colors are not as
vibrant or popping as much as a TN panel
but they definitely don't look bad I
mean they might have a slight washed out
look to them which means you might want
to add a little bit of saturation to it
but it's not going to give you the color
accuracy of something like an IPS panel
so this is this is definitely not going
to be the best solution for content
creators but it's a pretty good solution
for people who have limited space now
it's also not necessarily the best panel
for gamers either because it has no G
sync or freesync technology built into
it it's a 60 Hertz refresh rate with a
14 milliseconds response time so it's
not the fastest panel and yeah it's I
think it's a really good middle ground
because I think the issue with the panel
is if they went with something like a
predator panel or something like the AC
panels or even the new ones at 144 Hertz
or even 200 Hertz and I think the price
would be way too high I think it does a
really good job of walking the line of
being kind of a jack-of-all-trades it's
good at gaming it's good at content
creating the temperatures are decent
like I mention with the GPU that could
be better but the temperatures are
decent and it doesn't have a huge
footprint if you have room for that for
a 34 inch ultra wide on your desk but
you don't have enough room for a tower
well here you go now the only drawback
though to this band is it's definitely
got some tilt adjustment on tilt right
now but it's got tilt adjustment but it
doesn't have height adjustment and it
doesn't have swivel and the legs are
actually made out of very sturdy I think
this is steel something I'm disappointed
about though is that the stand doesn't
have any sort of height adjustment given
effect it's so low to the desk it gives
kind of an awkward viewing angle where
you're looking down at your panel and it
just doesn't feel right I like to get my
panels up right around I level with
wherever the surfaces that I'm sitting
at so right now I would have wanted the
panel to be right about here at the top
of the panel anyway rather than right
here that way I'm looking straight on so
it doesn't have swivel or height
adjustment which are two things I
would've liked to have seen anyway guys
time to go thanks for watching today's
video about the digital storm aura
all-in-one PC I think it does a really
good job at speaking to a very broad
spectrum of potential buyers and you
guys can sound off in the comments below
and let me know what you guys think
about this and
maybe we'll do a video about upgrading
this in the future have I said it's
advertised as being upgradeable huge
thank you to digital storm for sending
this out you guys can find the link to
them down below or just head to digital
storm comm and also tell what you guys
think about the new set this is the
first video we officially filmed in the
workshop here and I like the feel this
feels more right tell me what you guys
think down below and as always I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
