by now and seen the teasers there's a
new Titan card in town if you've ever
bought anything online I guarantee you
you're gonna want to pay attention
because your financial information could
be at risk we've all heard about the hex
we've heard about the breaches and the
millions of users bank account
information that has been compromised
due to those breaches well privacy calm
who sponsored today's video by the way
has a way to stop that it works is like
a VPN between your financial institution
and the merchants set up an endless
amount of spending cards that you have
backed by your bank account you create a
number do you create a limit and you can
even set reoccurring you can set
one-time use you can pause the card or
in my case I used it as an allowance
card for my daughter who's playing games
and now wants to use micro transactions
all the time well I can set her own card
and her own allowance allowing her to be
able to do that without having access to
my actual credit card information but
the best thing about privacy calm is
it's 100% free to use you can use the
Google browser plug-in or the app to
access your account make changes lock
cards or increase limits so new users
who sign up using my link in the
description below that's privacy calm /
Jays two cents that's JY z TW o cen TS
will get five dollars credited to their
account to use on their first purchase
so you would protect your internet
experience why not protect your spending
experience 100% free by using privacy
calm / Jays two cents or just click the
link in the description below okay so
I'll be the first to admit that when I
did my video about in videos product
stack and pricing scheme that they
probably slid the name up a tier which
is why we saw $1,200 but reims known as
the 2080 ti and that there probably
wouldn't be a Titan card well as you can
see this is the gold-coloured
manifestation of my in correctness
so I admit that so what do you get here
well the Titan is a two thousand four
hundred and ninety nine dollar stopgap
card that exists between the gaming
series and the Quadro series so here's
one - we've already tested the card I've
already ran it through
full testing sweet well I say full
testing the gaming suite there will be
two videos on this and I'm sorry for the
two-parter but that's because when I
went through the reviewers guide and
talked to Nvidia about this card because
I had a lot of questions I basically was
like why does this card exist why are
you guys undercutting your own Quattro
line and they basically kind of
explained it to me and why this card
exists who would exist for and stuff and
there's there's some tests that we want
to run on this card that we've not run
before there specifically and before
like AI do deep learning stuff I've
never done that's gonna take more time
to learn so that we can compare it to
older cards which I didn't have time to
get done before today I felt like it
deserved its own piece of content if you
will but because we've always
historically tested Titan cards on this
channel in gaming that's why we're
testing this today in games and I'm
wearing these black gloves because it's
super shiny and gold and pretty and when
you look at it it gets fingerprints and
so I didn't want to dirty that up now I
had fully intended to do an extra test
on this which I have decided to sort of
spoiler alert and tell you guys I
decided not to do and I was gonna be SLI
see if I can do this without damaging it
people cringe when I do this let me go
into spoiler alert and tell you that
these two cards valued at $5,000 are
actually significantly slower than my 20
atti SLI home-brewed ice bucket
challenge that Stephen at gamers Nexus
and I kind of competed with these two
cards don't even come close to what we
achieved with the chilled 28 et is the
2080 TI is overclocked much farther than
these cards were able to because these
have much more and that's dirty see it's
dirty it's what I'm talking about I hate
this the dirt anyway these cards have
much more dense cores in there means
more of them and as you add more cuda
cores in the same die size or whatever
larger slightly larger size it becomes
harder to overclock so without further
ado let's go ahead and just show you
guys the benchmarks because we know
that's what you guys care about and then
we will go ahead and maybe we'll do a
little bit of live testing here to sort
of show you in real time what the
performance is like tested in
battlefield 5 because again the only
title that takes advantage
RTX as it currently stands at this date
in 2018 and then ya know what else we're
gonna do with them I mean they're pretty
you know I just roll the things
so as you can see the main difference
between both of these cards is one is
silver and one is gold
now spec differences between the cards
this is that so the titan r-tx or r-tx
titan whichever order you want to say it
I guess is a fully unlocked tu 102 core
which is what we thought the 2080 TI was
in fact a lot of people even report it
as such but clearly in video is like
haha wrong so in the 2080 ti we've got
68 arty cores or ray-tracing cores in
the Titan we've got 72 so there's four
more of them not a lot but I don't know
how much more of a difference that's
gonna get us in RTX applications which
is why we're gonna be testing some
battlefield 5 in live mode right now to
show you that we've got 544 tensor cores
in the 2080 TI and 576 of them in the
Titan are the almost a tight next keep
one to call it tight next cuz the last
three Titans were called tight necks but
I digress so we've actually got 32 more
of those cuda cores in the 2080 ti or
4352 a massive amount but still not
nearly as massive as the Titan V's over
50 100 of them and the r-tx Titan has
four thousand six hundred and eight CUDA
cores so again not as powerful and raw
CUDA performance as a Titan V would be
you know their first gold card
but the Titan B also doesn't have RT
cores or ray-tracing course you wouldn't
be able take advantage of our TX titles
anyway now we also have memory
differences obviously eleven gigabytes
of gddr5 and 24 gigabytes of it in the
RT X Titan obviously no titles today are
gonna take advantage of 24 gigabytes of
vram that's one of the things that's
obviously there for the tensor cores
and/or the AI cores to do their job and
they are obviously able to leverage that
which is something that we want to test
when we do the professional workflow ai
tests but in those slides as you took a
look at you probably saw that obviously
at 1080p we were seeing some serious
diminishing returns and they were very
close with 20 atti that is because even
though we are running an 80 700 K
overclocked to nearly 5 gigahertz we
still are seeing a massive amount of
diminishing returns and bottlenecking in
fact if I don't even overclock the CPU
we see about 22
30 FPS lower in 1080p on the Titan card
and not quite as much of a return or
dimension return with non overclocked
CPU than the 20 atti in fact the 2080 I
was faster than the Titan card I don't
know non overclocked CPU because modern
making reasons so there's some things
gonna want to optimize on your system
though that is gonna help alleviate that
obviously you're going to want to
overclock your cpu because IPC on AMD
and Intel are very similar now but you
want more clocks more cycle so you want
to get the clock frequency as high as
you can that's gonna help it handle the
refresh rate also - if you go into the
Nvidia control panel go over here to the
manage 3d settings and you want to make
sure that where it says power management
mode on optimal power is set to maximum
performance apply that I should I didn't
want to hit apply yet it's or anything
we we also want to change texture filter
quality to high performance these are
gonna make some changes to the textures
and stuff in the way they're rendered
that's gonna increase performance but
you're not gonna really even notice a
difference and then obviously for
testing reasons we don't want g-sync
enabled because we don't want anything
to potentially limit our frames per
second so let's do this it's going into
some battlefield 5 we've just recently
did a video and yeah I know a lot of you
guys hate the title but still it's a
testing title to RTX title it's the only
title we have to test these features for
now at least until metro was it worth it
what's it calling a metro or the chain
Oh X it is thats it Metro Exodus and
then I don't think rise of the Tomb
Raider or shadow of the Tomb Raider has
implemented ELSS yet okay so one of the
things they had changed in battlefield 5
that made RT X performance increase is
the fact that they were rendering RT X
or at least calculating the leaves and
stuff the foliage which is ridiculous on
why they would do that but this is that
same scene I showed you before in the
last few videos and hard how r TX works
how its dealing with reflections and you
know it could be rendering things that
are behind you because of reflections
you can see the fire at there obviously
but here's we're gonna do we're in 1440p
right now everything is maxed we're
sitting at 63 FPS which really isn't
really isn't any better than the 20 ATT
I to be honest hey guys editing J here
so we're doing the side-by-side
comparison and we can see that the asus
strix
20 atti is actually about anywhere
six to 10 FPS faster than the r-tx
Titans our only guess here is that
there's probably a game profile that
needs to be updated in the driver to
take full advantage of our TX with the
Titan so yeah interesting here that a
card that's half the price is actually
performing better so yeah there's that
okay here back to the video and then
when you disable DX R&amp;amp;D x12 and you go
into DX eleven you get 150 FPS in 1440
with everything on ultra so as you can
see though although the performance is
outstanding it's definitely
mouth-watering it comes at a price
premium at two thousand four hundred and
ninety-nine dollars you can actually get
two of these twenty IDT eyes and still
100 bucks left over versus the price of
one RTX Titan let alone two of them in
SLI now I know a lot of you that are
just diehard enthusiasts are gonna run
out and you're gonna buy two because you
don't care you're gonna put them in your
system because money is no object and
that's good for you the thing is when it
comes to gaming I mean this is probably
the first time it's probably the first
time it's true where they're like this
is not a gaming card but then that would
mean that this is in the gaming card
either because of the fact that it's
literally the same thing it's just this
has slightly more of all of it the
exception of memory has more than double
so you can't necessarily say the Titan
r-tx is not a gaming card but the 2080
Ti is when they're exactly the same core
exactly the same architecture and and
all of that so that's why i test titans
with games like i said to begin this
video we will be doing professional work
flow testing ai testing deep learning
all that stuff but I've got to become a
little more versed in it because it's
something I've never experienced before
because that sort of leads us into why
this card exists this is for people who
are doing professional CAD design
professional deep learning testing any
sort of research for the guy that
doesn't have an enterprise backing him
with huge enterprise dollars so that's
why it exists but you can pretty much
play games on any GPU even a workstation
card does amaze can be great at it
fortunately the driver for this and the
BIOS does a pretty good job at it as you
could see this is where you guys come in
though I need some help I need to know
what tests you think we should be
running on this for doing things like
deep learning testing there are some
benchmarks that exist out there there
since
headaches there are problems with
synthetics because they are not always
indicative of a real-life experience but
they are extremely consistent when it
comes to back-to-back testing that way
we can remove all variables at least as
much as possible to get us true tests
and we can test them with Pascal cards
and of course they are TX cards so guys
we're gonna go like I said the start of
this video spoiler alert I know I have
two of them I didn't do SLI testing
because it was just straight up
bottleneck city and our 2080 Ti is on
chilled water were faster than these the
EBG axc ultra cars were faster than
these when chilled which means the only
way I'm gonna make these faster is to
put these on chill I don't know maybe
we'll do that if we get bored enough
someday if you guys want us to see if
you guys want to see us mutilate these
cards and put them on water and see how
far they'll go you guys know what you
got to do to get hit that like button so
thanks for watching guys and as always
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
