your volume down Nick is playing killing
floor right Killing Floor 2 and I am
playing PC building simulator which I
got a few days ago and I may or may not
be a part of this game in the future but
we'll just leave that part completely
unmentioned any further beyond that and
yeah so I thought that I plan to stream
earlier this week actually so the
coincidental timing with the unfortunate
events taking place the YouTube
headquarters are ongoing as we currently
speak but in the meantime yes I am
live-streaming some PC building
simulator here it's available on Steam
and I don't know how much it cost you
know much it is a $17 check so you can
basically use this simulator to build a
computer and not have to completely
break the bank for buying parts so yeah
I'm gonna go ahead and kind of let
people get in here for a second I pooped
the chat out so that I can actually see
more chat and I am going to be playing
this I have no idea how intense that
this game is I don't think it requires a
lot of hardware but I'm not gonna be
doing free build although I guess I
could do for you build but I want to I
want to do the career because apparently
the career is kind of like you're a PC
repair shop sort of a thing and you've
got work orders that you gotta fulfill
it if you've ever played mechanic car
simulator my understanding and it's just
like that
so as the career you kind of build up
your presence and your income and as
that goes up you buy extra things and
buy more work benches and and beefed up
your systems so let's see what we got
going on here new game
if you guys hear the sounds playing like
a slight echo I am listening to it on
speakers and not headphones and so it
might pick up on the mic a little bit to
begin go to your PC by the doorway and
open the email program on the desktop
I've got mail
what do you know Oh double click okay
just like real life here we go thanks
for taking over the PC shop for me so
it's not better state a few things the
company isn't doing very well and there
was no money in the bank account well
that what a way to start a company the
rent and energy bills come out monthly
so make sure oh you have to pay the
utilities too yeah so make sure the you
have enough to money for them I had a
job to go to which should help with the
rent see the email below remember to use
your thermal paste when putting in a CPU
I almost always forget and the PCs
overheat Nick would you go to a guy who
builds computers who always forgets to
put the thermal paste in so I think
you're all set up it's your company now
so running how you see fit
I hope you do better than I did love
uncle Tim psi to borrow 15 for fuel you
know how it is
all right give her that email so we got
a job here remove viruses I hope you can
help me my computer has been running
slower than usual I think I might have
clicked on something I shouldn't have
do I have a virus thanks Gary all right
I guess this is his computer did it do
all right so we need to PC can boot to
an operating system and we can remove
viruses and we need to work on this PC
for this job you need to run virus scan
press 3 or the cable button and plug in
the monitor keyboard mouse and power
into the back of the PC so I've never I
have not played this game yet I like how
it starts me at negative 15 because home
homeboy took 15 bucks for me so how to
play this game yet I have no idea like
the order of things I know how I would
do it in real life when I'm kind of
looking for here with PC building
simulator is how realistic the game is
our simulator is versus you know doing
it in real life
okay so let's see oh that's cables okay
pick that up put that there get up there
get up there okay now you need to put
your USB Drive into the back of the PC
so you can install the virus scanner
press 1 or install a button to go to
your inventory and select the USB Drive
it plugs into the USB slot and back of
the PC this is the part where you were
saying that it makes you have to take
off the stupid side panel huh oh yeah
see you can't there you go
so that was a problem right you weren't
tilting your view enough so you were
like clicking it through the vent
now press pure power button to turn on
the PC doesn't do this every time resist
a tutorial ok button a PC click on the
monitor to use operating system ok
there's pcs loud
okay I guess we'll take these off
why the heck not all right
so now how do we go to the monitor oh
that's up and down okay I'm just taking
the computer apart why the heck not lose
you can actually disassemble this whole
thing that's crazy
oh so that's cool when you turn your
view it actually turns the computer case
you can tell that this game was built by
PC builders because when you how many
times have you seen us do that on the
desk I go to look around it and it's
like you turned the case and you turn
the case right that's cool okay
I gotta figure out how to get over to
the monitor now I guess cable no all
right so am i doing here I already got
that already got that there we go
welcome to the virus scanner this isn't
a real virus scanner I'm sorry a lot
virus scanners actually take place in
its own bootable environment okay
welcome to Omega OS the operating system
of a choice click on add remove programs
to install the virus scanner and don't
forget to restart the PC after its
installed
all right so we'll install a virus
scanner yeah are you moderating at all I
just kind of keep it open on the side if
anyone gets really stupid then just say
goodbye
all right you must restart your computer
for your changes take effects sure
oh the Candace Rosen this stupid camera
I really think it's time to update my
OBS okay here we go we're back guys
so let's run the virus scanner do I wish
virus scans took only a few seconds and
you put the PC back together make sure
all the cables are disconnected now like
when you picked up and walked away with
the case and you yanked all the cables
out you guys just told everybody that
alright
power it down and let's go ahead and
move and
now do I put the pieces I took off back
on cuz they're like not on the table
anymore okay
guys giving back their PC with their
parts missing or what look to work bonus
PC so I took parts off this computer and
they're just not here now do you know
anything about that okay Oh
so these okay so those are the parts you
took off yeah I oh I can sell his
computer parts yeah what I wanted to
sell the parts there we go
okay I see you now oops okay fine I'll
do that first can you introduce every
time they like you have to actually
click on install that kind of sucks do
you I mean you know they're not gonna
stop
yeah so let him backseat game all they
want I'm not really looking at that so
gay
front panel and side panel leave by door
okay oh crap room button
okay
and why is it keep taking it off oh the
screws that's right okay every time I
hit escape even though it was on it
would like just disappear so like that
was weird okay I guess we can send it
back to him now huh this is where you
drop it and go a lot Linus all right now
you need to collect your pay go to email
Nick collect well using PayPal over here
using PayPal so I not eighty five
dollars and they're gonna tell me they
try groping I just wanna say thank you
for fixing PC boots faster than has in
years and you realize your uncle had
stopped emailing me just like real life
I hate you raised around okay whatever
so that one's done alright replace
graphics card now this is realistic my
graphics card is fried itself and it
needs to be replaced with the same one
please an NVIDIA GTX 970 maybe one of
those Shawn one's seen once Shawn wins I
can drop it around first thing tomorrow
morning
alright accept customers PC would take
day to arrive cool go to your shop on
your PC to buy the components you need
and can have them delivered at the same
time as the clients PC so I guess I have
to do other jobs in the meantime things
I can't buy a five hundred twenty five
dollar graphics card right now at 85
bucks or you can use okay but I'm pretty
sure I can't buy a 970 485 bucks so I
guess we'll have to say so I probably do
other jobs in the meantime hold on so it
pays 100 bucks it's a remove virus fine
we'll do that needs more space I need
some more harddrive space poking my
files could you install a 500 gigabyte
hard drive alongside my existing Drive
please I'll bring it around first thing
in the morning that pays three thirty
this person knows an awful lot about
what they want for someone not able to
do it themselves that makes sense most
people who actually need some sort of a
technician to install a hard drive for
them would say I just need more space
they won't be like I need a 500 gigabyte
installed alongside of this one has to
be an nvme I'm not - you know ok we'll
take that one so what can we do in the
meantime can we look around here is z97
Wi-Fi
I can't grab any of this random stuff
right on here we can't well it looks
like you could do something there at one
point so you can buy other workbenches
right yeah ok
what is it screw doors oh is this my
work PC down here I have feeling that's
gonna break at some point
so if you leave the workshop does it go
back to the main menu oh because there's
nothing to do right now so I can do that
right okay I miss you and your day in
advance to tomorrow
make sure you've accepted your jobs all
right and let's do this
look at all this work okay that's
upgrade scan we'll do that one first
it's easy yeah see it's filthy oops okay
oh wait it says one it doesn't let you
just open it you have to take the side
panel screws off that's weird I mean
this is one of those cases that have a
door you just open so why would it do
that okay clean out dust so we need to
buy canned air
how do you use the canned air
I didn't actually buy it today
how do you use the canned air I don't
have it I don't think I have it in my
hand I did oh ma 'king any noise it's
not going Shh oh come on guys make it
make noise is it really oh I realize
it's like I'm going why isn't I making
the sound
filthy computer filthy filthy filthy
okay
oh it's we need to remove viruses did it
do
lugging all the stuff that's a thin
power cable holy crap that is not a
worthy power cable all right install our
USB drive and power it on
dear little sounds weird should I check
their email give you like read customers
email oh yeah this is a virus scan so yo
YouTube horde Court headquarters just
got shot up said I am out y'all why
don't you get out dude we're in for you
to leave you must restart your computer
for your changes to take effect okay
Stan how many viruses did we find we
found zero files infected okay we're
good
and I guess we're done and we just mean
put it back together
that's something that's weird it
actually unscrews the side panel when
it's a you know door USB drive back okay
I need you that
we move
here we go doo doo doo doo
it's like I'm working in IT again fix so
that one's done
let's go tough customer
give me my money
it's fine we'll go back to her in a
second this one is fix okay
PC kyboot replaced graphics card install
oh that one we don't have enough for
money for you I don't think I'm actually
shopped yet but I don't think we have
enough for that one
let me do this one first how many hours
did you play this for so far Nick you
don't need to remove the cables you know
yes I know you can just pick up the key
of the case and walk away there and
everything unplugs but it kind of
bothers me that way okay so install more
or Tony easy store 500 gig later and see
if we have it
oops you have enough 40 bucks
that's a 320 gigabyte that we want
that's it one in 500 yeah they want a
500
why is there no 500 listen here ah there
we go 500 gigabyte costs 50 bucks that
is not bad at all
so how much is the graphics card then
they won a 970 looks like we can filter
oh cool
okay we'll be able to afford a after
this job go to my cart same days a
hundred bucks three to five working days
is $10.00 like okay they don't have
Amazon now it's 100 bucks it's free with
Amazon I don't have any other parts to
buy this is one okay
all right three to five working days no
my luck sent me five I just see what
other jobs we can get
I never go with computers but mine as
you start the bottom I'm already doing
that one I'm already doing that one okay
remember I go with computers but mine
isn't working properly I begin very hot
lately I'm running slower and slower I
don't think I can hear the fan anymore
it lives on the floor of my dusty office
I hope it's not all clogged up if you
have to replace a fan please pick the
cheapest one I can't afford anything
fancy they would pay two hundred and
seventy dollars to blow out the dust and
replace the cooler I I'm at I need to
get a new job dude it's gonna do this
now a lot of PC texts like oftentimes
will charge anywhere between like fifty
to a hundred bucks an hour
alright so that's in transit so I
literally don't have anything i can be
right now I don't think
that's hard drive all right time to go
and the day go to work
all right Audrey oh it's even uh it's
always the NZXT case it's all purple
ah that case isn't the way we need
another work bench if you ask me I don't
need this whole work bench being taken
up over here by my work PC
so basically yeah if you guys just like
the whole building stuff then I don't
see the reason why this this game
wouldn't just be a good whoa there we go
this game would be fun I think just if
you're bored and you like the idea of
fixing computers and stuff and leveling
up and well that's not hey can I just
take this person's graphics card out and
stick it in the other person's computers
all right why is this they replace air
cooler it should say verify air cooler
is operational not just replace it it
sounds like one of them like I'm one of
them Shady PC repair shops mm-hmm don't
you think you can go over John you can
you can go over drawing this game if you
tried it so I could buy that graphics
card now and not the wait for other jobs
is there an is there a downside to going
over draw by the graphics card now then
I mean it's crazy we need a nine 7265
bucks
I like it's a cheap deshaun GeForce GTX
970 aimer
the gamer that sucks I didn't realize
that so I could have put it on the other
order but oh well
there we go all right is it some money
back for this guy place air cooler
 I just did it again where I bought
a piece and not the other one I mean
it's not the click shipping again
alright that's fine
cool derp there we go search now okay
fine
cooling Owens 10 bucks yes that's what
we're going with she said nothing fancy
why did it put why is it say 40
I will go next day delivery screw it
come on get this job done
do you to install hard drive place
graphics card all right
new parts have arrived click the box is
yeah it's just like a round here huh
alright let's get her computer done
remove unplug motherboard
it's a cable for it there we go
install as broken can we sell the broken
one for $0 whatever we need to plug it
in right
wait
oh it's part of cable isn't it yep okay
there we go I like how you have to like
actually pick which USB port you want to
put it in makes me wonder if later it's
gonna be granular to the level of like
you have to play USB 3 in a USB 3 kind
of a deal oh I did it again I didn't do
the thermal paste just like that it said
not to do yeah we'll just let it
overheat why the hell not
so you get so caught up on like oh I'm
taking out the CPU no here we go
there okay so how do I close the little
thing then oh you can zoom in by like
mouse wheel how come I can't close the
lid then
now
remove cable install
did you see that it let me put it down
with the latch up there it goes well
it's like that's not right that's not
right there we go there we go I'm a
computer fixer
why did say computer need thermal paste
it was on there did it not didn't like
take itself off did do that thing where
I hit escape so like undid what I did
yeah it sure as hell did stop doing that
okay
there we go it's just like real life the
only thing is it didn't let me leave the
plastic piece on the bottom you know the
plastic cover for the base of the cooler
that's what I need to do let you leave
the plastic on so you can try and figure
out why it's overheating there we go
that was way harder than need to be
leave by door okay so everyone tells me
just let it yank the cables out yeah
when you pick it up it automatically
does it alright that works let's tell
them it's done
in my monies
in transit all right so let's go over
here
we can't do any yet because we still
need our other yeah we still need our
other parts don't we yeah that's right
thought
here we go here's our parts we've got
our hard drive now this one's the hard
drive right yes
okay so check this off need to add our
hard drive for the full-size hard drive
oops
so can you start just buying parts to
have them on hand to have to wait for
shipping you wouldn't that you said yeah
because it's very specific
I see like how it let me slide the look
at let me sled slide the hard drive tray
like through the back panel is that yeah
that's a bug there we go
that shouldn't be the case
so we obviously need cables
that's all the same okay cool
are you slightly back in there goes
there right I figured it out get them
mark go and it's go ahead
you know what no joke I'm gonna let my
daughter play this game like i'ma buy it
for her and just let her play because
it's so realistic in terms of just like
you get to plug this in like this is
gonna work without this plugged in it's
not gonna work without the thermal paste
that this will start to like ingrain the
flow and the familiarity with the parts
and where they go so I'm gonna I'm
totally gonna let Little J play this
yeah why not
you are live somebody just told me I'm
live weird it's weird all right
so weird
all right the sound gets all weird when
you turn your head think you're you give
my money
oh wait was it not done that is because
I didn't actually go oh I didn't put her
panel back together
I tried to ship it back to her that her
side panel I could say I've never done
that before in real life there we go you
don't need a side panel this is better
cooling this way side panels are for
noobs there we go
okay
we said to do that broken graphics card
line
okay
replaced graphics card okey-dokey see
she likes to play job simulator in VR so
I think she would like this okay stop
Coast Guard oh wait my card didn't
arrive yet
alright that's fine this was ready to go
at least like it's already too torn down
this one is this one need not remember
replaced by the board
can I replace it with just any
motherboard so I think we'll start
tearing this one down because we're
gonna have to see what all we need for
the motherboard graphics cards out there
cooler memory like this is cool because
you have to lift up each little tab for
the RAM undo the cable well from this in
here 24 pin SATA cable that was audio HD
audio looks like everything I'm plug a
CPU out
it's a seller on G 3900 it's a more Tony
z170 with a seller on I mean that seems
a little mismatched if you ask me okay
oh yeah I knew all my Portuguese you
know when to replace little J's
motherboard three times the other day
would have been nice if it was this fast
huh yeah there we go let's go buy
ourselves a more Tony oh no no do that
oh they need to fix that when you
hit escape
it doesn't undo everything you just did
because now I have to undo all these
screws again
why do so many people come in here and
start saying stupid like YouTube's
being shot YouTube me like like we have
it heard already like their first 56,000
messages people have been sending me
like I haven't seen a single one oh yeah
yeah
people people my god see this is the
part that's bugging me here I don't know
if I'm just doing something wrong okay
so I'm undoing that this Nick watch this
trick I know you're doing killing for it
okay so I undo this I'm do all the
screws motherboards out right you do why
we're replacing the motherboard not the
case or any I mean we don't need the
standoffs gone okay that's dumb that
needs to be Denny to be fixed because
that is not part of replacing a
motherboard unless you're changing the
motherboard like form-factor yeah okay
now we need to buy motherboard
I guess I should see what other jobs we
have first year here at mega Corp we
know that life doesn't always run
smoothly so we provide a free overdraft
for all your customers free free / deaf
limits $1,000 okay well that's
I'm not overdrawn anymore so
did I never finish Audrey's computer
yeah okay
we need another workbench badly well
this is just telling me I leveled up so
now I've access to other components okay
cool
I'm giving my daughter a PC and she
needs that seems to be a lot of that
going around lately huh I'm giving my
daughter a PC and she needs a lot of RAM
apparently she says she needs 16
gigabyte and I've got 2 gigabyte and 4
gigabyte RAM slots on my motherboard Oh
2 gigabytes and for RAM slots on the
motherboard ok fine except that one
replace motherboard broken graphics card
install PC status ready to boot
alright so we need to order the
motherboard oops
z170 mtech that's all we can get okay
we has four slots new 16 mother or 16
gigs we needed my memory we need 16
gigabytes looks like it's pretty
standard for gigabyte there $40 per 4
gigs that's how we're and prices used to
be I guess actually still not that far
off but still it's like $50 per four
gigs now so I could buy four of these I
guess one two three four okay
okay that'll do the order will arrive
tomorrow oh damn it's like defaulting
next day oops there's a lot of money in
shipping right there which one was this
place graphics card Oh with the gamer
okay so we need to come back tomorrow
for Britney's she's been waiting forever
here we go
got a graphics card my motherboard and
my RAM sticks so let's get this one out
of here this is the motherboard
replacement easy parts
well the motherboards not here yet okay
so we got to get his power crap out of
here for now take this one
eight gigabytes for 50 bucks that'd be
sixteen for a hundred yeah back in the
day that's what it was now it's a $200
for 16 gigs all right so we need to
install our PC processor no ghost card
there we go there 970 gamer didn't 1970s
require a power plug in real life yeah
this one doesn't seem to require it okay
well whatever
so you're just tuning in this is PC
building simulator basically the career
is like you're running a PC repair shop
you have these work orders you have to
figure out why oh crap it's undid
everything you have to figure out why
it's not working
upgrade their pcs whatever the actual
work order request is like and this one
here was replaced a bad graphics card in
this day and age it kind of sucks you a
bad graphics card you take it to a
repair place they're just gonna be like
sorry bro we can't we got nothing to
replace it with
and it appears to be working
oops and it's go ahead and install their
panel back on
there we go all right she could finally
have her computer back there we go
so apparently I didn't finish these jobs
properly weight estimate that's not that
what I want that's why
well upgrade to 16 gigs of ram so I will
take your 2 gigabytes of value Ram and
that's going in my inventory we were
gonna install open open open open oh see
this takes longer on the game there in
real life because I'm real life I just
put my finger across all four and push
them down so yeah I know right okay so
they automatically go down alright let's
go ahead and plug everything in make
sure it works what if we can do it
without a mouse oh well
and we were at the OS easy-peasy fairly
this one doesn't require pins oh yeah
it's got that little Locker in there in
the middle all right there we go
I don't think I have the motherboard yet
PC said is ready to boot understand what
that means I thought they took it from
me already yeah I know but see right
here I've already sent the PC back right
it just says PC status ready to boot
discard ok sounds like that was a weird
place motherboard collect this card top
quickly I need your help I borrowed my
mom's brand-new PC and I think I clicked
on something I shouldn't have now it's
riddled with viruses that's called
pornography I need it done before she
gets back from her friend's house on
1:10 2018 in two days hurry alright fine
Godot Lear PC not turning on missing
thermal paste hi there I bought a PC
from you six months ago from Tim and
it's been overheating oh that's the
uncle Tim the guy who never puts on the
thermal paste whenever I try to do
anything on it I took a look under the
CPU and there's no thermal paste what
kind of Mickey Mouse business are you
running I demand you fix this for free
and this time test the PC would you take
the time to ship it back and wait for
him to put on the Tim or would you just
do it yourself write an angry review and
eat the 10 bucks yeah all right I'll
take the warranty job ok so we don't
have a motherboard in stock yet do we
I don't think we do let's have a check
because I think the motherboard will be
here tomorrow if it's not oh we do have
it sweet
do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do put all the screws back
on I think it's dumb that it makes you
take the standoffs off to replace some
motherboard I mean come on okay so this
plug all these cables back in why is it
making me replug it into the power
supply never gonna unplug from the power
supply oh well okay we have put the cpu
back in
like are installing it upright careful
careful
um tools there we go
not not making Tim's mistake again
doo-doo-doo now we gotta plug in the
cables for this now put its memory back
in property of Woodward we go outside
slots
okay wheels missing here um graphics
card
everybody's got nine seventies in this
game apparently that's all plugged in
right okay
that thermal sound I know like metallic
apparently we're using liquid metal in
this one give me any power that's not
turning on what did I do
it's broken it's not turning on what do
we got here it's the side panel oh
that's all plugged in again oh no I got
the epin plugged in it's why we did not
turn on um wife is texting me once that
guy's okay so what did I do wrong here
so everything's plugged in
yeah CPU power is plugged in 24 pin is
plugged in needs to be connected top
right of the case are you talking about
that's unplugging Oh where'd it go so
it's gonna be the i/o but where is it ah
there it is
you guys are so smart see by them
knowing all this means I've done my job
Nicholas I did my job I kind of feel
like we should be running a benchmark on
this though to make sure this graphics
card is good you know what I mean so
even though it doesn't require it we're
gonna do it I'll show you guys how you
can actually benchmark test for install
3dmark yeah there's no GPU power on the
970 in this game which is really strange
because every 970 I have kind of looked
at had power
mmm times by Hall of Fame because I go
to the real one oh my gosh it really
does it just took me out of the game and
took me the real Hall of Fame that's
funny
okay here we go oh man that FPS though
holy hell
can we end it early can you escape it's
not part of the job I was just curious
yeah no sorry
your PC whoops
I mean side panel don't we that is not
gonna work
it was like two FPS I gave him an extra
Ram stick it no it said it was property
his are you sure let's see
so if I take this stick of RAM
so this is Woodward yeah see property of
Woodward so that was his stick my
trolling me you trolling me oops so now
I have to make sure that I can boot up
again but now something's not right
again
oh no this stuff's plugged in derp this
is kind of like the equivalent of when
you try and turn on a PC in real life
but you forget that you turned off the
power supply toggle switch there we go I
got had me thinking I gave him an extra
Ram stick but it has a little sticky
notes on who belongs to what so I knew I
didn't mess it up
there we go let's go get paid and all
the jobs are done upgrade plans of mine
I want four gigabytes of RAM installed
it would be good if you could benchmark
it afterward please okay so now we have
to go wait to the next day
okay in the day look at all look at all
those green jobs right there that's a
job well done okay what do we got here
boring II know where's the one where
dude like screwed up his mom's car
oh that car of a computer this is there
here he could have screwed up his mom's
car
I mean he screwed up her computer
anything's possible he borrowed his
mom's computer when she was out of town
he looked at some adult entertainment
and now his stuff don't work so let's do
this it's okay I'm gonna make like a
hundred bucks on this because this kid
looking at the dirties you know look at
the dirties on your mom's computer
because then you're just like you
sharing keyboards and stuff this is
wrong
adult entertainment
do you G wait so every weights says I've
been there
why remove because it's a habit for me
to remove the side panel no time I do
anything now
three viruses did he have warning files
found 320 infected files how is not one
click you're right X it could have been
okay
I was an easy one remember that problem
was an ID 10 T issue initiated by pep
kak I was $200 and I thought 100 bucks
I'm the $200 job right there light
thermal taste all right do it this is
the guy that good ol uncle Tim he forgot
to put thermal paste on here again
that's okay nephew Jay did the same
thing earlier at least I fixed it before
I shipped it back oh he's got a rise in
CPU in there all right there we go and I
just did it again I tried to turn on the
PC I know anything plugged in
this games pretty cool I can't wait to
let my daughter play it this would be
fun this is probably the perfect game
for kids in my opinion because it's good
enough to where it can familiarize them
with the parts what the parts do it kind
of gives you some ideas on like
troubleshooting and what that's like
because I mean it's it's pretty
realistic we've got to put in the u.s.
people like it's pretty realistic in the
terms of what troubleshooting steps
would be like you know what I'm doing
virus scanner no I guess it never hurts
right 3d mark the Intel cooler though
lol yeah that just that's a good catch
that's a good catch he just he just
pointed out it was an Intel cooler on
horizon no actually you know what though
to be to be honest there are aftermarket
coolers for AMD that looked just like
the Intel cooler so I think we're gonna
go with that it's a free to play you
have to pay for it it's like seventeen
dollars or $19.99 it's technically an
early access title but yeah nasrid wan
ridwan says no thanks Linus his daughter
2018 like I will I kind of skimmed
through that video he's doing this
daughter he was doing a hard to build
and he was like do you want to come back
in and help us finish the build that
she's like no thanks and she's like
jumping in the bean bags
I mean she's three right so you can only
be so into something at three alright we
gotta wait for this thing to go now
I'm triggered you didn't restart it yeah
me too but I need to do the restart I
didn't mean to actually install the
virus scanner I needed 3d mark what is
the name of that game it says it right
in the title dude playing PC building
simulator
speaking of viruses what do you
recommend for antivirus software I just
installed this and launched it and then
seen your stream haha blazing-fast yeah
it's going 21 FPS I just love that it's
like the actual benchmark
guys that's not Linus tech tips so don't
don't go talking to him like it's Linus
in fact once you ban whoever's name
copying like that somewhere up there
somewhere is somebody posing as Linus
hey I think I just discovered a glitch
I clicked off the game and then clicked
back to it and then the benchmark was
just done I'm gonna try that again next
time in fact why don't I try to run it
again right now and see if it works
let's see you ready hey hey oh I didn't
finish that sure isn't whatever that's
good enough
dudes piece and no gonna put the keys
back together
there we go
and that was it done man I've got so
much money now upgrade to four gigabytes
upgrade now I recently upgraded my PC
but now it's not working properly the
computer boots okay but when I try to
benchmark it or run a game the computer
crashes
I haven't replaced my PS you could my
new parts be drawing too much power
sounds about right
they could fix my PC since you add the
thermal paste it's running nicely I
didn't realize that business is under
new ownership a good thing too I think I
have been impressed with your timely
fixing of this issue so I'm happy to
give you another chance I shall
recommend you to anyone that needs work
doing ok
except that one this is the one that
once upgrade to 4 gigabytes of RAM so I
need to buy Ram anyway Louie hep in
there that's probably a good place to
start right he says yes 2 gigs but does
he have a 2 gig stick because I don't
think I can add the 2 gig stick biggest
we'll see so we currently have
we have
so he wants four I already had hey
that's smart because I kept that dude's
2gig stick as part of his upgrade and
then he added to Gig already that's cool
because now I can use those so now he's
got four gigs and didn't cost me any
money see if it works see if it accepts
it
there we go if you guys have played this
game already why don't you let me know
in the comments or let other people in
the comments know how you feel about it
I think this is like a relaxing kind of
a game it's not intense obviously there
is free build mode we'll check that out
in a minute
and you can just build something crazy
and free building so we'll try that in a
moment
that's when it gets a level-3 first oops
I did it again gotta install my utility
disc gotta run 3dmark why not make one
in real life cuz this one doesn't cut my
fingers shut up Nick J uninstall your
programs why do you give free software
to them because it makes no difference
to the game I like it but the
benchmarking sucks every time there's
new graphics card launch we go through
the benchmarks for dozens and dozens of
hours at a time so yeah it kind of
sucked in real life too I personally
like this game however there are many
inaccuracies yeah I mean I think there's
a lot gonna be a lot of little
inaccuracies because you can't possibly
account for every single combination of
parts ever like that I mean you can't
possibly do that
J about them standoffs he might have
metric and imperial standoffs that said
you could reuse the old screws and
standoffs with a new mobo I cannot
remember the last time I came across an
imperial standoff it's been a very very
very long time
J wait T hit level four why well the
benchmark run if you hit escape lawyer
while it's going that sucks cuz you know
in real life I walk away and let that
thing go you know what I mean I don't
just sit here and stare at it
yeah member I told you a second ago it
allowed me to watch it watch us cuz this
happened a second ago to go boop boop
see that works I did it earlier and I
thought it was a glitch all right so
since he got all triggered that I left
my software on there we'll take it off
there we go Judy dear we're home you
need to fix that sounds doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
I got so much money okay
I'm nigga I need to upgrade my PC can
you put in 4 gigabytes of memory
can you run 3dmark to check it doesn't
overheat I may understand that they're
trying to come up with a bunch of these
scenarios to just fill the game but I
think some of it's very strange like it
should do repetitive work because when
you do IT a lot of the stuff is
extremely repetitive so there be a
different job every time
I'm kind of stupid I should ordered
parts before I ended that day all right
install Shawn power King 600 or better
and one second here
run 3dmark and this one-piece upgrade to
four gigabytes of ram all right so I
needed to install
hmm om pay my bills am I gonna get my
parish shut off oh yeah we were passed
how do you pay them otherwise huh
I know but you had to go like a browser
but it didn't tell me that my bills were
do it just had passed you
all right so I need four gigs of memory
and I need the 600 watt power supply
music player
oh it's playing right now but I have the
sound turned down because of copyright
reasons yeah Shawn power King 600 that's
only 80 bucks and I need four gigs of
memory I'm just going with the basic
memory kit
yeah next day deliveries fine okay now
we can end the day
oh it says on them on the calendar okay
give me my parts go to this guy's
computer first
it would be fun the J unboxing simulator
why do you laugh like that
oh yeah yeah you get to jump over the
obstacles and stuff that is that is
hurtful there's a power supply in this
thing huh there we go
Jarrett why put itself on the table
backwards there we go
it's weird like it's backwards alright
well whatever
this is modular so the wife and I
watched it last night you should watch
it it's not that scary it's not scary at
all okay power supply day he only had
250 watt power supply is wondering why
he was computer with shutting down here
we go and
Maris oh there is
that's a front panel connector where is
there it is it's one of them they're
inverted ones
take a quick break and look at the chat
in a second - people are saying that had
terrible Jay is at this game
what is this
what the hard drive become I'm
disconnected I think I did it when it
ended the power supply didn't I oh
that's the power key before you say that
okay there we go he wants me to run oh I
already had it on there see it has to
run first like a little bit before it'll
work Wow an inverted tower case any car
vids soon yes actually
maybe something involving an Audi tt-rs
maybe something involving a seal one one
le no why there are no J's to sense
posters on the walls oh you guys just
wait you guys just wait okay you can
turn off the lights
can you really what I like to work in
the dark anyway who thinks I should send
Nick on a coffee run push one in chat if
you think I should make Nick walk two
blocks on a coffee run I can't go you
don't even moderate it my audience is a
very respectful mature why are you
laughing so hard my audience is
respectful mature and very trustworthy
to be on their own yeah if you guys
think I should send Nick on a coffee run
press one-inch yet and we're done
3d mark was already installed in this PC
so I'm not gonna uninstall it
there is no slow mode in here that's
twitch dude no there's not no there's
not look at my screen
that's twitch that has slow mode and by
the way it's not one person hitting one
a million times it's that many different
people saying one they just want you to
go walk out it's like 80 degrees today
heat it up a little bit they say there's
no there's no slow mode for chat don't
you think I would have used that on Tech
Talk by now that's twitch that has slow
mode all right let's put this back
together looks like you're making a copy
run buddy 420 run whoa whoa whoa whoa
yeah I don't smoke stuff you'd have is
legal or not I don't I don't know yeah
do it in this building anyway
okay that one's done there is a slow
mode
well not that I've ever found
yeah
all right look ah step it I leveled up
now I have access to all these parts
urgent upgrade required ok need
harddrive space
I already on the collector's edition
blu-ray I like to rip them I could use
my storage capacity it's a suit another
terabyte should do the trick
this job requires you to use the willit
run program that can be purchased from
the shop okay will it run interesting
oops there's software tab tools where is
will it run oh the auto connect tool
dude that's gonna be worth it I'm gonna
have the money huh yeah the quick screw
tool will it run is $200 find out
whether or not it will run or not
without the pain of installing the parts
first alright fine I was gonna say Baron
I have a delivery like shipping fee for
a software you know I'm not I'm saying
all right what do we got here it's
update this guy has some memories
someone requested I go to level 4 before
I do free free play or free build
whatever what why are you laughing cuz I
don't know words oh wait did you do ring
games you walk by did you do ring game
when you walk by you did didn't you oh
there it is I see it I see another chat
now you're fired you're fired after you
get back from getting me coffee
you're fired til tomorrow why am I
taking the back panel off for memory
here we go
fix that
Nevers like over 10,000 earlier a lot of
people left it was like ten thousand
seven hundred at one point alright did
you do oh wait what do they have in here
first of all this ones upgrade to four
right so we currently have in here
it was a memory there we go
go ahead and put this panel back on
we're gonna do a video about your car
when I feel like it I don't like I mean
I like doing car videos I don't like
doing car videos about my car and stuff
is often because then it feels like work
my car is about saying
gtfo to work and so I like to enjoy
myself
and not make it work
all right run 3dmark that's right
and did you do really marked through
your career are you free built I will
when I hit level four somebody suggested
I go to level four first turn off the
lights to save power
I will I forgot
you know whoa it's dark okay there we go
can you do a good $1000 PC build please
um no not very easily right now with Ram
prices and GP prices the way they are
wrong slot J that's not the slot you
took it out of I don't really care I
hope they always go into outer salats
put me in chat time out you Nvidia
she'll know cuz you're too stupid you'll
put yourself in timeout don't worry your
opinion buddy when are you going to do a
video about the water crisis in Mongolia
Thursday when you think of the r7 10
server as a gaming rig I okay damn it ug
pick hoarders was just shot up by a
female shooter your daddy wingnut you
are so late to the party you are so late
like you just strip walked in here like
three hours after it happened
thinking like you were breaking news
should I replace my r3 r7 360 with a
1030 it's struggling with 1080p 60 on
YouTube fullscreen the 10:30 would
handle YouTube no problem but so should
the r7 360 so you got something else
going on there wait you're number four
live trending in Luxembourg people need
to go outside more in Luxembourg and
then not do not watch me always thought
you put the RAM in the inner slots the
more you know it's usually the outer
slots or the alternating colored slots
like it'll be gray in black or red and
black or whatever usually the colors to
know a channel and see if this'll work
dammit it's not working anymore the
glitch shooter is not active free warded
shoot as the shooter is dead another day
the game won't let me install the a IO
shield you're probably doing something
wrong first
hey J my first water-cooling PC I never
installed a drain port can you make a
video about how to fix that I already
have
teach me to overclock you just put a
clock on top of your computer oh where
do you rank the r9 390 right now the r9
390 is like a between a 1066 gig and a
1070 in terms of power MJ it's as well
still usable platform of course every
computer is usable platform even a
potato PC it just depends on how long
you want to wait for it to do its things
if you're talking about gaming and yeah
haswell's just fine is the game free no
it's not J alt tab three times and it
skips one two three that didn't work one
three there goes yeah I'm sure they're
gonna fix that eventually so you can't
do that there we go alright
you got a mouth music everything because
you know copyright stuff
can you livestream where you build a
computer smiley face actually I just
said to Brian today I was like I haven't
done that in a while so I need to do
that again
there we go nope nope nope there we go
and let's go get our monies back
mm buddy give my money okay this is one
upgrade 1500 storage can it play we just
added the following parts to our range
msi radeon r7 370 gaming 4g okay that's
good to know
do you work with computers I've got the
money can you make the upgrade
performance dot wise - wise can you aim
for benchmark score of 3411 this sounds
like so many emails I get every day it's
not even funny it's scary it's like they
copy and paste it emails I receive all
right so I need to buy 1.5 terabyte of
hard drive space
whoops ah no no I go back
so we're gonna have to buy like a 1
terabyte and a 500 or Z already have a
500 in there I don't even have the
computer yet so I guess we're going to
bed here we go
J what do you think it's about what do
you think about what's happened by
YouTube I think it's sex no I mean
doesn't I don't doesn't matter if its
YouTube it doesn't matter if it's random
car dealership workplace violence and
any sort of violence sex I got to turn
the lights on this is begging me there
we go
okay so this one is upgrade would we
currently have for storage
when will you do custom loop with the
logos s1 not what the 1i have they have
not fulfilled their obligation to send
me another one
so oaky SNA one terabyte
so it's like Barracuda you could tell
Seagate paid for this or at least I
don't know maybe they didn't pay for it
I don't know next day delivery that'll
do fine okay let's get him out of here
don't take this one
which one's this one PC boo to us can
play seal way okay so we've got to plug
this all in and we've got to run the
will it run
okay
run um can have a better CPU I have an
i5 5200 you know you cannot have a
better CPU you are destined to have that
CPU only forever J what is the best way
to set up a multi drive system where
your files don't install to C Drive and
automatically saved to i its your files
are never gonna automatically save to
that location it's gonna be default
drive c usually which is why a time you
download something you need to go and
say where you wanted to go which game
did he want us to go world hearthstone
heroes of Warcraft World of Warcraft
ergo sail away there we go he's got
enough RAM he's got enough be Ram
he's got enough storage he's got enough
GPU that's minimum spec yeah we're doing
good
ok so we definitely do not oh he wants
to play the recommended specs I see okay
so we need another graphics card we need
a 980 we need a 980
that cost three hundred and fifty
dollars geez wouldn't it be nice even
today
add two cards okay so let's go and put
him away and this one so what I'm doing
now is I'm just seeing what all parts I
possibly need so that I can just border
at once
TC Kabuto OS and he wants a 3d mark
score of at least thirty four eleven so
he's gonna need a new GPU and CPU
probably
he's got a 1050 TI so that's probably
not gonna get the score we want done
it's a cry rig
wonder what will it play weren't though
give me a score let's try it
I always forget to plug in my utility
Drive my current score will check that -
you get a baseline why no what do you
think I'm doing this game is LOL J
should I run a an AMD graphics card or
Nvidia currently I have a 1050 t I want
to upgrade soon J you forgot the RAM on
the other computer
no I didn't we even touch RAM on the
other computer
see what this does I'm gonna do this has
3dmark nope what does it say but won't a
Warcraft I bet you they're using real
specs on this which is funny okay so we
currently have a quad-core risin 3 1200
with a 1050 Ti hmm ok so let's go and
get our benchmark oops
there you go so we got 21 24 and we need
131 134 11
that's a gtx 750ti so here's what we're
going to do we are gonna go ahead and
sell this card
because we know he needs to get rid of
this card right like how this is so
realistic like in real life how you have
to remove these screws and stuff that's
happening here
why won't it remove
okay interesting
fine I'll just tear the whole computer
down and see what happens it's a very
mismatched M Serena what does that mean
don't sell it keep it for later I guess
it depends on how much things cost at
the moment like this is telling me
there's something in the way of getting
a GPU out what
okay
oh there we go it just wasn't lining up
on the cable I guess cuz I tried
clicking the cable multiple times but it
was red every time I clicked it okay so
he's got a 1050 TI let's see
Jesus 34:11 is what needs right man
there's gonna be expensive
like they don't have very many Radeon
cards in here like higher end Radeon
card either 292 1050 TI's if it's just
yeah 9 69 69 69 69
so I guess 980 is what we're going with
then okay so that's in there and alright
so now we just have to place our order
and we'll do same-day delivery why the
hell not
these are high-paying jobs and there
they are oh I bought two of them yeah I
really buy two of the same card
whoopsies umm fight I put a 1 terabyte
all right well we got an extra 980 now
guys oops that's right do this one first
this is the one use the one day right
yes yeah I thought I put AG argh when
you don't check what you're clicking
when you click it sigue sigue we need
one terabyte of cheap one terabytes up
here No
so the reason why I didn't go straight
to like CPU on that benchmark run is
your graphics card carries a lot of
weight in I do next day then your
graphics card carries a lot of weight in
that score so I want to see what happens
by updating this graphics card either
way I know needs to be updated and
considering as a 1050 Ti the only thing
really faster than it in that list is
the 980 so I know it's not the buy it
anyway so yeah okay
no these graphics cards right here this
is broken so I'm gonna sell it
damn I bought this for like 300 some and
I can sell it for 117 that sex lease is
gonna match his build oh look at that
look at that that's nifty looking in it
where's this power cable
there we go
at work
so I guess we'll see what happens to a
score now
I mean 1200 is a fork or 8 thread so it
should be able to do all right with fire
strike
four times by I mean hey Thomas how are
you
there we go hey yeah look at that we
passed seat what'd I tell you
34 Elevens when we had to be CPU was
fine we're good we are good I don't have
to do this but ever since I got all
triggered and chat that I'm not removing
my programs I'll do it in I'll remove
them okay there we go put it all back
together you little covers on
oops
Oh derp
I'm doing that backwards
gracias sir
this is so tedious
uh-huh I still think it's really stupid
this is a hinged case why is it taking
screws out not just opening the door a
number four and live trending that's
cool that's why we're making tech
mainstream baby all right there we go
let's get this guy back to its owner
dude I lost money on that job and can it
play sail away so now I'm gonna take the
10:50 tii that last guy's case we're
gonna put it in this one and see oops
nope wrong case
so we're gonna see that 1050 TI will get
us to where we need to be to play this
game
I wish you could play music right now
but I don't want to get a copyright
strike so you know
am i doing
oh it's another one of these cases large
okay so let's see Coast Guard we can
take that 1050 Ti
we could put that back in there but
first where's the slide that lines we
had to do this one
see how this works this will require
cord yes it does no no
okay
let's see now
what happens oh dang we went backwards
Antipodes ETI is slower than 1/10 at 280
I don't think that's right I was
supposed to put the 980 in there yeah
I'm seeing that now but in real life a
1050 Ti is faster than an r9 283 gee
that's the thing so I mean I'm just
trying to figure out like why they're
saying a 1050 is slower than a 280 ok
fine we'll go with it yeah there we go
hey Nick I found an inaccuracy with this
game like it says a 1050 Ti is slower
than an r9 280 in our ninety-two 80s
from 2000 like 13 I'm gonna look now no
wait I don't have a 280 I don't have a
280 on my benchmark list because I know
what the 270 did when I benchmarked that
back in like 20 13/14 and know what the
1050 Ti does today 1050 Ti is just
slightly slower it's like a 1970 and 970
was much faster than a 280 so I I feel
like that's wrong but I will see see on
gaming sense for that I quit
for that I quit this game oh great
it has been stripped from just labrie to
80s 384-bit no no no dan dan dan dan you
know you don't start that crap the
memory bit bandwidth had very little to
do if we're talking about you don't even
talking about if you got about GTX 280
we're not talking about GTX 280
and r9 280 is slightly faster we're at
to test that now Nik see if you can find
an iron r9 280 online for us to buy okay
that's okay I accidentally bought two
980 s and turns out I needed both so
there is that yeah I'll go buy one we'll
buy one and loops to try it out I feel
like this is a true scenario for many
people or they'll have like a really
nice CPU because like this one here is a
6700 K which is a great CPU but then
they have like a really old graphics
card I feel a lot of people watching
this right now like what people watching
this stream are living that that problem
like you don't I mean where type they've
got all the specs and stuff that they
need except for like that one is missing
you know I mean and they can't even buy
a new graphics card that they've been
saving up their money for
how much 140 systems a little high are
you sure we don't have a 280 can you
look look at the inventory just look at
our inventory you don't go look at the
Shelf I we might have one actually cool
well this is good enough I'll leave that
program on there for him screw it
oh I guess we're keeping the PCI cover
because the only news one before oh we
have 25 yeah it's not it's that's
different
all right there we go
and that's done
give my money okay so this is the guy I
thought I bought the hardware for and
then I didn't okay
that was good
that one's done now I can buy an r5 and
an R 9 283 goe limited edition looking
to upgrade my PC I hear you work with
computers so my rig is running really
slow lately can you upgrade the CPU I'm
hoping for 4 gigabytes of memory if you
can stretch if you can stretch to that
can you run 3d mark to check it doesn't
overheat it's weird what I mean if you
can stretch it to that okay goodbye 970
now Americ just doesn't isn't up to the
task anymore so I need to get about
23:43 and pinch marks if possible I have
never heard anyone ever be like I need a
benchmark score of at least 20 to 18 you
know no I mean I feel like when the
developers wrote this game they just
like mash the keyboard to come up with
these numbers alright it's time to end
the day and use our parts they did it
again to sum up about two hard drives
I bought one I put one in the cart and
then two popped up
so I guess no well I'm sure I'll need
another 1 terabyte hard drive at some
point
oh well whatever
get this pc out of here can i buy
another bench yet i can give this like a
workbench for 1500 but then if i do that
i can't pay the rent
that's a that'd be a bed it'll be a bad
thing to do alright
that did it doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
there we go
and
I can't wait to buy the auto like the
one click cables cuz that's just gonna
be like one click and all the cables are
plugged in that's gonna be awesome
there we go 9,000 people in here it's
crazy so yeah I mean I guess if you guys
are really bored you got 20 bucks to
blow and you feel like building
computers this is pretty doable I mean
look at the graphics i mean i mean
they're they're blocky but it's they've
actually aren't if you guys know this
actually modeled this after the actual
cad drawings so they reached out to
these companies and got like the 3d
models sent over to them you know from
their design phase and then implemented
it into the game
and you see how there's these like
whoops don't do that nope
you see how there's like these build
spaces like like this little like
building area here they can make
anything they want out of this which is
why i'm saying you may or may not want
to kind of keep your eyes on this in the
future new build areas to build it so
yeah this is this is gonna be fun ok so
this is done
this is the outgoing right here and this
is the incoming there we go wow it's a
level four here
alright I'm gonna do I'm gonna do free
build in a second is this rushing
hacking sim okay that's not even funny
it's like a terrible joke alright it's
been a long time said no live stream
that wasn't tech talk so if you guys are
enjoying this do me a favor and use the
like button otherwise if you're not
enjoying it then you know what to do I
hate work with computers why does every
email start like that I hear you work
with computers alright so my rig is
running really slow lately can you
upgrade the CPU I'm hoping for four
gigabytes of memory if you can stretch
to that oh that's right I already did
that one okay
so I've gotta buy parts for him need the
3d mark scorer for him remove viruses
okay and you just big ol long
explanation for that did I
so why don't we see what he currently
has just wait till you get the job that
asks you to build a crypto mining rig
I'll just be like triggered the likes
are jumping up so quick likes make us
feel better I mean they don't change a
whole lot but they make us feel I think
it's real appreciated okay oh boy what's
happening here
yeah I've been playing this for like two
hours already like huh are you loading
up the game now yeah we should totally
multiplayer bro that'd be so awesome man
you have another bench already how did
you do that bro you're a rarity man no
one works hard anymore he dusted so many
computers okay we need to see what our
current specs are in this machine okay
I've had another glitch I was working on
some of the plugs yeah that works like
when the circle starts to go and you're
waiting for the circle to like complete
to plug something in if you just
double-click it real fast it just plugs
in like instantly yeah and that didn't
work on your end what level are you six
anyway oh did it again
yeah so you can't like pull up like
about or my computer or any of that to
see what the stuff is huh
he sounds like Leo from that 70 show man
the problem is the government man
they're trying to get in your head
chemtrails man it's all about chemtrails
they're trying to get to our kids
through coffee I don't like this
background it makes it hard to see the
icons all right so we currently have two
gigabytes of RAM we have two gigabytes
of storage we have a quad-core 1200 and
a gtx 750ti now this guy wanted a score
of what
oh just upgrade the CPU and upgrade to
four gigabytes of RAM bonds easy enough
so what's the other one
run a piece okay so I'm gonna try the
graphics card already having this one
the government's trying to get to our
kids me and I've been telling people
that you can't trust the government whoa
okay well I guess that's one way to see
what was in it um here oh there was a
960 mm well since everyone set the 980 s
faster or the two 80s faster let's see
you what happens
see I don't like to get public haircuts
man because I feel like they put you
know tracking devices and scissors and
then injects in your hair man they saw
it once on the Internet
because this guy left his volume turned
up oops
Jade you know Linus gave us 79-80 XD
system to his three-year-old daughter oh
yeah was it all the 30 loved his kids me
okay 21:17 dang what do we need to be at
23:43 alright so let's try the other
graphics card
hmm
I don't leave the temp agency is gonna
be faster you just now figured that out
that was like part of the level too like
it told you you had to download that
program yeah it's just needed but he has
a 970 oh yeah oh wait what am i doing
okay
no Nick's over there playing to you he's
playing a little shopkeep okay yeah it
does now man
just from the people who made car
mechanics simulator I have no idea
free build please no go buy it yourself
J you are a legend no uh legends never
die and I'm dead inside
[Laughter]
J you convinced me to get this game I'm
not trying to I'll be honest I'm not
trying to convince anyone to buy
anything I'm just playing I'm just
playing how do you skip the 3d mark
alt-tab three times I goes 21:43 so I
need to buy something for this computer
what does he have
I don't know what CPUs in here I think
so we have a 1300 x 1050 TI this would
be epic and VR yeah that's what I said
already J you're an above-average
individual well if the person is a below
average individual then I'll take it
which right when J are you hooked to the
game hmm I'll just try to get to level 4
so that I could do some of the requests
were like recommended I go to level 4
before I do free build but I think I'm
out to do free build after I figure out
this one here
1,300 X so I think GPU is what we need
to do because because reasons all right
so what do I need here this upgrade CPU
before gigabytes of RAM good that one's
not even here yet
okay so what did the other guy have in
it no it's 4 gigabytes of RAM and a CPU
upgrade oh crap that's right I only have
one bench
there we go
I wish it told like it showed you I'm a
stick you know like what the specs were
because I would write that down if I was
working on a computer I would write down
the specs it's time to fire it up try
and be like what's in here again who
needs a program for that it's called a
pen and a paper so this one had Oh a
1200 okay keep us alive this program not
so far
Ju gonna do a liquid nitrogen cooling on
your own to make it more intense uses
8700 K I'm not really right now ty says
oh my god Jay I love you so much well I
love ty ty for the record I love you too
you should probably like record that so
you can always have it like as your
ringtone could you might not being a
ringtone hi ty I love you hi ty I love
you alright so here's a 1300 right
haven't said 1200 so let's get him he
just wants to he just wants a CPU
upgrade but doesn't say what he wants so
I guess I get to use my own discretion
can we filter it by AMD no we can't okay
that's weird I am for there we go
so we're gonna go with a 1,300 X why the
hell not
we need a graphics card for the other
guy to 8165 155 180 damn there's all
kinds of graphics cards available 265
oh and r7 370 uh no r9 280 I had that
exact one right there tea with that
cooler okay
back to back to topic they might try 970
with his I don't want that Shawn one I
guess that's supposed to be like the
founders edition card or something go
with this one it's cheaper and then we
need memory oh look we got team group
team group memory holy cow here we go
he's already got two gigabytes in his
system so I was buying him another two
gigabyte stick and we're gonna do
same-day on this one let's do it
this is the one now we're gonna have to
change out the graphics card or another
guy card but the CPU in the memory now
he's got a Titan 2gig okay that's a
ragin tech cooler - oh it says it right
there I cut one let me undo the power
cable until last like I can't so many
screws we got here card we're my GPU go
I bought a GPU 970 check what kind of
crap is that
I bought the 970 it's not look
yeah fine we'll put his back wait to the
next stage just in case if I don't buy
two of them on accident again how you
got a calendar oh it's weird they should
put a calendar on the door if they want
that to be the case
no that's so weird
you don't need a better DP you for this
guy please stop at the silly voice MGR
legends want you to please stop being
stupid how's that being stupid
do you like huh yeah but okay it says
right
oops three marked winter oh yeah they're
right I think they're right well no I'm
stupid - shut up stupid oh my goodness
hey that was weird it wouldn't let it
the graphics card come off because it
had one of the little slot covers like
on while the graphics card was on it
sounds like what the hell yeah there we
go all right there it is
with 970 in there I think that'll be
enough to get us the score that we're
looking for here oh yeah I put that
piece back up right there
she won't let it go in the slot it's
supposed to go in you see that like it
has to go right here which is not where
it needs to go okay I think that's buggy
she now put it on top of the eye Oh see
it right there Nick look yeah so that's
a bug you know what they say about bugs
early access oh yeah
there we go
we're missing here oh all of the power
cables that were messing
and power
all right this should be enough Jay I
want a burger
mmm burgers there you go
hey we did it he got way more score than
he was expecting this one's ready to go
back and and go get paid time to get
paid so you wanted the update more parts
are available Gidget no I dropped my
gaming rig that one's in transit
diagnosed fix sure whether Mitch
requires you figure out what's wrong
with PC before being able to order parts
makes sense that's how it should always
be right but I guess there's people out
there that don't exactly operate like
that
the one that like was supposed to get
CPU and the memory was never even
supposed to steal his which we'll call
it oops
did you do do do do you did you to do so
now we've got rising 1300 X thermal
paste
and now we need his cooler back ready to
go
cooling that's right you know agent tech
cooler plug this guy back in keep hard
on just that you can thank goodness fat
if it wouldn't let me turn it on with
just the power cable plugged in I would
have it upset I'm sorry we do that all
the time around here don't we sir
well I've have to his memory here or if
it's gonna like that I'm using
mismatched memory well if the other
memory is even gonna fit let's see
right
yeah miss matchsticks buddy hello he
just said he wants four gigs he didn't
say and they have to be matched what do
that every freakin time
this game needs more Dyson that's good
they need to be there needs to be you
can hear the background music no you
can't you hear the pian is the paint
piano instructor next door the penis
instructor there needs to be a Dyson
vacuum like standing in the corner of
the room yeah oh here we go
21:50 all right there we go my colors
just like falling out of his machine
I've done so many jobs but they've been
staying like right around the same like
my money is not going up it's bugging me
right now so it's not just take them all
huh yeah what they should do is let you
start doing overclocking like let you go
into the BIOS and start playing with
settings yeah you my money reason
o'clock to nine eighty and the 980 gamer
this one says upgrade to eight gigabytes
of RAM PC is super slow right now yawn
I'm after eight gigabytes of memory do
you run can you run 3dmark to make sure
it's all working properly could you get
it done by one twenty six twenty
eighteen see that's the thing it'd be
nice if they told you what the current
specs works if he's like I have two gigs
and I want eight I want sixteen or I
want eight then it's gonna be more
expensive he's only paying two hundred
and ten dollars if he has eight I know I
can get another four for forty bucks
which means profit but that's the risk
right you don't know what he currently
has you can still buy 8 gigs to 4 gig
sticks or even one 8 gig stick and make
profit on that so I'll take that one
the thing is I'm just gonna not like buy
it
that one's got time so I'm just not
gonna buy it like next stick
you know I mean save money on shipping
the thing is I don't know exactly what
he has so like I said I could just buy
an 8 gig stick and be done or I could
buy 4 gig valueram or I could just bunch
of but buy a bunch of valueram right now
I keep getting these 4 gig ram jobs so I
could just buy more of them so here's
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna add that to
my cart add two of those to my cart just
so I have them on hand and that's a
diagnose and fix ok so it's going go
back to shop go to my cart I've got two
of those and we're just gonna let it go
three of five working days
pre-build I'll go to free bill in the
set guys and let's go over here whence
the rent do I always have little ways to
go
so this one Oh see this is easy this is
removed viruses those are always jobs
you want to take because they cost
nothing
at least from what I can tell you know I
mean unless they have this in some way a
virus caused physical damage I like
these because they are really easy to
diagnose and fix James Barnett says Jay
I'm late but is this a steam game and is
it cheap enough yes it's a steam game in
its 20 bucks start scanning baby I'm
gonna turn down this really loud 263
infected files holy crap
do-do-do-do-do-do
- I'm really kind of gained all about
where these boxes are you know I mean I
like the I like the boxes I need to work
on to be closest to the shop door and
the boxes that are on their way out to
be closest to the exit otherwise it's
like I know get upgrade to eight gigs
diagnose and fix alright so see we got
here so we don't even know like what's
wrong with this computer we just try
turning the power on to see what happens
oh yeah I see that
see this is this is what happens here
with watches deactivate activate
it's just something weird with um
Logitech it's really annoying
alright fixed it so often the BIOS will
give you a clue as to what's wrong if
nothing happens it could be broken PSU
if that doesn't help work your way
through the components to find the
broken ones fortunately I have spare
parts so see we got here
we need to plug all this stuff in
we know what's happening like is it just
not turning on of course this is what
it's like when you try and fix a
computer for someone my computer's not
working what's happening I don't know
it's just not working well does it turn
on well yeah but it doesn't work what I
mean doesn't work does it give you a
video No so it turns on but no video
yeah I think so what error no CPU found
I have another one to try though if it's
a risin anyway so it is a risin what CPU
was that anyway let's see
I'm broken oh it's a 1500 X okay but I
can stick this one in there to make sure
it boots the 1200 but I took out the
other customers build
look it works okay so I'm gonna turn
that back off take the cooler off take
the CPU back back in my inventory and we
need to order a 1500 X
oops $190 alright well I don't have a
choice
how much is this job paying me
340
all right so he's paying me 340 it's 220
yeah we can do next day on that one
that's fine
and this one what was this one
eight gigs of ram alright so we have to
now go to the next day
replace hard drive
why is it the professionals like these
people that work on the movie sets and
stuff right these big old long ass
emails I don't care that you're supposed
to be helping on an article just tell me
what you need by the way if you can get
a hold of a copy of the sonic monk
trilogy
I do recommend giving you to watch oh
come on oh and you can skip the second
half and the third can you do something
I need to get this article written here
as usual doesn't even say how much he
wants the series is massive I'm in some
indie film ok I'm supposed to be helping
out with an article for moviemax a
series retrospective of the sonic monk
trilogy this series it's massive and
some indie films Denmark so you can
understand why I want to take the utmost
care to get this right
does it just says replace the hard drive
so fine I accept it I'll try putting my
used hard drive I have and see if it
works
give away a rewrite okay okay I got the
CPU whoops
why is the case back
my memory didn't come
to the memory not oh I didn't do let me
see
so he had a 4 gigabyte stick alright
that's good but for whatever reason
guess War II ordered memory
now I gotta order memory
it's a quirky but I was making matches
sure why the hell not
you order will arrive in three to five
working days so as they say on the
calendar when it's coming the delivery
of the more Tony value so that was the
memory ordered right there and then
delivery of team group doesn't come for
 all the way to the 24th geez
yeah it's fine yeah that's fine so I
have extra RAM sticks which is good
though
okay so this one's the camp boot I know
I was saying earlier I was like where
the hell's Amazon do this stuff so
expensive
which hard drive to it to replace Ivan a
gig
doesn't say which one to replace them
yeah stop it
jeez mm-hmm well I wonder let me take it
off oh there we go
like I have to click on the cable that's
like going behind it okay
you stupid Dermot you'd be laughing at
this if you're watching you Nick
there we go what I just had to go
through huh
dang it
remember that extra 1 terabyte drive
that I had
there we go
there we go gum now
the Louisville area dude I'm catching
you man for $1,000 yeah yank I only do
it I did it I fixed it
dude it looked it or I made the 1500 can
you army
I'm curious
I don't think you can actually do that
oh there it is right there system info
get the details of the system's
performance like you were saying part
ranking compared the relative
performance of CPUs and graphs get used
parts at reduced prices from PC Bay will
it run alright well if you don't save it
you just automatically bark all your
progress oh I got a memory for this guy
yet soon as I finish these jobs I'll do
for you building this one was died
diagnose and fix all right so
god I can't wait to get enough money see
the one-click install of all the cables
oh there's no CPU even in it that's
the one I already started to fix
remember all right so now I got to wait
for the parts to arrive oh I didn't turn
in that other one though did I
great that guy put me on his damn
mailing list remove viruses okay
used the 1200 you have the parts J but I
was replacing the 1500 ETSU it came to
me bad with a 1500 X in it I was trying
to replace it for the same part will it
let me get away with downgrading him
I'll try it if it works and by all means
I mean shoot well I had another 1500 X
right here well whatever I guess it came
in but if it will let me do the 1200 and
sure why the hell not alright it lets me
do it Nick this game let's you be like
shady I just replaced this 1500 X with a
1200 and it was like good job I'm not
even kidding
Shady
it just doesn't seem right I mean I feel
dirty just doing it in a game and it
booted to the OS that's just wrong
I'm sorry I know not a single person
watching this stream right now would be
okay with taking the computer to a
repair guy and saying can you fix it for
me and then says sure I can fix it
downgrades you without like approving it
right once you once you'd be like okay
you're 1500 X is bad we can replace it
with a 1500 X or we can save money by
going with a yada yada that's how you do
business folks you do business the other
way you're not business very long said
problem is I went in this with ethics
and apparently that was the wrong way to
do it why isn't this letting me turn it
in though is it because of that see it's
not letting me say collect on it so
maybe that's why I let me try putting
the 1500 X in now and see what happens
oh I did thermal paste but I did thermal
paste though I put the little stupid
little thing on there or wasn't when I
tested it with the 1200 I think that was
probably it
there we go but now because he touched
it you have to boot it again do you
think there's add-ons like Auto thermal
paste and stuff for this game like when
you unlock abilities like the one
o'clock one click you know this game
though because then they're probably
testing this like internally you know
they probably kept forgetting to put it
on which is why the very first thing it
tells you it was like don't forget the
thermal paste cuz I always do yeah you
know that's how it probably went
you need to hire a guy to bring all
these boxes to the door for me okay
this guy's really bugging me upgrade to
8,000 gigabytes of storage for 440
gigabyte or $440 he's got 2 terabytes in
there now I think how big is storage
four thousand gigabytes it's one hundred
and thirty dollars you know there's
profit to be had
alright why the heck not
they have finished these jobs then I'll
be level now be level four who are we
good to go here's all my parts this is
the one I think I need with the hard
drives okay nope that's I
that's the viruses one that was easy I'm
number three on life trending on YouTube
right now the heck is that all about
yeah we got 8500 people watching I say
it was almost 11,000 earlier so I went
down a little bit but that's okay
okay
hey I remembered to put in my boot drive
this time
reach level 9000 be able to repair a
mining farm do you imagine mining
simulator just make a throw-up sound you
have 443 infected files
Angra it's like you never turned out a
virus job because doesn't cost money you
know I mean this guy needs 8 gigs of
storage I mean to me 8 terabytes of
storage so he's already got like the 1
terabyte I just put in there that's a 1
terabyte it's 1 terabyte so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take these both
out let me see if this will work gonna
let me take out these 2 terabytes but
there's 2 1 terabytes and put in my 2 4
terabytes
shoot to do the tray up well
fort everybody Oh
there we go what I do it again
and that's like in a work
nevermind the fact I took all of his
data and his OS it was like mine
there we go
easy enough so I got those two 1
terabyte drives back which will probably
come in handy later
see I'm learning now just be shady as
 in this game
and we're good
this one ready yet no but sunny my
memory for that one
you me me hey little four okay now we
can go to anyway he wants an upgrade
this Blake guy at films classics won't
go away holy crap
but repeat customers right replace the
PSU replaced CPU just guard help okay so
that was done alright I got to the
bathroom quick one here and say hi to my
gosh we're taking over chat I kind of
want to play for you though okay I won't
I won't touch it maybe
they already have a janitor or a janitor
simulator it's uh I have it it was
pretty funny it's a it's you're in outer
space janitor and just cleaning up gory
mess I forgot actually then we go check
I have it on my steam library
it is called VY Sierra cleanup detail
that's the game it's pretty funny I'm
not breaking his things
did he mute it Nydia mute it we're good
we're good
this chats moving way too fast
touch it
touching the game
and touch anything maybe I didn't touch
it okay it's free building yeah see if I
see a cleanup detail that's a fun
janitor see you told me you said on your
computer and chat with the people so I
was gonna do some stuff like what like
look up a game but yeah I looked it up
in my computer said you're gonna break
it
you broke my chair you broke it all
right okay let's tweet out or into some
free building you got on there and 500
people left haters all of y'all
all right here we go free build time so
it's done
Oh accepts accept okay so how do you
save Oh say again yeah well I didn't say
level oh that was autosave huh yes yeah
did now here we go guys free build time
I'll even have a how to build a PC like
tutorial I clicked it can we get out of
here yes thank you
no thank you mean menu free build so we
built anything we want right welcome to
free building simulator free build mode
in this mode you can build PC is using
all the current parts including the game
cases can be found in the cupboard we
recommend you play career mode first get
a feel for the controls okay we ready
did that case is that
okay
so we got the DG 87 DG 86 td5 England
303 the ragin tech Thetis Coolermaster
so I'm so glad they kept the real names
in in this game
I have complained for the longest time
about Coolermaster having the worst
naming of anything in PC it's like
industry like they're naming is so
terrible the cooler master master
Casemaker v msi dragon elite it's like
the worst names is like how many times
can we put master and maker in the name
of a product well you've got two masters
and a maker in there so I mean get in
there
all right so it's oh the corsair crystal
5x we built in this where i did anyway
the thing was kind of a bitch just to
make it clean I know okay oh man it just
like is strewn about and it sucks
60o silverstone did it like a TJ oh nine
no cooler master master Casemaker 5t
there's the guy next door pounding on a
keyboard oh there's a cool master cosmos
see 700 p which is funny as that's
exactly what I'm playing on so look Nick
it's like it's like case section yeah
yet they're adding more components like
that all the time they have a lot of
region tech in here I will do the we'll
do this one because that's this is the
case I'm actually like this is the case
that my computer is actually in right
now
oh they swing that door open why not the
other one that fine whatever
oh they don't make that slight like that
flips forward in real life like in real
life that piece I just took off like
will tilt forward before it comes off so
like right now if I wanted more airflow
in the front of my case I can just here
I'll show you guys on the webcam so here
is right so here's the case that I'm
actually using okay
but stuck on all the things so here it
is right here right so there's the case
in the game and here's the case in real
life so that piece I just took off in
real life you can tilt that forward to
get more airflow so I just I feel like
the game should have had that whatever
turn up the music hey can you play
louder over there I mean if that's
that's how I have to turn it up so I
wish I could actually make the doors
come off entirely this piece comes off
yep this is just like real life and then
here's the adjustable rail
let's see if we can what we can do we
need to RGB all the things other RGB
fans in this game of course they're the
only fans available okay
that it's very realistic
I feel like they should consult with me
in this game to like bring water cooling
in there like so I can pick all the
parts and then we like let me be the
water cooling consultant I think you
guys should contact the developers and
be like we want Jade I hope you guys
bring water cooling to the simulator I'd
do it yeah that's what I'm saying like I
would I would just I would consult with
them on getting it all done properly
should I make this as like close to my
system in real life as possible yeah
like should I just rebuild my system
right now but I can't it's all rigid
water to water cold in real life you
can't look dumb I hate or I do yeah put
it back in there yeah literally just put
the case away because if I can't SLI in
this case it's gonna look all empty
let's do this instead
and else we have
purple now what the heck now what will
do the will do the crystal because I've
built in this case in real life
can you put in an AI oh not that I've
seen
oh there we go forgot to logout a chat
the last thing I need is all them ding
sounds while I'm trying to do my thing
and there we go okay so take the front
off
that's not what the screws look like in
real life but hey it's alright
so the the fans in this case in real
life are RGB so I'm gonna leave the
front fans in and see if those are RGB
don't break the glass
hey I managed to build in this thing in
real life without breaking the glass
this is the the system that's in my
dining room
that sounds so first world elitist
doesn't it this is my dining room build
no that's just where the system is
sitting at the moment you think this is
you think that's first world you should
see my bathroom PC alright start
building let's start with motherboard so
what do we got here Z 370 X 399 x3 no no
no and x3 through 70 they have no x2 99
that's funny I love it see 270x 399 she
would do a thread Ripper build the
gigabyte X 399 designee R cuz I want my
system new plagued with BIOS problems so
that's it huh EB Gaz 374 the wind see
how that one looks in there Oh God
beer for an hour doing standoffs well I
mean it's realistic right
thread Ripper I like Hut's
photorealistic look at that
that's literally an image overlaid on
there okay so see what the other oh god
ton doing all this just leave the
standoffs in oh I thought want to
changes Dan does every time boy here we
go again
it's so terrible is he level four yet
yeah Marnie and Freebo calf Fe Lake I'm
doing thread Ripper right now at the
moment I guess I like how it
automatically puts in the i/o shield it
really should make you put in the i/o
shield because you know everyone would
forget
just like thermal paste all right screw
it down I'll go with the designated
board why the hell not
--card --card mode should make it like
not highlight things I I think that'd be
cool but I could also see people like
going crazy alright so now we need our
processor 1950 X or go home of course
he's gonna make you torque it down on
the right no it doesn't make you torque
it down they should have brought the
truth Red River experience tighten it
down in the right order to the right
spec or get a no boot right yeah okay we
need memory
there's no RGB memory in this game is
there oh yeah there is the team group is
RGB
oh they also have Dominator Platinum's
in here hang it all the dump lats
yeah their every speed and like all the
way up to like 16 gigabytes stick so you
do 128 gigs of ram platinum yeah team
group appears to be the only RGB Ram
that you can get because Dominator
Platinum's don't light up without a
light bar on them team group T force
Delta to RGB series blue LED RGB series
white Dan did other Ram manufacturers
need to step up in this game because
team groups is dominating in terms of
all of the like representation the
Nighthawk RGB fine will do that one jeez
yeah I'll bet
I do all little tabbies all the little
tab tab tab aru's no don't take out the
CPU
see that doesn't happen in real life
like you don't accidentally like look at
the CPU bracket and have it start to
uninstall itself that'd be kind of crazy
don't you think
we're going with all the Rams we are
doing all the Rams fellas and probably
like two girls that are in chat they're
all that Ram dude I like cut yeah
okay we need cooler
yep air coolers only that sucks come on
guys
that's not right though because there
were different coolers at the flat
coolers OLPC parchment
that's not right is there another page
no huh
all right well
yeah I'm disappointed any day iOS or
something
I'm gonna put fans everywhere
and what's funny is you can actually put
three 120s on the top in this case but
it's not letting you like position the
fans you know I mean so if you slowed if
you slid these two on the top back you
can actually put three of these on top
so that's disappointing
Oh thermal paste again yeah me a bigger
dot than that for the Red River holy
crap
yeah I'm just really disappointed that
raging tech is seriously the only
coolers that are in here I mean I know
they're gonna yeah but it's not because
I have a thread ripper oops
so maybe if I change this but why
wouldn't cry or it going like being here
like the cry rig cooler or fans are on
here but only the arctic freezer cooler
is showing up on here 40 our thermal
toothpastes yeah it's probably a thing
somewhere well I'm if it wasn't for the
fact that have to click 50 million
things right now I'd pull it out just to
put in Z 370 so I could run like the
cryo red cooler but I'm not gonna do
that because because getting these done
you know screw it we'll start over
I mean maybe this game is realistic in
the sense that that cooler doesn't
support the Red River in real life you
know that's a possibility I just can't
get an angle now to install there we go
no don't take out the fan you mother
it'd be easier probably just take out a
fan No
here we go
all right no that's the only I hate
about this game no like I said I now to
take out the motherboard I have to take
out all the screws which is fine
perfectly fine that's very realistic but
now to take out the motherboard it's
gonna actually force me to take out the
standoffs this and if I don't take out
the standoffs then it puts everything
back so I really hope they fix that
no they put the Red River in here but
just they didn't there's no cooler
support for it other than the Arctic
freeze cooler so now see now look at all
the coolers available look at this the
moment I took out the Red River there's
like all these coolers available for it
or for the case so yeah we're gonna go
ahead and just go with a Z 370 or
something like that see-through 70
gaming Pro carbon x3 net nope not
necessary 9c 170 170 SD 370 mm we'll go
with the Auris
yeah we do Z 370 or us cuz I'll match in
here nicely to I think look under search
who won the gleam giveaway if you're
asking then it wasn't you
now the all three winners have already
responded and the winners were announced
if you just go to Twitter and look at my
pin tweet you'll see the names that's
why social media exists no I mean well
let's put it takes three seconds to find
it
and there now we have my the board
alright so now let's do CPU 8700 K
clothes clothes thermal paste cooling
now we have all these cooler options so
this the silverstone silverstone we do
like stock intel cooler cryo a game 9i
great cooler in real life cryovac h5
Ultimates h5 universal now this is just
very realistic though because i mean
these are showing the real the real
motherboard socket types that they
support and that was the thing they just
don't have a lot of threader for support
yet just the Arctic freeze so we're
gonna do the r1 ultimate damn that thing
is massive okay let's go ahead and do
Ram first just like real life
oops no I'm not trying to put that in
yet
okay so it's do memory do damn white LED
RGB it's gotta be RGB man do that eight
eight
16:24 32
there we go now we can do our cooler
arctic freezer component Arctic freeze
whatever you guys know what I meant
there's that and we can plug in the
cable so there's that
let's go is it fit uh oh oh look at that
that's clock that's close that'd be a
real concern in real life you know so we
need a power supply don't we no power
supply maybe we should do 1200 watt man
Aiko is a 1500 watt power supply in here
but it won't let you do SLI interesting
interesting of course they're txm 850
cooler master master watt maker 1200 mij
see again the stupidest names ever I'm
sorry okay I guess we'll do we'll do
Corsair 850
J has pasted on yes there's paste on
there right now okay so now you plug in
our oops plug in our cables
yeah look at this there's like like you
said there's no cable management
whatsoever uh-oh is it specific to the
motherboard like you can't you're gonna
plug in one fan there's there no fan
splitters don't do this to me oh no no
no no okay
yeah so you can't even plug the fans
into the power supply what the heck
you look so enthralled right now well
I'm just I've never free built than a
free building this and what I'm seeing
here it needs to give you like a head
fan header splitter or something because
this I can't plug these fans into
anything see
there's nowhere to plug these and like
all the fan headers have been occupied
so that's dumb
oh wait you can daisy-chain them
if only that's how it worked in real
life okay all right you can daisy-chain
them but that's yeah okay you don't need
that many fans oh shut up
it's it shut up look at the way the
cable management is on this that's
embarrassing come on all right
graphics cards what we got here what's
the highest end card they've gotten here
do you have a 1080i yes they do which
ones they have in here it gee I wonder
if MSI like really hit these guys at oh
I have a kingpin card look at that it's
supposed to be
okay
uncheck fits PC top left oh I say didn't
change anything though put a kingpin
card nearly the size of this boom
I still can't believe they won't let you
do SLI in this game what the hell I
can't be right let's see let's try this
again nope it did not let you do SLI
uninstall uninstall
now well let me put the little PCIe
covers back on come on is it like
specific to the slot no okay well no I
guess you're not putting those back on
whatever um we mean no storage you
serious there's no like SSDs or anything
in this are you sure because here they
are here I see no no they just they're
plain like there's no lip there's no
label on them that's why 60 gigabyte and
120 gigabyte 250 gigabyte SATA SSDs so
there's no like big ones all right well
I'll just
plug these guys in
have you read the cables just like get
strewn about everywhere what they should
do is they should give you a cable
management mode where you can like click
and drag the cable and like move it
around yeah so you can be like I wanted
to go this way or even sleeved cables
would be kind of neat
all righty are we just about done oh I
need to put a fan in the back
install USB
oh yeah she makes you install OS okay
here we go
plug everything in see others baby boots
and I played this game for like three
hours already I've been streaming for
three hours yeah I started at 2:30
didn't I
holy hell this time goes by that's what
you're doing this okay alrighty whatever
oh look at that
give the colors yes I know I saw the
aura like the aura thing so alright
let's do this
side panels eye panel that's awesome
that cable go through the GPU yeah
there's some there's some bugs with this
don't forget this is early access stuff
guys that looks just like real life well
except for you can see it more from the
side but
yep so I actually have one of these
systems in use sort of used to be my
like guest PC but oh no no but my
my quote-unquote guests PC my guest room
is no longer really used like it has a
bed in there now so it doesn't have two
PC's anymore so it's like a guest room
now so when people come over for the
weekend or whatever they can stay in
there okay top panel
you can do water coolant you can do
water cooling thread River you can't
that looks cool
all right I like it better with the side
panel off that's too like great out
leave the side panel off for now what
else we got here
just those covers well let me put the
covers back on the bottom ones I took
off just what's stupid all right
so tools reboot it now it's installing
the OS those cables Nick oh I thought it
was this I thought there was a springy
sound I was like wait what no it was the
OS started so let's see we've got here
um you know lighting make sure you turn
the lights off for the effect oh yeah
good good call system info
and three work
that's restarting and it's go trying to
lights out like how it's daytime outside
when the lights are on
see state I'm out there you turn the
lights off suddenly it's nighttime there
it is look at that oh
incomplete case shut up I think a big
case okay select all lights here we go
wait it didn't do anything it's not
going pukey
oh my god dude okay that would be like
epsilon
that's alive that 1080i it won't let me
well the lighting aka aura app doesn't
appear to be working just like in real
life
well the colors are changing well that
sucks
restart the PC okay oh you actually have
to read why would you have to restart
the PC but now it's just blue which is
which is not what I told it to do again
this is working just like aura
yeah
it's too fast still too fast
and it's like way too fast there we go
there goes except the corsair fans are
not even like running there it goes you
messed up the boxes bro okay let me try
it again select all they're all selected
it's running Windows when in doubt
reboot yeah but you can't like actually
reboot on here
it's not working hmm the corsair fans
can't be RGB lighting in real life mmm
they can but they require yeah I mean
they can the will controller has plug
into the motherboard
okay so here's I'm gonna do
what's funny is like I told the system
to turn off you know it turns off as the
fans turned off now it's green I didn't
even tell it to go green and now
suddenly the fans are green the corsair
fans are static colors in real life they
are donated our RGB fans in this build
this like sea
I'm Ora wasn't working for my hero tan
and the fixed it and made a video Wow
I kind of won't watch this video now to
see if it's like the same type of
language alright what fans do we have in
here
oh my god this I'm gonna Yelp this guy
next door there's no RGB fans here which
sucks oh they can messed up again and
fixed there we go
are there any RGB fans other than I
don't think so the crowd rig fans are
not RGB in real life right the more Tony
heat aways love the names
well I mean there's that all right let's
build something in obviously those make
them white or something's reset apply
it's not even plugged in and the Corsair
is illuminated possessed all right what
we got here
sure I'll build in this little form back
there PC and then wool and then we'll
call it a day this was fun
actually I enjoyed this today put the
side panel back on and the LEDs will
work are you sure you sure I don't like
the way it looks on because they are
like the glass doesn't look very
realistic like transparent at all
these wires are so skinny okay they're
back to white it looks cool just white
be honest but see ramp jeez
breathe
hey it doesn't let you really link them
all together does it it still only shows
the color next to the Corsair it white
oops okay is that
who wishes their OS really like booted
that fast
here we go
see they just do blue
oh well that's fine
like the fans can actually turn off like
pee and the fans turn off and then the
RDP works and then everything turns off
that's right we're gonna be able over
here mmm
I feel like this needed ITX you know I'm
saying he's ITX breath rub move another
region tech case this would be a fun
case to build in I'd build in this case
what but I'm doing this one not the one
you have this is more like the open
chassis one
all right Susan I've done with this
build on this one I'm gonna go ahead and
call it a day guys but it's been fun
hanging out with ya I think we love our
you over there there level seven
yeah but still no more money than I have
it like level three or four it's like so
it's like you've really got to start
picking pinching your pennies doing that
piece eBay like use parts and stuff yeah
okay so now we need to process or you
have 1800 X in here y know 1800 X oh
there it is I was like that's weird
do you do did you do okay memories what
color should I do on this one like with
theme I'm gonna do green what do you
think well duty will do team green and
Vidya color in an AMD build that's what
we're gonna do yeah yeah that's what
we're doing
I need to open up all these other ones
dang did you just bang on the keyboard
somebody's playing piano the way I play
video games here we go
purple I do purple purple nurple
you know see again it's like really
selective on which coolers you can use
is it even let me do like case fans on
this let's see ooh it's a cool looking
case we use the special edition yeah
those were only nine seven years ago huh
is that 1080i
okay key balls I didn't have a power
supply who didn't yet Danny go to 1060
the evil 1070 1064 the one gaming Dan
they got all the randoms I wanted to put
one of the one of these green and
Messiah cards in there but I forgot
those really for the Millennial
millennium a 100 million edition and so
was 1070 TI titanium where do we have
4:10 eighties that's what I thought and
Gi well I guess I can put in a kingpin
card because if I do then I look at RGB
on that
that heatsink though man
I can't wait to back over off
so yeah this games 20 bucks and I think
I think this is an awesome tool for
people wanting to learn how to build
computers because if if you've never
ever built a computer this would
legitimately teach you like the way you
have to think about parts and the way
the parts work and all that stuff and
the way they they connect to each other
I honestly think somebody playing around
on this long enough would be able to
comfortably build a computer in real
life I honestly do got to have all the
storages for all the adult content it
doesn't let me put it in an SSD that
sucks yeah how can you not put in an SSD
in this all right I guess we're going
with 12 gigabyte there are 12 terabytes
of hard drive storage but why would it
not let me put in an SSD weird
okay well whatever let's see where we
can put fans in this thing
it doesn't even let you put in case fans
you know why cuz this chassis is meant
for water cooling and there's no water
cooling in here so alright guys I'm
gonna go ahead and end it here
like I said 20 bucks for this game on
Steam really not that bad at all
and we may or may not be involved in
this game in the future so keep an eye
out for that and yeah we're gonna go
guys so thanks for hanging out with us
today
well get out here we're going in the
stream and we will see you at the rest
of this week for some regular content
some good stuff coming and yeah it'll be
fun
so thanks guys as always we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
