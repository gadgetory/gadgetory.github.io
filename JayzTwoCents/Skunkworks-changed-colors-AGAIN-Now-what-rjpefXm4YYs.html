and thank God 5,000 of you were willing
to point it out to me in the last video
otherwise I might have never even
realized that the unthinkable is
happening once again with its
specifically tuned copper base and
maintenance-free plug-and-play operation
the EVGA 980 TI hybrid offers ultra-fast
gaming performance at the lowest
temperatures possible click the link in
the description for more details ok so
obviously the color in the GPU loop has
changed once again actually both of the
loops have changed color it's just the
color change in the GPU loop is so
dramatic you don't notice how much the
CPU loop has changed now they both are
getting darker and turning more Brown
and that color that you see in the GPU
loop is kind of what you're getting when
it starts to turn brown but a lot of
folks have asked me to please talk more
about this why it's happening because
I've been using pastel so lots of people
have been using pastel and now people
are afraid to use the pastel fluid
well the fluid that's being used in here
as I just said is the Mayhem's pastel
and I know it sounds like paints kind of
looks like paint it's non see-through
which made things look very very cool
for custom loops because he didn't have
that transparency and it looked as you
can see with the pretty loop in there it
looks very very good it's a cool way to
add color now pastels base coolant is
actually dragon ice and it's made by
well dragon eyes which is a nano fluid
and its base color is white and Mayhem's
takes it and pretty much cuts it and
does their own thing with it and then
adds a bunch of dyes to make these
various colors that you see and in fact
you could even start out with a white
base and mixed dyes yourself and create
your own custom color pastel because it
is more solid it's going to also make
impurities that are in your loop ph
imbalances and flux really show up for
instance if you have a radiator that has
a ton of leftover flux in it and you
have a white loop instead of turning
kind of this brown color it would start
to look kind of green what's really
weird is I've talked to a lot of folks
who have dark
color pastel fluids like the purples and
the blues and things like that and they
tend to get a little bit lighter in
color as the loop gets dirty so it's
really weird where the bright colors
turn dark and the dark colors turn
bright right off the bat I want to say
that I this is not really a problem with
Mayhem's and it's not necessarily a
problem with the block and radiator
manufacturers I think now here's what I
feel is happening here we are starting
to get a lot of long-term used data
coming back from customers and it's
really kind of alarming the amount of
people on various forums that have
complained about their loops changing
color now I think that this is something
that has been around all along it's just
it's much more noticeable in the pastel
fluids especially bright colors like
white that blue berry color and this
yellow it really is obvious now why is
the GPU loop changing color faster than
the CPU loop
well temperature can affect the
acceleration that which these things are
happening and the hotter it gets
it tends to be happening much much
quicker especially with the GPU loop
putting out nearly 1500 watts when
overclocked actually swore like 1300
watts in that cooling loop with the
overclocked tight nexus it can get
pretty damn hot when I start gaming and
playing other like or doing stress tests
on my system it's basically I don't play
a lot of games but I love to just
overclock and benchmark for the hell of
it most of it you guys don't even see
it's just a hobby of mine man can we get
25 extra megahertz out of these today
sort of thing so that's why the GPU loop
tends to be showing it's discoloration
much much faster now here's the thing
that really kind of confuses me when it
comes to this discoloration one I ran
Mayhem's pastel ever since doing my
initial system update with skunkworks
last year and I used the same sunset
yellow and it didn't change colors on me
it didn't change colors on me either
when I had the three seven 80s in the
loop but it started changing colors on
me when I had the nine 80s and now the
Titan exes so I don't really know what's
different now here's the thing I did
change the radiators and some folks have
been like well that's because you
changed radiators or you didn't do an
acid cleaning on there you didn't use
the Blitz cleaning kit and you've got
flux and bla bla bla bla bla because
people like to tell me what I did
they weren't even here but the reality
is the radiators I was using before this
were the alpha cool radiators which are
arguably one of the most dirty radiators
that you can get from the factory
requiring a lot of cleaning before you
use them they tend to do their soldering
and stuff and then just ship it and it's
up to you to actually do the acid
cleaning to get rid of most of the flux
that's inside those radiators however
these radiators are hardware labs
radiators these are the black ice
nemesis GTS radiators which are arguably
one of the most cleaning radiators on
the market and I think the thing that's
most frustrating about this is the fact
that I have cleaned these radiators now
four times four times the real question
is why does it keep happening it could
be anything really there could be tons
of things going on in there and here's
the bottom line
I don't have the time to figure it all
out so I'm kind of done dealing with the
pastel personally especially on a loop
like this it puts out ton of heat now
you might not have this problem if
you're running one GPU or even two and
especially if you've got you know a lot
of radiator space even though I've got a
560 rad in here as well as a 280 rad
giving me a ton of surface area for
cooling it still gets really hot because
like I said it's like 1300 watts of heat
dissipation that these radiators have to
handle so the loop gets really really
warm and it makes this room a hundred
degrees in no time if I simply turn on a
benchmark and leave the door closed and
don't have the air conditioner running
but anyway with that that means I've got
some future plans here that I want to do
with skunk work so here's the thing I I
feel like I've done a lot of skunk works
videos and I feel like I just beat the
subject into the ground I know those
people out there that are agreeing with
me right now like okay a skunk works
whoop-dee-doo we've seen it enough who
 cares well there's also a lot of
you out there who do care which is why
we're talking about this today and I
assume that if you do care you're still
here if you don't you probably didn't
click on this video anyway so who am I
talking to right now
so future plans every time this system
comes apart you guys know I try to
upgrade it to involve it in some way so
when it comes to storage I'm gonna try
to beef up the storage in here even
further I might go with a large M cut
end not to drive I'm not even sure but I
am going to change out the motherboard
because I want to try out some other
things there are some things out the
EVGA x99 classified board that I love
and there are some things that I really
don't like about it for instance the 90
degree connect
I'm not a fan of that especially in this
big ol case it still is a problem the
other thing is I just kind of want to
check out some other stuff so I'm gonna
be taking the x99 classified and moving
that over to my test bench with my 59 30
K and I'm gonna be putting the gigabyte
SOC champion x99 overclocking
motherboard in here which you guys know
is an orange and black fame now
obviously some of you have already
caught on like wait a minute you said
you were gonna do a green build because
of this cool issue but yeah I am going
to do an orange theme because I figure
if skunkworks wants to be orange so damn
bad I might as well just go ahead and
oblige now Green has been done a bit and
I think the green would look fantastic
in here but I want to try orange I think
the gunmetal black and orange would look
really really neat if done properly so
I'm gonna be putting in that motherboard
might have to rebid some tubes I'm
assuming the socket for the CPU is not
going to be in the exact same position
so we'll be playing around with that I'm
gonna upgrade the memory to corsair
dominator with the orange tops on there
so we're gonna be doing a memory upgrade
in this thing as well we are also going
to be doing orange transparent fluid I'm
also really tempted to put my fourth
Titan X in there simply because I can
but at the same time I don't want to add
more heat to that loop I've even been
thing about going the other way and take
you one of the Titans out I don't know I
really don't know what I'm gonna do
regarding that but I've got to get I'm
probably putting new fans in here all
together these Corsairs
in here a couple of them are making some
vibration due to some bearings I think
are starting to wear out I'm not really
even sure I don't want to repaint these
rings it's gonna be another project guys
I know a lot of you probably really
don't care but at the same time a lot of
folks do want to know about this system
and I've always said this system is a
bit of an evolution a that kind of you
know parallels the growth of the channel
as being a growth of this system so
we'll go from there now one other thing
I need to tackle a while I'm in here
which is going to actually add a bit of
time to this kind of a overhaul is the
fact that my GPU loop is getting hotter
and hotter when it comes to the
temperatures of the GPU core in fact
even though these things are
water-cooled while not overclocked and
these massive radiators I have actually
seen temperatures get up into the mid to
upper-60s C on the GPU temps that is way
too hot for water-cooled loop which is
making me think that I'm starting to get
some clogging going on
these blocks and now that could also be
because I do have soft tubing in the
basement of this which could have
leached some plasticizer and with the
superhot temperatures and the Nano fluid
and who knows what's happening with that
loop it could be starting to clog and
those micro channels so I'm gonna take
them apart I'm gonna clean them and then
we're gonna start all over I really need
a work area I don't I'm not looking
forward to doing that in this room I
need a garage I don't even have a garage
but anyway it's time to go you guys
notice the color change it was obviously
time that we had this discussion you
know it's like the birds and the bees of
PCs we got to talk about when things
start to change and and you start to
notice things and you start to feel
funny it was it was time to talk about
it I mean it was as awkward as this
conversation was it had to happen but
anyway I've obviously made up my
decision orange black and gunmetal
that's the colors I'm going with but I'm
curious though but overall what you guys
would have done if this were yours
no there's a strawpoll down in the
description of this video click it and
vote what you would have done remember
there's no right or wrong answer here
this is completely opinion here and even
though your opinion may different than
mine and yours may differ from the
comment down below yours it doesn't make
you or them wrong remember this is all
subjective and tastes so I'm just
curious what color you guys would have
gone with time to go guys thanks for
watching we will see you in the next
video which I have lots of things I
could do do you guys know that there's a
380 X coming out from AMD yeah I got one
of those on the way let's see I've also
got the sapphire r9 380 ITX
that's gonna be a neat I mean they kind
of took like what they did with the 285
and they did it with the 380 so that's
gonna be nice a nice little 380 I've got
to figure out something to do with that
we have also got that this guy right
here
the gigabytes extreme 980ti with a
radiator in there this is a product that
exactly exists because of well I would
like to think the suggestions I gave
them a year ago about where they went
wrong with the water force and what they
should have done unfortunately every
other brand on the market has come out
with their single 120 rad GP long before
gigabyte came out with theirs even
though they were technically one of the
first to try it with the water
course I wish they had done it faster
but we'll see how this thing performs
but anyway guys time to get out of here
we will see you in the next video and as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
