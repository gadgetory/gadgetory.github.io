you hear like lawnmowers and stuff in
the background you'll have to forgive me
apparently none the neighbors can get on
the same page you'd use the same
gardener on the same day everyone has
different gardeners on different days
and since is this gonna be sort of a
blog you're just gonna have to deal with
it because I am yes it has been two
years since I built project red mist and
that was one of the most badass
over-the-top unnecessary size
compensating builds I think I've ever
done and that's what made it glorious
and it's actually the build that led to
the inspiration for skunk works that's
why red mist and skunk works looks so
similar well it's been 2 years now and
the owners been chomping at the bit
since I believe last September to
actually get the system updated and
that's what we're going to start today
and yes it's going to be a series deal
with it
with its specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance-free plug-and-play
operation the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
now as you might imagine there are tons
and tons of little bits that are going
into this machine and all I am showing
here right now is just like you know the
the main component tree if you will if I
had all of the fittings and tubes and
stuff laid out here it would seriously
wouldn't have enough room anyway this is
the SMA 8 case you guys know I love case
labs this is actually the case that made
me fall in love with the SMA 8 and it's
what led to me getting one of my very
own but yeah we are reusing that case
including the custom acrylic bottom
piece that I made with the pass-through
fittings and all that stuff we'll talk
about these guys I get a lot of question
about these what are they and how do you
find them well we'll talk about that at
some point in this series now the
motherboard is an EVGA x99 classified
and yeah that's not new to the channel
it's a brand new and though it's not my
old one I still find it to be the
absolute most stable motherboard for the
x99 platform and I will always recommend
this motherboard to anyone looking for a
high-end stable x99 especially for a 59
60 X which is obviously what he has got
where is the focus oh my god that's far
away yeah so anyway 59 60 X I kind of
feel bad for him though because it seems
like every time he builds a machine
something new comes out like for
instance he dropped this off about a
week ago and guess what as rock spilled
the beans on yeah 10 core version sorry
bro he's got 32 gigs of the Dominator
platinum ddr4 going into this beast I
mean know what speed it is it doesn't
matter we'll find where it's table with
our overclock his heart main drive is
going to be he's adding a samsung 950
pro m2 Drive he doesn't want to go with
any sort of raid or something has to
worry about you know falling apart he's
just want something super fast and
obviously the 950 pro m2 is very fast
and he's also got it's already mounted
onto the back I'm just not gonna take it
off for the sake of the video it is a
three terabyte black drive now he's got
three 980ti s SC editions from EVGA that
are going in here we are going to be
obviously ripping off the coolers and
fully water cooling those with ek water
blocks and back plates
speaking of blocks ek supremacy Evo
block is what we're putting on the CPU
to keep it nice and cool and then we
have also got these these in the same
radiators I am which are the black ice
nemesis GTS rads 480 rad for the CPU
loop we are not doing a motherboard in
this loop only because there are no
blocks available for that and then 560
rad for the bottom and whereas I am
using a 282 also keep the third tight
next cool I didn't really change
temperatures too much so he's just going
with a single 560 and then keeping
everything powered we have got the
corsair ax 1500 i power supply now
because we are doing a red white and
black theme here i did happen to score
for him some black or some red Dominator
tops not black ones but red ones
everyone's like why don't you just paint
them well because I want them to say
Dominator on top and there it is
all right so you just saw me do two
things and I want to go ahead and kind
of address something that I know it's
gonna be a bit deja vu and we've talked
about it a million times in the past and
that being J why are you using airflow
fans on your radiator well it's a couple
reasons for that one
these are 140 millimeter fans on a five
sixty millimeter radiator so obviously
that means there are four 140 millimeter
fans when this was built two years ago
there were very very few options for
high static pressure 140 millimeter fans
and we wanted the fans to all match when
it came to the ring we went the corsair
fans quite honestly back then for
aesthetics
we lose a little bit of performance when
it comes to using high pressure on the
radiator so that kind of leads to the
next question is since we've fast
forward two years and there are now a
lot of static pressure options for 140
millimeter fans why aren't I using those
well quite honestly this is because of
the fact that these have performed very
very well not only for red mist but also
for skunkworks
it gets to the point to where the amount
of surface area of the radiator becomes
so big that the amount of static
pressure doesn't really matter quite as
much now no people are going to refute
that rebuked that whatever the right
word is they're gonna try and tell me
I'm full of but the bottom line is
performance numbers have always dictated
that the cooling that in the 560 red and
the fans that we're using at the speed
that we use them are fine now the
reality is there's not a lot of surface
area that these fans are having to
overcome and especially since we went
from a low fpi 45 millimeter thick
radiator down to a high fpi 30
millimeter thick radiator the hardware
labs nemesis radiators have a very
efficient fin design where it doesn't
take a lot of static pressure to push
air through there and I cannae Pig that
with skunkworks which is why he's
mimicking that here on this build
because it's proved it's been proven
that the performance is there even with
the airflow fans now the other thing you
saw was me putting on the red Dominator
tops here for the Corsair memory and one
thing I just kind of want to point out
with this is I put on two of them
backwards so that as you can see here
they face what you can kind of see they
face the opposite direction and the
reason for that is since this
is going into an X 99 board and there is
memory on either side of the CPU and one
side is upside down compared to the
other we want all the logos to face the
same direction so you just put those on
backwards now if you're doing something
like a mainstream motherboard which
doesn't have quad channel then you could
just put them on you know normal and
then they'll face the right way
regardless now we are gonna be doing
glass tubing in this build and that was
my suggestion he didn't want to do it
after I did glass in the build which you
can see right there not my Starbucks cup
the fractal design nano s build ever
since I did that I love glass and I will
be putting glass in skunkworks
in fact I'm gonna be changing the fluid
and skunk works again we'll talk about
that in another video about why I'm
gonna do that but again it's all for the
sake of science so we are going to be
doing a PE TG build in this and then
using those tubes for the proper links
of getting all the glass cut we've got a
lot of glass I've got like 30 sticks of
glass now just to make sure I have more
than enough for all these builds that I
want to do
all right so what I'm about to do here
is just so full of blasphemy it's not
even funny but it needs to be done so
because you want to test all hardware
whenever you're dealing with new parts
you want to do a like a boot test to
make sure everything works graphics card
memory motherboard CPU power supply all
that stuff so this is all the new
components here this is one of the 980
is the 59 60 X is in there all four
sticks of memory are in here and the ax
1500 I but because I don't have like a
quick cooler that I can mount down on
here I've only got these big behemoths
that you have to assemble I took an old
AMD brick right here now literally
without Eve it doesn't even have thermal
paste on there do as I say not as I do
don't do this mount it down properly I'm
literally gonna do a boot test with this
push down like this holding my hand on
there so it makes good contact just long
enough to see if we get an image and a
post so with that said the cool thing on
here is this motherboard has a cue code
readout so I can actually see what it's
doing so it's scanning memory now that
past's okay it's checking peripherals b2
alright so we're stuck on d7 but we have
right here it took us right into the
BIOS so the memory is or the PC is
slowly getting hotter and hotter it's at
50 C right now so go ahead and turn that
off
but everything worked worked just long
enough which is all I wanted
alright I'm done for today I know it
doesn't seem like I got a lot done but I
really got more than enough done to get
a good head start on this project we
tested all the hardware make sure make
sure it works we've apparently cut my
finger right there don't even know how I
did that
ow isn't it funny how you can get cut
and not realize it and not feel any pain
until you see it and then suddenly your
brain is like oh my god I'm cut I'm
dying I wanted to get the graphics card
blocks installed today but that didn't
happen actually run out of time god we
got to go get little Jake from school I
got Jim she got Taekwondo and all that
stuff but anyway the motherboard is
installed the block is in there the RAM
is swapped over with the new tops we got
the new radiators in there let's see
what else did we do oh the MDOT to drive
is in there of course that's not very
hard install it's literally one screw
but I've basically done some planning
and planning is the part that always
takes the longest with these builds now
as I said it is gonna be glass so we are
gonna be doing PE TG first and then
glass it's kind of a waste of PE TG but
I'd rather waste that than the glass
trust me but yeah that's pretty much it
the next time around we'll start getting
some of the loop together we'll get the
graphics cards blocks put on and then
it's really not gonna take that long to
put this build together it's a lot more
red in here now the original parts that
he had I realized I forgot to mention
what he's upgrading from he had to 780ti
is in here as e87 maximus motherboard as
well as a 4770k and 16 gigabytes of
dominant corsair dominator ddr3 so it's
a pretty good step up for him again it
kind of sucks considering the new stuffs
gonna be out fairly soon but whatever
now I can hear a lot of you guys already
saying like this build is so expensive
it's so unnecessary blah blah blah yeah
there's a lot of things that are
unnecessary but then again that's part
of what makes this an enthusiast build
and makes it so much fun and like I said
before he's a paramedic he works long
hours for shitty pay and he's saved for
a year to do this build it's his money
not yours
so he can do whatever he wants anyway
guys time to get out of here thanks for
watching wait for part 2 probably next
week and as always thanks for watching
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
