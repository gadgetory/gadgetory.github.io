to make we haven't quite left yet
because with one more video we had to
make before we left about a thing that's
being shown at CES because we've got our
hands on it early which is always nice
we are of course talking about NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx yeah it's nothing new right
how about Nvidia's apology letter the
affordable 2060 that actually has all
the features of the cards below at this
4500 dollars worth of graphics cards
right here I'll cram them in this little
bag this is faster than all of these I'm
serious
EVGA offers a full range of components
including video cards motherboards power
supplies cases and peripherals
regardless of your needs EVGA sure to
have you covered to see what EVGA can do
for your next build head to EVGA comm so
let me go ahead and set aside this brick
of graphics cards which literally cost
more than its weight in gold of course
we are talking about the 20 80 the 20 80
TI and the Titan r-tx well the t-rex as
they like to call it because I guess it
has little arms I don't know be 2060 a
card that man was are a lot of rumors
and he isn't even as of a couple of days
ago the written articles that are out
there showing off all the leaks are
wrong and I feel like Nvidia really kind
of pulled out all the stops with this
card proving that the RT x-series at the
top could have been a heck of a lot
cheaper which is of course what people
were super mad about they were mad about
the launch prices rightfully so the 2080
the card that only matches the 1080 TI
in performance $800 MSRP b20 ATT I don't
you get me started on this guy $1200
founders Edition price $1000 MSRP yeah
try finding one per gram and then of
course the non-gaming card built on the
exact same architecture that their
gaming card is 2499 dollars a good poor
man's GV 100-ish kind of a card you can
see as the cards were kind of coming out
they were sort of working their way up
the ladder which people were looking at
going well yeah well that's sucks so
they just ran out and bought all the
Pascal cards and now trying to find a
Pascal card it's hard which left people
out going crap now to what do I own pay
this kind of money the RT X 2060 costs
three hundred and forty nine dollars now
let me tell you why that's exciting
right after we show you the benchmarks
yeah
do you see why $349 is exciting because
we showed you directly compared to a gtx
1070 TI at $100 less it's beating it and
pretty much every test we threw it no we
didn't we don't have the biggest testing
suite of games we're gonna add to it
trust me I really want to but a lot of
games on built-in benchmarks and it's
hard to get a consistent real time
gaming experience you know to do
benchmarking back but that's okay we'll
figure out a way and we'll do it the
reason why we chose a 1070 TI was cuz
when I had a discussion with their
marketing manager or the technical
marketing guy and I said hey what is
this card aimed at replacing sure it's a
60 series card but you already know 60
series between one gen and the next gen
is not directly comparative they're
always comparing it to the previous tier
higher right so we've got that weird
stopgap card the gtx 1070 TI that AI
bees weren't allowed to overclock
because it would be faster than a 1080
but it was there just to compete with
the vega series at the same price point
four hundred and forty nine dollars and
as you saw this card was beating that
card for $100 less also to the founders
edition has no markup it is $349 MSRP
including founders so there's none of
that bullshit to deal with it also has a
cut-down T 106 I say cut down they call
it modified it's a cut-down 2070 core
but it's a tu 106
it's got DL SS it's got you know tensor
cores it's got RT cores it's got all of
the AI functionality that we have in its
bigger brothers and actually at a usable
sizing we'll call it our concern was as
we went down the stack with our TX with
the one title we can test it with a time
of recording this video that being
battlefield 5 which still D LSS has not
launched yet we we just have one title
to compare with which unfortunately
doesn't paint the biggest picture and
it's not the most optimized once we saw
the latest build of battlefield 5 things
increased dramatically to where you
actually were able to play 1440p with RT
x on and get more than 60 FPS at you
know with the 20 80 TI but what does
that mean for the low-end cards well in
video saying that you can get 68 FPS in
1080
with DXR medium on and up 290 FPS once d
LSS is turned on the reason why I'm
mentioning it not showing it to you
which we will do kind of a quick demo is
because again the DL SS build is not
available yet for us to test and the
only auto title that has DL SS is final
fantasy and that's just a synthetic
benchmark so I'd love to see the way it
actually plays in games but the fact
that it has all of the features of RT X
at this price point means that
unfortunately if you were one of those
people who ran out when RT X was
launched and it looked like the price
and scale was just sliding all the way
up and said I'm gonna buy a Pascale card
and you bought a 1070 TI or a 1080 it
means that you paid more than you did
for this card to have less
forward-facing future-proofing we'll
just use that words went to the hate it
without DL SS without RT cores and all
that stuff that's gonna be utilized by
developers as we move forward $100 less
card giving you better performance in
the card the cost hundred ollars more
that's how it works kind of less Morial
science but feels bad though if you ran
out and got a 1070 TI when you could
have gotten this one month later now
look when you compare it to the 1060
which NVIDIA likes to do when you like
to compare it to the older generation
because the numbers would look so much
better on paper 1920 CUDA cores in this
guy versus 1280 found in the GTX 1060
and by 1060 of course I'm talking about
the 6 gig full-sized 1060 not the
slightly cut-down CUDA core and three
gig version that bastard child that
should have never existed a 1050 Ti
we're gonna call it this it's got 1920
cuda cores versus 1280 it's got 30 SMS
versus 10 and then 1060 it's still six
gigs of gbbr six versus gddr5 in the
1060 it's cut 5 gig array performance
versus the 0.44 if I know the 1060
that's not a fair comparison that's
that's just Nvidia phone in one in
that's like saying special news alert
special hardware is special right I mean
it's you can't really compare those
numbers that means nothing that's
besides the point
the card is everything RT X should have
been it's better it's faster it's cooler
the hottest I could get this was 68
degrees it overclocks like a mother I
got the seen almost 2200 megahertz
pushing it just past where the RT X 20
is at its factory clock putting it way
faster than the GTX 1080 and all I did
was a load up after burn and moved the
sliders a little bit hit go and run and
it did it it took it and yeah so this is
what our TX should have been they could
have done all this with the higher end
cards kept the price the same and then
then what with the news articles have
said amazing performance for same price
Nvidia is the best company ever no
instead what they got was hell hell man
what the hell was a collective what the
hell heard around the world which is why
I think Nova's got 20 70s that's ok but
before we get out of here of course we
have to do our live testing of
battlefield 5 wiping up the pipe as I
said it's the only title we have come on
developers get with it would you I know
Nvidia sending people over to your
studios to help you guys get ready for
it what are you waiting for stop milking
that teat from Nvidia and actually put
out a damn game that we can play besides
battlefield Jesus Christ all right let's
just play the game
so battlefield 5 here are the settings
that we've got going right now we're in
1080p 60 Hertz
of course FPS is not locked because we
want to see if the max FPS is we are in
DX 12 but d XR is disabled I want to
show you right now what just the raw
rasterization performance is like and so
I saw someone asked once what are
youtubers took when they played games
through these demos and stuff because
we're not on our normal configs we're
not in a normal layout loadouts this
isn't even like my main account I play
on this is a test account we use it's
just normally I'm not playing like this
with the monitor turned sideways on a
wood platform I play good and you know
it Phil okay so $350 card and 1080p
Ultra getting us over 100 FPS so
considering the fact that I saw back
there 1440 is coming up quickly becoming
the new 1080 while how could a FPS it
didn't come down that much 80 whoa yeah
so yeah I mean eighty eight eighty two
Phil this is playable right eighty eight
FPS 1440p ultra all right we got to go
ahead and load up some DXR yeah okay so
we have to go down from 1440 even in
Nvidia zone reviewers guide they were
like 1080 60 is kind of the mark there
so 1440 60 big bad
the market like the 20 atti at this
point but as soon as I hit 1080 we look
at 5856 now we are in DX our ultra I
think right now yes we are we don't want
ultra we don't want that we want
I think medium is where we found to be a
good sweet spot because of the fact that
you don't really notice that much of a
difference well you know they said 68
FPS oh here we go reflection time
I saw the reflection their little chart
showed 68 FPS I'm seeing 77 and look at
that the core is actually hitting 99
percent okay that guy now out 300 $50
card give me all this performance
real-time rate racing I mean that
whether you're a nerd for the tech or
not that seems nearly unheard of I know
Phil and I have been super fanboying
behind the scenes on rate racing what it
looks like and 3m $50 card give me a
favor if you want those people that just
buy two gtx 1070 TI would you return it
today to get one of these I think you
should if you can but I digress guys
thanks for watching a like I said CES is
coming up Coursera is sponsoring our
coverage here so huge thinking of course
