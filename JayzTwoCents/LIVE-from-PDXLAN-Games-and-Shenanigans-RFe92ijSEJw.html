yeah this is real life right now oh geez
I forgot to change the thumbnail so it's
just says real live at PDX land and it's
a giant image of the 1080 TI whoops it
copied the thumbnail of like the last
time I went live using lot youtubes like
instant stream features this is an event
so anyway what's up guys jst sensei me
pop the chat out so if I'm using a
secondary laptop to monitor the chat so
bear with me here
we pop that out yeah so that that
thumbnail that was actually not intended
to be so my bad or whatever it's a cool
looking graphics cards we can go with it
right we're gonna take a couple minutes
here and let people kind of trickle in I
am live here in Portland at PDX land and
as you guys can see if I turn the camera
around they kind of put it in the back
they put us back it's in the back
you know dreamhack but there is a there
is a lot of us here and we've got two
10-gig the networks brought in through
Xfinity and then of course the sponsors
for this entire event for us anyway cuz
I am here with fractal Josh and Nick is
also here you guys can see them they're
skunkworks we brought skunkworks with us
there's Josh and Nick josh Polk Nick and
tell them to wave so there's Nick oh
they're and they are of course playing
on the systems that we built in our
build challenge so it's gonna be a low
quality stream in terms of it just being
webcam and stuff this is me actually
playing games for once so I would
appreciate it if you guys would
appreciate the low quality that's what
we need we need to appreciate the low
quality I'm trying to see if I can't
change that thumbnail nope I can
whatever thumbnail is what it is
let's see chat is popped out right
see so we have a few games on the docket
we have so we're gonna start with
insurgency only cuz it's I've never
really played it I'm pretty derpy at it
I'm really bad because when those games
are like you can't just go running in
and be all Rambo like you kind of have
to go serve our monsters here to keep us
going you have to sort of like plan out
your attacks and work together
the AI is actually I hear fairly
difficult to overcome so you have to be
smart about it and that's not me that's
not the way I operate I like to operate
in shooters like I operate life and
lovemaking I like to just kind of Ram it
ran in there run in there and just get
her done and get out so yeah oh also two
donations please dont donate there's no
reason to donate for this we are sponsor
of this event of course fractal design
has sponsored Hardware for this as well
as in the monetary offsets for us to get
out here three of us in a road trip in a
car for four days total
speaking of car Hertz has graciously
donated our accommodations so they have
provided us with our 2017 Lincoln
Navigator 3.5 liter EcoBoost twin-turbo
v6 and also our hotels so oh and then
EVGA of course a sponsored the
motherboards and graphics cards that we
are using in all three systems so what
the exception of my tight nexus I I got
those direct but that's a guys time to
play some game so I'm gonna go and flip
on over here and if it's noisy well
we're at a LAN party so is what it is
Josh and going turn on your mic now if
you'd like and we are also in discord so
we'll be below a sexy job josh is also
live-streaming are you liking right now
I'm surprised skunk works as it yeah we
have like six systems running off of one
daisy chained power extension cord you
guys can check out
Josh's stream though if you feel like it
he is gonna be on Twitch whereas I am of
course on YouTube so he is gonna be
twitch TVs Ford / fractal Josh
credits me I'll be trying to pay
attention to chat but it's gonna be on
my phone so yeah remember guys first and
foremost we're here to play some games
but we want to share with you guys so
please bear with us in terms of being
slow
Jake Paxton says what's up Jay hey
what's up with you
sardines with crackers and pus there's a
lot of discussion Josh about me being a
pussy and I'm okay with that cuz I own
it I can't need him yeah that's kind of
the thing you know we we didn't see
on-screen was that inside the truck stop
we had a bit of a discussion choice a
and J was rather adverse to it what I
asked bombs let us know you saw leave
and walk towards the car in the video
like that was his reaction inside but
you know he tried it until you open well
okay so the way I went down was he was
like well no it doesn't mean you're
gonna be the one who has to eat them
right there's a chance that you may not
be picked you know you may not lose
first I'm gonna rock I stole I was like
no you know the way it's gonna go down
because I am so adverse to eating this
release raw fish you know that the
universe is going to force this upon me
and he was like no you don't know that
you don't know that well as exactly the
way I went down that's why I was like I
told you I told you that's how this was
gonna go
they also corrected me the little fishes
that I was like thinking of were
anchovies oh you shouldn't get that
brand this other brand is like really
really good it's like but that was the
whole thing
the challenge was let's find the
crappiest food that we can
well apparently mustard is a good thing
to eat with them but I didn't even
realize the can said soybean oil until I
was editing it yeah the funny thing is
when J was editing it his aversion to
seafood was hitting him again he's like
stain on J's pants was cuz when he was
bending over retching he threw a piece
at me yeah he threw a piece of the fish
at me and when it hit me it bounced off
my leg it like smeared on my leg and
then it fell apart on the ground like
the spine fell out and it was just it
like exploded and that's why I was like
gagging even more you hit and then it
smelled like fish in the
yeah it was it was bad like no matter
what we did it was just bad something
smells fishy is what Krispy Kreme
McDonald's J please help why's my GPO no
tech questions guys where this is gaming
stream and even says gaming run anything
so sorry Jerry eat your damn sardines no
I wouldn't even eat know what they were
cooked I didn't realize you were that
averse to to any form of seafood but man
it was it was pretty strong I'll put it
that way
I mean there was no acting involved I
didn't have to act that was totally
genuine I still think that on the way
back we should do the Russian Roulette
and we hide a sardine in one of them
whoa we weren't even thing about because
you could possibly see the sardine right
because it would be like a dark spot
well what we were actually saying was
like the juice like you pour out the
sardine juice into a Slurpee and no no I
even offered to drink it right I was
like can I drink it but then you started
throwing pieces of it at me and stuff
and yeah you know Nick Nick Nick was
against it as much as I was but the
motivation for Nick to show me up on my
own channel was greater than his
adversity to the sardine which is why he
ate it twice well and I did see a couple
people commenting about I've never seen
Jay cop out so badge it was owned by a
can of fish yes you know and we caught
we talked about this in the car right
everyone has their weakness and that's
mine that's mine and it was it was kind
of funny for Nick to be like I've never
seen Jay have such a moment of weakness
oh yeah Jay was just there there was no
acting there at all that was just Jay
that was totally just jailing the worst
thing was the way it would run CH didn't
do oh stop
I know it's like the limit you said like
when we pulled it out yeah that is his
reaction
it's here you anymore not even hear you
anymore are you live now yeah yeah I'm a
little bit a little bit dirty but if it
won't get you a game I'm just running
window a windowed mode and then I'm
doing window capture and it's working
fine
okay I'm gonna relaunch insurgency now
and a real quick bit about you were
saying about insurgency so people that
don't know it's been around for a long
time you can usually give it for less
than ten bucks on Steam and it tends to
be a more realistic game the main points
mean there's no hitmarkers there's no
arcade style points and also there's no
mag pooling so if Jay fires off 15
rounds out of a thirty round mag and
then does a tactical reload that 15
round mag is gonna come back and that
goes against everything that I am like
used to I'm used to like firing off four
rounds and capping off a mag so I'm
gonna be screwed on that also too it's
basically like playing it's sort of like
playing in my opinion a crossover of a
close quarters battle field and csgo on
hardcore mode yeah the thing that like
when I play Rainbow six siege for
example I'll do the same thing fire
three rounds boom cap reload and in this
game you don't want to do that you'd
also don't want to yo lo I was streaming
a couple weeks ago and a kid popped in
to play with us
he's got a 360 noscope and let me know
how that goes for you oh yeah is that do
you get to control AI difficulty is it
always just as realistic as it can be no
you can control it you can do
there's brutal bots where they're
wearing armor and the AI is a lot more
difficult I always play just PvE you
know I don't tend to go for like full
multiplayer because I don't want to get
owned by some thirteen year old
talking trash to me in Russian right Oh
some Russians something I also have to
point out to here I totally free I'm
such a bad such a bad host got to call
out a sponsor oops our panels were
actually supplied by Acer these are on
these were these were loan to us here we
are running Acer predators with a xB
ones 1440p 144 Hertz refresh rate g-sync
the whole spiel you know I haven't
played on the sixteen by nine panel in
quite a while
I've been running ultra wide 20 1 by 9
for a while but this is this 27-inch is
actually a very good format
I'm happy with this I could run this
daily and I should be fine with it but
it's high refresh rate which is all I
cared about because once you go high
refresh rate right Josh you can't go
back the other way yeah I was able to go
back to monochrome you know kick it old
school for a while but it's so hard to
find flat panel versions of that
monochrome yeah like a white CRT a black
injury yeah you know or take it back to
my you know my work on trail routes
since we are an organist there's a lot
of things that are like labeled Oregon
Trail at the Oregon Trail burger you
know the Oregon Trail smoothie it's like
wow guys it's quite possible you could
hear a slight echo Josh's right there
like two seats over so my mic might pick
them up slightly but is what's been
playing games so it's not gonna be like
a lot of that we're just waiting on Nick
honestly we're just killing time until
Nick comes back do we know where he is
or what he's doing I I don't know I
think he well you gave him that burger
oh well maybe that's him you should
explain that so yeah Kevlar condoms here
Gerry's here they're on the opposite end
of the building ironically so grams of
all our medias here Houston computer
systems here and they got like these
burgers I know what they're from but
they're basically a hamburger that's
made with the bun is a it's made out of
donuts and so they brought it and gave
me was like oh there's no way I can eat
that right we've already eaten so poorly
on this trip I'm already like off the
charts and level of guilt but there's no
way I could eat that and so I just asked
Nick do you wanna he's like well it
might kill me I was like I'm okay with
that so I handed it to him he ate it and
we haven't seen him since we think he
might be in the bathroom yeah I think he
might be dead that might be immoral you
know if he did then well there's more
room on the way back he is talking to
Jerry jeez come on Nicky oh yeah I see
it I see him standing there talking to
Jerry
yeah I'll try texting OBS hates me it's
not capturing the game I'm gonna help
you over there you need some tech
support no no I'm good I might just am I
just so talk amongst yourselves I'll
give you a topic why I suck at tech what
you work for fractal design that's why
so the sponsorship has been rescinded
too late Marty here I can fly home I'll
ship the system sure it's all good we
should have done that I mean if we're
clear we're thinking about doing stuff
as far as the easiest way to do it
that's what we have done but you know
what I can't I've seen too many horror
stories and what happens we will ship
big heavy systems like this and they
show up just smashed I work for FedEx
for a cut for a few years as a FedEx
driver I know what they go through
there's no way I can in good conscience
ship a system like this somewhere I
would have to go it have to be pallet it
and go on like a less than truckload
you know trailer yeah it's just I mean
the thing is you can insure it up to the
hill if you want to but it's not really
gonna matter yeah at the end of the day
it's just gonna get to what PSU is
skunkworks had it used to run a 1600
watt EVGA supernova but when I went
three-way was sort of abandoned by EVGA
in game or by Nvidia and games I reduce
it down to a 1200 watt and I've been
running 1200 ever since with two
titannics
PS or X's not the XP big peanut little P
not to be confused with the new
collector's edition which worth they all
because of how expensive they were yeah
there's a good next one's gonna be tight
knit speak dragger edition humble brag
humble brag 10x B would just throw away
your money didn't you see one like on
the eBay for like 4,700 okay so we we
had a conversation about this in the car
obviously we had a lot of conversation
we talked to each other a couple of
times but when we were in a car ride on
the way up here that was when the email
came in with the teaser Lincoln and I
screen kept the
titin collector's edition and I was like
wait a minute
they've sort of done this before right
with the Titans E or the Titans ed which
was the dual GPU Titan card and I was
kind of curious Michael wait a minute
that didn't really sell for long it was
$3,000 when it was new there were low
quantity made me wonder what they're
going for today there there is a base
seller selling them for four thousand
seven hundred and fifty bucks so who in
their right mind would pay that in why I
think they're treating it like it's
already some sort of a collector's card
and why someone would pay that level of
premium for it yeah there's somebody out
there bred things are getting a deal
with that like oh it's gonna be
collector's edition item you know I
think it's very difficult still look at
tech is anything like a true collector's
edition from like increasing in value I
mean except for maybe RAM or video card
you bought you know yeah other than that
I think it's still too new to really
fall into like that this is an
investment yeah speaking of graphics
cards and things guys make sure you tune
in to tomorrow's video be very important
to me if you guys watch it and toss the
like if you enjoy it it's something I've
never really done before I hosted
kingpin in my studio he flew in from
Taiwan we did some ln2 overclocking
stuff talking about Ellen to what it's
like cuz I've I've seen this stuff that
like trade shows I've seen it at CES and
Computex
there's always guys doing Ellen -
something like that's not for me and I
don't know I don't know anybody I
probably burn my hands blah blah blah
and so the whole point was like to come
and educate me and then see if I could
potentially get on the leader board for
the hell of it right not only did we end
up doing a really fun video it's about
25 minutes long 20 minutes long
somewhere around there we broke the
world record on single card time spy
extreme and then we broke it four more
times so it's a it's a fun it's a fun
video for me he left me the stuff as
well as a kingpin card for me to start
messing around with it more on my own
and I can't we'll see what can happen so
yeah it's a lot of fun
I'm I texted Nick saying come on I can
see him as a come on get over here and
he's not
alright I'm gonna go grab him okay so
guys I'm gonna put this on a FK mode
here real quick and I will see you in
just a moment
you
you
you
you
all right I got him I already had him I
already had him yeah got him buddy heck
gonna go ahead and start my stream up
again so today I got towards Nick help
would having a nice day you keep that up
sweetheart you can call me anything you
want Nick can you say something on
screaming oh my god
is discord crashed no look at this
screen that's like weird it's got like
headshots of us what is that oh it's
somehow like because it smashed up I
think it's cuz you tagged or something
hold on I gotta say it does look rather
glorious but I tagged him they had it
holy crap haha we're a winning game all
right we're back yes I'm in the game I'm
you guys are gonna have to guide me
through this I don't even know how to
start this run as fast as you can
no I mean like how to even start like
you guys gonna invite me to something is
how this works yeah are you friended
with me on Steam why she don't think I
am I think I think you are deserve a V
in it v as in Victor yes okay
let me invite my little let's hear are
you in the game right now I'm in the
game right now if I can't invite you
didn't then they can't okay
is there an acquire steam overlay or
what about B I don't know
the unfriend of them yes right-click on
the name and kajori through the venue
and get a hold on I'm already in your
party
I know but didn't bite him oh I think
you have to show up as online oh yeah
that's right I stayed signed off all
right fair warning if you guys if I'm on
your steam friends list and you guys
start messaging me and stuff it's insta
blocks so don't do that while I'm
streaming I really need it I really need
to thin out this list I really do said a
minute but calling I got it I mean oh
that's you I almost bet I almost removed
you for my list so many times not
knowing who that was don't you feel
stupid
I know right I like how you're like I'm
not gonna show I don't want to say your
names but they can see it on my stream
oh I really like to cater to the viewers
I think that people can't see you are
actually blessed hey so what we'll do
we're gonna go into coop
we're gonna play I guess if you want to
put a message out to everybody in your
check yes we're gonna play PvE we're not
going to leave complaining you know PvP
so why is I say I'm on co-op PvP like
under my name it says coop PvP Junior
like like you see the avatar on the left
oh look so right here it says co-op PvP
yeah don't worry about that okay um
let's see here let's pick a random one
that has at least three people some some
pro true the sub oaks on the chatter
really loving NYX my little homie
nickname
[Laughter]
okay we're gonna hop into an empty one
odds are randos will probably join with
us but this way we don't hop into you
know service it's just like a bye menu
or do you expect out a config you spec
it out okay but it's a bit is a buy menu
though with points I say so do you earn
points by how much you die because if so
I'm gonna be rich loaded so there's
different things you can do it different
servers love different point allotments
there's also like a weight allotment
right what you'll also have to is like
if you're playing Survival the more
people you kill the more points you get
gotcha considering I just fired up my
first game at 3 o'clock I don't think
I'm gonna stop to leave to go alright
teams do I team selection what do I do
here oh we're already on the same team
right I don't know what happened all I
see is this it's probably loading Thomas
the Tank Engine left though well I was
on another menu thing you're mine I
broke it I broke it guys I'm sorry thank
you in a problem all I did was click go
and then them now I'm looking at shows
you in here okay let's return to the
menu okay everybody exit out tonight oh
it doesn't show that you're here though
yes Joshy doesn't show that you're in
here no problem exit out to main menu
yeah you got it that's the only way you
get MVP right we won
did we win yeah we won we won okay now
follow along everybody it should load
you in there automatically will take a
little bit to lit up the maps that is
really crazy that the game itself is
showing us at the top give us some codes
to give away so and I let them know we
were playing oh okay I get it now I
thought that like auto-generated I was
like how the hell that they just had
they use my profile pic I'm seducing all
these players and doing certain Z's what
I'm doing Jay is licensed on steroids
I know maybe hey what's up guys scarce
here they sent your growth you always
made me snort my monster I tried okay so
here's what we're gonna play one of
their official servers we're gonna play
survival okay that's where we're all
gonna start with pistols the more guys
you kill the more points you get it's
sort of like gun game then but it's like
a like a waves yeah and this is just one
way of doing it so okay em isn't marry
so did you get your config screen this
is where you pick and pick up the top
like specialist Scout whatever we're up
there see the blue things okay pick one
of the open ones oh I see you click that
it's gonna let you configure but there's
nothing you can really add right now so
I'll go bomber what could go wrong with
me and a bomb this world war two game
whatever World War two rifle I have an
old bolt-action rifle this can't go well
you've already got someone did John wick
just hop in yeah we're good to go there
Dan carry on I'm like who is Terrace
John wick some random okay now like I
said there's no crosshairs there's no
this we're gonna head towards like you
see Dean F we're gonna go over there
I followed John wick because that seemed
like the safer bet is Artie is there a
friendly fire yes okay oh my god how do
you slide I saw what John macdui like
slides troll when you're running oh I
see
John what just left me behind is their
stamina involved in this not directly
but you'll see you still start to pan
down a little bit that's a bad guy get
him
there's no crosshairs on okay neato this
old gun here let's see here that counted
you got a kill
oh I killed him Oh oh god there's a lot
of em over there I hit windows button
hold on wow oh wow I think I did all
right for the first time this is a
different style I like this now though
normally when you play it the
checkpoints so if you die you don't
spawn in until your your team captures
our checkpoint so if you have points hit
em right now you can spend them what's
up with dudes eyes oh my god his eyes
are like freaking out on that model you
can also pick up in any weapons if you
shoot a guy hit after oh but you only
have you only have the magnets in there
well makes sense some of these guys are
like rubber bands ah I think I was
friendly expired
I think somebody killed me like friendly
fired
oh is this SCS clone no it's quite
different than CS it's built off a
source hub G is infested with whiny kids
a lot of you any triple-a title is I
just flashbang now you're not really
intended to survive this are you its
wave after wave you can only get so far
I mean then they start getting more
aggressive does your weapons and it goes
up against eight guys will we play pub G
I don't think we're gonna play pub G
maybe but maybe not so we can play try
another round of this and if you want we
can hop out we'll just end this train
those game go home and then we can go
under like a more traditional like a
checkpoint style or something like that
where you can spec out before we leave
I got arrested they're staring at each
other I only have one point and the
thing is sometimes you think you knock a
guy down and he just went rolling sort
of shooting oh no at the flashbang nice
being my bad dude I'm confirming that
he's dead
how do I know if I killed somebody if
you hold down tab it'll keep your KD
count knowing they'll show you where
you're wrong but that's just it there's
no guarantee that's what makes it hard
we're special you're sniping people kill
the Murphy just
alpha echo in my chat says you were like
a terrorist uh-huh van all nights wait a
minute they kicked us at the box cutter
next I'm out of bullets
oh can I get in this
can I get in that APC I'm gonna I'm
gonna die just trying to get it open
area I know there's a pretty weak smoke
bomb they're using didn't go off at all
it's like
spectating on che don't do that how do I
get more got him run back to him he did
but after reload Oh Oh God
how do you how do you do knife oh my god
help me
resisting the urge like reload after
every two rounds it's tough
well what'd you run into is the dead
man's click you run into a room you
react somebody ah me a gun where's this
gun
oh he's behind me i flashbang my corpse
someone said this is like watching your
parents play Nintendo for the first time
it's true I accept that that's true
I've never claimed to be a good gamer
have I dad you don't have to jump in
real life to jump in the game oh right
that's so bright when that happens oh my
God look at my street where the flash
ping goes off it's like a solar flare if
my face I was gonna be a three only cuz
I played it a lot but I was only good
I like how she's in your chat but not
like she doesn't go to the YouTube stuff
so I don't know if she's watching my
stream at all no I'm just like trying to
wait for my vision come back you can't
grab any of this animal on the ground
with hell no you can reload there though
basically we're doing a public service
showing people how not to play the game
watch what I'm about to do do not I
think there's a certain amount of people
that would agree there's a there's an
entertaining element to watching really
good players and there's also an
entertaining element to watching the
really bad players
oh you can't jump off the roof well I
was trying to go after the the machine
gun that was on the ground but you can't
do that if you do that you died
good to know that yeah
don't jump up damn Nick oh god I need
sunglasses to play this game you would
be neat Josh what if they had a thing
like a module that you hooked up
lighting so that what a flashbang goes
off it's like you get some of my studio
lights in your face
these are predatory ones they have some
they have some interactive stuff too on
some games where it can like hook up to
heaters and red lights and stuff -
really it like explosions and things but
I think it'd be neat if you had like a
lighting setup so that when you're
shooting is like pops of light in your
face but then also like a flashbang goes
off and it's just like like those
spotlights come off and you get a Sun
sunburn stream like else are we good I
said I was watching I'm watching my
preview I'll be here on my laptop and
every time a flashbang went off
I was whited out like a ghost I was a
white silhouette yeah well you know to
keep it real okay now we're gonna do
checkpoint checkpoints where you get to
pick out your loadout before you start
we're probably to join a game in
progress we might have to wait for them
to finish but that would give you time
to spec out spend your points on
different things you can change the
primaries HP ammo is basically hollow
point a PMO is armor-piercing are you
sure about that
Jay why you don't eat the sardine oh I
think I think my wife finally watched
the stream because she just her the
video she just texted me and all she
said his sardines that's all she said
sardines I'm gonna kill you in real life
just so you know it's really it's about
what the November events the smaller one
I need to turn down the volume
there's like what 250 ish people here on
this one maybe 300 there's 500 here
I thought 500 was like July in February
500 it does seem fairly full yeah we can
we playing it's insurgency because I'm
doing this on youtube I can't like
change the title midstream like you can
on twitch but we're playing insurgency
and we might just do some random like
left 4 dead 2 if you think I'm dirty on
this Josh don't expect me to be very
helpful on that for dead well good as
long as we are on the same page then if
you need to the X key oh so this is not
hold aim down sights it's click okay oh
god an RPG what's prone oszi okay see
which is pretty typical I just wasted
like a whole mag dammit that's gonna
kill me the whole like reload thing well
when I first started playing this game I
never worried about like fully
completing a mag before delivery because
I never lived long enough to go through
all my bags I have a Molotov cocktail
I'm throwing it in my bad light
yeah you guys enjoy that I'm gonna go
around hopefully not catchable it says
laying down some covering fire is he not
think there's someone in that building
right there I was right there is someone
in that building oh yeah I almost shot
Nick in the butt sorry right yeah Nick
sorry I did almost shoot you in the butt
oh damn it
I keep wasting my mags stupid habits is
there leaning oh there is leaning Luis
yeah so dang that was like Black Hawk
Down oh god they're rough they're
rushing not feeling too good about this
since it is real they said bad words no
shit
and this crazy thing all the Indian
voices you hear in this game are done by
one guy
really yeah where's the tears mortar
because mortar coming in think I killed
a guy I think I killed a guy I'm happy
yeah I killed one guy whoo-hoo J
Skyliner Supra whoo that's a hard one
Nick skyliner Supra skyline which
skyline all right Eddie boy okay so it's
our thirty or if it's our 32 or 33
versus super at like a mark mark 3 or
mark or super mark 4 super I met you
doing my first date breath I think so
okay just to Jay
recoil is real in this game I'm done yet
I caught a lady down that's where you
can like
sound effects on this game are pretty
cool too though oh god chase gunner
what could go wrong I'm okay I don't
want to play battlefield Scoob at a
field the guns
I'm specking on Josh I'll leave them we
had to call that surprise buttsex
you're hilarious J no I'm not what I
need to like be better with my rifle
though I need a I need a muzzle brake
and I need better optics and then I feel
like I could actually use it
secta when I just clicked
just tracer ammo like Ashley make them
come like find our way back to you oh I
want to get rid of my front iron sight
can I do that or is that part of the
post on these yeah
it's gotta change barrels it's scary to
shoot and have an explosion happen
because I shot like the timing was just
right thing we think that I did it
because my rifle has a different skin on
it the good thing is about policing that
so people can't do stuff that gets it
like a cheat ability like you have clip
the terrorists like blaze orange
jumpsuits or stuff like that
oh geez that was a machine gun to the
face
oh I'm dead two people next to you Steve
obliterated
I think I was one of those two people I
want to change my gun but I guess the
ones that we have available to us I
cannot do ones without a co-host more
than 16 though it takes to frag grenades
or a thermite is there more beer than
people at PDX actually is this is not a
drinking event I don't think that's a
that's vector land that's different I
have a Aichi under grip how do i how do
i aromatic no no I meant like how do I
make it shoot its I don't know
nikinoo district with the m203 i don't
know maybe it looks like three activate
it like scroll down to your explosive
use or the same select-fire know the
many difference wait oh I got it I
figured it out oh really so you can't
like shoot it against a wall on your
face something is shooting anything how
did he not die I only have one left on
the last guy left I'm scared saw the RPG
getting what this is that's gonna end
have some faith in me please just a
little bit I love what all the dead
players trying to tell you how to play
the game like how do you capture
speaking of time the RPG I don't think
has it doesn't I found that out earlier
okay we got this
oh look I did it I never got to shoot my
RPG though it's probably good thing oh
my god let's do this one stuff
so we think so far it's fun I like I'm
enjoying this it's a different style
I just never actually even made it
through the tutorial I kept dying
repeatedly well the tutorial on this
game is when you're like in training but
then your base is attacked while you're
in training that's a tutorial right I'm
seeing a lot of people saying like a lot
of really cool and supportive things in
chat thank you for that in a world where
chat is just no no chat chat is
typically just like so toxic I'm running
the same class again because I think it
worked out well
someone said we're playing half-life 3
Shay's in my town I know we're not
planning on doing like any meetups or
anything we will be going out and
getting dinner later so who knows what
run into you ran into we've run into so
many people just out about heavily Josh
what makes this when difficult angles it
seems like you're exposed from at least
two sides at all times it's hard to
snipe this one
I killed someone would like to make that
known that I killed a guy I really need
to switch my control so that could hold
down right click for aim down sight and
not I'll come my fire team's going that
way and I'm going the other way
can I just drive this tank it's running
don't let the keys in it yeah it's all
like hardcore core kind of yeah you
leave yourself exposed you're going to
get hit with something you don't I mean
all right
I want to get that guy in the bridge of
my Ichi yeah come on bridge it didn't
blow up stay frosty this guy's at the
end of the tunnel there is on the bridge
okay
I just tried to kill him and I D I got
hit with the click click oh yeah go
higher and you're all so slick smoke
grenade yourself at that boy in the
wrong way
Oh got another RPG RPG I'm I'm
underneath the tunnel with the bus for
the buses oh god I mean shot at oh
they're behind us the -
they're coming up the stairs behind us
coming through the doorway don't shoot
the doorway oh god damn it I went into
that room Josh does the bad guy click
click click click click
Kevin Spacey's in Tehran oh stop shut up
where I'll talk about that shit right
where's my RPG a is my body I took my
RPG back I'm gonna get killed with this
I'm good with RPG ok I'll get with the
RPG don't worry Nick why do you laugh
when you always say that you've seen my
RPG skills Josh don't stand up this is a
regular grenade like a grenade grenade
oh god I pulled the pin okay I didn't
know what kind of grade it was so I
wasn't afraid I think was a smoke
grenade but it just looked green so I
wasn't sure
already our charges
now turn the radio now the guy in the
rooftop
yeah coming out of the doorway don't
shoot me
there's a lot more guys here that about
their feet I'm trying to make our way to
you guys let alone actually supplied
some assistance here that guy dead
standing up yes yes Nick I'm on your
right now I'm on your left
using my H II well god oh god oh god oh
god oh god
she's not gonna yellow any better than
that
just chasing that guy Oh
there at the last I think I just got rid
of a perfectly good round how do I get
off this roof without breaking my legs
well I'm a saw
oh god that was a friendly my bad I
didn't mean to do that they're gonna be
coming back in the way we came oh why
would I kill someone that killed me okay
I killed which you know I killed more
people than that I killed more people in
that round that I have in any other game
though I killed 11 people whatever I see
you gaming J you know it's funny I
talked about this before I build
computers and do custom stuff and talk
about overclocking and GPUs and stuff
and that and most of the time the
audience is really receptive to that if
I do a video about games or anything
they're like we want to watch you play
games don't do a bit about games it's to
beauty about overclocking game fine
the opposition's get trying it in and
blow up our cash I'm trying to go recon
on this one that's gonna go very badly
I'm sure yes
can I put a foregrip on a sniper rifle I
don't know if I'm gonna be any use to
you guys but I'm gonna try sniping this
map to lay everything okay
is there a way to hold your breath
shit okay while I was busy looking at
like what happened when I hit shift kind
of thing
oh my my attachments didn't I was backup
before I ran through fire Oh oops
oopsies my bad my bad
I I killed a guy that was on our team
reinforced when the next wave begins I
want the attachments I was trying to put
on here come in yeah we gained a point
each wave
the hardest part for me obviously is not
knowing the maps
oh the sprinklers just in just went off
oh sorry the sprinkler system went off
in the game well they sound really
convincing when they go by your head
instead I was last man left what I
didn't die and it ended what happened I
don't think I was anywhere near them
yeah guys I'm enjoying a game that's old
there's nothing wrong with that is there
Josh only to play the newest games do
you have to be a streamer or youtuber to
attend PD excellent no no the effect is
very few streamers or gamers are
youtubers here
I saw the RPG come in before I died the
game is insurgency it's on Steam and
it's pretty cheap can anyone help me
nope
no I was free to chat I'm dead I I died
instantly telling an RPG that came in on
the start I was spectating on a guy who
just fell to his death
I don't know which way I'm supposed to
be pointing it's part of my problem like
I don't know this map at all I don't
even know the caches are there's a
matter for he laughing come down try
this again you see me dancing see me
dancing I'm running towards danger it
actually works
and I'm dead I need meetups planned in
Portland nope there's a sign of time
want to play much I won't use what has
been in playing games what a play a good
job well to be fair I took out like
three guys before I died by that play oh
god there's an RPG coming up the stairs
it was like a bunch of guys on the
stairs I got three of them
how do I equip grenade it says I have it
in my loadout oh there it is for what
shopping guess where I was just killed
by friendly unless I'm blind
I'm really bad at this map what if
you're getting attacked from all angles
no this is not Call of Duty I'm that guy
that keeps getting caught on the
doorframe every time he goes through a
door well I ran into the enemy very
quickly and I'm dead again I'm not
really digging this map
I can't stay alive longer than ten
seconds
after this go back to quit talking to
him how about you quit telling people
what to quit huh he's just some pretty
well-equipped insurgents
I think about this game she was like
with his age you don't have to have
Heian oh it runs on Steam right or I'm
sorry source didn't even see the guy
yeah I don't like it at all the fun
level diminished big-time with that map
this can run on a bulldozer - plays this
better so who gives a fuck if Linus
plays the better conquers playing with
bots near PD excellent I think people
seem to get the wrong idea about a LAN
party everyone's playing the same
fucking game it's just you're here all
in the same place playing games that's
what matters right there's some people
oh they're playing World of Warcraft I
see people playing Diablo 3 I see a lot
of destiny - I say some Warcraft I see a
lot of League
whoo I'm going slow you son of a bitch
why you tried to get it
let's see did we go for it let's go well
I got that kind of experience it to know
what I want right see ya oh yeah giggle
giggle giggle right you will see muzzle
rise on that thing like crazy does it
have a bite but yeah if you go pro
Gatlin got another one don't walk in
front of me
don't walk it right okay you're gonna
you're in front of me guy
oh oh here's all here's cheap at and
then your aw damn relocating I don't
think it's going in his favor he's gonna
have to reevaluate choices so NFS asked
me how tacticool J is at what I'm very
cool oh I got hit with an RPG or
something
I killed seven people on that one I can
advance beyond cover
J you're sort of angles out man and stop
camping oh shut up camping first of all
play against bots it's insurgency it's
designed to be played like you would in
real life you don't go fucking Rambo and
running around you shut up and play the
way you want you shut up about the way
I'm playing if you can't tell what you
should be doing there sir
it's just shut up stop camping no spots
you're gonna get mad at you stop camping
first of all I'm a heavy gunner I'm
super quiz it 249 and my job is to lay
prone and put down fire not run around
like Rambo stupid I would like to put
down suppressing fire in this hallway
but everyone's in the way thank you for
everyone moving out of the way just let
me mo him down I'm looking for their
feet you see that if you see the piles
of bodies are laid out there so I was
like I'd like people to get out of my
way
especially since I'm learning right now

Pacific time so now my live stream at
the audio going well Thank You Josh
say I got mission it'll just be like a
Late Late special edition whatever are
you guys in a gamer no no I'm still in
the menu I need something on your ready
I'll get one lined up I guess which my
scene here okay I'm ready to go let me
get a monster About You Jay I know right
how much would this be if I wanted to go
or is it invites only no its tickets are
public and what is it like for $40 to
see you have like a whole weekend you
get Internet everything I mean the
internet here's solid it's like one 500
down to 50 oh yeah yeah and that's with
everyone on it yeah so I think they
brought in 20 gigabit per second like
total like $2 million check out PDX land
I think net for all their available show
dates they'll put the tickets on sale
they generally sell out with 24 yeah
they sell out one in the same day
see Guinea takes a ticket is the hard
part yes that's the thing where it does
help being me I guess which is really
kind of hate so really being me since I
bought you you did but remember by the
time we hit you up for them no luck by
the time you have formed they were
already sold out yeah they make
accommodation so right which thank
goodness for that yeah it's it's just
like if you want to go to pax you get a
kind of camp out and the benefit is if
you do make it to a PDX land you kind of
get the first crack at buying tickets
for the next point right right this is a
lot of fun I like the skin I never this
is my first time playing it and I've
owned it since I came out you understand
I own just about every game like every
major title but that's because I use it
for work for testing and benchmarking
and just general knowledge of how
something runs on a game you know if I
don't do videos about it I'm still
playing with it and testing it so yeah
it's one of those things where I finally
get to sit down and play something it's
like wow this is actually pretty cool
sorry Josh um buddy Josh I'm going to be
running for that gunner of that support
position like every time in a fight you
for it yeah you're cutting out your mic
slowly yeah how about now I think he'll
be alright now it's Jerry with us yeah
he is on the other end of the venue
actually just to kind of show you guys
here too if you haven't these first time
here and you weren't here in the
beginning part of the stream here is
we're in the kind of back part right so
josh is right there we've hi Josh the
little nick is to the right wait hi Nick
Nick is not in discord is it of course
he's not Nick is such a noob Josh tell
Nick to get in discord discord okay
we're gonna go Thanks yeah ja Oh Nick
why was he ignoring me then and not
waving to the camera like I said Oh cuz
I was definitely you did oh oh that
camera oh my god
trying to show everyone where you are so
we're in the back part of the room here
there is
sorry so shaky the main doors are like
way over there and then there's you know
more people here and stuff so it's not a
huge Atlanta I mean like Dreamhack and
in Europe is like dwarfs this one good
it's like thousands of people but we're
about 500 people here it's nice to this
manageable you know and then there's
some vendors who like Emma sighs we go
from UK is here you're still cutting out
here and there it's kind of weird am I
really
Andy up north says there's about 30
people there yeah 30 right yeah now 500
J well what would you do if someone
would send sardines in the fan mail I
don't have fan mail so good luck that
could be rain soaked in unemployment oh
oh let's see here check check and see
can you hear me any better on discord
where you want you run discord write
your volume level wind up a little bit I
don't know if it was just the threshold
was a little too low or high on some
screens too so sometimes it'll cut out
now it's way loud normal voice I think
you're good I just think your threshold
that'll be put down a little bit gotcha
you guys ready to pop in no we are not
already in a match why are why are you
already in why are you so low over there
Nick I mean your party it says you're in
the service I'm launching go to another
nwi official server too far J no it's
not too far
we drove 15 hours to get here that's how
much we wanted to be here what
NIC's lecture no I got it I told you
dude I got she achieved something and
offered support literally on the last
game don't you think I should put that
generally do not offer support
neither emotional or physical support
exactly what I'm running J's not there
to watch out Josh I'm gonna should be
shooting right your way
Genta they lined up and they both felt
like dominos
it felt opposite directions it was very
Hollywood
remember through that smoke made so I
couldn't offer any more support though
I'm reloading watching 10 minutes what
server I don't know
I follow Josh Josh drags us into the
servers let's see here right now we're
on I think it's full the cool thing
there there are some like unique servers
now it's a hack oh Jesus
are you dead no I'm not
Europe there are some custom servers
ready to play 16 people
when I used to scream and I scream and
fill up quick
we do that we play 16 that gets a little
hectic yeah
Mack you and you were famous er yeah my
stream more often used to stream like
every night at like midnight
yeah midnight night that that works
slows down enough bird be in between
worldwide conference calls hello cool
and I'm not ignoring chat guys I'm kind
of focusing on the game still annoying
part about streaming when you're you
know an online personality up myself
as everyone expects every second of your
stream do we spent like staring at the
chat and it's not why I strained eyes
you don't your dick it's like not
ignoring you just trying to even if I do
I'm apparently I'm dead something hit me
from the side and I think it was the one
you're shooting at
and I private you know you cannot cannot
private me that sounds very offensive
and dirty and violating
Jen was flood into your DMS just Fassett
up first
we need we need a saline vaseline
vaseline but I decrease I don't know
where I'm guard I'm lost I'm just gonna
head towards all the diamonds can't go
that way
oh shit that means click OK I'm going
way the wrong way simply for my Chet I
see you guys I am watching chefs not
able to respond the entire apologies
don't apologize
I just sweat dead guy fall off a balcony
I'm somebody shooting to me no is a
teammate trying to kill me that's
probably me no is that right cool guy or
everything where is everybody
they wrecked cool just make sure you're
playing the game right or we can kick
you
he's trying to get my attention to tell
me which way to go but I already figured
it out like hand cramps from like
constantly holding down the car there's
so much blood in holes against the wall
that I've just shoot up 200 I turn right
I'm here to J I'm already dead it was
those okay this seems safe this smoky
hallway here the one that's on fire yes
quick everybody stack up in the
stairwell closest you cancel oh god I
already pulled the grenade our shadow
shadows it grenade grenade now I'm gonna
it up
I would like to get into a position to
offer aid and support doesn't help that
support runs slower than everything else
I know it's hard to keep up with you
guys they're on fire let's push the talk
up okay
Hazen Kaine all right go I didn't know
that the in-game chat has like this
burrito extra radio chatter yeah
reloading could be captured and the
defense he has a Foxtrot yeah we set to
defend now all right I will defend the
stairs
I got stairwell oh shit and that's me
dead anyone got my six
let me check yeah you're fine I'm
third-person spectating on you
no one's getting up my stairs totally
can't even give a shit this is called
defending be good everybody else yes I'm
like Yolo and too fast on this issue -
down whoo look Jim weapon eyes got a guy
fly inside by a guy in a stairwell that
as bad as that sounds that's what I
meant
I got an RPG everybody I'm also enjoys
rock pool so we both went down from the
same bullet gotta give that guy credit
if you spoke out one bullet cuz I just
destroyed the thingy with my RPG lower
stairs our toaster am I'm not gonna
trying to walk down the railing on that
one I'm lost again
yeah it gets easy to get lost skirt oh
shit I'll keep moving towards the red
things I guess yeah space of what it is
check one check point
got my concentration face nice on hotel
there's a lot of people are about multi
spectating watching your stream in mind
it's probably two very different
playstyles bad and worse - in this
oh shit they're dropping watch out lady
you're right
Oh see movement we're coming through the
building turned out coming from outside
oh god oh god I got a run run where'd
you run outta ammo no I just I turned
the corner there was the 18 of them
Josh and watching at 6:00 if you want to
stay back there okay I need to reload
I've had people ask before like how come
you reload so slow in this game because
it's realistic yeah
they shouldn't like they're attached
later though somehow how do you mean
really uh you know at the speed reloads
yeah acquired skill right yes I'd like
spend your points on it like yeah watch
my left side rich environment hang out
GG 39 kills 32 suppressed Nate from 29
30 how gpj 23 kills 20 to suppress only
shot 353 fire shot so good I did 298 all
that's alright with all that spray it's
all that to spray three people you
understand the spray keeps them from
running in Jesus somebody so many people
are like really dumb when it comes to
like tactic he's not he doesn't believe
in us Jason up appeal box ready I'll
send you some fresh monster no cuz I
know it gets fresh sardines suit this
out now Jay
what game is this it's insurgency a bill
on Steam and we do have we do have coach
we can give away me we give away those
later like over Twitter or something
like that if you want to check it out
and there's also the their newer game
day of infamy which is kind of like a
same play style but world war two and it
is brutal you think it stuff like this
try out like iron sights and bolt-action
rifles I'm full weight right now in real
life not the game an RPG strike early on
to take out like Daniel
try to pry to overwatch all the bullets
flash a little bit tricky I got it's a
claustrophobic map I have it yields
nests I'm pretty exposed to rooftops
though you probably won't get a lot of
fire I mean I've got this this this
little road right here this came more
than a sniper rifle I feel like the like
the EBR is good stuff semi-auto you
don't have a crazy mag scope on it so if
you needed to defend yourself to your
primary conduct I would like to get a
rooftop oh god I made a mistake I made
it big I just cleared that room before
you got in there so reloading appreciate
it I can see your handiwork all the
bodies are six there come upstairs and
smoke grenades are effective I can't see
crap I go downstairs to defend
I've got North covered they are checking
rooftops
I've got North alley covered okay hang
on tops like so you did resupply oh shit
oh god they're flanking they're flanking
rekt cool on your right they caught me
when I was moving I've got your six
though so keep North alley covered no
let me know when we're moving over I was
intense
I'm dad
I miss lurking but I'm finished the
scrapyard worst finale your earlier vlog
was hilarious thanks Jay you're welcome
glad you enjoyed the plug here there's a
guy in the smoke in the alleyway that
was expected the guy just laid down on
the open like what like you're so
fucking cool you're so awesome
everyone should be as good as you and
the way you game cuz like you know
you're so perfect I wish I was like you
but I don't have the capacity of holding
the level of Awesome of which you're you
know your bag of guts actually holds
we're learning it still T man J turned
into a phallic girl it's like totally
from SoCal's I like Nick Stinson all
junk
just like the internet does to me if
you're in my chat you say something
really stupid I will I will wreck you
it's what I do
someone in my chat asked if they weren't
perspective what I want screwed up today
for my home system yes to have this one
the one that I'm using right now is a
little Jay built in his challenge
accepted video series against so go
watch that video if you want to respect
some of them right now
I'm dead I got really pitched there well
lit up yeah I saw that like we're all
alive and now you're dead yeah Oh as far
as heads I'm using them using the
SteelSeries that don't have five or
something like that does pretty good
face pretty punchy get some no shit
that's friendlies our six are six are
six that sounds like overwatch anyone's
looking for Jay there's about four back
here again
I'm sorry honestly the mic on his
headset blocks out bad really good bike
ones gonna fail one of the people in my
chat was like move up move up but if I
had moved up if I had moved up we
wouldn't have seen the flank coming from
behind right there at least
do you have an ITX or microchip oh
you're not talking to me spray-and-pray
by JC sense why do people not understand
the task of a heavy gunner yeah that's
it
first of all it's not spray-and-pray I
am 40 kills in it's not a headset this
is that my n 50 X's audio technica that
I'm using the Yeti mic Yeti blue blue
Yeti well blue is the brand I stopped
hearing a while ago Jim stayed back and
forth it's almost like we've been at
sorry
swimmer Nick your paybacks coming
reloading the worst possible location
like the radio mod that guy has to make
it sound like a real radio oh god I
threw a frag in there get out of there
get out of there hey guys sorry do for
the lulz
I need to reload all right I'm hot I
felt like a really bad like dr. Seuss
book
breakout breakout breakout wherever
we're enjoying playing with bots right
now keeps things very just chill yeah
that's the boy how many FPS do you have
Jay at 144 Hertz panel and the G sink is
on so I'm just doing 144 Hertz
we'll play a little bit more than I
think maybe we'll start okay right now
when you get back we'll get some food
and then we'll go back to the stream
again yeah yeah well break food let's
stuff and come back you stirred maybe do
left4dead later yeah yeah oh that would
be super Derby I didn't see many kills I
had that last round but I think it was
closer to 60 yeah some of the maps like
I've had him as high like cuz you're
mowing them down they just keep running
in when you get some levels where the
check points go out to like a Mandel
Jacobs spawn on a Mac weapon
it was 55 kill school less I'm most so
far a lot of people are saying it's kind
of crazy how close our stream sink up
yeah especially I started mine
what don't puck don't pop that chief are
there warlock I'm gonna hit you moving
in my red dot on that was a bad word sir
when he he caught me standing so I just
injured his feet and held down the
trigger in the rest to care of itself
I can't tell you in this game how many
times I'm fired at muzzle flashes cuz
there's too much smoke
let's check our six making sure on some
blanket nine to nine seconds before that
part of the war opens up reloading J is
too sexy you know it to six before my
pewter to sexy very much
you're loading I'll grab this hallway
oh shit I'm gonna get nice alley over
RPG oh no no not today not gonna do it
not today
trying to push outs if we get early
indication which direction they're
coming from oh god they spawn did they
pop spawned in front of me geez
oh man that was shit Josh Josh I turned
the corner I'm looking and they were
like JC sexy AMD family you don't pay
much attention do you try to play co-op
on Massacre servers maybe we're gonna
play some left 4 dead 2 later and
that'll be funny I think yeah
here they go that way RPG dick
and it goes our left
ripped yeah I was she was I was too far
to the left I couldn't turn right
history I think later you left for dead
cat - Modi branded I've actually thought
about I actually thought about getting
it wrapped but I have 20 little dents
and things under what well somebody say
get your dues Modi branded basically
saying get it wrapped but I have too
many small dents and things that show up
with wrap like if I do am a trap or
something
no do full chrome yeah so I'm just a
driving blind spot at that point but
dazzle it well things you never be able
leaves you close your door and see your
reflection
it happens already though it's pretty
shiny oh you want try brutal before we
end it all right we went to 20 bucks for
objective and they're all gonna be
proven so what you want to do you can
spec up your stuff get AP rounds cuz
brutal BOTS usually have
we'll do an F J what you would be doing
better if he had eaten the fish on the
road trip no I wouldn't be here right
now I'm beating the bathroom still
throwing up fish is a brain food okay
now what we want to do is just go hide
are they gonna come from all directions
no it should still be the same style of
gameplay they're just they're really
mean whoever that flash in front of me
now
no nothing as he already told her once
hahaha well I just go straight to the
third count acts like it's over as
everybody's taking incoming fire post up
on right alley
right side upstairs which way they gonna
be coming from yeah just cover all the
doors
another compass you do but I can't
remember how to bring it up in the room
time to look at it
so it doesn't do anything my caper
compass nope resupply Ches as you guys
already know is for talking oh my gosh
you just got capped from behind that was
kind of funny
areas compass came up then disappeared
again that's weird
I think I'm bugging out maybe cap has
popped up and then went away without me
doing anything
tell shit's getting real - no one's
talked as much yeah we're in the game
that's what happens when you put a
riddle like it gets yeah what direction
oh my god oh my god oh my god I couldn't
say anything cuz I was too much
well guys went down a corridor where
there was probably ten of them at least
yeah I could I couldn't
yeah I couldn't say anything alright let
me get in there
my phone keeps way to go team
that scared me so much I'm too arduous
oh I don't even know who got me this all
right think I was I think I was friendly
fired give your own though I'm in a bad
place you are paying attention Jason I'm
a fanboy all PC parts isn't that isn't
that a good thing there are so many cool
systems here they'll built with all
manufacturers
oh shit watch out I was gonna go off
never know Jesus hi I'm like really
stuck back here
Leroy Jenkins I wish we could set where
these comfortably looking couches I know
right you really use the rest around all
day job there's only how many points of
entry for him here yeah I'm gonna cover
this hallway okay you get that you need
help let me know I'm gonna go back here
cover
Oh got me son
you're all that shooting going on and
I'm trying to post up on my corridor and
it's scary because it's like I feel like
I should be helping but if I move from
here it's a whole another entry point
yeah you get up guys behind you it's
like I don't know when they need help
you know I mean that's what's like
freaky about it cause once launched you
into a street that has BOTS already
fired at yeah I know right
like I just shrugged off three rounds
that's nice I got it was anybody coming
in from that side you just came in I
don't know there's two people behind me
round up they're coming in or not I can
hear the footprints but I don't know who
is it who it is the footprints are the
footsteps just I hear I hear colors I
only killed 47 on that one all right
guys I think I'm going to shut down the
stream for now it will probably be going
up and down a couple times today because
you know I want to share this with you
guys so I just don't feel like streaming
on Twitch so although it's YouTube I'll
probably be going back live again later
still planning on doing a late night
tech talk with Jeri later on so there is
that make sure you have your
notifications turned on thanks for
watching we'll also probably be
streaming some left 4 dead 2 later yeah
that's usually a 4 3 4 ve right 4 vs.
the environment is like foreign floor
like we do it versus yeah so I try start
with like 4 or ve and then maybe
universe is where we can do 44 ok
survivors for zombies like that cool all
right guys I'm gonna shut down the
stream a little bit thanks for watching
and we'll see you in a couple hours or
so if I can figure how to get out of
here anyway same thing goes from you
