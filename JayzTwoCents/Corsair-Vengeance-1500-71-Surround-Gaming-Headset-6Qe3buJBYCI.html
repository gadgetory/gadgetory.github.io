watching J's two cents and from the
company that brought you the awesome k70
keyboard which I use every day and love
we're going to take a look at the
Corsair Vengeance 1500 gaming headset
okay guys so today we're gonna take a
look at the vengeance 1,500 7.1 surround
gaming headset from Corsair the
vengeance line has been around for quite
some time they're Corsairs memory of the
vengeance line is very very solid you've
already seen my review of the k70
keyboard which is a vengeance line
absolutely solid products so today we're
going to take a look at what the 1500
surround sound headset is like I do a
lot of live streams and I do the Tech
Talk and I do sometimes when I'm gaming
I just don't want to have you know the
big headphones plugged into the mic and
sometimes when I'm doing the Tech Talk
or the live streams I really just don't
want this giant adult pleasure looking
Yeti in my face the entire time now
these guys came in at $69.99 at Fry's
Electronics at the time of recording
this video of course there did release a
whole new line of headsets which kind of
fit the gap between the 1300 to 1500 now
you have the 1400 to 1600 which are just
slight revisions of this current last
year's lineup a product so with that
don't let the price fool you they still
seem like a really good quality product
but today we're gonna go ahead and dive
in see what comes in the package we're
gonna see how they look and feel then
we're gonna do a mic test and see how
they sound and for some of you aspiring
commentators out there whether or not an
inexpensive sub $100 headphone like this
fits the bank or fits the bill or
however that that's saying goes I'm
really not very good at sayings here so
alright let's go ahead take out my
little bitty knife here because I don't
wanna I always seem to cut myself I mean
my hands definitely tend to show that
seal on the top and that's pretty much
it
now the packaging isn't anything
spectacular first before we actually
open this up the front of the box it
just says vengeance 1500 7.1 gaming
headset immersive intensive online
gaming by Corsair on the right hand side
you have your product guarantee which is
for two years against workmanship
craftsmanship inning break stops working
on the back of the box here you just
have a whole bunch of text and a bunch
of different languages that no one
really cares about
I mean honestly nobody reads this stuff
and on this side here you've got yours
information about the headphones
themselves when it comes to reef runt
response range you have 20 Hertz to
20,000 Hertz which is 20 Hertz is a lot
of bass and that's because these do
feature a 50 millimeter driver in there
and because of that you can get some
pretty decent bass if it's a quality
driver when it comes to the cable link
that's three meters or nine feet that's
really long it's 250 mil lots of power
so it's not even a whole lot of power
consumption and then it is a USB
connector so it is a USB interface which
means that this is going to act as its
own sound card when you plug it into
your computer so you don't have to use
any of the three-and-a-half millimeter
jacks now unfortunately because of that
that means you can't use this with your
Xbox or your gaming console system so
this is purely a PC gaming headphone now
the packaging here the outside you know
it's just cardboard and some see-through
plastic inside here it's nothing
entirely - it's like eight crate I mean
it's like the same kind of material that
you know eggs come in at the supermarket
so we're going to set that right there
when it comes to what rolled out of the
package here you've got your warranty
against defects paperwork right there
you've got your warranty guide and then
you've got some stuff do not return this
product to the store yeah of course
there's really big on going through them
when you have problems rather than
returning the product to the store and
then getting a replacement I don't know
why that really is the cable here is
braided this is very very nice quality
cable I do like the way that this looks
and feels reminds me a lot of like the
munition in√©s headphones where they're
nice and braided so it helps entangle
and look at the length of this cord this
is if you need a long length of cord
this is definitely gonna fit the bill
you do have inline controls here you
have what appears to be it almost looks
like a little boombox speaker right
there
you see that right there it kind of
looks like a little boombox but you've
got your mute switch right here it's a
toggle and then it looks like you've got
plus and minus here for volume which is
kind of funny the minus key is sort of
facing the wrong way
whatever so you got your volume and your
mute which is important you know so when
your mom busts in and tells you the
dishes dishes I'm gonna take away your
games then you know you're not gonna end
up on one of those embarrassing YouTube
videos where you're you know that guy
that got caught being yelled at by his
mom and you know then you're forever a
viral you know turd so the as you can
see here the ear cups they do twist
which makes it easier to store these
they're very springy in fact once you
start to twist them to just kind of like
plop over on their own the ear cups are
made of fabric and they are very very
large so if you've got big ears you're
gonna get a nice comfortable over the
ear fitment so you're not gonna be
dealing with these sitting on top of
your ears they are fairly light they're
not nearly as heavy as I thought they'd
be what looks like brushed aluminum over
here on the side right here it kind of
looks like an aluminum brushed aluminum
it's not just to let you know this is
plastic so don't think that you're
getting a nice aluminum set of ear
phones because they're not the headband
is nice and padded you can see you can
see right here how thick they are they
definitely look like they would be
comfortable on your head so we'll be
sure to check that out the headphone or
the microphone here it's got nice nachi
looks like it's got some stops in there
so wherever you place it it's gonna stay
you know sometimes you want to push it
out of the way a little bit so you don't
get that sound hanging out some people
do videos and they're trying to eat
their mic yeah it does
twist or not twist but it bends and
stays where you put it which is good and
then you do have where the cable meets
the ear cup right here you have a nice I
don't actually know what these are
called but these are some nice I guess
it's that plastic thing that takes all
the stress off of the bend so you don't
break your wire it's got a nice notched
one so it can bend pretty nicely
so when it comes to adjustability you do
have height adjustment built in to the
hip hands so if you've got a huge noggin
I mean you can see right here just how
big they can go I mean look at that I do
have to admit though when I put these on
they're awfully huge in the sense that
they push these back in there I don't
have every big head they're awfully wide
I mean okay they sort of look a little
silly I mean I feel like
I don't know why they went so Wyatt up
here where they don't really follow the
contour of your head so you got all this
open space right here they look they
really look kind of silly but with that
let's go ahead now and let's switch over
to the built-in mic here into this
headset and let's see exactly how it
sounds testing one two three
testing one two three testing testing
testing okay guys so I got the
headphones on and we've got a friend of
the channel here coconut monkey you've
seen him a few times sporting the Elgato
gaming shirt but here we are talking
about the Corsair Vengeance 1500
headphones and I've listened to some
audio quality I've listened to some
audio like music on these already and
I'm gonna go ahead and get my feedback
and I'm gonna let coconut monkey listen
to them and I'm gonna know him give his
feedback and then we're gonna talk about
some good and some bad that I'm noticing
with these first off the audio quality
is you can hear what the mic really
isn't that bad at first when I was
recording on it I thought oh this is
this is horrible I don't like this at
all if you're gonna be doing
commentaries I don't recommend it it's
it's bad for commentary but when we
listened back both of us especially when
we heard him on the speaker's kind of
thought they really don't sound that bad
and in fact they almost sounded as good
as my Yeti which was kind of weird can
right off the bat say I don't like the
shape of them I don't like the way they
stick out so wide right here like I feel
like I'm should be vectoring airplanes
in for landing sort of thing I mean
these are you know feel like a NASCAR
spotter there are 50 millimeter drivers
in here which kind of I expected a
little more bass especially since they
claim on the box here you know in the
packaging that they've got a twenty to
twenty Hertz to 20,000 Hertz response
range and that seems to be like the norm
everybody puts 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz
I don't think people I mean I think
they're saying okay yeah we've
reproduced sound at 20 Hertz for cheeks
shake at 20 Hertz these don't do that
but that does come with nice EQ software
where you can go in there and you can
control the full EQ and volume range and
you can set 7.1 surround and whatnot
I do really like the way this sound for
music I haven't tried them with gaming
yet but gaming you know it's just gonna
be a lot of explosions and things and
the 7.1 will test on that when I do some
battlefield 3 gaming later you know live
streams and whatnot but what I'm gonna
do now is I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna let coconut to cut the camera hear
me let coconut monkey listen to some
music and then we'll get his feedback
and I'll tell you guys what I don't like
about these headphones so don't go away
we'll be right back it's like a battle
there's where's there's nobody up
there's like a really really really
crunchy noise but yeah it might live 70
Q you can to see that you up here yeah
got the 30 heard screams cuz if it's
claimed it can be 20 of every old crank
30 I'll pull the trouble download
okay guys so here we are and we just
listened to some sound quality you know
songs on this we are you know you guys
can obviously hear the way they sounded
on the microphone I'm gonna go ahead and
let coconut monkey give his two cents so
you got to speak up in this thing
all right now and just show them what
you normally use that way people can see
what you at least have in contrast this
is my choice that I use the trending X
720 pros and compared to those that one
I love the species of these a lot more
the ear cups yeah cuz these they gave us
like the player one and they also gave
us like the soft one like that but the
soft one like they squish down yeah well
it's kind of like what I said I said
earlier before you came in that belt the
leather or pleather ear cups get hot and
your ears start to sweat and they get
just uncomfortable against your skin
yeah that's my opinion on them because
these are kind of like the same material
oh you're the harder than these holy
crap Phillies yeah those look feel like
they're worn out like they remind me of
like you know a managua thats cracking
like that feels really hard that's not
comfortable those have no squish to them
okay anyway we're talking about the
Corsairs yeah so yeah they've got the
cloth ear cups that you really seem to
like they're like yeah only really light
which a lot of people kind of mistake
wait for quality you know at least that
one feels more sturdy than this cuz in
me most reviews I read this single snap
this will be the first thing that snaps
that seems to be the person that breaks
on almost every headset review because
when I was looking for headsets today I
saw a lot of people that said that their
ear cups are their you know their
adjuster just broke so in terms of the
okay so what about what the hell they
sounded they sound pretty good compared
with like other headsets
based on that was like he said
lackluster yeah I was childlike more
gluten to it for 50 millimeter drivers
for these to have I mean God they just
didn't hunch there was no punch there
was base stone I mean it it produced
sound at the rate at the frequency
ranges it said that it would but they
just didn't have any OMPH behind them so
if you like a lot of basing music I mean
these aren't gonna be used for music
anyway in fact these are USB so you
couldn't use them with your music player
anyway if you wanted to but if you're
gonna be listening to music on your
computer or watching movies you probably
aren't gonna be as thrilled with the
bass and then even after I cranked them
up on the EQ they weren't great yeah I
mean when it comes to the sound quality
of the Corsairs you really are at the
mercy of the USB controllers so if
they're not gonna sound as good as
something plugged in directly to a sound
card to even a three-and-a-half
millimeter Jack mic quality here's what
I have to say about that there there has
been there was some controversy here on
my opinion on the microphone on this
where there is kind of a faint
high-pitched buzz that takes place every
now and then and there's a little bit of
a history here it when you're listening
to it but when it plays back like in
this video when we played it back
earlier we were like woah this actually
sound pretty good for gaming headset to
get to that point I had to upgrade
drivers had to do reboots had to go into
the EQ and I had to adjust it if you're
looking just plug this in and record
yeah out of the box you may do like I
was about to do which was return these I
was not thrilled with these whatsoever
but I think now I'm gonna go ahead and
hang on to him my quality its decent
they sure as heck are better than the
logitech 9g 920 SRD 930 sorry because
these are wireless and wireless signals
can't carry that much the Tritons that
coconut monkey uses the sound quality on
those are great too but then again he's
dealing with huge amount of bandwidth
for the for the optic because it's an
optical it's a fiber optic headset so if
you're looking for something under a
hundred bucks remember I got these today
for seventy to seventy bucks $69.99 and
you want 7.1 surround and you want a
decent mic for commentaries for under
100 bucks it's gonna be hard to beat
these I mean there's a lot of other mic
headsets with microphones
in this price range I mean you've got a
whole bunch of razor you know headsets
and yeah you I came in cut out regions
you know I'm not thrilled with to total
beach I mean granted I've only used a
couple of turtle beaches and my x12 cell
that garbage with those are only 50
bucks these are only $20 more than the
turtle beach's and they do have you can
get the 1,300 the Corsair 1300 which is
almost identical in terms of hardware
but instead of USB interface it is the
three-and-a-half millimeter which you
could then use them with your xbox if
you wanted if you had the converter so
there you go guys this has been the
Logitech Vengeance 1500 gaming headset
7.1 surround USB go and check it out
under a hundred bucks it's gonna be hard
to beat but if you don't if you're
looking for high-end quality microphones
you're never gonna beat something like
this Yeti right here so thanks guys for
watching thanks coconut monkey for
giving us your opinion on these because
it's you know audio is hard to give a
review and an opinion on but I like the
software I like the microphone you guys
can hear the microphone and if you want
to hear them out but you know live check
out my live streams I'm gonna be using
these from now on in my live streams and
you'll get to hear them firsthand so
with that I'm gonna get on out of here
we're gonna play some battlefield and
we'll blow stuff up and poems and noobs</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
