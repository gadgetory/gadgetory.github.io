took a break from building my new studio
to take a look at something I'm excited
to unbox and play with something I've
been waiting for for a long time that
just very well might be the most
overkill graphics card on the planet
today's video is sponsored by drop calm
and the mast drop Plus Universal IEMs
the first earbuds tuned by drop with the
three armature drivers and two-way
configuration - vented drivers and multi
bore sound channels per ear the master
out + Universal IEMs deliver extended
bass and clarity to see all the specs
and to learn more click the link in the
description below so one of the things
that this company is known for and
they're shipping is they're packing
peanuts if you've been following me long
enough you know why that is
oh they use air pack now EVGA no longer
uses the edible cornstarch packing
peanuts check this out look at the size
of this box holy crap so this is the
twenty atti kingpin full retail card I
thought they're gonna be sending me like
some sort of engineering deal in like a
brown box that out to give me an idea I
thought there are other packaging what's
crazy yeah your girth versus the girth
of the guy she tells you not to worry
about so I'm really excited about this
because if you guys aren't aware I
actually have a bit of a kingpin card
collection going this was my previous
kingpin this is the 980ti
but the reason why I'm bringing these
out is I kind of want to see how the
aesthetics over time has sort of changed
I'm gonna guide keep it to fan boy
you're right man I've I've spent so much
money at EVGA over the years that I
deserve this oh my god so much I'm it's
a water-cooled card
okay well that's that would make sense
if they were right because one of the
problems to be honest with the kingpin
card it's not all cupcakes and sprinkles
is in an air-cooled fashion like these
you don't get anywhere close to the
capability of the card and that's
because the card is truly Bend EVGA
takes the best chips and puts them on
the EVGA card or the of course are on
the EVGA card the kingpin card and then
you've got to do things like evbot and
manual overclocking and overall
and all that sort of stuff to get its
true potential in fact I think Steve you
know gamers next to Steve recently did a
livestream where he hit something like
26 hundred megahertz on ln2
and that's what the card is truly
designed for it is designed for ln2
overclocking but at least with the
watercooler just like the one we took a
look at CES so it's very similar
that wasn't a final version so I'm not
sure exactly what's different cuz I
don't have them side-by-side but at
least on water we're gonna get more out
of it but just like we saw at CES it's
got the OLED display on the side right
here which is going to show us real live
temperature readout wattage all that
sort of stuff and then we've got
connector panels back here so if you're
doing manual overclocking ln2 and stuff
you can hook your probes right up to the
harness that comes off here and you get
a live Hardware reading of voltage and
stuff you'll have to count on software
which is not the most accurate on the
back the usual suspects we've got a fan
header 3/8 pin power connectors we've
also got evbot connector right there and
I think that's a USBC mostly microUSB
that's before I should probably RTFM I'm
kind of glad to see that they got away
from the air cooler although that would
be a more Universal drop-in solution
these air cooled cards man they're just
not being shown justice although the
cooler is good it would make them fall
kind of just in the same category as any
other custom air-cooled card until you
really start pushing it so that you can
see the the bend chips in effect what I
wanted to show here before I hook it up
is at least kingpin gave us back a full
sized
display port where the other cards
always had mini DisplayPort like you see
right here and then they would give you
an adapter to adapt it from mini
DisplayPort to a standard sized
DisplayPort and asked him once why they
did that and they said it's because if
you take the cooler off and you do the
the pot and all that you could go single
bracket or single card slot the card
also does have active cooling on the
VRMs because the problem is if you start
going ln2 and stuff and you take this
off you lose active cooling over the
VRMs we're at least here they have a
heatsink separate on the back and a fan
to keep things nice and cool so with all
that out of the way hook it up in the
test bench and see how much we can get
out of this thing
without going any sort of exotic cooling
it is a triple bios cards you've got a
normal bios which is a green light
you've got an OC bios which is an orange
light and ln2 bios which is a red light
now you're still gonna have some locked
functionality even with these bio set
far we can get this seem to go on just
water I am on the LNT by us though
because I want to see how far we can
push this on water and hopefully not
damage it I want to do a baseline run
here first we use 3d mark for this I
want to see what our stock score is and
then what our max overclocked score is
so if you download the latest beta
precision you can then get control over
that display which we're having some fun
with as you can see JS 2 cents is the
best ever which is what it's saying on
there and it never deviates because it's
the absolute truth and all of the truths
that I've ever truth the truth in world
but you have a couple of different
things you can do here you can even put
in a picture and apply so now that
creepiness is out of the way let's go
let's go ahead and what's my cpu running
at let's go ahead and perform our 5 gigs
all right it's going to perform our time
spy we'll just do regular time spy
scores and see what we get so our
graphics score is a fifteen thousand
seven seven six which is a single GPU in
time spying non-extreme the core clock
started out at a twenty seventy all in
its own member this is factory
temperature curve factory well the fan
curve isn't but the factory power limit
all that stuff we didn't touch anything
as you can see right here it's all still
set to default and so started out at a
twenty seventy dropped to a twenty fifty
five and then looks like twenty fifty
five is where it's sort of stayed memory
is not overclocked it's still sitting at
seven thousand so it looks like we still
hit though approximately forty three see
that is our baseline so we need to see
how much higher we get in a 15-7 seven
six when we overclock I have a feeling
we're not gonna gain much the chips
until they get cooled and buy cooled I
mean chilled water some sort of a
chiller healthier
lnto dry ice whatever until you really
bring the temperatures of the core down
they all kind of land around the same
mark so I'm really hoping here for
twenty two hundred on this a i/o setup
I'm not sure if we'll get it but that's
what I'm hoping for so I'm starting here
by just
maxing out our power limit which is 144
percent forty four percent above a
hundred now the hundred from like the
r-tx founders edition model that
baseline moves up so it's forty four
percent of the new baseline or the new
what's considered the the 100 percent
power limit we're also going to go ahead
and prioritize GPU temp and I'm not
going to touch the clock at all I'm
curious as to if we get a higher clock
so I'm gonna test that real quick with
Kevin just to see what our new core
clocks are alright so by raising the
power limit 244 we gain no score
whatsoever in fact we went from a 1577
to a 15 749 that's all within margin of
error let's try going 100 put us around
2150 radiator still nice and cool and
during the test the radiator wasn't
feeling like it was getting any sort of
thermal soak at all it felt like the
same amount of room-temperature air
coming through it so that tells me that
240 is more than sufficient to for
keeping that die cool all right so we
went up to 1648 1 and it looks like it
shot up to 20 160 which was technically
90 megahertz because member it was going
to 20 70 first and then it dropped down
to 20 145 constant but the constant is
what's making me happy
right there and I've even touched the
memory yet to see how far we can go with
this so as we're gonna do I'm gonna max
this out I'm gonna find where we crash
and then I'll tell you guys where that
was all right so this is where we kind
of landed a gain of about 11 50 or so we
went from a 15-7 76 to a 16-9 3 6 that's
a pretty hefty game by just moving some
sliders obviously nowhere near where
card like this is capable of capping out
because we don't have the equipment to
truly get us as far as we possibly can
with this card our max speed here
started at 20 190 because it goes in 15
mega hurt increments the next step up
was 20 205 which was not stable it would
run for a little while and then crash
and then if we start at 20 190 it runs
for a little bit drops down 115
megahertz tick down to 20 175 and that's
perfectly stable all the way across we
are running a 1 gigahertz overclock on
our memory and we haven't touched
anything with voltage just power slider
and our our core slider as well as our
memory and this is what we got
pretty hefty jump but what we're gonna
do right now is there is another aspect
to this this is not your everyday good
card this is not a card designed for the
average gamer that wants to plop it in
their computer and go because it would
not be cost-effective there are plenty
of cards that can reach this level with
just the air cooling or water cooling
like this that do not come with the
price premium of the kingpin card
because this card is designed for the
xoc community the extreme overclockers
that want a card that don't require
having to solder power delivery custom
power delivery to the motherboard that
don't want to have to come up with
custom solutions for bypassing all of
the safeguards that are in place on
retail boards that's why kingpin
designed these cards is so that you can
plug in evbot take full control over it
you can remove all of the safeguards
through custom bios there's lots of
things you can do with this card that
just are not going to be and
user-friendly for the average consumer
myself included I have I've only played
with this level of overclocking once
under kingpin supervision which is why
I'm excited that in July we're gonna be
doing another thing with him at EVGA
headquarters regarding liquid nitrogen
cooling and all of that on this card so
I'm extremely excited for that so that's
why I kind of want to see where we can
get on my own just with this and maybe
hooking this radiator up to the air
conditioner to bring the temps down to
see what happens because what we do know
and they give me there's a whole guide
on the XOC community talking about I
think it's X dev talking about this card
and the temperature scale and what
happens to the core clock stability as
the temperature drops so they give us
this really nice chart that kind of
shows how temperature correlation with
stability goes hand-in-hand so until you
can get the temperatures under control
you're not going to get the core clock
stable at the higher frequencies as you
go at the higher frequency you also need
more voltage which is why having an
unlocked card like this with a custom
power delivery system designed
exclusively by kingpins team means that
this card is designed for that so that's
why you're gonna you might watch this
and go wow it makes sense it's that's
the same speed as he was getting with
the founders edition card but well
that's because under the same conditions
is what we're dealing with here whereas
the founders edition card actually it's
a much lower power limit so let's just
go ahead and say the trio card or the
Strix or whatever it's rough
same as that but here's we're gonna do
now let's let's chill it a little bit
here and see what happens
oh this is heavy this guy hasn't
come out in a while you're gonna come
out to play ha ha so it looks like
around 14c is where we are dropping
condensations under control because
we're not far enough below the dew point
to get any measurable condensation I
give anything it feels slightly moist
but there's nothing in the lines and
stuff it's not it's not cold enough
anytime we do this people freak out well
my god you the condensation no that'd be
like saying turning on the AC in your
room is gonna make the inside of your
walls condense and that's not the way
it's no question is now can we get 22:05
we we couldn't do this at all before
so there's your direct comparison to of
what visually that curve looks like of
core clock versus temperature because
this is 20s see colder than it was with
just the ambient air in the fans blowing
through the red but now that we're
blowing chilled air you can see we're
maxing out at 24 C 22:05 no problems
without touching voltage yet so what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna see
where we crash without touching voltage
and we'll see a voltage helps at all so
that's what we got with just hooking the
air conditioner up to it not touching
voltage and just give me a s'more
stability through temperature because
like I said earlier this shows how
temperature directly relates to
stability before voltage is even
involved so we're gonna go ahead and now
bring up the voltage tool and we are
going to we're gonna see what happens
all right so we decided this is probably
a pretty good place to stop here one we
reached 32 degrees C on our core temp
which it's not too hot but as we've
already talked about as this temp goes
up the core stability goes down we did
get it to pass 2200 we had a weird kind
of a spot right there which we didn't
have any other test so I'm not sure what
happened there our score did come up to
a 17,000 890 so we got more than 2000
graphics points higher with this
overclock a little bit over voltage but
also to the card was screaming at me it
said +5 volt too high and then all the
lights were flashing and everything and
I'm like come on baby come on it didn't
die and it didn't melt but it definitely
was warning me that the 5 volt was too
high what
interestings we didn't touch five volt
on here so I think it's some sort of an
algorithm when we moved the core slider
and stuff that could be completely
normal when you go that far in the
overclocks
with using the classified software I
don't know so I don't want to kill the
card yet but it's one of the kind of
overclock I said yeah it could happen
III at least wanted to play around with
some of these features because it's
something I never did on any of the
previous generations I'm a lot more
comfortable now with kind of playing
around with these extreme voltages and
stuff which we didn't do extreme today
will but I've been I've had fun this
last year playing around
lnto and all that sort of stuff so we're
going to probably end up putting a LNT
pot on this and seeing how far we can
get this to go so anyway that is that
nothing else to really talk about except
this card shouldn't make any sense to
you unless you're an extreme overclocker
or you want to play around with those
types of features and and money is not
really an object and taking the risk of
destroying the card and you want to have
those features readily available to you
without having to do any sort of custom
board modding and stuff so anyway if you
guys want to learn more about this card
you can head over to EVGA calm it's
extremely limited I have no idea how
many are being made it's probably hard
to get your hands on one now as it is
and they are really expensive because of
the custom one-off nature of this card
so guys tell me what you think down
below in the comments on how you feel
this card performed obviously with the
AI you hooked up to the AC it got us
above where we could go not by a whole
lot though you can see we only went from
2175 perfectly stable to 2205 and then
20 to 20 which is not a lot when we're
talking what 30 mega or 50 megahertz at
the most by giving it way more voltage
and dropping the temps with this but we
know this card likes to be around the
new minus 150 C on L n 2 so that's where
we're gonna see the really big overclock
alright guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you in the next one
well me students again ever touch the
computer for four days
how does computers well I would be like
my dad how do you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
