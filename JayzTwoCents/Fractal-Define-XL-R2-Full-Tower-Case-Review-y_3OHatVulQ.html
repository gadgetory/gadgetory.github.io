is Jays two cents and we're checking out
the defined XLR to full tower case by
fractal design when it comes to the
packing there's nothing really much to
say here they do put a lot of foam
protection on this case so I don't worry
about it getting damaged in shipping now
on the surface this case does not really
appear to be much of a flashy case don't
let that fool you there's a lot of
design effort that's gone into the
appearance of this case this model is
called titanium and the front door is a
brushed aluminum and it does have a
titanium tint to it it's very attractive
but the details don't stop there even
the case feet or chrome the top of the
case natively supports either to 120 or
to 140 millimeter fans as well as an
optional 120 or 140 millimeter fan mount
on the side panel take notice though
that there is no side window in this
case so if you want to show off the guts
of your PC to add a rear of the case has
a 140 millimeter fan pre-installed and
nine expansion slots the PSU does mount
at the bottom and it has a rubber ring
installed to reduce vibrations from the
power supply also located in the rear is
a fan filter that runs the entire length
of the bottom of the case to keep dust
from making its way inside your system
but keep in mind if you have the system
close to a wall it'll become difficult
to pull it out on the top of the case in
the front you will find your headphone
and microphone jack a reset button a
very cool looking power button with an
LED ring around it two USB 3.0 and two
USB 2.0 on the inside of the front door
you'll find four or five and a quarter
expansion slots and a removable air
filter for the front intake fans
you'll also notice some foam on the
inside of the door but we'll get to that
a little bit later behind the front
grille you'll find a pre-installed 140
millimeter fan as well as an expansion
for an extra 120 or 140 millimeter
intake fan as well as the intake filter
which the fans are mounted to and is
tool is removable for easy cleaning
fractal also includes a 12 7 and 5 volt
fan selector that can control up to
three fans allow
for either performance or silent
operation one of the things that fractal
design is really known for their efforts
and soundproofing computer systems the
side panels on this case are lined with
about 1/8 inch sound deadening material
that make the side panels very heavy
even the unused fan slots in this case
are using the same sound deadening
material in order to keep dust and sound
from making its way in and out of this
case remember the foam on the inside of
the door that we mentioned earlier yep
soundproofing material to further make
this case as quiet as possible fractal
definitely didn't leave all of its
design innovation only on the exterior
of the case the inside is very roomy you
have 8 hard drive expansion slots and
you have a 140 millimeter intake fan
pre-installed in the bottom of the case
the front IO cables are sleeved in black
so that they're not very unattractive
but they do leave a little link to be
desired I do however recommend moving
the 140 millimeter fan to the front of
the case for an extra intake one of the
features that I really like about the
hard drive cages is that you can remove
the middle cage and reinstall it
sideways to get better air flow across
the intake and into the case or if
you're not going to install any hard
drives in that cage at all you can
always remove it for optimal air flow
one of the things that I find very
unacceptable though is the fact that the
five-and-a-quarter bays are not to list
I have a hard time with that considering
even $50 cases have to list five and a
quarter base today now if you're
considering going water cooling in this
case you can fit a 240 millimeter
radiator up front as well as a 240
millimeter up top now keep in mind in
order to fit the radiator up front
you're going to have to remove both
harddrive cages which will require other
options for mounting your hard drives
when it comes to motherboard options it
does natively support ATX micro ATX mini
ITX e-atx
and XL ATX motherboards and all included
hardware comes in a box that has every
single screw that you could possibly
need to install any component
now it's time for my two cents and how I
feel about the fractal define Excel are
two full tower gaming case I wouldn't
really say it's a gaming case
technically it's more of an elegant case
that you would put somewhere that it's
going to be seen where you care about
how sleek the case is you're not
interested in showing off your
components because there's no side
window but I have to tell you the sound
deadening features of this case are
unlike anything I've ever heard indeed
if you run your fans on the seven volt
or even the 5 volt setting on this case
it is absolutely quiet I've built four
systems in this case this year alone and
have never had anyone be dissatisfied
with this case it's awfully heavy though
when you take into account the side
panels and the sound deadening material
that's inside this case I don't like the
fact that they installed the 140
millimeter fan in the bottom when you
install a fan on the bottom and you're
pulling air up from the ground or the
carpet of the floor even though you have
a filter there you're going to pull a
lot of dirt in with it so like I said in
the review I definitely recommend that
you take that bottom fan and move it to
the front that way you have two intake
fans in the front unfortunately the
front of this case is very restrictive
when it comes to intake fans especially
if you're running the hard drives right
behind those fans I haven't noticed any
sort of temperature issues inside the
cases whatsoever including the fact that
I was overclocking an AMD 8 core 8350 in
one of these with absolutely no issues
whatsoever and that was on air cooling
not water you can't install water
cooling in this case but it's going to
be a bit tight up top because there's
not a whole lot of room between the top
of the case and the top of the
motherboard so you can easily fit a 30
millimeter thick radiator as well as 25
millimeter fans in either push or pull
but push-pull configuration is not going
to work with this case at least not on
the top of the case because you're going
to have clearance issues with the
motherboard however on the front of the
case you have plenty of room to do a
push-pull radiator configuration I
definitely feel that this case is worth
it if you're looking for something
that's different than your standard
flashy you know crazy curves crazy
design looking case this is definitely
the way
the brushed aluminum front is just sexy
as hell there's no way around it and
it's definitely worth looking at every
time you walk by this case and you look
at it you're going to look at it you're
going to think wow that is just an
awesome looking case the side panels are
a little bit boring especially with the
120 or 140 millimeter intake square on
the side but you can obviously mod the
side panel if you want to go that route
but anyway this has been Jays 2 cents
