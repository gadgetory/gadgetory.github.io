going to be water-cooling some 10 80s
coming up here pretty soon for the
skunkworks
update so I like to take the opportunity
when I can to show you guys something to
do with water cooling and every single
time I've upgraded my graphics cards and
done water cooling blocks I've done a
tutorial on how to install said blocks
and we're going to be using the e K FC
1080 GTX full cover nickel plexi water
block for this tutorial I don't have a
black back plate at the time of doing
this tutorial but when I do the
skunkworks builds I will have one but
the reason why I really want to do this
video is I've not taken this card apart
yet and seems when people say that the
back plates are kind of hard to get off
on these I'm not sure if that's true or
not so I figured well let's do it
together and see whether or not that
claim holds any water and then you know
same time you guys might actually learn
something so let's go ahead and rip this
thing apart that's always fun I love
taking stuff apart if you're a hardcore
gamer and love to customize stuffed and
check this out because mass drop has a
drop going for the might ODS a sci-fi ki
cap set buyers have the choice to build
whatever custom kits they want including
color schemes and layouts they even have
layouts for planked pre on ik ergo docks
and non-standard layouts for razer
corsair logitech in coolermaster and
heck they even have Nordic German and UK
layouts covered as well for full details
about this drop head to the link down
the description one of the things that
makes a 1080 a little different than
other reference cards with the exception
of the standard 90 80 not the 980ti
is that it has a backplate typically
nvidia doesn't put back plates on their
cards but this time they did because
they're trying to make it a retail card
and for ya they put it back plate in
it's it's a nice black plate it's
plastic but some folks have said it's
hard to get off and I'm not sure if
that's true or not now taking a look
here I can see there's a lot of tiny
tiny little Phillips head screws on this
thing then a couple of larger standard
Phillips head screws and of course
you've got your GPU spring loaded screws
right here so I don't see anything
really that looks too difficult it's got
a seam right here so this looks like
this is a different part than the front
so it's gonna be a two piece back plate
it looks like so I've got this guy here
just a little T handled screwdriver
husky brands it's a Lowe's brand but
it's got some bits that
fit down in there now these aren't gonna
be on there too too tight again because
this is plastic but you certainly don't
want to strip one of those out that
would suck these of our this back plates
actually already been taken off before
ek had this card before me
well actually I shouldn't say before me
I had the card and then I sent it to ek
for them to verify their block design on
because for whatever reason Nvidia did
not send them a card so I sent them mine
and they've already taken this thing
apart but these screws are so freakin
tiny I mean you can kind of get an idea
right there just how small those screws
are really really small it's one of the
reasons why I like the t-handle or any
sort of ratcheting screwdrivers I can
keep downward force on it and then I can
just turn this get the screw out and it
doesn't pop off or slide off or anything
like that especially you're dealing with
such tiny screws I know the video just
really doesn't show you how small these
screws are so all of the screws for the
back half have been taken off and
there's that you can see it just comes
right off so I so far this seems pretty
pretty dang straightforward the only
thing I can see here and each one of the
places where there would be a screw when
these tiny little backplate screws is a
standoff a threaded standoff that they
screw into so I mean I guess you just
have to go through and take each one of
these off but that that's really just a
little bit of an extra step it's not
that big of a deal look like they might
be maybe a four millimeter now with the
reference cards this also screws right
here on the face that you have to take
off there's one right there and one
right here so you have to make sure you
take those two screws out as well I'll
remove these two right here though
because the other screws are actually
holding the outputs here to the shield
that way they don't break when you plug
in your port for your cables so it's
just these two in the middle left to
come off
okay then over here in the corner we
have a couple of regular sized screws so
these are spring-loaded once you get
them completely threaded out they'll
just pop up these hold tension exactly
on the four corners of the GPU core ah I
missed the screw so you could take off
the backplate without having to undo
those four screws I thought so would
seem weird if we couldn't so there we go
there's our two-piece backplate taken
off and here you can see the 1080
doesn't have any Ram mounted on the back
of the GPU so adding an aftermarket
backplate to this will add a little bit
of heat dissipation from a company like
ek because it puts a thermal pad right
here on the back of the die a lot of
heat actually comes off the back of the
core right here and then the plate can
help dissipate some of that heat but a
plate like this here this is this is
purely aesthetics this is purely an
aesthetic backplate I got really lucky I
just happen to have a four millimeter
socket in here don't even ask me why I
remember why but it's the size that you
need to remove these standoffs here so
if you guys are wondering it is a four
millimeter that you need here all right
there we go it looks like I got all of
them I don't see any of them missed here
let's go ahead pull this apart gently
it'll be gentle because the pace makes a
pretty good bond when it gets heated and
yeah there we go just like that now
inside the ek packaging you're going to
get all the screws and hardware that you
need to install your block thermal paste
plugs allen keys you've got your thermal
pads here what's interesting is the pads
are pre-cut for the RAM but they're not
pre-cut for anything else you will need
scissors to cut these and the
instructions here will tell you what to
cut and where to put it I always
recommend I know us men are like we
don't need instructions but yeah you
should you should really pay attention
to the instructions trust me and then of
course we have the block in all of its
glory look at this
I think the nickel plexi block looks so
good I like nice clear blocks it looks
very very elegant I guess would be the
word and if you look at the way it is on
the card it looks like that it just
looks so nice now I like to keep the
boxes a bit of a workbench if you will
because this hangs down when you go to
flip that over to put your back plates
or your you know screws on the back of
the card it can actually hang off the
edge like that it gives you a better
area to work on because we do it like
that then the block is going to fall and
it makes it a little harder so I keep
the block around on the box around is a
bit of a workbench so I'm already
cleaned off the GPU core right here I
use isopropyl alcohol and a lint free
cloth of some sort a lot of people like
to use coffee filters those tend to work
pretty well but I'm now referencing the
instructions here so I can see which of
the pads go where now you've got a
thicker pad a half millimeter pad and a
one millimeter pad so number three here
is the one millimeter as you can see
it's what's going to be covering all the
VRMs back there number two is going to
be a thinner pad and it is the one that
gets put on all of the chokes right here
the square things are the chokes so
we're going to be actually active
cooling the VRMs right back here and
then the chokes for those as well so
what I like to do that way I know which
way to cut is I like to just kind of
take it here put it where I need it to
go and then push it down like this push
it real hard because then it makes an
imprint on here and how why you can pick
it up it makes an imprint and I can see
exactly at that point where I need to
cut let me see if I can get this ah
there we go like that you can see where
the components are so now I know where I
can cut my length sometimes pulling off
the backing is the hardest part now it
might stretch a little bit too when you
pull the backing off because it is
really really soft so if it does he
might trim it down just a little bit
more did stretch a little bit when I
pull it off the backing so I'm going to
trim it like that
place and there once that's in place and
we need to peel off blue backing just
like that so there's one set of thermal
pads and I basically do the exact same
thing here for the the chokes I'm also
going to cut this one a little bit long
ways because it is a little bit too wide
and these don't have to be perfect you
just have to make contact and lay it
across just like that make sure it's
nice and sticky if you find that your
thermal pad doesn't stick it might still
have some residue left over from the
pads that come on the factory cooler
these are very greasy so you might find
that that's the reason why it's not
sticking very good so if that's the case
take some alcohol rub it on the
component so let the alcohol dry use
compressed air to help dry it and then
you'll find it will stick a lot better
the same goes for the the RAM now the
nice thing about the thermal pads for
the RAM is it is already cut now once
all the thermal pads are on it's time to
do the thermal paste and they include a
non-conductive eco therm ek Tim they
call it thermal interface materials with
Tim stands for now this is the part
everyone likes to get controversial
about how do you put it on well as you
can see right here on the instructions
ek recommends the x+ across now
obviously when you have an opening as
big as the tip of this thing how ladies
it gets a little bit difficult to do
that without there being a ton of
paste so i'ma think on this one here
because his diet is pretty small I'm
just going to do the cross it's going to
be more than enough thermal compound
what we really want to make sure here
though is that we don't actually do a
dot there dot there dot there done there
I know that just looks really globby and
ugly but again you guys know it's really
difficult to get a nice thin stream of
paste what matters is that every square
millimeter of this is covered it's okay
if it squishes out along the side but
you obviously if you put way too much
nothing terrible's going to happen watch
this video right here if you guys don't
believe me but this is more than enough
and it's not too too
it's more important that you have enough
rather than too little so what we're
going to do now is we're going to line
up our our water block here flip it over
now you guys can see why I like to use
the box and if you were using a back
plate at this time you would use the
manual for the back plate to see which
screws you can put on first then you put
on the back plate and then use the back
plate screws to connect the rest of it
together like a sandwich because I don't
have a back plate yet those are coming
in the mail and this isn't one of the
cards that's actually going in
skunkworks at the moment I'm just going
to I'm finishing out this video for the
sake of it show you guys how it goes
together now you want to use these
little plastic standoffs oh these little
plastic washers here every time you use
a screw that way it doesn't bite into
the actual card material itself
these also just make sure that the
screws themselves aren't going to be
shorting out or pinching on anything
also the manual says to do it so so
that's why I'm doing it now I always
start with the four corners around the
GPU first because that's obviously where
the most important amount of torque be
put down on the card or the block
because we want to make sure the GPU is
getting nice even torque on it so we get
good thermal compound spread as well as
making sure that we're not going to be
overheating because we have any sort of
gaps in there now tighten down till snug
and do a star pattern again that's a
cross pattern go diagonally and then go
to the other corner then go diagonal
again now we're going to get nice even
pressure on the block and the die don't
over tighten you can easily strip out
the block remember it is made of copper
so if you over tighten this then you end
up stripping the block and then you
don't do yourself any favors whatsoever
and then once you're done just give it a
little bit of an extra turn again not
too much force and that is all you have
to do so your work from these corners
right here these four don't get any
screws but you're going to work outward
till the entire block is done now in
this corner right here you're going to
use one of the screws and nuts that come
with the es screw nut I get it so you're
going to use the one that comes with the
kit right here to make sure that this
front plate has something to screw into
because that's actually where the front
plate mounts right there to the card if
you don't do that
they
you couldn't you know end up putting too
much torque on this plate and bend it
and you don't want to do that all right
there we go fully installed and like I
said if you were doing the back plate
the only difference is like these outer
screws right here typically are the ones
that mount the back plate down so you
put the plate on with its thermal pad
right here and then put the screws for
the plate on there and then there's your
back plate but yeah as you can see right
there not too difficult and it looks
pretty slick
so there it is GTX 1080 water cooled now
we'll be doing some testing with this
guy here to see if water cooling gets us
any additional Headroom when it comes to
overclocking I don't expect to too much
but I hope temperatures stay really
really low that was one of the nice
things about the standard 980 was the
fact that temperatures were super low
with that compared to the big maxwell
chip like Titan X and 980ti which got
significantly hotter in my loop than the
980 s did so it'd be nice to be in those
temps down I'm actually thinking about
going with 210 ATS instead of three not
because of the three-way conflict but
really about heat and really there being
more more power in there than I truly
need but anyway it's an enthusiast build
and I guess going over the top is kind
of what we do around here isn't it every
guys thanks for watching I just want to
make this quick video where I document
putting on the block because I know that
there's people out there they're going
to be watching for that make sure you
guys if you guys going to get EK blocks
make sure you use the EK configurator to
make sure it's going to work with your
card as of as of the filming of this
video the only card that is supported by
EK is water blocks is our EK water
blocks is going to be the founders
edition PCB or reference PCB they might
come out with other boards in the future
but as of right now the founders is the
only one that's actually included with
the lineup and is covered no pun
intended
alright guys thanks for watching in as
always i will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
