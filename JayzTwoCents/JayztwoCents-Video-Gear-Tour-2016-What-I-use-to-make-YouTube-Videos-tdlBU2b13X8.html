honest I'm uh kind of impressed by its
proportions I know right all right let
me show you something here
I kind of like the thin ones but this
one is about form-factor
yeah but mine can fit in tight spaces
with girth you can open tight spaces
it's like a master key whether you like
thick or thin the ITX lineup from
fractal design is sure to have something
that tickles your fancy remember it's
not the size that matters it's all about
how you use it not it's definitely the
girth don't finis Garrett Dean no
contest no there's contents obscured so
I asked you guys on Twitter recently if
you were interested in learning more
about the equipment that I use on a
regular basis to bring you content and I
thought it might be fun to show you guys
kind of the progression because there
was an overwhelming response to that
tweet saying that you guys really wanted
to see this video and I haven't done one
of these in a couple of years so I
figured why not we'll go and show you
the equipment that I use now to bring
you content where I started where I am
today some of the reasons why I have
upgraded the way that I did and I want
to emphasize if you're trying to start a
channel or you're on a limited budget
you don't need the stuff that I'm
showing you today it's one of those
things where there's a progression that
kind of happens as your channel grows
your equipment kind of grows with you
you don't need to run out and spend
thousands of dollars on equipment
because you're not gonna see a return on
that investment when you don't have the
viewership yet so just start off simple
use what you have available to heck you
can even use a webcam with like a Yeti
my core a blue snowball or something on
your computer and get the job done
here's what I want you guys to do before
you continue with this video I'm gonna
put a link right here to my very first
video I want you guys to see where I've
started versus where I am today that we
can understand what it was I said about
the equipment growing and progressing
with your channel all right so now that
you've done that or hopefully you've
actually watched at least the first 30
second let's say 30 seconds of your time
watching that terrible video that was
shot on this guy right here a Canon t2i
that I own I think it's a 550d for the
European counterpart I own this already
because I bought it to do family photos
when Little J was born it does it's a
still camera
is first and foremost always a still
camera even the Martin the the 5d mark 4
is still a still camera so when you
shoot video in DSLR there are
compromises to be had no in this guy
right here you only did 1080 30 you guys
gave me a hard time about why am i was
shooting 1080 30 and i'm like 30 is fine
for talking head 60 is for a bit for
games and I still agree with that but it
doesn't have an articulating screen I
couldn't see myself I couldn't get
focused as you guys saw in that video it
was very very difficult as a one-man
operation the other thing is it
overheats like a boss when it comes to
shooting 1080 on this guy I could get
about five to eight minutes of recording
time before I'd start getting a little
flashing temp sensor on here telling me
hey the thing is overheating and that
was indoors if I was outside in the Sun
it was even worse so the other thing
that really sucked about shooting with
this guy here was the audio you have to
get audio in here somehow and it only
has a 3.5 millimeter jack on there so
what do you do well I bought at h4n from
Guitar Center which was neat because I
had X has XLR inputs on there so I could
use my sennheiser it was like $100
handheld mic that I'd like a vocal might
be you would sing and to not talk into
at a distance and I had that literally I
wish I still had pictures of this I
literally had it duct-taped to a tripod
to use off-camera not a bad setup the
execution was poor I didn't know what
the hell I was doing
anyway fast forward it had I had a magic
lantern on this helped it overcame some
issues that I had but eventually with
all the overheating in this thing it
finally died the power supply in this is
dead there's no point in fixing this it
would cost more to fix than the camera
is worth so fast forward to this guy
yeah what the hell is this thing it's
monstrosity of a camera this is what
happens when you decide you still want
to shoot on DSLR and you have to
overcome the obstacles of shooting on a
DSLR so what you see here is a Canon 70d
that I bought two years ago with an h5
on top again the same reason this h5 is
on here as the t2 I you've got to get
the audio somehow from mic to the camera
this is the solution
h5 it's also got a defocused follow
focus on here that way I could get
focused pulling a lot easier I like to
do a lot of documentary style cinema
style videos on my own that you guys
have never even seen I just like to
shoot video and this was what I came up
with it's got a quick release plate on
here most of this is like eBay stuff
total knockoff and we're not talking
like Redrock micro or anything super
expensive on there
the problem was shooting on a rig like
this one it's really heavy oh and then
lens on here too I bought at the same
time as the camera it's a Canon 17 to 55
millimeter EFS it's a crop sensor lens
it's a crop Center camera so it's fine
and it's got a F 2.8 so you guys have
seen that nice depth of field what
you're seeing right now in this video is
actually f 2.2 if you were curious but
that's kind of a sides a point so the
problem is this is heavy and you get
very tiring and I do have a shoulder
part that goes to this if you guys
remember I put that together if you see
es a couple years ago the problem is
it's does the limitations of very bad
battery life on this thing so to carry
like an army of batteries with you
external batteries for Canon DSLRs are
not very plentiful the only option would
have been to also put on a battery grip
that can hold two batteries make an even
bigger bulkier and heavier but at least
I had an articulating screen but this is
exactly the step I've been shooting with
now for nearly two years
and I decided it's time for an upgrade
because again the sensor is good but low
light is terrible it's very noisy and
low light because it's a small sensor
and it's a mirror sensor so this the
sensor is actually far away from the
glass it's being bounced off a mirror
one other piece of forgot to show you
though was that I also have this eye cup
right here actually very nice eye cup
that magnetically attaches and not the
magnetic ring it actually has this
magnetic piece right there that slides
into a slot ladies and so when you're
running and gunning at least you can get
three points of contact if you didn't
want to use the shoulder piece but
anyway I want to do more vlogs and
things and you guys know that this is
not easy to carry around maybe you don't
know I just told you so I should about
this guy right here this is my Sony
Handycam it's a 4k camera
it's the ax 33 FDR ax 33 I believe and
it does 4k it does 60fps 10
1080 it also does I believe 120 720 I
don't shoot 720 for anything but this is
what I use now when you guys see and I
doing vlogs out and about like coconut
monkey now we'll go to my croissant or
whatever
this is what we shoot on look how small
this is I mean this looks a little bit
less ridiculous and then of course on
here we have a Sennheiser MKE 440 stereo
shotgun mic it's got amazing audio
quality on this thing and what I like
about it is it's got various functions
on here like low-pass filter it's got
three it's got audio gain on here three
levels of audio gain and the batteries
this is the same batteries that shipped
to me with over a month ago and I've
used the hell out of this thing and it's
still going and it outputs directly into
three-and-a-half millimeter jack so you
could use it on a camera like this you
can put this on the DSLR when you're out
and about and it's perfect
so yeah the only problem is there's no
XLR or anything on this obviously so if
I want to use a boom mic like I'm using
right now above me it's right that's
right here no yeah yeah so we're
capturing audio like that I'll show you
that in a second this would go on the
DSLR to move the h5 when I'm out and
about lens wise though I do have a few
lenses I showed you the 17 to 55
millimeter I also have this Rokinon 24
millimeter cine lens so it's completely
manual it's got a manual iris control
and got manual focus control but it's an
F 1.5 it is it gives you super milky
bokeh milky bokeh that massive depth of
field we get a nice blurred background
and really crisp detail because it's a
prime lens it means it doesn't have a
bunch of elements in there like a zoom
lens that are moving in and out that can
sometimes cause a little bit of
fuzziness but I also have the kit lens
which came with the 70d and I put that
on the t2i
until the t2 I you know completely it
worked for a little while after it went
bad I was gonna use it as like a B cam
yeah it died I also have of course my
nifty 50 no Canon owner without a nifty
50 everyone's gonna have it it's a
hundred bucks it gets the job done 50
millimeter F one point eight it's very
cheap its plastic II drop it it will
break but so what am i using now I just
showed you all of this so what the heck
am i recording on I can't wait to show
you so this is my new pride and joy here
on the channel this is my sony FS 5 very
expensive camera body please do not
start with using this camera body it's
got its got uses I'm gonna use it for in
the future and I can't wait to actually
show you some of those videos in fact
there's a video I can show you that I
already shot and it went up on the
second channel will show you that in a
minute for a lens this is my
my 18 to 35 it is an F 1.8 lens is not
image stabilized so it's perfect for
tripod shots like this it's extremely
crisp what I like about it is when I
move the focus is super smooth and when
i zoom it in and zoom it out the camera
lens length does not change the element
does not push out at the end but as you
can see out here it's got articulating
arm and that is a shot that you guys
just saw obviously there's the chair and
stuff it's got a sennheiser emmy 66 it
is a phantom power acceptable or a
single double a battery acceptable in
there I love everything about this
camera that I can't wait to start doing
more stuff with this 4k you guys might
have noticed this video is in 4k but it
also does 1080p 240 FPS slow-mo so if
you look at the video I'm gonna put up
in a minute you guys can see some of the
features of that guy but what's cool
that this camera as it breaks down the
handle comes off the grip over here
which I use to control a lot of the
features comes off the monitor can come
off the mic can come off and it can
break down to just the body here with
the viewfinder right here which is cool
about this viewfinder is it is it is a
full-color OLED display that is insane
so when you don't even need the LCD on
there to shoot and if I was to put
something like the nifty 50 on there
then it's going to be you know a super
small light run-and-gun camera I do have
a meta bones adapter on there though
because this is a sony e-mount camera
and I'm using my Canon glass I want to
keep my lenses so I am using a meta
bones adapter I do also have a speed
booster on there but I'm gonna be
returning the speed booster the problem
is I'm using crop lenses here so the
speed booster adds a black ring around
it and it actually adds a little bit of
fuzziness to it so I'm just gonna remove
turn the speed booster and just keep the
standard adapter something else that I
kind of take serious or more serious
than I used to now is lighting you see
I've got these soft boxes these soft
boxes are junk I got these off of Amazon
they always want to fall over they're
always their flimsy as hell the head
constantly wants to like noon just kind
of sag down because the joint in there
really really sucks but they get the job
done for now I do want to update these
two variable color LED lighting but
that's very expensive and LED lighting
could also
could add Flickr it depends on the
quality that you get and this is my
audio technica 4053 be shotgun mic you
can see by the size of my hand just how
small it is hey stop that but it's a
hyper-cardioid mic not a super cardioid
so it's got a tighter pickup pattern
which helps me block off a lot of like
the computer sounds the air conditioner
running stuff like that so when I'm
doing my talking videos it's perfect and
it's actually attached to a boom arm
that I use it's actually intended for
like a hair light like this is intended
to hold another light up above your head
to get a nice hair light but I use it as
a boom arm for my mic and in my tripod
here it's just an e image it's a fluid
head it's not as good as a Manfrotto so
I'm probably gonna update that in the
future but this is what I use when I do
my my pans and stuff like that and then
over here I do also have a slider as you
can see it's got a really cheap ball hit
or a video tripod mount on there it
moves pretty smooth I'm not a huge fan
of sliders that aren't motorized because
a human can't move this as smoothly as a
motor can obviously so I actually don't
use it a whole lot but yeah at least I
have that in the arsenal so one tip I
want to show you real quick here is as I
was shooting obviously with this guy in
4k which is one of the reasons why I got
it if I'm shooting something and I want
to talk to the camera if I had the mic
turned forward
I'll just sound like the echo bouncing
off the room so I turn it backwards and
then I turned down the gain on it so
just a little bit of a tip there is that
way when I'm talking to it the mic is
pointing at me ah genius right you'd be
surprised how many times I did it the
other way so if you want to see the FS 5
super slow-mo in action then head on
over to this channel right here it's my
second channel cars and vlogs with J's 2
cents where I do like car stuff and just
regular vlogs I talk about weight loss
all kinds of crazy stuff up there it's
just another channel where I put things
that I don't think fit on the main
channel as much so I put it over there
so you can click this video watch that
and you'll see what the super-slow-mo is
like it's like a super dramatic sexy car
washing of Nick's car moving on there's
one last piece of equipment I want to
show you guys that I haven't actually
used yet on the main channel I use it a
little bit in the vlog Channel and that
is the fact that I do have a DJI Osmo
that I want to try finding some uses for
I I thought it would fit in somewhere so
I
it and we'll actually do something with
that in the future but guys that's the
equipment that I'm using right now to
bring you my content I think the
contents gonna get better especially
with the fs5 because I'm not having to
overcome challenges with equipment the
fs5 is freaking amazing I want to do
amazing things for this channel that's
one of the reasons why as time has gone
on with the equipment I want better
equipment so I can return the investment
to you guys that you guys invest in me
with your views to give you the best
possible content that's worth watching
so that's why the progression of
equipment anyway guys time to go thanks
for watching you guys requested it I did
it I know it's not a whole lot of like
real camera work or anything happening
with this video but the information is
there thanks for watching guys and as
always I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
