that's at
this is a travel vlog
brought to you by fractal design check
out fractal design and use Celsius as 36
estimate but not seriously though they
did sponsor the trip we are on our way
right now to LAX to pick up fractal josh
who's flying in we're going to stopping
by hurts hurts is also chipped in for
this trip they are paying for our
accommodations which is a huge thing for
us because we are road tripping I'm
taking skunkworks we're taking the
builds that were built during the build
off I finished painting the front of
mine with the problems and what did you
do yours I had just that the wiring we
just did I love that there get I
rearranged to the wiring and fixed the
hood scoop so that goes function how do
you fix the hood scoop so as function oh
you flip the fan around yeah this is my
first time taking my system to PD
excellent and this is my first PD
excellent ever this is your first actual
land ever yeah like a real land I don't
mean like for friends in a house well
excuse me and my birthday parties it was
8th fret at Chuck E Cheese no in my
house we did 2x boxes for on floor with
halo it was the best
the best the best it was is the greatest
deal in a history of ever
we're in traffic now yeah we're trying
to get to Josh it GPS says I'm facing a
totally different way than I actually am
which is funny give it give it some time
to orient it go it's nice we gotta go
down here and turn around I'm gonna suck
because
well it's LA and it sucks like just
pointed out the back window they'll see
the traffic the line of cars we were
supposed to be in that Lane but I ain't
getting in that Lane I know better than
to get in that Lane no we made it to
Hertz we're gonna pick up Josh or we
have to pick up the car right no he's
picking up the car we're just signing
our name on it because we're gonna be
driving it - because we're all three of
us are driving to get to Sacramento
tonight so we're gonna be driving - like
way late in the night we're gonna have
fun right no when I got a haircut I did
- we just we just have to look for a
tall redheaded tree walking around
that's what we got it up found him one
of the cool parts about being sponsored
by Hertz on part of this trip is the
fact that we get to pick the car the
problem is we can't find it first
problem is we can't seem to figure how
to put down the headrests how many how
many idiots does it take - three three
collectively between the three of us we
are half of a normal brain but you know
what this vehicle should be large enough
and it's free I wouldn't say it's free I
would say I still have to sit in a car
with you for four days total I'm gassy
so that's gonna be fun we kind of go up
but GPS and we missed our turn we
totally did not we're just taking the
scenic route
it's fine at least a isn't here yet use
the left lane - to a marathon -
Rosecrans right now
hello everybody how's it going I got the
first stop we go to is like food we
haven't even really left town yet we
have to get the priorities down yeah
these are major keys we're not even
gonna make it in until like midnight to
where we're going halfway so we're going
about about 500 miles today
yeah good eight hours give or take
that's a plan he's already traveled like
2,000 miles or some chairs yeah yeah I
got up I went to bed at two o'clock in
the morning got up at four o'clock in
the morning and yeah it sucks and he's
the one driving yeah I'm kind of excited
for this land party though because this
is I mean I've been to PDX three other
times but they were always with systems
at Puget system built and no take an
incredible way from Puget it's just like
it kind of sucked to get there and then
have to install my games and stuff so
for the first time I'm gonna be there
with the system skunkworks
and it's all ready to go so that's me
cool and I was gonna have uh I let him
wave through and they took my spot
see what happens when you're nice I know
this thing is like geez where do you
make birth so you see we've driven about
well 14 feet since we got our food and
now it's first first stop on the road
trip we've been on the road for six
minutes we made it from LAX to the
studio and now like just to the nearest
food place Ajay's give him coffee
we should leave deal dude you know oh we
could sell skunkworks you can make it
Mexico in time then Craigslist I really
don't know how to get back to the
language menu no so your last names
since that's French right in the middle
men's - no I'm getting ready to frost a
two different sizes yeah I don't know
I'm just trying to get it to talk to us
we're all lonely we don't want to talk
to each other and like it'll tell you
like you'll restate what your next terms
well you don't have to do anything for
four mile five miles so whoa Oh God oh
wait what happened there's get it
no wait that's just the reverb which one
was mute I think no because the active
button is black right yes but that's
what it was on right like that no that
was the other one why can't it be a
slider
I wasn't amused we were they crank the
heat on me when I was getting us coffee
earlier only because I made it a point
to make it colder on my side of the car
okay so now last time I touched the
screen the little thing you caught that
now it's not popping up
okay we'll try that courtesy when we
make five Newark
whoa the cameras apparently tired too it
won't focus it's super yellow in here
like the white balance isn't changing
who cares right
we made it well admit it halfway how
many hours were we in the car today
eight nine hey I think we made a few
stops Lauren - why do you say when
you're leaving me I feel triggered okay
so we spent we got in the car today
actually headed up this way about four
o'clock in the afternoon that doesn't
count the drive back from LA to my house
and the studio to pick up the gear and
stuff all in all today has been a very
long day in the car definitely stay
tuned though because this is going to be
well the video is not gonna stop for you
guys but for us it's sobbing we're gonna
be doing our truck stop challenge
tomorrow we don't even know that sounds
really dirty huh yeah guys creative ways
to earn money go jackhammer I say what
we do is each person goes in we buy you
the most off-brand looking candy that we
can find or the weirdest looking food
and then we draw straws or something and
then whereas a shortest straw gets to
pick last how do we get to us do we just
have to like cut one probably one of the
17 drinks tops tomorrow 140 in the
morning so it's time to go to bed we got
a 7:00 a.m. wake-up call to get to PDX
plan seven hour drive seven and a half
hour drive we'll find a way stretch that
out so we'll see you all tomorrow
morning morning everybody so we're awake
sort of we overslept by 1.5 hours oops
yeah I said we got a 7 a.m. wake-up call
well we got up at 8:30 because that's 7
plus 1.5 although the 5 is more like a 3
in this case 8:30
day my eyes are bloodshot look at my
eyes on my god would you stay over there
are you stupid
we have what 7 hours and 8 minutes left
to go yeah one of them fancy doors sure
hope you're gonna have a nice day it's
really nice out there pretty good
weather and everything okay oh yes yes
stroller race
you should be there like the girl with
ya it's so pretty here look at this so
we have a problem here and I and I
totally predicted this yesterday which
is why I drove for like oh I don't know
probably 3/5 of the drive you are now
we're get started mentioning it alright
yesterday I was going much faster than
that something you guys have to know
about Nick that's a really tight turn
slow down what's wrong with you Nick is
probably one of the most timid skittish
here to get people I know we overslept
by an hour and a half and now we got
Nick at the wheel first that way Josh
and I could pick up the slack at the
tail end of the relay race this area is
very pretty though I'm being forced to
it to basically acknowledge the nature
and look out the windows since we have 1
X and I have 1 X that means no signal
and here in the mountains it's just like
on TV look the clouds
the clouds are just resting in the hills
what do you think Josh the thing it
looks really beautiful up here the
Pacific Northwest that were heading
towards maybe not in yet what do you
think Nick it's pretty I'm not looking
at anything beyond its name from the
vehicle
anybody knows he's does that look of
fear in his face
we are actually in weed California right
now completely unplanned 187 % unplanned
I'm taking the RV entry exit because of
the size of this vehicle
yeah it's itsel and yeah so basically
what we've decided is that we're gonna
go into a truck stop we're gonna burn a
pilot travel center as we are lots of
people here and we're going to try to
pick the grossest possible thing or the
most random candy food whatever each one
of us gets to pick one and then we're
gonna draw straws and the person with
the shortest straw gets last choice so
they will most likely get the worst
thing that's silver it's all gonna suck
but but we also don't know how bad it is
so we could end up choosing one that's
all right yeah hey good we might we
might find a new favorite meal Nick what
do you think like this each of us bought
something gross to eat that we think is
really gross yeah from a truck stop and
basically we're gonna do
rock-paper-scissors and whoever loses
gets last choice so let's show my
choices okay so Jay explained your
choice you got well I hate pickles and I
thought what sounds worse than a van
Holton's hot mama hot and spicy pickle
it's one sassy pickle as you can see now
so room temp and it's been in this
package since who knows how long is that
a manufacturer date do you have to do a
bite and drink the juice I chose the
Tijuana mama pickled sausage because she
sounds kind of good we don't know it's
been shitty on the field without chewing
and then I went ahead and picked each
Clif sardines in Sweden which Jay is not
too happy about I hate seafood with a
passion I won't eat it cooked I told
them if I if I if I get last pick I will
absolutely bitch out because I know for
a fact
no one's gonna pick that first or second
one two three show oh I ain't last wait
we all we all read we all won because I
cam he beat you you beat me
[Laughter]
keep going into some losses okay so okay
I quit for the clip I'm out of here
no no no no I told you this would happen
I told you my next first picnic you know
you want the sardines you were like I'm
gonna do it cuz Jays a little bit yeah
yeah the drink juice first I know so
Josh are you gonna pick the Tijuana
Obama or the sardines no I don't know I
mean there's so many good choices it's I
feel like this one's gonna be least
disgusting you really cuz you like
pickles don't the pickle the dirt
it's really not that bad huh not that
bad
can I kick that one mm-hmm no I'm trying
to decide we know where you're going
with this I know you do it tell you what
if you if you bite if you do one I'll do
one in addition to mine it's kind of
good oh oh
I squeezed out two farts it's no better
be common I can't do this I said I
cannot you can do it you know no I can't
I believe that was gonna be the little
tiny ones I'm done this is a
hole like chunk of fish I believe
nothing the whole thing huh oh you know
what just the bait no I can't let the
airclimber
that's just sausage kind of weird on the
inside - oh it's dude
oh I gotta get on my hands Oh what if I
just take a little the water you think
that's gonna be better
I don't know cuz I can chase it I have
to chew the water okay get guys
I always thought sardines were like the
tiny little little tiny little fishes
why is that so big
oh look at it let's go tails on it oh
dude all right broke this is not happen
- oh my god no wait I'm good
that's right give me one tell my leg
what's that I don't know what is chain
it's okay you ready do it
no that's it now I think I win with
picking the grossest thing try some no
come on
alright sardine okay that wasn't that
bad after the second bite there okay I
cannot do seafood period
this is peaking cooks and seafood so
this you want a fish and chips not bad
huh
Oh spikey that's not too bad it's spicy
bitch I bought a CB radio that way I can
keep my ears on we're smoking
well this is basically the trip for me
so far and this is why I have that face
whatever we do live stream some
periscope
what is this dude I don't appreciate
this so there's like a third or fourth
stop we finally stopped for some real
food quote-unquote Jay it was amazing
it's called was it vintage in the
vintage in it's pretty good I had the
turkey bum just take your sandwich the
bomb it was the bomb huh did you have I
had the country fried steak cuz you
can't go to a country place and not try
the country fried steak
we just got to Portland and we're
driving under this like gondola thing
and where is it thank you see right here
this so there's like a gondola that will
hang on this this thing here it goes
like all the way across the city or
something at that uh we need to do that
Josh wants to go on it and I'm afraid of
heights so I'm kind of like hail no but
I think it's good Nikki down for it yeah
yeah look at that
you shut up I also I'm not sure if that
poop on my shoe right there look how
look how smooth this traffic is flowing
look hey he's driving was now looking
this is why all right the next time you
see us we will be at PDX land probably
maybe horses or sizzler or gas station
or there's a shell or another truck stop
or just crying on the side of the road
slightly bright just a wee bit bright
yeah this is not honoring it all right
Nikki first PDX equality to the
environment I like it so far it's pretty
neat we like a lot of custom systems
right yeah a ton visit like though
there's a big one up front I really
liked but problems had its own like
reservoir wall type of thing yeah how's
it going everybody we finally made it
here after what 15 hours 16 hours of
driving I think yeah without killing
