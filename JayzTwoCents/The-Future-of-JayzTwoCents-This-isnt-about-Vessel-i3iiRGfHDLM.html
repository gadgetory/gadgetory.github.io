and if you guys : social media I made
kind of a big announcement and I thought
that maybe with the amount of comments
and stuff that were going around it
might be a right time to do a Jays to
send state of the channel and I would
like to immediately start off by stating
yes I have a cold sore on my lip just
funny they call it that because it's not
cold at all factor kind of burns so if
you do follow me on social media than
you guys were amongst the first to know
that I resigned from my full-time job
and that probably surprises a few of you
were helped the bet because so many of
you already figured that I was nothing
more than a full-time youtuber which
kind of bothered me a little bit
considering the fact that because I had
a full-time job doesn't mean I wasn't
putting full-time into YouTube as well
but that's all about to change this
channel started over two and a half
years ago August 26 2012 mostly on a
dare a great guy by the name of holiday
doc MLG commentator came across my
twitch channel he thought it was funny
he thought I would be great at YouTube
and I thought he was full of quite
honestly I made sure to tell him that
too but he kept nagging me until I
offered at least to try it and fast
forward now two and a half years later
and here we are
267 thousand subscribers or maybe more I
have no idea the numbers going so fast
needless to say it has grown well beyond
my expectations in fact my first year's
goal was 1000 subscribers but we did
that in three months for two months I
don't even know it's all happened so
quickly now just a little bit about my
history I had been working with the same
company for nearly ten years
I was hired as an energy efficiency
auditor for a company actually doing
things like energy efficiency cost
analysis and measuring the amount of
energy a building was using it was for a
clean energy company and then later on
and they found out I was actually IT
certified they needed an IT guy and
I got into IT and then the company
continued to grow and I continued to
move up the ladder and I actually moved
up into a very 10-year tenure to
position with the company and was very
very comfortable but as the channel grew
I found myself having to constantly
divide my time we're going into work
meant I couldn't get things done on the
channel and I couldn't fulfill promises
and things were slipping and then I got
to the point to where there was times I
was using vacation time or even using
sick time to catch up on the channel and
that wasn't fair or honest either and so
I found myself burning the candle at
both ends where the only way I can make
everybody happy the only way I could do
this was if I was burning the candle at
both ends by good at getting up in the
morning early in the morning going into
work starting at 6:00 a.m. there's
actually a while they were I took an
earlier shift to work an East Coast
schedule my office is actually out of
Boston and telecommuting 6 a.m. to 3
p.m. and then coming home and then
working until about 7:00 p.m. getting to
spend one or two hours a night at the
most with the family and then working to
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and doing it
all over again so people who were saying
like YouTube channels are easy to run no
they're not in fact it was way harder
than working IT full-time doing that
easily for over the last year and a half
at that type of schedule I was burning
myself out for both I didn't want to do
YouTube anymore I didn't want to work
anymore I just wanted to lay in bed I
gave up all my hobbies because I loved
doing YouTube YouTube is my hobby and so
it got to the point to where a decision
had to be made now last year my wife and
I worked very very hard to get rid of
our debt that was our goal for 2014 and
we did it we got rid of all of our
credit card debt 11 credit cards tax
liabilities and hospital bills
completely paid off in fact little Jay
wasn't even technically paid off for all
of her doctor's visits for when she was
first born and some health complications
that she had and even that is paid off
we don't own this house we rent so we
have very little overhead in fact we are
in a position now to where we can live
on very limited means now growing up my
parents always owned and operated their
own businesses I they didn't go to work
to a nine-to-five I got to see firsthand
from a child up to adult how hard it is
to run your own business
now there's tons and tons of support on
social media people saying way to go Jay
be your own boss but of course there are
people who are concerned and I don't
fault those people I think they're
coming off from a very good perspective
a very conservative perspective saying
Jay don't leave your job don't leave
that security well guys I'm of the
mindset first of all that working for
other people does not equal security
first of all second of all my successes
and and my security depends on their
personal abilities to run a small
business which is no different than what
I'm doing now I'm a hundred percent
confident that I can do this but I can
say this with with reassurance for you
guys this is not a knee-jerk reaction
this is not something I just woke up
this morning and said you know what I'm
going to resign and be my own boss this
is something that has been in the works
for a long time I spent many many
sleepless nights trying to figure out if
this is what I wanted to do especially
with things being up in the air
regarding YouTube and how they're
handing handling monetization and stuff
I said a long time ago I would not put
all of my eggs into YouTube
unfortunately they're not technically
I've got five different avenues at which
I currently earn right now and YouTube
is only one of them so I would not be
putting the security of my family or the
livelihood or for them into YouTube's
Adsense monetization not to mention the
amount of people who use adblock we
barely get monetized on those views
anyway I don't fault you guys for using
that because frankly the YouTube ads
tend to suck but all I wanted to do was
to address the public here saying this
is a choice that I'm making because of
my love and dedication to this
everything you see around here is
because you guys watch this channel and
because the quality of life is improving
and the quality of the business is
improving I want to be able to see where
I can take this and then became a point
to where going into the 9 to 5 each day
was costing me time energy and money at
the end of the day where I could not
devote the amount of dedication that I
really want to with this now one other
thing that I can say with complete
confidence is know that I have done my
research I've done my math and I have
done my Studies on what it's going to
take 1 to run a business been doing it
already for almost 3 years to what it
takes to cut to survive the amount of
money I need to make and trust me when I
say that we're
well above the safe threshold there is
money in the savings there is money in
retirement in investments things are
good and this is very very low risk
involved especially in the near term
I've got a long-term plan here guys and
know that I have other things in the
works that I can do because I'm gonna
have more time on my hands I know that's
something every single full-time
youtuber says guys I've got so much in
the works but I can promise you
long term over the next couple of years
this is going to be a very interesting
ride but I'm okay with that because I
don't want to look back at the end of
the day or the end of another five years
or even another ten years and say man if
only I had not been afraid to try then I
would be stuck just wondering what would
have or could have been and that's worse
than trying and failing
I would rather try and fail and say well
I know what didn't work and try again
but I'm not the kind of person that's
just gonna sit around and say I was too
afraid to try it's not the way I am it's
not the way I operate but I do want to
say thank you to everybody who is very
concerned that means a lot actually if
you guys weren't concerned that means
you don't care the fact that you guys
care is a very big deal because we have
to do this together it's community
effort you guys watching is what allows
all of this to happen
my professional dedication now and the
amount of professional time that I set
aside means I'm gonna have more time for
the family at the end of the day I get
some weekends back hopefully I'm not
planning on doing a video a day guys I'm
not even planning on immediately upping
the amount of videos I'm doing I'm just
trying to up the quality of the content
first and foremost I'm not gonna be
putting advertising or ad revenue
everywhere or taking every single
advertisement opportunity that comes my
way in fact I wish I could show you guys
but I turn away more ad requests than
probably anybody else
in fact I turned down most of them I'm
not willing to put ads all over your
guys's faces for the sake of money
that's not the way this works as far as
I'm concerned now I know this video sort
of been all over the place and let me
just kind of recap here first of all
guys I'm prepared for this I am setup I
have all contingency plans in place as
well as another business I'm actually
doing on the side here independent of
the
that I'm also going to be doing at the
same time we're going to talk about that
in the future that's a that's a tease
for now but I wouldn't be doing this if
I wasn't 100% confident in my ability to
make this succeed nor would I be doing
it if there was even any possibility of
there being negative effects for my
family my family is first and foremost
my dedication and I have 100% confidence
that I can provide for them they have a
hundred percent confidence in me and I
have a lot of backup plan in place to
keep things running if hits the fan
so I don't think I just woke up and
decided to do this it's not this is a
long-term well-thought-out process with
a plan in place the other thing is I'm
not gonna be putting ads all over the
place I I'm with you guys ads are very
intrusive and I'm if you guys have
noticed I've done some ad integrations
here now there will be more but they
will always be relevant and they will
always be non intrusive and they will
not take away from the overall viewing
experience of the video if you guys only
knew how many ads I turn away I turn
away money left and right in fact let me
just say I turned down a thousand
dollars today I know it's easy to just
say that especially since I'm not
putting the emails in front of you but
the person who contacted me represented
a company that I did not think was
relevant to you guys therefore it was an
easy decline I'm not willing to do that
I think the quality and content that I
create here is more than enough to
sustain itself and we'll find out we'll
see how this is gonna go but like I've
already said I would hate myself in the
future if I didn't at least try so you
guys have certainly made what was a
mediocre life before YouTube certainly
really weird one but a very very
exciting one and you guys have made
everything you hear me say today
possible and before that I am definitely
grateful I know there's times where I
come off a bit rough around the edges
but that's because everything I do is
very passionate and I definitely need to
work at getting a little bit of the
roughness under control but just know at
the end of the day guys that maybe a
larger youtuber here but I'm also human
who makes mistakes and I will make more
mistakes in the future but I'm working
on that as well so that's it that's all
I wanted to say today gotta get out of
here in fact this video is coming up
tomorrow the GeForce GTX 980 hybrid we
saw this thing at CES and I cannot wait
to do live unboxing and benchmarking of
that thing as soon as we're done with
this video so guys thanks for watching
once again thanks for being a part of my
life it's a very big deal I have nothing
but absolute dedication to you guys now
with my professional time I do have a
couple of weeks that I'm gonna be
working still before I depart there's
some exit plans that have to be put into
place I have to make sure that the
company is going to be able to survive
without me and I'm helping them come up
with a strategy to replace me which is
good they wanted me to stick around they
really really wanted to know if there
was anything that they could do to help
me change my mind and unfortunately too
dedicated to this for me too like I said
not try so right around mid-april it
would all be going full-time and I'll be
hitting the ground running and the first
thing I got to do is clean this pigsty
up this place is an absolute mess and I
don't like working in clutter thanks for
watching and if this all comes crashing
down well at least I tried hopefully you
guys hang in there and if not I
completely understand why you guys leave
because not the prettiest thing to look
at but I hope you guys all love me for
my brain all right thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
