here and I haven't done this series in a
while but I've always liked helping
newcomers when it comes to the scene on
giving people some ideas and some tips
and tricks on being more efficient with
their workflows and just feel a bit more
excited about making videos and it's
sort of my creators corner type of
series it's been a while since I did one
we're gonna go ahead and do that today
there's a ton of different ways that you
can do things you're gonna find content
creators have different methods of kind
of approach approaching and achieving
the same end result so your results may
vary and you might see people saying to
do things a different way find what
works best for you and then just kind of
ignore the rest that people are saying
no you're doing it wrong that's just the
way I kind of that's the way I kind of
do it but we're gonna kind of talk about
just two things today because obviously
a lot that you can talk about I'm gonna
talk about how I do my color correction
because I shoot in Sony s log which is a
professional format in my sony fs7 and
fs5 with a demo Shogun inferno recorder
and as you'll see when i pull in the
footage it's very very flat so I'm gonna
show you how I do my color correction in
that and then I'm also going to show you
how I do my dual camera setup or even
two three or four camera setups because
what you're gonna see works up to four
cameras we have to import our footage of
course so we are gonna bring in this MXF
file this is from my ff7 right here and
we're gonna bring in this file this is
from the Shogun as you can see a Shogun
and so gun infernal this is our inferno
this is from the FS 5 and we're gonna
bring both of those in so as you can see
it's importing the files this could take
a little bit time or a lot of time
depending on your system and then we've
got both four files right here now if I
drag this into the timeline just like
that you can see just how flat this is
right here this color does not look very
good because that's how s log is it's
basically sort of an HDR type of effect
so it's got more dynamic range which
allows us to actually capture more data
in both highlights and shadows but as
you can see until you process it it's a
very flat and boring image but we're not
gonna be working in the time like like
that no no no that's not the way we're
gonna do this we are going to go ahead
and create a dual camera or multicam
sequence we're gonna highlight the
videos we want to make a multicam
sequence with and we're gonna
right-click and do create multi cameras
or source sequence now normally I would
use audio in fact I do even have a slate
which is what you can use to sync audio
you can see it right there on the table
and I do in fact clap it the problem is
I didn't actually have a mic setup on
the FS 5 because I'm a dork and so there
was nothing
for it to sync with something's we want
to do it via video otherwise we could
normally just say do it via audio and
make it go so we're just gonna use the
endpoints which means just start the
multicam sequence where both of those
clips start because I don't have time
codes synched on these sorry Graham I
know you're gonna show you how to do
timecode we'll do that later but we're
just gonna use the endpoints for now it
took both of those files set them in a
different bin as you can see right there
they're in here and now here is our one
camera our one piece of file footage
that has the camera data now you might
be looking at this going well what the
heck there's only one camera showing up
right there well if you hit ctrl or hold
ctrl and double click you can see now
we've got two different timelines here
so this is our footage as you can see if
I mute up the top layer you can actually
see the second camera and what we're
gonna do right now is we are going to
sync these up now again this would be a
whole lot easier if the other file or
the other audio tracks here actually had
something on them if I had the FS fly it
actually had a mic hooked up which I
didn't
unfortunately this would have been a
whole lot easier both of the audio
tracks you see right here going into the
FS seven one mic was on Austin the other
mic was on me and so that's why they are
synched up but if as you can see they
are both on this video track right here
the problem is we can't see the
underlying track because we got this
track on top of it so I'm just gonna go
in and temporarily bring down the
opacity but you can see right here they
are not in sync right
do you see he's rubbing his eye right
there so we are clearly not in sync and
again this is a lot more work than I
should have to do but this is because I
did it poorly so what I'm gonna do right
here is I'm going to see if I can find a
spot okay so I'm gonna look I'm gonna
look for right here like right where he
touches his eye that's the top track and
now I'm gonna look for that on the
bottom track here again way more work
than I should have to do simply because
I forgot to hook up a mic otherwise we
could just sink on the clap so do it the
right way so you can see we're pretty
much synced up right there now bring the
opacity this one back
one hundred and now they are in sync not
to be confused with the boyband and the
reason why we want to make changes over
here separately is because we don't have
to then trim all this up we can just
edit the main timeline here unclipped
all of the outtakes and there and stuff
our color correction our audio changes
everything that we do here takes place
over here now one thing we're going to
want to do here while we're in this
timeline is we want to switch our views
so we go up to our our playback here we
right-click we display mode go to multi
camera and now you can see both cameras
now you can click back and forth on
which camera you want to be active or
while it's playing you can actually just
use the number one and number two on
your keyboard
if they hit one that's the first camera
- that's the second camera and while
it's playing I can actually switch
between them so anyway as you can see
once I'm done playing you can see the
different cameras took effect right here
so that's the way that you will easily
go back and forth between cameras in
that timeline but as you can see the
color on this it's still pretty poor so
now we have to go into our color
correction to this and normally I would
do this on an adjustment layer but both
these cameras are going to be slightly
different in terms of color tone and
brightness and such so I don't want to
apply them an adjustment layer on top of
both I want them to kind of have their
own I need to match the footage so I'm
not going to be applying it to both so
I'm going to right now is I'm gonna go
ahead to my effects tab go to my custom
bin and I'm gonna pull to strip over
here and just apply that to the very top
layer right here now that means we're
gonna be editing this top video first so
it's going to go back to our display
mode of composite video so we can see
just the one that we have you know on
top right here and it opens up all these
options over here under the effects
controls so once we drop to strip in
here we get this lue metric color and
then we've got input LUT right here and
this is where you can browse to your
Luntz now there's some pre-installed
let's here with premiere but I use ones
that are specific to my camera into the
exact recording format that I'm you
so that's what I'm gonna be using today
so this is the let I'll be using right
here it's a sin es log three to a rec
709 and that's the way it looks when it
applies the lip as you can see it's a
bit dark it's a bit contrast II now is
where we can start making our changes
but more importantly you'll notice it
looks like that over here now we can see
the other camera did not take effect yet
because we haven't applied anything over
here in this workflow now normally I'll
use a gray card like you see right here
to get my color balance but we're pretty
much in a studio environment now where
the color is controlled which is why we
want to block out those skylights when
I'll have color shift throughout the day
and our lighting is pretty consistent so
I don't actually need to use the gray
card but I always start a clip with it
that way we can adjust it if we need to
so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come over
here I'm gonna find a shot we're just
kind of sitting here talking I'm gonna
start playing around the color to make
it look you know presentable I mean
that's the thing about color is it's
subjective right you can go for a
certain look and feel so I'm gonna go
ahead and warm this up just the tone
make it a little bit more comfortable
I'm gonna bring the exposure up slightly
which is kind of a bad move we were
slightly underexposed for this but
fortunately because we're shooting with
pretty good cameras were able to bring
this up quite a bit before we get a lot
of noise so you can see there's no ways
and stuff in his shirt right there but
yeah we normally don't want to go up and
exposure down is where we want to go but
I'm going to pull this up a little bit
and then I'm gonna bring the blacks down
just slightly that way our exposure
doesn't affect any of that so this way
we can actually bring up exposure and
skin tones without affecting the dark
colored shirts that we have on but the
other thing here is we actually need to
add a little bit more saturation because
although we're using the LUT it's still
a bit under saturated and we can play
with this quite a bit as you can see
that looks like we got sunburns or like
were cartoons or whatever I like to
bring my saturation up to about 1:45 you
can even type this in right here if you
want and then we get a look like this
then I like to go into creative I like
to bring up the sharpness just a little
bit because we had no sharpening
whatsoever in camera we do all this in
post and then I actually bring
saturation up a little bit more even
right here just a couple of points but
then I bring the vibrance down and
that's how we get this sort of a look
right so let's get a
we're kind of looking towards the camera
so we can get a feel for it and that
might be a little bit on the warmer side
of things so now I can go up here and
play with the temperature just a little
bit you bring it back a tad so you don't
want it to cool I kind of like it right
around there and there that's not too
bad so I'm gonna do now is I'm going to
turn off the visibility on the top layer
and I'm going to start by copying this
so if you just right-click and copy you
can bring the attributes I'm gonna turn
off this layer bring up this one and I'm
gonna now paste the attributes so at
least we have a starting point that sort
so you can see just by copying the
attributes of the other camera that's
what we get you can see the color tone
is a little bit different there's a
little bit more green in this footage
this is the fs7 right here which is a
superior camera to the fs5 even with a
Shogun inferno attached to it so I want
to bring just a little bit of contrast
to this one there we go I'd say I think
that's starting to match pretty nicely
there's still a green hue in here though
and this is why using IPS panels is also
really important but I'm gonna go ahead
and turn the top layer back on I'm gonna
go over here to exposure and bring that
up just a little bit more so I'm gonna
go full resolution editing right here
but you can see now we still have a
little bit green tone so that's where we
come down here to our color wheels which
are pretty important so ryuko wheels up
and this is gonna be more in the mid
tone to highlights so I'm gonna go ahead
and just go opposite of green which is
magenta I'm gonna add just a tiny bit
because member we're trying to match the
footage underneath and I think we're
getting pretty close right here this
does a bit of a magenta in it so I'm
gonna go ahead and pull some magenta out
of that one and I think there's gonna be
a lot of there's gonna be a lot of
tastes and personal preference in this
but see if we can do here in the
highlights maybe do a little bit in the
mid-tones I think we've got a fairly
decent match now if we come over here
back to our main timeline as you can see
both have taken effect
so with that basic workflows you just
saw this is what the timeline looks like
post Malone was awesome enough to supply
me with the non-vocal
version track of Rockstar so there's no
vocals right here this was kind of
playing throughout the video and the
nice thing was when I wanted to kind of
have it fade into like the the video for
rock star then we just lined up the
peaks and valleys and we switched from
the normal just regular track to the
vocals and that's how you got this and
at the end of the day this is what we
had so anyway that was my workflow here
for the dual camera interview here with
post Malone I hope you guys have enjoyed
that video if you didn't check it out go
ahead and do so the guy is super chill
he was really fun to hang out with and I
will be doing some stuff like that in
the future but if you guys want to see
more creators corner type a video like
this let me know what sort of subjects
you want me to cover and I'll do the
best I can to do it anyway guys time to
go thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
