can drum on the box you know what guys I
got new merch it's available now crowd
me calm /jc sense we got zip up hoodies
we got tri-blend we got a new logo I
digress
since 2012 it's at the wrist logo you
guys been asking for that anyway all
right guys
live it up we can all kinda stuff zip up
hoodies beanies polos don't take my word
for it cuz obviously I can't do this ad
so just look in the description below
and you guys will find the link Thanks
all right so if we take a look inside
here well okay so here's the deal there
should be nothing to assemble on this
here are the mounting brackets and stuff
it's of course supports all of your
standard sockets 2011 2060 6 a.m. 3 a.m.
4 TR 4 maybe we'll check this thing is
gargantuan holy crap now this isn't a I
oh it's fully assembled it is expandable
this is based on a 280 millimeter
radiator design from alpha cool we've
got this nice honeycomb sort of a grill
protection on here so you don't smash
your fins you can see here we've also
got in collaboration all of my finger
prints or something on that holy crap
what to clean that off
be quiet fans are actually used in here
or as they like to call them ice vind
the ice bin fans in here making z-a I
moved through with all of these static
pressures needed to get Ozzy maximum
cooling so it has these quick
disconnects right here that I've never
actually use how do you use these guys
so yeah they're not really quick
disconnects they're just disconnects and
nonetheless and you lose a couple of
drops of water as you just saw right
there but that makes this expandable
expandability is kind of key because
these are off the shelf water cooling
parts it is a custom loop as an AI oh
now no they are not the first to do this
at least the ice bear is not a new
concept
EK did something similar to this and i
think to be fair alpha cool slash aqua
tuning tuning did something quite a
while ago as well but be predator 240
and 360 which we took a look look at a
while back was also the same concept of
off-the-shelf parts put together as an
AI Oh
this water pulled up in there that is
expandable and allows you to add things
like graphics cards or other radiators
or whatever may be the case these are
two very different approaches so the
predator was sort of a failure and if
you guys remember that I did a video
about it ek had to end up warranting a
lot of systems because they leaked there
was a problem with the block or
something like that and so it was sort
of reborn as the Phoenix Phoenix came
out in 2017 using pretty much a lot of
the same parts as the predator but it
was an upgraded block design and whatnot
but my problem with the predator and I
don't know what this persisted on the
Phoenix was they used what looked like a
DD C on the end of the radiator tank but
it wasn't a true DD C the the pump
internals were different they were
lesser quality than a DD C we found that
out when I built this test rig because
what I did you guys can go back and
watch this video you'd have to dig it up
I'm not gonna put the link but you can
find when I built this test rig the pump
that's down here is actually out of a
predator I didn't have a DD C but I had
this top from alpha cool this is an
alpha cool unit right here that's been
running now for like three or four years
in this in this setup and the pump is
actually out of a predator and that's
when I found like wow it didn't work in
here because the housing was slightly
different so that's one of the things
that kind of Concerned me was they were
able to cut costs when making an AI oh
like that by using lesser great parts
now alpha cool is using a d5 style pump
which we will take a look at it's the 7
or the VPP 755 v3 not to be confused
with the older 755 or VPP 755 which was
actually kind of garbage this is a much
better redesigned redesigned PCB
everything about it is different which
they say is making the reliability of it
much much better so let's do this let's
go ahead and open it up before we
actually get it on to our test rig to
see how it performs on our 8700 k oh I
forgot to mention - these are G quarter
threaded fittings right here so against
all of my better judgment I've decided
I'm just going to keep this assembly
there we go so there it is this is the
VPP 755 V 3 pump which is very much a d5
style pump it is a pee
um you can see how these are just drop
in be to be quiet fans believe these are
silent wings yeah silent wings three
okay so it's all hooked up here the
retention system pretty straightforward
it's a back plate with the pass-through
and blah blah read the instructions for
your particular mounting style obviously
with AMD and all that it's a little bit
different for each socket but we found
out with the LEDs for so I've got the
actual pump hooked up to a different
power supply so I can turn it on
independently and actually show you what
the pump it sounds like because the pump
can make a sound that's sometimes very
intrusive like DD CS are very
high-pitched very loud usually D fives
are usually a lot less audible but they
make a hum so this is what this one
sounds like and pay attention to the
window right here there's a blue LED in
there that turns on member that strip
that we saw that you can actually see
your water level in there so that's the
pump right there at full speed like I
think my mic that close to for you to
hear it but as you can see the blue LED
lights up your reservoir that's in there
so you can keep an eye on your water
levels and when you're filling it though
it'll make a lot easier you know to fill
it like this this is kind of the
orientation it wouldn't be intended to
go in in a case usually at the top
biggest issue you're gonna have with
this though before we get into the
temperature test is fitting this
behemoth bo-hee myth behemoth we went
through this before didn't we I feel
like we've done this behemoth so
obviously it's the width of a two
hundred and eighty millimeter radiator
so it's 140 millimeter fans wide but the
extra width of the chassis built around
it I want to see if it'll fit in the r6
that's kind of where I think I might end
up using this but with my own fittings
and reservoir or not reservoir but
blocking stuff to match the gold build
because I think this matches my solution
of trying to get something that fits in
there and looks decent and I can paint
all these external pieces gold to make
it match because gold you like gold
around here Oh should with the gold bill
but obviously we're here to do a
performance test so I'm gonna go ahead
and well turn on power to the system
usually power is important okay so we're
installed and we're gonna kind of
overclock this a little bit more but I
want to kind of just start with some of
the basics so all cores are synced to
four point seven which is the turbo
clock but on the ASUS motherboards if
you enable multi core enhancement and
then think cores you get four point
seven on all of them one point three
five volts is where we are in the CPU
normally I would not recommend going any
higher than that for 24/7 because a lot
of coolers have a problem keeping that
cool now right now we're gonna do a
Cinebench run first but then we're gonna
overclock it till it's no longer stable
I'm gonna try and get 5 gigahertz out of
this and then we're gonna run a 264 for
30 minutes so right now our package is
idling at 29 C and our cores are in the
mid to upper-20s
which is only a few degrees above
ambient right now it's about 68 degrees
Celsius or Celsius what it is burning
hot in this room going into a little
diatribe now about people asking me J
why do you talk about temperatures in
Fahrenheit we talk about ambient then
you talk about Celsius and PC I don't
speak Celsius but I understand it for
computers because I know the ranges
thing should be in but I don't know what
like our ambient temp is because I'm
sorry that our thermostats in America
want to be different anyway with that
said about 68 Fahrenheit you can do your
own conversion and our system is running
like I said in these high 20s when it
comes to Celsius now if we run Cinebench
which is a navy X instruction set boom
spikes up to 66 on the package low to
mid-60s on the core all the different
cores and it's just solid
look at that they're not even
fluctuating that much okay so we found
our theoretical max right here just in
terms of temperatures and voltage and
all of that okay so here's what we got
we got five point two forty five point
two gigahertz right now as you can see
right there using Hardware monitor and
the voltage to achieve that is more than
I would ever recommend on any a i/o or
help even a custom loop one point four
on the V chord I hit rhymes I'm a rapper
now but the question is is it gonna
survive a Cinebench run let's see
cores right here net packages in the
mid-90s 94 93 95 the fact is we passed
at 5.2 by just moving voltage slider to
1.4 we were crashing at one point three
eight so I don't think we can get away
with any less but here's the thing 95 97
we're still not at t.j.maxx this chip is
designed to be able to run all day
technically at 104 C at 105 it starts
the throttle I don't think a 264 is
going to
I think I think it's gonna crash to be
honest so what I'm gonna do right now is
I'm going to back it back down to five
gigahertz put the voltage back down to
something reasonable that you would use
on day to day and see how this cooler
does okay so five gigahertz at one point
to eight volts is what we settled on
temperature-wise as you can see freaking
amazing 74 on the package high 60s mid
70s on the cores alright 8a sixty-four
incoming alright so here's what it looks
like after nineteen minutes
interestingly we got you know the curve
if you draw a medium line through there
it kind of goes up a little right there
and then sort of comes back down the
lows got lower and the highs
you can see right here on this line
didn't really go any higher than the
highest so what we think might have been
happening here as this curve is sort of
trending downwards slightly if you think
the thermal pace might have been setting
in better because we just installed it
and went and it takes time for thermal
paste to sort of kind of not really
solidify but sort of spread fill in the
gaps and cure there is a curing process
that happens with thermal paste and we
think that it's curing and that's why
we're seeing the lows go down right
there but if we go over here and we stop
the test
you can see we did hit ninety eighty
nine ninety 89 89 83
but our averages later averages 81-71
7377 one this is the average is more
important than the maximum here because
this could have been those momentary
spikes where when you're testing cache
and you're testing FPU like we literally
were asking extreme here or eight
extreme to do an extreme cooling test we
asked it to just stress the CPU as high
as you possibly could but we passed
nearly 20 minutes at 5 gigahertz at one
point to eight volts with a temperature
that is more than reasonable I mean the
averages were absolutely phenomenal
if you back this down to stock speeds
then it stays in the 50s and the 60s we
want to see how it does in games though
obviously because a iOS and gaming
computers are very commonplace now so if
we look we're using far cry 5 which is
known to be pretty CPU intensive and
what the level loading we're seeing 70
to 60 to 57 so inside the actual
rendered game we're on the helicopter
ride right now into wherever this cult
country is and you can see we are still
sitting in the 60s 40s 30s it's bouncing
all over the place
as you would expect with a game now
running over clocked at 5 gigahertz on
this on just an AI oh yeah obviously you
could get away with this running
overclocked while gaming and and the
funny thing is even when we had this
test running for 20 minutes the air that
was coming through the radiator and yes
we're sitting in an open environment
because we want the radio to be the only
thing controlling temps not some sort of
case flow is the fact that the air
coming through here was always cold it
was always ambient feeling so that means
that the temperatures we were seeing
were straight-up package limited in
terms of the IHS design and the Tim used
in the CPU on the 8700 K is what was
keeping us from getting any cooler
whereas there was very little saturation
so yeah the ice bear it's got a funny
name but it is definitely the beefiest
AI oh I've taken a look at yet and again
it's not truly an AI oh it is off the
shelf water cooling parts that you could
go and buy independently and make a
custom loop out of that they've just
already all assembled it for you there's
nothing different about this xpx block
there's nothing different about the
radiator that's in here or the silent
wings fans are in here or the the 7pp or
whatever the VPP 755 v3 pump that's in
it you could buy all these independently
and make your own custom loop they just
did it for you and it's preassembled
comes with a warranty and you don't have
to worry about screwing anything up in
your system expandable and obviously
performs really well so I still think I
might try and see if this fits in my r5
or our six case and use this instead of
trying to piece something together
because I could paint this gold and or
even leave the plastic part like this
and paint the shrouds gold and it would
match and it would definitely make my
life easier and give you that all
figured out all right guys we're gonna
go tell us what you think about this I
think the only drawback to it quite
honestly is well there's two things the
price it's about 280 US dollars
equivalent to approximately what these
particular parts independently would
cost you for the fittings the pump the
reservoir the radiator block 2 being and
all that the fans it's pretty much the
sum of its parts but the other thing is
going to be its size it is definitely
large it is wider than 140
fans and is certainly longer than a two
hundred eighty millimeter radiator
because you have the pump and the
reservoir up in this section so there's
not a whole lot of cases they're gonna
be able to fit this up top some might be
able to fit it up front but you're
definitely gonna want to look at the
dimensions of your case to figure out
whether or not it can fit the dimensions
of this cooler so sign up in the
comments below what you think about
alpha cools new ice bear and yeah like I
said this is an a IO that can beat up
your a IO you know you have this bumper
stickers that says my student beat up
your honor student my cooler can beat up
your cooler so you can I bite cut they
aint bet bet a helmet a helmet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
