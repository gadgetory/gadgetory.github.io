here and we're going to go ahead and
continue on our discussion of the gtx
960 it's been out for a few weeks now
and people have been definitely blowing
up your inbox with it but we're going to
go ahead and take a look at it because
well i'm a graphics card whore and i
really love to play around with the GPUs
stuff but today we're going to be taking
a look at the EVGA gtx 960 super super
clocks i don't even hope they made an SC
but we got an SSC sitting right here
with its improved radiator support and
legendary noise optimization the new
define are five from fractal design is a
pc builders dream come true
click the link in the description to
learn more ok so here it is the EVGA gtx
960 super super clocked I don't know if
they made a standard SC model but they
did send me a super super clocked and
they have a for the wind model now this
as you can see does have a backplate on
there but I installed this they sent the
backplate with the card so we went ahead
and put this on it does actually offer a
little bit of passive cooling for the
back of the PCB there's a couple of
portions around the GPU that it touches
as well as the memory that is located on
the back of the PCB so you do get a
little bit of passive cooling that is
assisted with any of the air flowing
over the back of the card as a lot of
cases now offer either side panel fans
or nice directional fans on mid plates
in the cases so you would get active
cooling technically passive but with air
blowing over it you would get some
cooling to the RAM that's on the back
that's why I like back plates they do
offer not only an aesthetic improvement
but the back of the PCB does generate a
lot of heat go and play your game you've
got massive cooler on the front touch
the back and watch how much heat is
actually being generated there so if you
have thermal pads on here that are
touching parts that generate heat it
does increase the surface area give you
better cooling that's why I love back
plates spec wise it's no different than
any other gtx 960 1178 megahertz core
clock it's got 1,024 cuda cores it's a
GM 206 chip it's got 128-bit memory bus
for 112 gigabytes per second
of bandwidth as well as 7,000 megahertz
clock speed of the two gigabytes of
gddr5 vram on here so for the output you
do have three DisplayPort 1.2 one HDMI
2.0 and a DVI dual link DVI on here so
that's going to be pretty decent for
connectivity it's pretty standard and
then we do require a single 8 pin PCI
Express power connector on here because
this is a six phase which is bumped up
from the standard three-phase which is
on the reference model so you are going
to have to make sure that you have at
least one 8 pin PCI Express which all
modern PSU is pretty much have now for
the cooler it's the AC X 2.0 which is
through pretty much going on every
single one of their cards 11 swept fan
blades reverse well they look like
they're reverse but they're actually
spinning they're moving air a little bit
differently it's a little bit quieter
the fans won't turn on until they get to
a standard or regular 64 degrees Celsius
I believe so yeah pretty basic stuff
it's the same on all of their maxwell
cards so we're going to do today is
we're going to include a couple of extra
gaming benchmarks on here that you guys
have requested we've included far cry 4
in the test because you guys said that
the game was working good i want to make
sure the game didn't have any massive
hardware bugs in there so it's working
good as you guys said almost drop my
phone we've added watchdogs back in
there because well we're now looking at
cards that would not necessarily be
hitting the FPS cap so we put watchdogs
back in there and we've also included
csgo
so those are the three titles we've
added based on your guys's
recommendations csgo actually a perfect
example of where a card like this sets
in fact the Nvidia demonstration that I
went to they had csgo going on 144 Hertz
1440p monitor showing just how powerful
this card can be for lesser demanding
titles like counter-strike so there you
go guys we're gonna go ahead and take a
look at this thing right now let's go
ahead and roll that transition get this
thing benchmarked and see exactly where
it sits transition
alright guys Jays two cents here we're
back we've done a lot of benchmarking on
this over the last well spent pretty
much the first whole half of this day
doing the benchmarking and here it is
the gtx 960 now i was able to achieve
almost fifteen hundred and 80 megahertz
on the overclock but i didn't make it
through all of my testing and all of my
games without a couple of driver crashes
specifically in battlefield 4 if you
guys own that game you know it's very
picky with overclocks and then fire
strike 3dmark fire strike was getting a
couple of crashes and wasn't making it
through the entire loop so with that I
bumped it down to about fifteen hundred
and thirty megahertz and we were solid
all the way through now it did boost up
to about fourteen hundred 1392 was where
this card boosted all on its own without
any MSI Afterburner or precision X or
any of that so out of the box you're
going to get really decent clocks as it
is but if you guys are willing to do a
little bit of tweaking then you can
definitely get it to go a little bit
higher now when it comes to the gtx 960
since it's been out for a little while
there's been a lot of debate about well
is it the right card to get is it worth
getting I mean it's only got two
gigabytes of vram it's got 128-bit
memory bus it surely can't be a good
card with those specs well right now
2015 with this card at this spec range
it was able to handle everything I threw
at it with a minimum of
60 FPS I think one test was 59 but 60
FPS which is like that magical number
all gamers shoot for at 1080p this card
can do it now whether or not it can do
that say 2 years in the future well
that's always going to be the kind of
thing you need to ask yourself what type
of games do you play because that's kind
of the typical upgrade cycle is every 2
years at least for most people not a
whole lot of us are fortunate enough to
be able to do annual upgrades or
sometimes even biannual upgrades or
twice a year so if you're looking for a
card that's going to last at least 2
years I think you're going to be ok with
this I kind of wish EVGA or an EVGA but
Nvidia would have gone to 3 gigabytes on
this because of games like Skyrim and
shadows of Mordor having high res
texture packs as 4k and 1440 are
becoming much more regular standard a
lot of people are really pushing the
resolutions of their textures which is
going to eat that 2 gigabytes up really
really quickly so I would have liked
Nvidia to have done 3 gigabytes I mean
that's the only thing I think that makes
me hit little hesitant on the future
proofing of a GTX 960 I mean nothing's
future proof but the longer your money
will last the better but if you're only
looking at buying a $200 graphics card
if you guys are diligent and save all
year long you could theoretically do an
annual upgrade now if you guys are
sitting on something like a GTX 760
depending on the model model you're on
the 960 in the 760 does trade blows with
each other depending on the test so
don't go shooting yourself or you know
kicking yourself for buying a 760 if
it's in recent 760 is still going to do
just fine especially at 1080p now other
than that I don't know what there is
really to say about it I mean it
performs well and temperatures are
really good with this loop running right
now it's still bouncing back and forth
between 61 and 62 and this loop has been
running for about 20 minutes now more
demanding titles like battlefield 4 or
things like fire strike where it really
stresses the GPU as hard as it can the
ACX 2.0 cooler on the factory fan curve
was able to keep it all the way down to
72 degrees Celsius in a room that was
sitting about 77 degrees Celsius or not
Celsius holy crap 77 degrees Fahrenheit
we're like on the Sun apparently no 77
Fahrenheit guys I'm sorry I don't know
what the conversion is on that standard
temperatures for PC is always in Celsius
I don't know American I don't do those
conversions but anyway it was a decently
warm day today and so the room did get
warm it got up to 72 once I did my fan
curve where I put it on the OC bios and
then messed with the fan curve a little
bit and overclocked it I was as you can
see right now able to keep it sitting
right here at 61 degree Celsius we can't
see it but I'm telling you 61 degrees
Celsius perfectly fine temperature if
you asked me in an open test bench you
put a case in there with good airflow
you'll get similar results alright so
there you go it's a very very well
thought out very well built 1080p card
if you're in it if you're a team green
player and you guys like EVGA it's
definitely a card worth looking at that
$200 range obviously pricing right now
is very interesting volatile we're both
red and green are definitely trading
blows when it comes to getting a grasp
on that $200 market so you really going
to have to ask yourself what it is
you're after and what it is that you
want when it comes to a $200 graphics
card but I think the gtx 960 is a pretty
solid card as far as I'm concerned I
have no problem putting this in a lower
budget build whatsoever so there you go
guys JC says take a look at the gtx 960
super super clocked before the wind
model i would have liked to have tested
that one to kind of see what the max
offering was from EVGA but nonetheless
this card performed very very admirably
I'm happy how well it actually did today
and all the titles that I threw at it so
if you guys want to discuss this a
little bit further you have any
questions head over to forum JC CENTCOM
and sign up there if you guys don't want
to do forms there's always Facebook and
Twitter and if that's not your thing and
of course there are the comments down
below fortunately those are really hard
to respond to there's an awful lot of
them so there you go guys
gtx 960 hope to see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
