been a long time since I've updated the
skunkworks bill here on YouTube and it
trust me every time I do a video I see
your comments out where is skunk works
well it's here things are kind of
progressing along there's been some
snags I want to talk about that I'm
going to show you some other parts that
came in today and hopefully you guys
will understand what's going on after
that and then we'll get this build fully
underway and the hell out of my shop
because I'm it's taken up way too much
space
what are you doing guys thought it's
time for an upgrade
that's little J's Xbox ah much better
how did you even get in here Mickey last
time I was here no big deal well I could
go for a drink right about now though I
kind of feel like you've already done
this whole living room thing before
no there's different channels these are
horrible man well you are breaking and
entering
no not I have witnesses the new defined
nano s from fractal design supports
full-size power supplies full-length
graphics cards room for a complete
custom water loop and heck even room for
a couple of freeloaders click the link
in the description for more details
tractor josh not included all right so
it's gonna pretty much look the same as
you guys saw it last time the loop it's
pretty much all put together with the
occur they almost acrylic the ptg I
haven't got a chance to cut the glass
yet but yeah it pretty much looks the
same it's all routed some of the guys
don't like the way that this turned out
with the way it crosses over I don't
really have a choice because of where
the holes were pre-drilled otherwise I
would have made the ones that you know
wouldn't have crossed over I would have
figured that out but I have to reuse the
holes that were already there from the
previous built we've got the ek
radiators in there and here are the
three 980ti s and I want to talk about
that but I'm not going to talk about it
yet I'll talk about that in a second
something else that came in and what
I've actually been waiting on that was
making this take a while in the
beginning was the custom sleeves and
we've got a lot of cables for this build
right here now these sleeves are made by
joe he's actually the owner of sanctum
sleeping me he also is part of the
modders group modders inc and so if you
guys want to find him you basically look
up Joe with modders Inc it'd be kind of
the best way to find him but he's the
same guy that's done pretty much all the
sleeps for any of my systems you guys
have seen has just been some name
changes throughout time but yeah this is
these are the colors that we came up
with here obviously these colors are
specific to
you know the way it's gonna look inside
red mist so I think that this is gonna
look pretty good we chose not to go with
any white in the sleeves this time
around last time there was red white and
black I think this looks a heck of a lot
better but I'm not wiring these up until
the loop is done because I'm gonna have
to have these wired up first but I want
to make sure there's nothing in the way
with the loop now one other thing that
we decided to change here is if you guys
follow me on Twitter then you would seen
that I posted these 980ti is for sale
because the owner of red mist is as much
as he tried and bless his heart he could
not deal with the fact that these are no
longer the latest and greatest so we
just sold all three of these kudos to
you guys who bought actually two people
by one guy bought together got about one
these are getting boxed up and shipped
out either today or tomorrow and you
guys will have these on their way and
they are coming with the stop coolers so
guys are asking us not coolers there
they are right there well we come with
the stock coolers these cards never even
saw a single game they never even saw
water so you guys are good you guys got
a pretty good deal but he's gonna be
going with two 1080s actually he's gonna
ditch the third card even though he
knows three will work he just spent
1,800 bucks on all three of these and
then the water blocks he spent over
$2,000 on these he took a huge loss and
then is actually getting two more 1080s
and two more water blocks so you spent a
lot of money on graphics card lesson
learned folks don't buy your parts and
pieces save your money and then buy all
your parts at once that way that doesn't
happen with you so there's the 59 60 X
let's go ahead and talk about that for a
second a lot of people just like the
graphics card we're like why do you buy
a new CPU because the new stuffs coming
out it's not usually as big of a deal
with the new CPU stuff as GPUs it's a
lot less of a generational gap but I
kind of had a feeling in the back of my
mind that the 69 50 X was gonna be
really expensive the only problem was in
the back of my mind I was thinking 1,250
bucks 1,300 bucks who knows and we got
this CPU at micro Center for 900 so or
eight between eight nine hundred
remember exactly what it was but it was
a hell of a deal so when the CPU came
out 1700 bucks for the 69 50 X
even he was like yeah I wouldn't bought
that anyway and I don't think a lot of
people would and the amount of
performance you're getting with the
eight core sixteen thread yeah that's
one of those things that definitely
didn't leave him feeling a little bitter
like especially like the graphics card
did so something I want to talk to you
guys about real quick here just for a
couple of seconds or minutes whatever in
the middle this video is it's really
better to save your money rather than
buying the stuff in pieces it's fun to
buy it it's fun to get it in the mail or
it's fun to go and get it off the shelf
and play with it but if you can't build
the whole system yet you might find
yourself in the situation unfortunately
like the owner of red mist did where by
the time he started collecting the parts
and by the time the build started
happening and we were still waiting for
stuff like the sleeves to get done
before we could finish the build you
might get obsoleted before you even fire
up the system so unfortunately for him
with the graphics card it was an
expensive lesson to learn but I don't
think in the next build he's gonna do it
that way he's probably gonna be like an
every two year builder so I honestly
think the money should just be set aside
rather than buying parts but when it
comes to the CPU though typically you're
gonna find nearly as much of a jump as
you would find with graphics cards so we
wanted to talk about the CPU here just
for a second it's not something we were
too concerned about hell I'm not even
feeling the need upgrade to a 10 core 20
thread $1700 CPU this doesn't even if I
end up with one it's so not necessary
and yeah I speaking from an enthusiast
and a reviewer that price is just
astronomical I don't understand it it's
not a Xeon it's not it's not a server
CPU so why the hell is it so damn
expensive
something else I get asked about a lot
are the Dominator tops and how I scored
red ones and orange ones separately
because I didn't buy the kits that they
come on actually got the top separately
it's just one of those things where it's
kind of a perk of the job really as I
had a I have contacts at Corsair I can
make a request and then they let me know
if they can make it happen or not
unfortunately both times they were able
to get me the tops I wanted the issue is
that the colored tops like the orange
and the red only come on 16-gigabyte
kits and these are 32 gigabyte kits so I
wasn't about we weren't about to buy 16
gig kit just for the tops although we
could have and then just sold the the
ram off and lost a little bit of money
that's how we got the top so
I really can't help you guys get him
maybe right Corsair on your own and or
hit up their PR and see if they can it
can help you out but again I didn't I
don't talk to the PR guys I talk to a
different team altogether so I I really
can't help you there now for the
lighting he's got the NZXT hue this is
purely on my recommendation absolutely
love the hue it's the amount of control
you have on this you can control each
individual LED he was asking about
lighting and previously we were just
using some of the lodge assists corner
sticks just solid white LEDs we want to
add a little bit more control and fun
with this system so we are going with
the hue which is fully RGB about
eighteen million colors and you can
control it however you want you can make
it marquee you can have it control based
on temperature based on fps all kinds of
funky stuff whatever you just want it to
be again he bought this nothing in this
system is actually sponsored with the
exception of the motherboard EVGA did
send that over but this is a fully
retail built system so this way the
system looks on the back right here
these two cables actually are not fans
these are going to the LED strips that
are behind the reservoirs lighting those
guys up there's the splitter for the
fans up top this is controlling the fans
up here for the radiator and this is
being controlled by DC output of the
motherboard down here we have the pumps
and stuff you guys have if you've seen
the original red mist series then you'll
know how I did that if not I go and
check out the original red mist series I
guess everything down here in the
basement is soft tubing and I decided
not to do hard tubing this time around
on red mist like I did on skunk works
because I've got to pull out the
radiators for skunk works because again
I start to send those off to get tested
we're finally gonna test the fluid
change issue find out what's happening
there and the rigid tubing is actually
making a bigger bitch to take apart than
I anticipated
so yeah that's why we are using soft
tubing there but that right there is how
we are controlling the you guys can see
that there we go that's the fan control
or the fan splitter anyway for the four
fans on the 560 and again it's all just
running with these extension cables as
you guys can see two different headers
on the motherboard and that's how we
were actually controlling the fans but
I've got a lot of wiring I still have to
do something else I'm asked often is how
the hard drives mount in an SMA eight
from case labs well it's got this upper
cage here that will hold two three and a
half inch drives and we've got this cage
down here that will hold for two and a
half inch drive so two three and a
half's and four two and a half's
natively as the way that it ships you
can add more cages to the front if you
need more but anyway he can put four
more ssds here's if he wants he's
putting another one in and then he's got
MDOT to drive on the motherboard we
already showed as his main drive so yeah
I've got to pull these out unfortunately
now he's gotta wait until 1080s are
available because they are back ordered
it is just like the 600 series all over
again everyone wants one and nobody has
them so unfortunately he's delayed his
build again which is really pissing off
his lady friend because they want she
wants to play overwatch in other games
and this is where his system has been
now for like two months or whatever the
shop was supposed to make things really
easy but this behemoth is taking up all
my space alright so that's it that's the
update so far on skunk works and that's
what we're now waiting on we got the
cables which we are waiting on I hadn't
cut the glass yet but I can do that in a
couple of hours but now we're gonna be
waiting on graphics cards yes it gives
me time to figure out there's anything
really more custom I can do with this I
still got to make the EVGA bridge here
I'm gonna paint this white and I'm gonna
do my red LED backlit ish custom thing
that I showed you guys before now EVGA
does ship with these little stickers but
these stick on the front they look
really cheesy so we're not gonna be
doing any of that we're gonna make it
fully custom but I do think painting
this white maybe the aluminum part white
getting rid of the SLI sticker and
making the LED glow red
I think that'll actually accent really
well with this system anyway guys I know
there wasn't a lot of information in
this update but it was so many people
were asking me where the hell is red
mist what happened is it broken did the
guy quit is it done and you didn't
finish it I just thought I'd go ahead
and show you guys where we are so far
with that and I know I guess just give
you guys a little bit of a little bit of
an update there got stuff coming up for
skunk works got actually I'm kind of
curious here I want you guys is opinion
on something I'm gonna put a straw poll
down in the in the comment section here
and I'm thinking about trying out a new
motherboard for skunk works when I do my
update on that and you guys know I like
to try out different
pieces of hardware because that's the
best way to get you know experience with
the different brands and stuff that are
out there and if you just use the same
thing all the time at least in my
position then you're always speaking
from only a single perspective and I
don't want to do that so I've also got
in here the msi god x99 god-like carbon
and I've also got the new gigabyte x99
phoenix sli which is a white and orange
board and a thing about that be really
cool on a white case like like red mist
and do a white orange and white theme
yeah white orange white that makes sense
so I'm really torn oh yeah alright guys
I'm gonna get out of here vote down in
the description there's a link to the
straw poll vote on it and I'm curious to
what you guys have to say anyway I'm
getting out of here I'll see you guys in
the next one as always thanks for
