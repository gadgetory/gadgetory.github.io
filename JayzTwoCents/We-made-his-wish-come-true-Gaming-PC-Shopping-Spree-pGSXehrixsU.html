seriously r @ JS 2 cents we got to have
fun and kind of keep things light
hearted share our mistakes just sort of
goof around
we've done some fun collaborations in
the past like the Terry Crews project
we've done some stuff with a new egg and
you know a few other brands Linus tech
tips obviously the post Malone build a
lot of fun stuff very light-hearted
so when make-a-wish reached out to us
and said that there was a kid whose wish
was to meet me and make a computer I was
like really me of all people we were
honored to say the least
hi my name is case I was diagnosed with
Hodgkin's lymphoma in February of 2018
and ever since then my life has been
different to say the least it was like a
Friday milk morning before school we
were gonna go out for breakfast and then
that came in kind of ruined our life for
the next couple months as a parent have
a child going through cancer it's been
very difficult as one might imagine it
was horrifying especially the way we
found out but I think Minh tria lee
matter how a parent finds out that their
child is cancer right it's gonna be a
horrible thing but we had an amazing
support system across the board family
friends our church and our neighbors and
that's that's what got us through
make-a-wish has changed this experience
a lot near the beginning of my treatment
my sister actually referred me to make a
wish ever since that I've been looking
forward to this so much as I was driving
into the Micro Center parking lot to get
the computer parts seeing Jay and his
all crew they're standing there was just
it kind of hit me in the face right
there that I was there and so were they
so I first started filming at Micro
Center it was uh it was kind of a
feeling out process you know we're both
a little kind of we're both a little
nervous I'm nervous he's nervous his
parents are there make-a-wish is there
there's lots of eyes then he kind of
started loosening up I loosened up and
I'd learned quickly that the kids quick
he's a he's witty and he fits right in
he's got dry sarcastic humor and so we
immediately started having fun with that
he took everything we had in stride and
he dished it back plenty I also wanna
get a huge thank you to Micro Center
because when we talked to them about
this particular project where kids
reached out to us with wanting to build
his dream system with us and make a wish
we thought what better place to do it
than here at Micro Center since its
local huge part selection and obviously
they stepped up and said we would love
to be a part of this project so we're
gonna do now is we're gonna walk around
we're gonna find all the parts to build
an amazing system which he tells me he
wants to do live streaming right you
want star doing live streaming yeah any
particular games you want to stream
rocket League Pub G
and probably rainbow succeeds those are
my okay awesome
so you're a Tom Clancy fan have you
tried the division two yet no not yet
okay we'll see if we can get you a code
for that while we're here so alright
let's go and start putting together the
pieces and we need to build it ever
since I stepped foot outside the car at
Micro Center and stepped foot into micro
Center I've just been saying that it's
so surreal because it it probably won't
even hit me for a while yet but it's
just so weird being here with my
favorite youtuber and yeah it's just
been so amazing to be here
ever since I was young I've been I'll
I've always been interested in tech and
computers over the past couple years I
played a lot of video games and ever
since I was diagnosed watching J's
videos and playing video games were two
of the main things that kept me sane my
current system is an old Intel i7 2612
gigs of ram ddr3 I think I overclocked
to a bit and 1050 Ti that I have
basically pushed to the limits on
overclocking I'm looking forward to
probably playing games that higher than
45 frames a second I'm medium to high
detail
all right so here's the parts that we
chose we're back at the studio here with
Keynes and we're getting ready to build
this so it's going to go over the parts
because you kind of saw us choosing the
stuff but we didn't really talk about
why so 9900 Kay yeah you had this on
your PC part picker list yeah it is a
fantastic value in terms of having the
computing power to be able do things
like live streaming you said you wanted
to do that the overclocking of it is
fantastic
it keeps the costs more reasonable
without going to an X platform which for
the most part isn't even going to be
that about you much value to that
so motherboard what do we choose over
there you want you want to tell us the
maximum maximum x11 it's harder than it
looked at yeah it is the Maximus 11 hero
y5 a lousy 390 it is I think in terms of
memory 32 gigs of the Trident Z RGB
we've got of course the Asus 20 80 TI
Strix card that we're putting in there
they didn't have this X dot at micro
Center so this is one of my personal
cards so I'm proud to be able to get
this to you to enjoy for all your gaming
needs we've got our RM 1000 X power
supply which should be more than enough
for this build one terabyte nvme SSD
from Samsung this is the 970 Evo plus
and then we've got the 860 qvo which is
a 2 terabyte SATA Drive so the idea here
was that you're gonna have plenty of
room for all your games because we're
you telling me you have an 80 gig SSD
now I have 180 K SSD which I kind of had
to compress the windows files in order
to get a couple games on there
especially with the amount of storage
now needed for modern games in terms of
cooling
I forgot to mention we have the corsair
h 150 i Prosis is the 360 millimeter
variant of their H series we also used
the white corsair 560 x crystal so they
recently came out with a white white
variant that which is neat you can kind
of see the skeleton in there obviously
you not a build computer oh yeah I've
been watching a lot of videos but never
built on before oh this is gonna be even
better I didn't really do never built
one before I kind of want to just stand
back and just sort of let you do it and
then guide you as you go if you have any
questions I think that would be the
appropriate thing to do here I think you
should have as little hands on for me as
possible that way you can also say I
built this what do you think all right
that sounds good
unboxing complete Oh see how easy
ah easy when you're watching at home
I'll be honest if he hadn't told me that
he'd never built a computer before I
would have probably called him a liar
because he knew exactly was doing he's
researched the parts he he's watched
plenty of our videos Linus's videos
plenty of other youtubers videos on
building computers and it makes me feel
like we did a good job because he knew
what he was doing and that was cool yeah
you look bored I felt like I was doing
nothing like why was I here it was case
to sense for the day literally more or
less curiosity for me like how what what
happened to make you realize something
wasn't right well I was sick for about a
week but what kind of sick like flu just
like yeah fluish cold then we went to my
pediatrician and she just pointed out
what's that lump on your neck but there
was there was enough symptoms from the
start to go okay this isn't just a
normal cold or yeah so that I mean the
pediatrician from the get-go was
concerned oh yeah she scheduled blood
tests that we later found out that we're
kind of pointing towards Hodgkin's
lymphoma which was what I had imagined
the treatment started pretty quickly
yeah next month I'll see that would have
been a 900 on the table if you had if
that were out you see that when Kay said
he wanted to meet a youtuber for his
make-a-wish first of all I was delighted
to hear that his older sisters said oh
that's like the dumbest idea imaginable
but I I thought oh this sounds really
fun this is something that's right up
cases alley it's something that I can't
relate to because of my generation but I
know this means a lot to case and and it
seemed like an okay idea to me so today
has been a really fun day to see case
experiencing so much joy I guess I
anticipated that but I didn't realize
how much fun he would have today with
this make-a-wish experience especially
today doing the shopping spree meeting J
and everybody for today
was just a true delight for me as his
mom to see him go through these things
and being in the vaccines during the
video of the build today it really was a
treat to sit back and watch and and see
him all throughout the the build very
fun to watch just to participate in his
joy and to see the interaction with him
and with Jay we've talked about it I
guess a lot along the way but especially
in the past couple days about how the
strangeness of we're here because of an
awful thing but the awful thing is
making is you know there's a good thing
coming out of that awful thing then
there's this wonderful opportunity with
make-a-wish to be doing this right now I
mean it's just it's been such a joy to
see him experiencing what he's been
experiencing here the past couple days
and what will be happening moment of
truth the way that's normal if you get
an image here maybe there it is yeah
it's not hard is it it's easy you just
got you just have to be sarcastic you
know that's all it takes is some sarcasm
to be able to build a computer
so you said this is your first full
computer build a Defen scratch how do
you feel how do you think wet I think it
went pretty well there are some hiccups
but everything's working now so yeah
yeah so we dealt with this particular
motherboard for whatever reason didn't
want to let us use fan splitters off of
any of the PWM s and even a fan
splitter controller where you plug in
one PWM header and then the controller
does the rest so we ended up just
switching it to the high amp output and
everything's working fine a IO is
showing up perfectly fine everything
works what do you think the most
difficult part is I always ask people
this when they build a computer for the
first time what's the most difficult
part not really sure the most time
taking part would probably be cable
management and you're gonna probably
play around this a bunch
even if you get at home in terms of like
changing the way cables were routed and
stuff I bet you completely rebuild it I
wouldn't be surprised if you do it like
for fun you take it apart and rebuild it
I have no doubt that's gonna happen at
some point but I don't think there's
much of a difficult part to this well
I'll be honest if you hadn't told me
you've never built a computer before
from scratch like you tell me you've
changed like RAM and stuff like that
yeah I would have said I don't believe
you because it seemed like you were
pretty natural and it sounds like you're
pretty techie you know you're talkin
bout you built a Tesla coil for school
or something obviously we have a
natural-born computer enthusiast here so
I wouldn't be surprised if we see more
great things from you in the future but
obviously thanks for this opportunity
for us honestly I mean I think the the
experience here went both ways yeah huge
thank you to make a wish for bringing
Caze out and of course Kay's family for
taking the time to do this as well so
enjoy it I will if we play games
together you better let me win and with
that we're gonna go ahead end this now
and let you enjoy it so thank you I'm
glad you're still with us
to a lifelong of good health yeah thanks
guys see in the next one
he even walked off stage left in my push
button get the twist bet you see you
feel try using for the first time two
times a charm thought you watched my
videos you don't go over every single
screw ion mirror we've been so many
bills its total secure a computer
building channel almost almost you're
not there yet we try I can see your
frustration building already with the
wires it's funny to watch kinda thanks
I've taught them well or just watch them
off Linus's videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
