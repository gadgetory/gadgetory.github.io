cents and I'm bringing you a second
video for today while we play some
cocktail music in the background and
have a little discussion on how i feel
about Google+ this isn't something I
want to talk about it's something that I
don't know I so many people have talked
about it I've just kind of stood in the
background and just watched three things
three major topics i want to discuss
today first being the bob thing the bob
movement second being what i feel is
wrong with the comments section and
third how I feel about Google forcing us
to use Google+ first I do not think that
the Bob movement is going to change
anything it's a harmless exploit nothing
is happening of it it's an it's an
annoying exploit on it that's too loud
or not it sanics annoying exploit that's
not hurting anybody and until an exploit
comes around through which segues me
into the next thing i don't like about
the comments section is the fact that
you could put up hyperlinks in the
comments section until somebody gets
their identity stolen or some horrible
malicious virus or something spreads
because of google and youtube nothing's
going to happen guys Bob isn't going to
change a thing that's why don't allow
him on my channel it makes it harder for
me to get through the comments and talk
to you guys to the point to where I've
honestly been making very minimal
efforts to even look at the comments
because of how up they really are
sorry for my language there but that's
what the comment section of YouTube is
now it's up even more than it was
before and Google thought they were
fixing it and all they did was make it a
spammers haven now the thing i don't
like about the comments section is there
needs to be character limits because i
don't want to open up a book and see
huge ascii art there shouldn't be links
and that's I don't like the way the
order them let me control the way i want
to see them don't put up what you think
i feel is relevant let me choose what i
think is relevant let me sort how I want
not just newest and top comments let me
decide I do like the fact though that
they added in their filtering now so I
can filter out certain words that's
that's a big deal to me I like that that
has nothing to do with Google+ these are
comment changes that could have been all
along
now here's why I think they force
Google+ down our throat Google+ is a
platform that they know they missed the
boat on there five years late to the
social media game and they want to be
able to advertise on Google Plus just
like they do on YouTube and they're not
happy with placing videos on or ads on
my videos and taking the money that I'm
doing the work for that's not good
enough for them they want to pull up
every pull in every penny that they can
by putting ads over everything that they
own they want to be just one big giant
digital billboard and because of that
they know that nobody's using Google+
and since Google owns YouTube now they
just want to be able to say okay well
hey if we force people to use Google+
through YouTube and every time they make
a youtube comment it counts as a Google+
comment they can go to advertisers and
say look at these metrics look at these
millions of users that we have using
Google+ which is really nothing more
than just one big sham that's why
Google's doing it Google wants to show
that people are using Google+ when
they're really not because they know
that Google+ sucks google+ will never go
anywhere and they're forcing it down our
throat to make it look like it's going
somewhere that's why google+ is not
going to go away google is not going to
revert its decision google has never
reverted any major decisions I've ever
made like this they don't care how we
feel about Google+ they really don't
because they know that we're going to
keep using it and there's there may be a
huge falling out on youtube but there
will be new users who will come and just
use it and adopt and adapt they don't
care they really don't so what am I
going to do about it well first off this
isn't a shameless social media plug but
I do have facebook and twitter that I've
always communicated with you guys on
when I've always encouraged people to
contact me that way because I get over
10,000 comments a month before all the
spam and it's impossible for me to see
all of your guys's comments but if you
send me a tweeter you send me a Facebook
message or something I almost always get
back to those so that's the best way to
get to hold me right now I am also
already working on a discussion forum
like all the other youtubers who have
the tech blogs and tech videos like I do
have utilized so I am working on that
which will give you a place to go and
contact me if you want
now some of you may go well doesn't
having a website that you have to
register on the comment isn't that just
as bad as Google Plus and YouTube well
yes and don't be registering on there it
just keeps BOTS and other people from
posting anonymous spam and stuff yeah
sounds a lot like Google right but the
difference between this forum that I'm
putting together and the integration
with Google and YouTube is google is
requiring that you use Google+ to even
be a part of YouTube I wouldn't require
that you register just to look at the
forms but if you want to comment you
would have to register and I'm not
forcing you to do it it doesn't change
the way that you watch my videos you
don't have to register to watch my
videos so it's different in that aspect
but that's how I feel about the whole
google+ thing they're doing it to boost
our numbers and look like people care
when they really don't the comments
section needs to remove links that is
the biggest biggest deal breaker with me
ascii art is annoying and it's really
annoying to go on there and remove giant
pictures of dicks off of my website
that's extremely annoying or my paid my
videos it's extremely annoying and there
needs to be character limits just so
that I don't expand a comment and
sometimes you may think you're expanding
a comment by the way and it's a link so
i don't even expand comments anymore I
don't need to see a book of a thousand
words guys if you wanted me to read that
there's other ways to go about it
because I wouldn't do it in the comment
anyway it's just too much so there it is
guys if you want to talk to me directly
I'm not really checking the YouTube
comments anymore because they're just so
screwed up do it through the social
media and in the future to do it through
the website that I'm putting together
it's all I wanted to say you guys wanted
to know my opinion on it there it is if
you don't like it Oh the last thing i
want to say real quick before i get out
of here people suggested that in the
meantime i do a subreddit well I feel
like subreddit is the other cesspool of
the Internet I don't like Reddit I don't
like Reddit whatsoever so if you don't
like me now because I don't like reddit
that's your prerogative I'm not
concerned that you don't like me because
I don't like reddit if you would want to
unsub or not like or not like me anymore
because i don't like a website that you
do you have bigger problems in the fact
i don't like the website anyway right
it's not going to happen guys I'll see
you later thanks for watching this video
you guys asked for it there's no waiting
or anything it's just a vlog Yves Logghe
vlog going up on the internet on a
Sunday and I'm gonna go relax now and
I'm gonna play some
I field for a little bit later tonight
so if you see me hop on and try and kill
me or take my dog tags I don't have any
cool tags so you'll get a bunch of blank
ones all right guys I'll see you later
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
