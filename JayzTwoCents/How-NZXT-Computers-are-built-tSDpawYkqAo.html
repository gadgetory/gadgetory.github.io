video I did a few months back we took a
look at NZXT SB LD pre-built service we
took a look at the build quality the
cable management we did some
benchmarking on it well guys this is
part two of that where we came down to
NZXT headquarters where we're actually
going to follow one of those orders
through the process and show you exactly
what happens when you order a system
from NZXT do you want to be cooler you
want to be more desirable you know what
guys I got new merch it's available now
Kavi calm /jc sense we got zip up
hoodies we got tri-blend we got a new
logo I digress
since 2012 it's at the wrist logo you
guys been asking for that anyway well
guys live it up we can all kinds of
stuff zip up hoodies have beanies polos
don't take my word for it cuz obviously
I can't do this edie so just look in the
description below and you guys have find
the link Thanks
so what are the unique things about NZXT
SB LD service is that you can actually
choose the games you want to play on
their website and that will give you an
expected FPS for those games based on
the price point that you pick now we're
in the cage right here which is where
all the best stuff is kept you got your
graphics cards or CPUs your memory and
when the order comes in it looks like
this it's on a picking sheet someone
will personally come and pick all of
these parts and put it on a cart that
cart will then be wheeled off to one of
the builders who will give it a very
personal touch in terms of building your
system now this is kind of like like
kind of like nerd heaven right here all
the best things are in this cage in fact
there's even in RTX 20 atti right here I
don't think they'll miss it I mean
they've got enough of them so so once
the parts are picked and they're put on
a cart they make their way to a builder
now this is where all of the bill it
happens in NZXT build you can tell
there's a bit of a theme there and they
actually have something what's called a
blitz service which means if you get
your order in by 11 a.m. Pacific time
it'll be built tested and shipped by
4:00 p.m. the same day it's called their
blitz service in fact that's the order
I'm holding right here it's part of I
probably should go put it back so you
can start building this but I digress
this is where all the building takes
place of course they are all running
NZXT cases which have built-in cable
management so all of these systems are
built with a lot of cleanliness involved
which has unfortunately something that
not a lot of builders take in mind
you know mind if I watch you you you
okay be on camera yeah all right so what
are you building okay so what are you
building over here eighty seven okay ten
atti in what cases this is 700 hundred
page seven hundred i they have almost as
many screws as I do although theirs is
all the same size I have to pick through
all mine so it's way too organized in
here when I build parts just tend to
like explode in 360 just everywhere and
then I'm like where did I put that screw
where'd I put that i/o shield I can't
find anything these guys aren't builders
they're way too organized I think
they're robots
so this is QA and QC right here this is
the first stop in assurance testing so
all of the drivers are gonna be
installed right here obviously your
operating system all the updates all the
things that are usually the worst part
of building a computer having to deal
with all the software software is not
fun it's kind of like that doldrum in
between building it in the build
excitement and then playing your games
and stuff is you've got to deal with all
that that tedious work that nobody likes
and that's what happens right here now
they're also gonna do stress testing on
this they're gonna run all systems with
prime95 they're gonna run it with fur
mark in fact an entire bench you know
suite of different stability tests to
make sure that when the system arrives
to its customer that it is as stable as
possible now as soon as it passes all of
its QC QA it's ready to go over to
shipping now this isn't just a shipping
department they're us you're actually
checking for accuracy on the order so
they take the original picking sheet and
they inspect all the parts that were
installed to make sure that they are a
hundred percent accurate and it's
checked like that along the entire
process now we actually followed an
order here that was a blitz order that
made its way from parts picking to build
to testing and then to shipping and it
took about an hour and a half or so for
that order to go from when we started it
all the way to where it was in the box
and ready to be picked up by the courier
now one of the things that they do here
as well as they have all this custom cut
foam which is designed for each case at
each box and all the boxes are pre-made
their double wall extra thick so that it
arrives at its intended destination with
well as little damage as possible I mean
obviously EPS and FedEx have sometimes
other
you're packaging but NZXT takes extreme
caution when it comes to packing these
systems so that they're going to arrive
in 100% working condition in fact if you
look right here you can actually see the
wall of foam all these custom cut panels
to fit in the boxes that they're gonna
go in and like I said we followed this
guy right here from the start to finish
and we're not gonna follow it to the
customer's house I probably a little
weird if we just showed up unannounced
but anyway guys if you want to learn
more about NZXT a look at the link in
the description below we did a video on
this before we talked about you know the
process and we received the system and
we kind of took a look at it and we
benchmarked it but I wanted to come here
and kind of invade their space to see
what the process actually looks like and
I can't tell you how many systems
actually ship per day but I can tell you
it's enough to have a massive team like
you saw behind me here in this video to
make sure that these orders are done in
a timely manner and they're done with a
extremely high level of quality and care
so guys I want you go ahead and go and
check out build at the link in the
description below and as always guys we
will see you in the next one today well
we are here we are here car broke this
is where Tom so one of the unique things
about winning unioning okay so I'm BL
Dee's website do it one more time it
sound better this is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
