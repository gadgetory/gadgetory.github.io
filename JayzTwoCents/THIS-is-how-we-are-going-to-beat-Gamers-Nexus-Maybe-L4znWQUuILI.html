Steve this doesn't okay here we are guys
our very first video of CES 2019 of
course we were kicking things off here
EVGA because they've got a new graphics
card one we've been waiting for for a
while and that is of course at the 28th
ETI kingpin before we talk about that I
need to thank our sponsor is that being
corsair and the new corsair one HPD
desktop so go and check them out in the
link below again a huge thank you to
Corsair for sponsoring our trip this
year now this is the kingpin 28 dpi card
we've been waiting for for a while the
Turing architecture is kind of plagued
with power delivering power limits I
don't want some issues but very low
overhead what that means is although the
core is great at overclocking the power
delivery system of it really holds it
back where even if you have temperatures
kept down into the 50s on water you
could still see power limit becoming
what's holding you back if you haven't
seen our coverage on that go and check
it out well kingpin being of course
kingpin has removed all of those limits
virtually all of those limits with his
custom card now this is like the fifth
kingpin card I believe it is this has a
520 watt TDP no to tell you what that
means when we had our two XT ultras
which had a custom BIOS on there which
would allow us to go to a hundred and
fifty-three percent power draw on top of
the founders vrm design we were seeing
roughly three hundred and forty ish
watts so this is capable of nearly 200
more watts of power draw than what we
were seeing when we already had broken
the world record when we had that
attempt so if you were to take something
like this and hook it up to exotic
cooling like say ln2 or dry ice then you
would definitely be able to see maybe a
chip limitation long before power limit
which is what was really holding back
that competition between Steve and I
obviously the intro is a little bit of a
joke we know that Steve is gonna
probably get the same cards but that's
the fun of it because then it becomes to
who's the better overclock or who's
willing to take more risks and who won
the lottery draw but when it comes to
the lottery draw these are binned chips
as you would expect these are the best
of the best these are the chips that
were set aside to go into their fastest
most limited production card now there's
a few things that we don't have
information on yet we don't know what
the price is going to be this is still
early
during sample there's gonna be some
minor tweaks coming out we don't know
what some of the final renditions of
this is gonna be in fact I asked him if
I could overclock it right now cuz it's
running stock out of the box and they
were like unfortunately it's not ready
like the BIOS and stuff it needs some
more tweaks but in terms of features
it's got some pretty interesting stuff
this is the first water-cooled kingpin
card normally we would see these massive
copper heatsink designs which were
designed to a3 fan design or to fan back
like the 1980s and the 90s GI it was one
of those things where it's kind of like
you take the world's best overclocking
card and then put air cooling on it and
it's like that kind of defeats the
purpose so at least this time they went
with a 120 millimeter AIO now I asked
them if this AIO being a 120 mil was
gonna hold back the card in any way
because you know it's an overclocking
card and they said they found that going
with a bigger rad like a 240 didn't
really help things very much now it's
pretty warm but they also wanted max
compatibility with more cases and
because a lot of people are running a
iOS and they're gonna be putting them in
the top or the front of their cases and
120 has more compatibility with going in
that rear exhaust fan setup but as you
can see with the OLED right here this is
gonna tie in with their XOC software and
with the OLED display you can show any
bit of information you want now
currently this card is bouncing between
1920 and 1830 out of the soft settings
or out of the box settings nothing's
been touched and it's sitting at what's
the temperature here that's cycling
through but I think it was sitting at 58
C or 54 C 56c and it's been running
battlefield 5 now for hours this has
been on all day running battle of 5 you
can come here and experience it of
course RTX is on 1440p panel all
settings max and it's sitting at 56 C
with the fan on a very conservative
curve okay so you guys have probably
heard by now that Nvidia is launched its
mid-range card the r-tx 2060 another
controversial card that people either
love or hate but love it or hate it it's
here that's next-gen and that's what
we've got to talk about so we've got
three new cards from EVGA covering the
2060 spectrum the $349 price point and
kind of up from there so this is the
2060 SC this is not a reference PCB but
it is a their 200 for tour 300
349 would be nice you guys quote me on
that they're gonna charge you 249 for
this okay just kidding please don't
quote me $349 price point this is the
RTX 2060s see it's a four plus two power
design we've got the XC we're very
similar and sound very much alike on
camera SC and XC which is basically the
same thing as the SC but it's got a
little different bios higher boost clock
higher base clock give you a little bit
more performance the same PCB same power
phase delivery and all of that this over
here the XC ultra is a two slot if you
guys can't tell these are shorter PCBs
but three slot this is a longer card it
is a two slot six plus two power
delivery and other than that it's a all
custom PCB so none of these are really
based on the founders edition PCB but
they are designed for overclocking and
give you a little bit extra Headroom
trying to give you some more value now I
don't have concrete pricing on this yet
but it sounds like they are really
trying to hit that $349 price point and
these kind of step up incrementally this
one here was said to be something like
389 or somewhere around there so I think
you guys can obviously expect to see
2060s between 350 and 400 dollars
depending on how premium the card is so
anyway guys that has been what EVGA is
shown here with some new cards obviously
the twenty atti kingpin this is
important I guess that we're gonna beat
Steve with this and this one's actually
mine so thanks for watching guys and you
will see you will see you in the next
one nobody sees me leaving so this is
perfect I can't get back in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
