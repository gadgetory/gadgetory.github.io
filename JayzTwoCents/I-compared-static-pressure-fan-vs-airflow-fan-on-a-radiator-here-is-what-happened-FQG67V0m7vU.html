gonna aim to make this one a fast one
because I want to get to the point
I'm tired of dwelling on this topic I've
talked about it so much you would think
that I would have already done this
video but I'm an idiot and I never did
today we're going to do two direct
comparisons between a static pressure
optimized fan and an airflow optimized
fan on the same radiator on the same
device with the exact same RPM settings
running the same test with the same
ambient temp to get tail we got a lot of
constants going on here
and we're gonna see once and for all
what kind of differences there really
are based on fan type okay so here's the
setup I've got a EVGA GTX 1080 hybrid
and I'm using that card because well
it's an all-in-one loop on a graphics
car they get hotter faster I can do this
test more quickly and it's very very
consistent and unlike CPU which is doing
a lot of other random things but that's
besides the point anyway it's got 120
millimeter all in one radiator in there
it's a 30ml radiator so it's going to
give us a pretty good example of what
kind of temperature Delta's we're
looking for your Delta or the difference
between the two is what we're really
after here now for the fans I've got two
identical fans here well with the
exception of the blade design they are
both Corsair 120 millimeter quiet
Edition fans so they're going to be
running a max of 1200 rpm except one is
an SP and one is an AF airflow and
static pressure so we're going to do our
first test here on heaven we're going to
let the thing run at 4k until the
temperatures equalize at a particular
temperature and whatever that may be the
max temp and then we're going to compare
our baseline with the static pressure
fan because that's the fan that people
say you have to go with then we're going
to slap on the air cooled or the airflow
fan and we're going to see what the
differences really are I have to make
sure obviously with my thermometer that
the room ambient temp is the same
there's a lot of variables here we've
got a Kevlar there's like highschool
science
alright enough talking let's get to it
that was stupid
transition
okay so this thing's been running for a
while now actually looks like we got a
baseline of about 49 to 50 see it's kind
of bouncing back and forth right there
we might have actually hit 51 for just
like a split second I'm going to check
that now I know you guys probably can't
see it too good it's actually in 4k now
it's really small max temperature 51
like I said but it flattened out right
at 49 50 49 54 9 feet and that's where
it stayed so that's our baseline we're
going to do now we're gonna do the exact
same test with with with this pin that's
how that's how it works so compare and
contrast works if you guys are in high
school and you do science class you note
that okay should okay just do it
now I've just started the test here with
the airflow fan but the one thing worth
pointing out and this isn't a surprise
to me I expected this but one thing
worth pointing out is one of the reasons
why I put paper on these radiators like
that is it gives you a visual
representation of the amount of pressure
coming through the fan and the amount of
airflow so you can see kind of a
comparison between the two if one if the
paper is being pushed up higher with one
fan and the other that means it's more
airflow and you can see that with the AF
fan the paper is not moving as far as
the espy fan and they're both running at
1,200 rpm the running at their max right
now but the question is does that equate
to different temperatures well it's
running and we'll come back at the end
and we'll talk about the results okay
our test has been running long enough
here we've got a lock temperature of
about 55 degrees Celsius it bounces down
to 54 every now and then then comes back
up to 55 and then there's a scene where
the islands are kind of floating in the
sky whenever that scene happens it pops
up to 56 and then comes back down to 55
so if we compare the two that is
obviously a temperature delta of 5
degrees Celsius if we look at the max
with the little spikes in temps that we
saw a 51 verse is 56 and we're seeing
about 3 to 4 Celsius Delta between the
average temperatures now on the surface
that leaves a lot of room for argument
that yeah static pressure fans are
obviously better for radiators no one's
ever argued that in fact they are
optimized static pressure for a reason
but the whole point of this here was to
see just how much of a difference there
really is now let's take a look at the
setup here real quick to understand the
results a little bit more we have a
graphics card that was overclocked to
2088 megahertz max voltage and the
memory was running at plus
400 so we're putting a decent amount of
heat although the memory is not touching
the cooling plate in this test I
overclocked it anyway just for the hell
of it that's what I do on a 120
millimeter radiator that's only 30
millimeters thick
so we are already asking a lot of the
radiator now if we were to take the
radiator and make that a 240 red would
have seen much closer results on the
temperatures because radiator surface
area is more important than the type of
I think I just hit the mic this video is
full of fail the radiator surface area
is a bit more important than the fan
blade design now obviously if you have a
choice
optimize it go with the right stuff at
the start but I just wanted to put some
people at ease that if they got the
wrong fan they don't need to freak out
they're not going to ruin their system
you know if you want to know a little
bit more about things like push pool
because that's obviously the next
question then check out this video right
here I've already done a comparison of
push pull and push pool on this exact
same setup so you can see how that
compares there's a lot of confusion when
it comes to fans up I've done videos
about fan setups and stuff I mean gosh
there's there's so many videos about
fans on this channel because there's
constant debates over it
but a lot of people get really caught up
on this stuff and they really start to
obsess over one little thing and they
kind of miss the big picture anyway
worst case scenario here tiny radiator
hot graphics card running overclocked
you saw we saw a max of 5c Delta on
spikes and only about 3 C on our average
temp that's not bad like I said if I put
a 240 in here and put 2 SPS vs. almost
did it again vs. 2 SPS and two air flows
we would have probably seen only about a
2 degree difference maybe even one looks
like I've got a topic for another video
that's ok this this conversation will
never die so we can just keep talking
about it till the end of days alright
guys thanks for watching as always I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
