no it's not dress up like a road cone
day or Caltrans Appreciation Month I
just got done riding my bike for 18
miles prior to making this video so I
just didn't really feel like changing
you today's video is sponsored by master
ah the largest community commerce
platform in the world had to master up
today and suggest something to be
dropped and I'm like literally drop it
you know where they bring the price down
and stuff but I also just got back from
Portland at the famous PDX land and yeah
guys I know there's bigger lands in
Europe another's dream caster dream Tech
or whatever it's called and Sweden
that's really really big but damn it
stop taking the wind out of my sails it
was a cool event it was my first land
party and it actually became pretty
apparent and I learned something very
quickly and that is that many large
individuals in one room for three days
tends to start to get kind of smelly
actually that's that's not the point I
wanted to make it all but the point I
wanted to make was that everybody had
some sort of headset because in a loud
environment like that you have to and it
got me thinking what's the best headset
on the market well it very well may be
the one that you make and yes I know Tek
syndicate already did this video you got
it you got a copy those that are that
are better than you so one of the more
popular videos regarding headsets and
gaming headsets and headphones is
actually text into kits video about the
mod mic and when mass drop hit me up and
said hey do you want to check out the
mod mic 4.0 I was like absolutely
because I'm in the same position a lot
of you are I like good sound and I like
good headsets or headphones the problem
is gaming headsets inherently have
mediocre sound and terrible mics on them
so what do you do well if you've got
your favorite pair of headphones or
you've got you know your nice audiophile
sound and you get on your computer to do
PC gaming usually the experience is a
little bit less than desirable
especially when it comes to the
microphone Department now we're going to
be taking a look today at antlions mod
mic 4.0 and
Packaging is actually very very small
and modest it just has this little
cardboard sleeve it says int lying on it
and you've got this semi rigid pouch
here when you open it up it's very very
basic the mod Mike is just kind of
chilling in there all folded up and then
you've got the Mike itself right here
now basically the way this works is it
has a pretty decent magnetic a little
adhesive thing two of them that you can
mount on to your favorite headphones
typically there might be something of
audiophile grade or better than a gaming
headset that you would typically find
and then it's got clips that you can you
know plug the cables to each other and
then you have a microphone a very good
quality microphone hooked up to your
favorite headphones so there's really
not a whole lot to say about it other
than let's go ahead and get it installed
on because it comes with two adapters
I'm actually going to be putting them on
my two favorite headphones those being
my AKG k 7x X's right here and we're
also going to be putting them on my
audio technica ath m50 X's both of these
have very different sound signatures
both of these have very different these
are closed back these are open back and
we're going to go ahead and make
basically two gaming headsets out of one
ant mic mod or antlion mud-like
4.0 so let's go ahead and get these
things installed so as I mentioned
inside the package it's pretty basic
you've got the mod mic itself right here
it's got a nice little windscreen on
there to help basically it's like a
built-in pop filter nice long cord and
then see here's a nice long cord not
braided or anything it's just rubberized
you got your standard a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack right there
and then inside this little Ziploc
baggie which is kind of shoved in there
admittedly I've already had this thing
out of here but whatever it's okay
otherwise I'd look like a real fool on
camera more so than I already do but
inside here you've got a few things
going on you have got two of the
magnetic adapter my bobbers as you
attach to your headphones and then you
have got one two three four five of
these clips that are designed to clip
the cord for the mic get it get it on on
screen there J you start
act a lot like Barney Cleese video here
alright so you want it we got five these
clips that you can use to connect the
mod mic cord to the headphone jack or
cord that way you don't have it flopping
all around there as you can see here the
adapter is just a magnet on one side
with the teeth in there so that you can
rotate the mic around up and away or
down in front of you and then it's just
an adhesive on one side now they do say
that the adhesive will work on metals
mesh plastics wood but it will not stick
to rubberized surfaces so you want to
keep that in mind okay so I've already
taken the adhesive back off of these
little adapter there we're going to go
ahead and magnetically stick that on to
the mod mic itself so as you can see
it's stuck on right there and then we
are going to basically just stick that
kind of in the middle of the ear cup
there in a position that we want it to
be in that way in its resting position
it's going to be kind of in a position
that we want it to be in now the cool
thing about this adapter it actually
sticks on there really really good so as
you can see there's our mic and then we
can just rotate that up out of the way
so let me get this some focus here you
can just rotate it it's now in front of
your mouth and rotate it up and out of
the way there you go
so since we have two adhesive
thingamabob errs we can pop this off and
now we can have our second gaming
headset so let's go ahead and do that so
these are my AKG k7 x x is also sent
over from master op dang I love those
guys I would not have this high-end
audio stuff or mid-range audio depending
how you look at it without those guys so
make sure you give them a look man
they've really supported this channel
but alright so once again I've stuck the
adapter here on to the mod mic and what
we're going to do now is we are going to
go ahead and test what they say about
using it with mesh they say it works
with meshed headphones so I've gone
ahead and stuck it on there and as you
can see boom there it is so we can also
flip those up and out of the way those
don't flip up and out of the way as well
they don't go straight up because as you
can see the headphones here they stick
out but I can put it up behind me and
it's a mod it's a you know it's a it's a
flexible mic so we could do that and
then when we're ready to game flip that
around I can there we go and just put
the mic back where you want it and it's
staying on there that's not going
anywhere that's really stuck on there so
we've got those there now we've got
basically at AKG K 7x s or xx
gaming headset I guess there's only one
thing left to do that's going to be a
mic test cue up the transition okay now
here we are we are recording directly to
audacity we're not going to be doing any
sort of post-processing no compression
no noise removal no bass adding no
treble adding no clarification high pass
filter none of that stuff this is
exactly as it's coming out of the
microphone going into a desk now the
levels look pretty good we're not
peeking see how sensitive it is uh-uh
one two three one two three I am
recording now guys this is Gabe e46 AM
radio
today's coming at you yet that was dumb
this is why I don't work in radio I have
no idea how it sounds though that's one
of the best parts about doing these mic
reviews I'm going to leave it to you
guys I want you guys to tell me how it
sounds now I did do a quick playback on
it just like one sentence to make sure
it was recording but I didn't have my
headphones on and my speakers were
turned down so I have no idea
how it sounds so we're going to right
now is we're gonna do a noise floor test
we're going to see how well it actually
picks up the background noise skunkworks
is running windows open you might hear
dogs barking I hear a baby crying in the
background so let's go ahead do a few
seconds here of silence and let's go
ahead and see how it sounds
all right now it's going to do some
handling see how it sounds when you
handle it
all right well whoa looking over there
as audacity I think it picked up
something well there you go guys mod mic
4.0 make sure you guys head on over to
mass drop give them a huge thank you for
sponsoring today's video by sending this
thing on over now they are doing a mass
drop on this at least that's the plan
and if there is a drop on this it will
be down in the description there'll be a
link in there you guys can head on over
there I get no kick back from the drops
all I did was send it over it gives me
content for the channel gives you guys
something to get a little bit cheaper
through master up which is kind of a
neat service where they will broker
cheaper prices if enough people sign up
to want to buy something they go to the
manufacturer manufacturer says yeah you
get 10 people want to buy this will
knock five bucks off or something like
that so it's a good service I don't know
how anyone could go wrong with that it's
completely free to sign up and really
live Jerry uses it I use it lots of
people use mass drop there you go guys
mod my 4.0 what would you do with it how
do you think it sounds sound off in the
comments and yeah guys I know that like
stand alone mics like the Yeti or the
audio technica at2020 they're going to
sound better but look at what those are
versus what this is let's keep the
comparisons relevant alright see you the
next one have this that's the idea I
will see you you'll see me I won't see
you if I see you then that's really
weird especially if it's in the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
