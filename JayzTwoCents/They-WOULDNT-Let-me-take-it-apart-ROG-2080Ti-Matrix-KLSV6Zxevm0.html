course that is Corsair in the Corsair
one high performance desktop PC the
i-140 8i 160 and I 180 to be found in
the link in description below so you've
probably already seen this in your feed
but you haven't seen it for me this is a
Seuss's new r-tx 2080 TI matrix card you
you may or may not have heard of the
matrix that well not the movie we all
live in the mid matrix i chose the blue
pill but I digress that's beside the
point the matrix was part of the ROG II
line of products and and that's kind of
been replaced with Strix and a couple of
other things you know the ROG has
obviously always been the flagship
especially for the gaming line but
matrix is something we haven't really
seen since like the GTX 980 and the 290x
from AMD
it was very robust coolers it was very
over designed not over designed over
delivered power delivery usually you
couldn't scratch that before you run out
of core you know clock and stability
there but it was designed to be a heavy
hitting overclocking just do what you
can do card well it's back and what they
decide to do with this one here is
everyone sort of come up with their own
hybrid designs and that usually that
just involves putting a ASA tech block
into the shroud and then having some
tubes come out of it going into another
ASA Tech radiator they've decided to
make this a self-contained AIO that is
built in-house that is not based on an
ASA Tech's design so let's go and take a
look at the actual cooling plate first
so this is what the cooling plate looks
like on an ASA tech block this is what
well this is actually the cooling plate
the pump would go on top of it this is
what you'll find in any ACE detect based
a IO whether it be on a GPU or a CPU
cooler this is what they came up with
for the matrix so as you can see it's
got a much more dense much larger fin
array or fin stack that's going to give
you better cooling that has full dye
coverage but you'll notice the plate is
also really really big well the reason
for that is so that they can cover all
of the chips as well so you can see if
we line this guy up right there you can
see not only is it touching the actual
die for the GPU it's touching the memory
as well because memory overclocking on
our TX has actually been pretty
impressive and we pushed when we were
doing our overclocking competition
versus Steve we pushed our memory all
the way up to you 12
190 I think it was at one point that's
1290 overclock or 1.29 gigahertz on top
of the already you know the speed that
it runs out which is 7000 megahertz so
it was pretty insane so what you're able
to see right here is a fully
self-contained radiator built in to the
actual cooler the what would typically
be the triple fan design on an
air-cooled card is just pushing air down
through the radiator also pushing air
down onto the vrm directly which has a
heatsink that's on top of that so it is
definitely a hybrid in the sense that
it's using both air and water to do the
job but it's not requiring you to use up
any sort of fan slots in your system
it's not requiring you to run hoses
anywhere it's 100% maintenance-free but
it comes with all the features that you
would expect with being a premium ROG
product of course it's got ROG ROG yes
ROG has ROG in case you hadn't heard has
RGB as you would expect of course it's
going to use GPU tweak to overclock and
stuff I believe eighteen hundred and
fifteen megahertz to see out of the box
boosts clock and of course because of
GPU 3.0 gpb's 3.0 it's definitely going
to push farther as the thermals allow
which is the whole point of having an
over built cooling system like this so
we can expect to see this coming soon we
don't have pricing information or
anything on that yet which is kind of
the theme at CES you see the cool stuff
coming you don't know exactly when or
what the pricing is going to be but yeah
you could definitely take a look at this
as it comes out hopefully we'll get to
do or if you wanted I'm sure Asus will
be able to hook something up so that we
can overclock this see how far it can go
take advantage of the additional power
delivery you know robustness we'll make
that work robustness of it I'm assuming
with that we were gonna see some
increased power limits and which has
been the thing that's unfortunately held
back the 28 ETI in terms of how far you
can push it is power so that's what you
can expect from the 2080 tid matrix from
asus rog let me know what you guys think
about this in the comments down below
and as always a huge thank you to our
sponsor for sending us here this year
