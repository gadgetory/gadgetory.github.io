here bringing us some discussion here on
something that I'm asked about quite
often some of you graduating high school
graduating college and you guys have
found yourself with a little bit of
spending money and you want to know what
to do with it well a couple months ago I
promised you guys I would circle back
and give you my true in depth review on
three panels and SLI and whether or not
it's right for you so that's we're going
to talk about today multiple panels SLI
and whether or not is something you
should even consider spending your
hard-earned or stolen dollars on
wherever maybe I won't judge I'm a
judging and this is a reward I would I
would turn you in like that all right
first things first let's talk about the
panel's yes I do have three cheapy
panels I have never been a panel snob
I've been a hardware snob never been a
panel snob they're $130 piece less than
500 for all three 1080p five millisecond
response time contrast ratio on them is
good color rendering on them is okay
could be better that's why sometimes I
look really yellow or really funky in my
videos because some of the color
correction or color accuracy of these TN
panels are not great now with that said
you guys use whatever panels you frickin
want to use I don't care I don't care
I'm not a panel snob in fact you guys
could tell me that you you're using some
no-name Korean brand and no I'm not
talking about BenQ I wouldn't even care
because my god honest opinion is used
whatever works for you now with that
said let's go ahead and talk about my
experience on games and how I really
feel about the experience I've created
for myself here in this beast
especially since I'm getting ready to
move this all in to project skunk works
or whatever it's going to be called and
I've been highly debating putting my
third 780 in here taken out of the test
rig putting one of these graphics cards
up here in the test rig and going with
3-way SLI then I got to thinking you
know that's probably quite a bit
overkill now the way I see it there are
all types of gamers out there but they
pretty much fall into three categories
as far as I see it you've got your your
FPS shooter gamer your simulator gamer
and your
Oh gamer now there's a lot of other
types of gamers out there strategy games
card games side scrollers and all that
sort of stuff for the most part this
video probably isn't even going to
pertain to you but let's go ahead
address these three types of gamers and
whether or not this setup even makes
sense for you now we'll go ahead and
talk about the FPS gamer clearly I've
got battlefield 4 running behind me now
FPS shooters I'm going to tell you right
now and I knew this going in these games
do not benefit whatsoever from having
three panels if anything it hurts you in
the long run
the short run and the mid run and the
moment you start playing yeah it's
pretty it's beautiful it's a wow factor
your friends walk in and go wow he's got
that still cool but then people start
playing it and you let them sit down
they start playing they go this is weird
this is really weird many other shooters
not just this franchise they're kind of
tricking you they make you think you're
getting three full panels of rendered
gameplay but they're not they're not
giving you three panels of rendered
gameplay they're giving you two panels
stretched over three what happens is the
side monitors start to look really
stretched out from about halfway across
the panel so what they've really done is
they've rendered the center center panel
and half of each of the side panels and
then taking that half and just stretched
it across the entire screen so the side
screw of the monitor or the side of the
field of view no matter how you adjust
the field of view all the way up or all
the way down I've played with it you
know that was kind of oh it's kind of
cool
I need a 3d camera so I'm gonna start
just like throwing things all right back
on topic it screws with your vision it
screws with your hand-eye coordination
it screws you with your little lip it
screws with your visual acuity you have
a harder time picking out targets you
have a harder time identifying your
target and you have to learn your
hand-eye coordination all over again
because you're your brain if you've been
playing first-person shooters long
enough your brain your hand your mouth
they're all in tune and you know you
only have to move the mouse two inches
three inches whatever to go in any
particular part of the screen our human
brains are friggin awesome we can
calculate in just microseconds how far
we have to move our hand to move a
little cursor on a screen to hit a
certain pixel you start adding all this
extra real estate your brain doesn't
know what to do see start aiming all
the place okay you start to adjust to
that but what happens is your reaction
time is still crap because you're no
longer scanning a sixteen by nine area
of pixels that's focused right in front
of you so you're kind of tunnel visually
visioning term tunnel visual I'm guys I
promise I haven't been drinking much I
didn't have a liquid lunch so your brain
is used to focusing on this one panel
and getting everything kind of
calculated now your brain is having to
deal with movement in the peripheral and
so it sees movement your brain wants to
look what is that what is that what is
that what you're looking all over the
place and if you're on the ground
shooting like this guy behind me here
that can really really screw with you if
you're in a vehicle it's kind of nice
because in jets and in tanks and all
that you've got a wide field of view and
let's face it the game narrows your view
down so when you go external view and
you can see everywhere around you it's
kind of fun but if you're the kind of
gamer likes to be on the ground this is
only going to hurt your reaction time my
gamer score in battlefield 4 went from
260 s all the way down to 150 and that
I'm attributing it to the panels and the
nd surround 100% this is a wow factor
this is eye candy it is not competitive
and if you take shooter seriously you
need to skip and beasts around you need
to skip three panels and you need to go
with like a 1440p or 1600 P if you want
ultra-high resolution or you just want
the the best-looking panel that you can
skip three panels please I just did you
a favor
take that money and divert it into a
singular like 27-inch 1440p of NQ
something like that forget this behind
me but if you're a simulator gamer
oh ho baby it's a whole different ball
of wax simulators highly benefit from
that wide viewing angle when I'm doing
eye racing and I can see out my left
window and I can see out cross my hood
and I can see everything happening in
front of me as well as a massively wide
field of view it is invaluable when it
comes to racing and I've got friends who
have been telling me I can wait to get
multiple panels because that's where it
benefits now if your flight simulator
it's the same exact thing you pretty
much are seeing four super wide viewing
angles more like real life I mean we
have peripherals we can use those
peripherals and in race
games and simulator games Nathan game
Jimmy I am really slurring my words
today jeez
in racing games and simulator games it's
okay to use your peripheral and just
kind of scan motion by that having to
move your eyes like a shooter game it's
actually more realistic that way now the
other type of gamer MMO gamers uh yeah I
guess you could sort of benefit from it
like dab low three and I really - mm oh
but dab low three World of Warcraft or
whatever quest I guess to have a quest
next or whatever it's called you got EVE
Online and all that kind of stuff if you
the other panels are nice but most of
all you're looking at is terrain there's
nothing happening over there because the
game is designed to pretty much be
happening in the center of your viewing
range so eh that's kind of what I feel
about it I mean it's really up to you I
can't say it would or wouldn't benefit
you I mean it could be nice if you're if
you're looking for that one mob or
you're looking for that NPC and you
can't find them instead how to look
around that one little panel if you can
see way wide like Diablo 3 it really
comes in handy looking for loot and
treasure and things like that and
enemies it really comes in handy
especially in World of Warcraft if you
zoom out real far you have like a
massive viewing range so but it also
depends on the optimization of the games
as well not all games are optimized for
envy surround or Eyefinity it's up to
the developer of graphics card to get
those drivers running off to eyes for
that some games are not Battlefield
franchise I don't feel at optimized for
it whatsoever you've got to get rid of
that stretching you can see it right
here on this to the left of me let's
watch as this guy turns look right here
where my hand is don't focus over here
focus right here do you see how right
there it's all stretched you're really
only rendering to about right here and
then it stretches so as you're running
you'll see things look like they're
coming in slow and then the moosh they
wish by you that really screws with you
I racing I don't think I could ever race
on a single panel now the last thing to
discuss here is SLI configs yes if
you're going to be running multiple
panels like this SLI crossfire it is
pretty much going to be required even a
Titan black edition or regular Titan
yeah they have high amounts of VRAM but
they're not going to have enough
processing power and the GPU to render
out all three screens and still have
acceptable frame rates now the cool
thing is on battlefield 4 with 2g
780 s which now you can find used for
$400 apiece obviously talking $800 in
graphics cards I'm getting over 120 to
130 frames per second in battlefield 4
in ultra settings with msaa on but I am
capping out my vram the three gigabyte
vram cards I am capping them out but I'm
not getting any ill effects I'm not
getting any crashing any blue screens
but that's all just a myth that crap
doesn't really happen when you cap out
your vram it just when it cut about your
vram you don't get any additional frames
beyond that and you'll get any horrible
frame latency my frame timing is when I
monitor frame timing is pretty
consistent so that's all just myth maybe
we'll handle that in another video so
here are my final recommendations maybe
you skip forward to this part in your
hoping j-just give it to us flat out we
don't care about all the background
stuff just tell us what to do PC guru no
I'm just kidding I don't I really don't
know anything about computers if you're
an FPS gamer ditch the other two panels
get yourself a really good 1080p or
1440p panel skip 1200 P that's not a
standard 16 by 9 ratio anyway 1080p
1440p 1600 P I still recommend two cards
if you are a simulator driver racer fly
or whatever
ba-baby three panels you got to go with
three panels I'm telling you it is such
an immersive environment in fact maybe
you could have three panels like mister
barnacle YZ 346 inch screens and you
feel like the game is just flying right
out at you that'd be kind of cool if you
were an MMO gamer it's really up to you
it's not going to be beneficial for you
ultimately in the long run but then
again games like World of Warcraft
they're not very visually enhanced or
very very intensive anyway so it's
probably not gonna be too much of a
problem now guys I don't regret doing
this like I said I even thought about
putting my third 780 in there but I'm
going to leave it with two and three
panels and no I don't plan on going to
1440 PE or 1600 or 4k any time soon
whatsoever it'll be at loose at least
two more generations before I even
consider a 4k panel so I hope this
videos helped you guys knows a little
bit more discussion based not a whole
lot of tech information in here but
these are just my opinions
hopefully they'll help you make a
decision on what you should do with your
rigs now I sincerely want to thank you
