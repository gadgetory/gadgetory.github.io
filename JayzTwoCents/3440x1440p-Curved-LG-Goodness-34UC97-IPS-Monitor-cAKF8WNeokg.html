and we're back with another tech video
just like I promised in the last bike
video thing that we just did and the J
always pays his debts sorry I've been
watching a lot of Game of Thrones lately
it's really getting addictive I just
started watching it may God have mercy
on my soul because I think it belongs to
HBO now the new EVGA silent series power
supplies offer excellent silence and
efficiency through their new EVGA Eco
mode technology and also features a
seven year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more so a few weeks back I was
lucky enough to take a look at LG's new
34 um 67 vsync freesync kitchen sink
whatever sink monitor and I was a little
bit underwhelmed I mean free sink is
kind of cool and all but personally just
my personal opinion I don't really care
about all the new vsync g-sync freesync
technology going into everything I
personally just don't really care all
that much personally for me not all that
pleasing to look at especially since I
look at a 1440p panel as my main panel
every single day so going back to
something with you know 1080p pixel
density was just not pleasing on the
eyes so when LG saw that video they
reached out to me and said hey how would
you like take a look at our 34 you see
97 21 by 9 ultra wide curved panel and I
was like well heck yeah sign me up
because if you're not aware of this
panel behind me is a 34 40 by 1440 P so
basically it's 1440p pixel density in a
34 inch ultra wide curved panel now I
saw this thing at CES and it's been a
whole lot of attention to it because
really I didn't think it's something I
would be taking a look at so soon but of
course when LG reached out to me I owed
it to of course the audience and myself
to get up close personal a little bit
intimate with this monitor now it is an
IPS panel so as a content creator that's
something that game that really
interested me because none of the panels
that I have in this office are IPS so
I'm always kind of
as to the color correction and quite
often I guess incorrectly so either I
look yellow or green or orange or blue
or purple or something because I just
don't have anything that's color
accurate and this thing has an sRGB
rating of over 99% so that means that
the color accuracy on this thing
especially when calibrated is going to
be damn near lifelike now the stand on
this thing is actually very elegant in
fact it is all metal
it is nickel-plated very shiny very very
well built it doesn't slide around the
desk because it has rubber feet
unfortunately it lacks any sort of
height adjustment whatsoever so you are
stuck on the height and as you can see
it almost didn't fit underneath my
little GPU shelf right there so you're
gonna have to keep that in mind if
you're searching for or interested in
buying this monitor there is no height
adjustment there is only tilt adjustment
and even then it doesn't tilt down
really much past vertical it tilts
mostly up so you're definitely gonna
want to keep that in mind now when it
comes to vase amount the first thing I
did was I looked on the back of the
panel to see if it has vase amount
because I like to VESA mount all of my
panels and I was a little disappointed
to see that it did not have the amount
built in however they did actually
include some where I'll find it to give
me a second they did actually include
this plate right here which simply
mounts on to the same little swiveling
bracket that's on the back of the panel
and then you have four screws here that
would mount to a vase a mouse so this is
going to retain all of its up-and-down
adjustment built on to the monitor as
well as being able to screw into a vase
amount now it's not nearly as elegant as
the panel or the back kind of a gold
color looks itself but then again most
of the time you don't really look at the
back of the panel anyway speaking of the
back of the panel and isn't once again
all medals so the monitor itself is very
hefty it even has a nice plastic cover
to cover all of the i/o that's on the
back of the monitor and speaking of i/o
I was actually kind of surprised to see
that there is no DVI support in fact
there is DisplayPort to HDMI ports two
USB 3.0 and two Thunderbolt 2 ports on
the back so and actually has an audio
jack as well the audio built into the
monitor
is lackluster it's not even really worth
mentioning I couldn't even demo it for
you and give you an accurate
representation of what it sounds like so
as with most built-ins monitor speakers
they produce sound but probably not the
sound you're looking for the cool thing
about the HDMI ports on this panel is
the fact that you could actually split
this panel in two and have two perfectly
square 1x1 panels with each HDMI
treating each half of the screen as two
separate monitors not entirely sure why
you would want to do that but I guess
technically can maybe if you want to
have two different systems hooked up to
it at the same time I don't know but
that flexibility is there now the
Thunderbolt 2 is going to be more
appealing towards content creators that
are working on a Mac platform because
most PC enthusiasts or PC content
creators are not really utilizing
Thunderbolt that's really become more of
a Mac thing but has Thunderbolt on this
so you could use it as an axillary
display for your Mac Pros or your Mac
books or whatever else you're using
that's Mac Apple Mac Mac Apple now when
it comes to gaming because that's what
most of the people watching my channel
are going to care about the 34 UC 97 is
a 5 millisecond panel which is not as
fast as a lot of gaming panels which
advertises low as 1 millisecond grade of
gray however 5 milliseconds to me is
kind of still very very acceptable in
fact anything under 14 milliseconds is
typically considered lagless when it
comes to input in fact there is no
perceived input lag whatsoever when I
move the mouse around it feels very very
responsive even though it's a 60 Hertz
panel and I am used to 144 Hertz panels
it doesn't feel like there's any sort of
input lag on there now games I'm happy
to say are really starting to utilize
this 21 by nine format where you're not
getting the black bars on the side
interestingly enough though in games
like GTA 5 the black bars are there in a
lot of the cutscenes even though the
game is rendered out and the cutscene is
basically being rendered in the game
engine and game environment itself you
can actually see the parts that are
blacked out as the bars kind of stretch
out to fill it so I kind of find it
interesting that the engine is putting
black bars there when something's being
rendered
there anyway so it's a little bit
annoying and I guess it adds a little
bit of cinematic effect where you use to
get black bars on the top and bottom now
we're just getting them on the side but
whatever I digress gameplay on the sides
of the 21 by 9 don't feel stretched out
and that could help or have a little bit
to do with the fact that the subtle
curve on the display is giving you very
nice viewing angles in fact it's keeping
your view between right side and left
side of the monitor fairly uniform where
the distance from your eyes to that part
of the panel is not going to really be
affected when we sit close to monitors
on our desks you can have quite a bit of
distance change between the center of
the panel and the edges of the panel
because as you turn your head that
distance gets farther away so the idea
of the curved panel is to eliminate a
lot of that distance change when it
comes to looking at the screen and since
we sit so close to the panel we don't
really need that much of a curve
otherwise it would start to look a
little bit distorted now I find myself
becoming more and more of a fan of the
21 by nine format when it first came out
I kind of wondered if it was gonna be
more of a gimmick is that something
people were gonna adopt and you do find
a lot more people especially gamers are
starting to adopt this because it's a
good alternative to Eyefinity and
surround the most annoying thing with
dealing with multiple monitor setups is
of course the bezels but the panel like
this actually allows you to deal with a
wider viewing angle a wider screen real
estate without having to deal with
bezels or even the driver Finnick enos
that is found in invidious around and
AMD's Eyefinity maybe even in the future
will find even wider panels where
they're getting you know maybe the width
of two sixteen by nine panels you never
know I mean when this first came out I
thought it was a little bit gimmicky but
it really does seem like twenty-one by
nine is here to stay and a lot of people
are adopting it in fact it probably
isn't gonna be long before we start
seeing 4k variants of 21 by 9 but then
of course graphics cards are gonna be
getting hit really hard
in fact this 34 40 by 1440 really does
push my 980 classified to the limits
when it comes to gaming so the pixel
density is there and the color accuracy
of course is what really makes this
really worth its weight in gold almost
literally considering the rear of the
thing looks like gold it's kind of in
terms of color it kind of looks a lot
like the gold iPhone from Apple it's
really kind of almost a pewter e gold
color so the panel itself is built very
very sturdy I would like to see height
adjustment on the thing but the pixel
density is fantastic the uniformity of
the color and even in light bleed in the
corners are really not too bad there's
some but not a lot
color shift isn't there of course
because it's IPS and it's combat a
little bit by the fact that we have a
curved panel and gaming on this thing
even though it's a 60 Hertz panel and
I'm personally and subjectively leaning
more towards 144 Hertz panels being my
sort of thing could game on this and
have absolutely no problems doing so so
if you guys are looking for a panel
that's got good refresh rate of course
excellent excellent colors and is going
to give you a long-term solution for
productivity gaming color accuracy and
just looks fantastic then you really
shouldn't look any farther than the LG
34 you see 97 I don't think this is
where it's gonna stop though I think
they're gonna start finding more and
more ways maybe in refresh rates in
response times to get better performance
and lower response time under 5
milliseconds and higher than 60fps when
it comes to refresh rate of the monitor
itself that's what I would like to see
so what do you guys think about this
what you guys think about the curve
display
I know curved phones curved TVs and
curved displays have really kind of been
a thing lately and I don't know the
curved is nice but I don't think that's
really a deal breaker for me personally
tell me what you guys think down in the
comments or better yet head on over to
Twitter at J's 2 cents or the forums
over at Jesu sense comm and tell me what
you guys think as always these videos
are not possible without you guys so I
just wonder once again extend a huge
thank you to watching this channel
watching these videos and we'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
