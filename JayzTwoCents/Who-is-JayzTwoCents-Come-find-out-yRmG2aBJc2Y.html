cents youtube channel come at you semi
live on the internet here I want to
welcome you to my new channel
formerly J's VFX now J is 2 cents and
the reason for the change is I
discovered I have so much more that I
can actually offer the YouTube community
when it comes to my technology knowledge
my personal career in my life path and
the things I know are so much greater
than video effects I know
laptops cell phones computers tablets
building computers custom water cooling
gaming both console and PC pretty much
done at all in my 31 years so I wanted
to make a change I wanted to kind of
reclassify myself in the community here
as somebody who you can come to to get
advice technology opinions and just
general reviews when it comes to
anything digital
whether that be cameras or games or
consoles cars doesn't matter bring it to
me I can give you everything you want to
know about it and if I don't know I will
find out and I will give you an unbiased
opinion some would actually say that I
have a little bit of a technology
addiction I don't know what they're
talking about
I personally I don't think that I have a
technology problem
my therapist actually says I'm getting
better I'm getting much better at it but
anyway besides that a little bit about
me most of you probably don't know who I
am but based on the community I hope you
get to know me I am 31 years old I am a
full-time father I am a full-time IT
engineer and I spend my spare time where
I can gaming first and foremost priority
is my wife and daughter and my family
but you've got to learn to let loose
you've got to have some fun you've got
to be able to go out there and just do
what it is you love to do from day to
day because if you don't you don't have
that outlet you're going to find that
life is actually quite disturbing that
is a tangent that is a rant that is not
the point of this video I had been
gaming on PC since I was three started
on a Commodore 64 we're talking 1984
here 1984 how many of you were not alive
in 1984 I'm venturing to guess quite a
few of you were not alive I liked PC
gaming so when it comes to PC gaming you
will discover that there are two sides
of the fence and there's always two
sides of the fence right console gaming
you got Xbox you got PlayStation you
know cars you got Ford you got Chevy
right you got Toyota Toyota you got
Nissan there's always going to be the
same genre yet a rift and a rival when
it comes to basically that particular
you know technology it is you're talking
about me personally my rig most people
are just disgusted with the fact that I
went with AMD but then when they see my
rig actually perform they're just in
shock they're in awe they have no idea
that AMD can actually perform the way
that mine does
sure Intel does generally blow it out of
the water when it comes to a lot of head
to head equal components comparisons but
I think the bottom line here is being
the underdog when it comes to AMD and
just making people go oh my god how did
you do that that's the best part so I am
personally running a MD 8 core 8120 you
can find all the details down in the
information below I will link
information about my computer as well as
the build when it comes to PC gaming the
kind of games I like to play are usually
first and foremost first-person shooters
first-person shooter I started on was
actually
a Wolfenstein 3d back in 1991 I believe
it was I was very young it was very gory
very graphic for its age and for its day
my mother was actually not too keen on
the fact that I was playing such a
violent game but I mean I've made it
into my 30s now and I've not gone into
you know any crowded areas it started
shooting people so I think we're good
there so without further ado maybe will
do from here is we'll just go ahead and
cut over to some gaming scenes some of
my battlefield 3 footage don't forget
you can watch us live stream tonight I
do regular live streams usually on
Sunday nights with holiday doc from the
Call of Duty MLG making a comeback wait
for that go to his channel make sure you
watch it I will have a link in this
video to his channel go and subscribe I
expect you to subscribe it's probably a
little depending I'm sorry I did I
didn't mean to be so pushy I'm gonna go
ahead and cut on over here to some
battlefield 3 footage and I hope you
stick around for that well here we are
looks like we're playing
caspian border now in this game I went
ahead decided to jump into a jet I don't
normally hop in Jets but you know it's
the way you can get better at it so I
decided to follow my wingman here and
attack whatever he attacks but
unfortunately for whatever reason he
just plowed straight into the ground so
with that I went ahead turn back towards
my base trying to regroup see what's
going on out here in the map see where I
can go and lend a hand I spot a tank
right over here trying to cap
b-but if you walk it's into him and I
got hit with a canister right off the
bat which put me down to 56% at this
point now I'm being plugged of being
pinged little did I know I believe I
actually had a level 100 pilot on my
tail as you can see right there I eat it
I did jet crashes right into my own base
at a level 100 pilot takes me out so at
this point I'm contemplating what to do
next I'm not entirely sure what I want
to do I went ahead and said oh I see the
Vipers over here I'm a much more
experienced Viper pilot so I decided to
go ahead and run on over there say we
can do with the Viper I was actually a
little surprised that I was able to run
so far and still get a hold of the
helicopter all on my own
usually the helicopter is a prying piece
of equipment it's hard to get as you can
see right here we have two enemy jets
flying in wingman formation here at that
point I didn't know what to expect
entirely I have a note gunner and taking
on air-to-air as a chopper pilot it's
actually not entirely too difficult as
you can see at this point I got a squad
spot on me so I know my gunner he shoot
enough ground targets on the right I'm
continuing my pursuit of the broken off
wingman here I see that I have a
friendly f-18 that is taking pursuit to
my entire mission at this point to see
if I can't force some flares out of him
lend a little bit of a hand on my
teammate if I can force them to pop
flares and we got much more of a chance
of actually taking him down as you can
see there I also fired one rocket force
two flare fired the second rocket and
found its target as you can see
unfortunately there was no disabled so
right here I'm actually able to keep a
lock on him which is keeping the
pressure up on this jet he's making a
run for back to his base doing a little
vase of wind over here to get a load the
AAA was actually taken four shots at me
and the helicopters quite easy to take
down with anti-aircraft however I'm all
the way across the map so I'm not in too
much danger here my gunner doesn't seem
to know exactly what's going on at this
point can he logged on to EC I mean Oh a
cm didn't had no effect dodged that
rocket however I'm getting locked on
once again not Toyota Shores locked onto
me taking evasive maneuvers here trying
to get low trying to dodge this rocket
it finds its mark I dodged that rock I
put her down she got her bails out pop
out since I am an engineer I'm gonna
repair this helicopter we're gonna get
the sucker back near as soon as we can I
don't expect my gutter - to come back I
think he thought we were done for little
Tino we survived and we're putting this
sucker right back up in the air right
back into the action
unfortunately I was kicked from this
server i right at this moment since
there was a reserved slot and a reserved
person was joining so I found myself
another server got right back into the
helicopter immediately located my next
target and off we went
see an enemy shoot out ahead at this
point since I have no gunner all I can
do is once again force flares on this
jet hope he comes into range try and get
a quick luck on this guy set off some
missiles realizing that he's down now I
switch over to this bogey here flying
straight at us chasing my f-18 butt off
two missiles he flares but they still
make contact with him forcing him to
break off he turns around fly straight
back towards base my way man turns
continuous pursuit at this point I start
searching for ground targets
I see tracers coming from the a a over
here I'm gonna put a couple of rockets
into him they find their target
fortunately now I'm aiming low he's
locked on to me he shoot me with his
Gatling gun I'm getting low at a range
and I am making my way back to base Y
heading back to base here I have nothing
really in my mind other than to get out
of firing range
stay low something say to me I have no
idea where it's coming from looking at
the radar I see I've got a jet behind me
he's flying away
considering the fact there's nothing on
the radar but I'm still being hit the
low trajectory of the tracer rounds I'm
assuming it's a a on the opposite hill
so attacking me looks like we got a
bogey and a friend me right here engaged
in a dogfight I'm gonna try and lend a
hand see if I can't force a flare again
maybe get lucky and actually get a hit
on this OMB locked on ECM got the kill
both rockets find their target
and that folks is how you take out a jet
with the Viper starting the celebration
a little too soon I'm locked on ACMs
they're not taking effect I switched to
the garcy put out a flare
I get collided into by a jet we're going
down I'm going down we gotta set her
down people can't repair this stay low
stay out of range
oh the slid away from me slid away it's
gonna explode I think I got about one
percent right here as I start my repair
tool and we bring her back alive that
was close ladies and gentlemen it does
not get any closer than that when it
comes to being shut down Landing and
repairing back to 100% we're gonna hop
on over here get in the cockpit take
back off find our target get a little
revenge see if we can't get some nemesis
points here looking at my radar I see I
got both Jets on my left looks to be
like they're a little bit higher than me
gotta be careful at this point as I'm
vulnerable here we go locking on forcing
some flares turning around going over
here helping my friend Lee seeing this
su turning back towards me going head-on
see if I can't get some Rockets off
before the flares he flared they still
find their target walking back on at
this point he's panicking he's trying to
have to burn her away he realizes he has
no flares I got two rockets being locked
AC I mean breaking the lock turning away
getting out of combat resetting getting
my bearings wishing I had a gunner
through all of this
getting low and that's the way you stay
alive in a viper you have to know when
to disengage when to a gauge when it's
smart to attack to know your location at
all times
Kenny locked on to once again looks like
it's the enemy helicopter straight ahead
he's just hovering there he's vulnerable
he's turning away he's not engaging got
a momentary lock right there locked on
to missiles away he CMD seems too late
they make contact he is trying to run
away from me right here having a hard
time locking under to the ECM jammer
right there being shot by a jet put it
in his face block block two missiles
away chopper is down choppers down
that's how you get up close and personal
right there with a havoc just put it
right in the face
and locked on to once again this point
I'm not entirely sure who it is that
could be the a on the other side of the
map don't really care ECM jamming
breaking the lock it's flaring broke the
missiles locked on again use my
secondary missile shoot out of this is
going to make contact oh he puts it in
the ground before the missile action it
makes contact either way it's a kill
you're dead I'm alive we're happy and
that is probably one of the most fun
chop arounds I've actually played in a
long time by myself no gunner no
teamwork quick switching to the gunner
seat popping out flares popping out ECM
is taken out Jets and that my friends is
