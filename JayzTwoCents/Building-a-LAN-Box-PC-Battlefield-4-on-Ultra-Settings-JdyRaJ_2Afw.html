they don't hit the red right to stay in
the yellow up up up okay yeah that's
right it's getting hot here all these
parts
sup guys you're watching J is 2 cents
and we're gonna bring you the video that
I know you've been waiting for
cuz I've been hyping it all month long
and I'm building a second PC and this is
kind of a milestone for me personally in
my life because you may find this hard
to believe I have never personally owned
two towers at the same time never
I have always replaced the tower with
the tower so this is really exciting and
really fun to me really fun to me
whatever that means I'm really gonna
fund me
okay so there's a couple of things we
need to talk about here one I apologize
for the audio quality I'm using the dead
cat thing over there to capture the
audio without wearing my little clip on
and we are going to be doing this video
a little bit differently than normal
we're not going to be doing a build log
how to build a computer I've already
done that a couple of those if you want
to see those I'll annotate them here
somewhere and you can go and check those
out we're instead going to talk about
the parts we're using why we're using
the parts and then we're gonna do a
little montage of the build and then
we're going to talk about overall
thoughts after it's complete so let's
talk about the parts one thing I want to
point out it's most of these parts were
provided for review so there are some
parts on here that you guys may be like
well why did you go with this and why
did you go with that well for the most
part I didn't have a whole lot of a
choice but the parts that we've got
together here are pretty well compatible
with each other and are gonna do a
fantastic job of what I need this
computer to do and that being it needs
to be a test bench it needs to be
portable I want to double as a land box
that way I can take it with me to gaming
events and stuff without having to break
my back and hire a crane to move the 900
d and I want it to be customizable in
the sense that we can fit different
components in there without issues as
we're using it as a test bench also so
here is what we are using this stuff
okay we're gonna go ahead and get into
the note seriously for the processor I
am using and I chose this one on my own
the Haswell 4670 1150 socket CPU I'm not
gonna be using this video this machine
as a rendering machine for video editing
at the most the worst task it would have
put on it is a stream machine which yes
is rendering but without any other tasks
being done on the computer at that time
if it's streaming for me picking up what
I'm doing on my gaming machine
it's very there's more than enough power
in this quad core to handle that and to
keep that cool we are going with the
glacier 240 L from Coolermaster we did a
review on that I'm not sure I think this
video is going to go up before those
reviews so make sure you check out those
reviews individually as they go up and
again we are going to be putting
everything in a cooler master half XB
evo this is the upgraded version of the
Evo gives you a couple more hard drive 3
1/2 inch hard drive slots they have
hot-swap on there that has a removable
hard drive cage give any more room
internally comes with upgraded fans over
the Evo really good case very flexible
and that's what was important and we're
gonna be putting some jet flow 120 s in
that Evo of course we are going to be
using the ax 753 Corsair that's a
recycled heart power supply I had in my
gaming rig I took it out we're gonna put
it in here and we are using 2 MSI gaming
components we are using the r9 270 which
I've already done the review on very
very powerful card for under 200 bucks
was able to play battlefield 4 on ultra
and had an average frames per second of
50 frames per second which is really
awesome so the heads an amazing card for
less than 200 bucks it couldn't
recommend it more if you're on a budget
and then we're going to be using the
unreleased z87 em micro ATX 1150 socket
motherboard this motherboard is not on
the market yet well we'll take a little
bit of a look at that in this build I'll
talk more about this motherboard
probably in another video as I get a
little more familiar with it but it's
got all the features you come to expect
it's got a high-end NIC card built into
it high-end sound card built into it
program we are using the xpg from a data
1600 megahertz 999 twenty four times we
did a review on that for a mouse we're
using my G 700 s this is my wireless
gaming mouse I purchased that we have my
crucial m4 SSD as the main drive we have
two Barracuda Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm
drives here that we're going to be
putting in raid four into some raid
testing and some raid videos how to raid
how many guys have been asking and
that's not a warcraft raid or a raid
boss this is raid for hard drives and
then we are going to be clicking and
clacking with the Sam storm quick fire
stealth mechanical keyboard so without
further ado let's go ahead and jump in
here let's put this thing together and
let's see how we like it and we'll talk
more about that at the end of the video
so don't go anywhere
you
so there you have it guys Jase two cents
can build a battlefield 4 on ultra
preset computer in about two and a half
minutes thanks for watching I'm your
host JC to say I'm just kidding
it's going to talk about these parts and
see how much they cost and what the
performance is like all together these
parts came to about twelve hundred and
fifty bucks and there are some corners
that you could cut on that if you need
to keep the budget down closer to eleven
hundred bucks or maybe even closer to a
thousand that baffle before right now is
running on my mechanical drive not my
SSD so if you really need to cut some
corners you could omit the SSD I
wouldn't really recommend it but you
could also go with the air cooler
instead of the glacier 240 L which I
have on here right now I wouldn't really
recommend cutting that corner though
because the glacier 240 L on here is an
absolutely amazing water cooler it's an
expandable water cooler as I mentioned
and it is just it gives you full custom
loop performance but it's already
packaged together that you can expand on
later if you need to I mean right now
this thing was running in the mid-60s on
the course the 46 70 K while overclock
to 4.5 that is amazing I mean I can't
even say enough about it the MSI is the
87 M gaming motherboard it's a micro ATX
board overclocking on it was really easy
the the BIOS is awesome the features of
the board look awesome it just
aesthetically it looks great and they
matched up with the MSI gaming r9 270
card we've already done the review on
that fantastic combo they look really
good together
and this r9 we've already done the
review on it so this is no surprise but
we're sitting in this 65 frames per
second at the time of this this is in
spectator mode but still 65 frames per
second average an ultra preset
who can ask for more on that I mean
seriously that is amazing performance
for a hundred and $79 graphics card
again at the time of filming you don't
need to break the bank by spending 500
bucks on a graphics card to get good
1080p performance I mean it's just not
necessary and the Aviator ram 1600
megahertz out of the box with 999
twenty-four timings XMP profile and
bumped it up to 1866 megahertz
overclocked no problems whatsoever
didn't even break a sweat
all these parts came to about 1,250
bucks you can easily get it down Warlow
- a thousand - $1,100 if he just scaled
it back on a couple of the components I
wouldn't scale back the graphics card
though this is absolutely perfect right
where it's at
lastly I want to say that the half xbe
bow was just a great case to build in it
doubles as a land box and a test bench
so it has dual purpose for me I've I've
needed a portable computer but one that
also I can do all my testing in four
parts as they're sent to me and that's
exactly what that's doing right there
behind me you have a removable
motherboard tray make giving you nice
easy access to the bottom part of the
case if you need it giving you a easy
place to take the mobile tray out put a
yo heatsink tower on there and mount it
right back in the tray with four thumb
screws the cooling on is amazing three
sides come off or top and both sides
come off giving you nice you know
surround access to every aspect of the
board and the end the case couldn't ask
for an easier build which is important
for a guy like me who builds in all
kinds of different cases sometimes some
of these cases are just a pain in the
ass to build in not the half XP debo
great case guys huge shout out to the
vendors who supplied parts for this case
MSI a data cooler master you guys really
came through for me and I definitely
appreciate that so guys this has been
Jays two cents if you're interested in
the parts that were used or checking
them out for yourself I'm going to put a
link to them down into the description
and you can go and check out those parts
because prices are always changing so
they may have gone down by the time you
get around to watching this video I'm
making it on out of here I'm gonna start
filming some more reviews we got lots to
cover this holiday season and as always
if you've enjoyed this video you know
what to do follow me on Twitter because
that's the best place to get a hold of
me if you need advice or a tech question
when it comes to your computer and I
want to see you guys in my next video
one sem yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
