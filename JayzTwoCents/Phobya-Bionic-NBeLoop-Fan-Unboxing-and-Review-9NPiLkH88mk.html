today we're gonna take a look at the
brand spanking new NB a-- loop 1600 RPM
ultra quiet fan from phobia this thing
was designed in conjunction with noise
blocker so we're gonna see just how this
thing performs on our water cooling
setup
okay so the fan comes in this nice
packaging here it's actually pretty
decent packaging some fans come in
horrible packaging inside the box here
you have and one of the things I
absolutely love about phobia and I just
want to point that out right now is they
sleeve everything everything that comes
electronic from them there are fan
controllers that obviously their fans
have really really good sleeping on them
I mean it
they don't scrimp in that area as you
can see right here we are using the
black and red model because we have kind
of an ROG theme going with this water
cooling build that we're working on and
the fins are actually transparent just
like the noise blocker fans if you've
ever looked at noise blocker if you're
not familiar with noise blocker they're
a very good fan company teamed up with
phobia to bring you just one of the best
fans that they could possibly build you
get a pretty generous length of wire
here for the fan I wouldn't say it's
incredibly long but I also say it
wouldn't it's not as short as the
Corsair fans where they only give you
like that much fan cable which you can't
do anything with but what's really
interesting about this fan design is if
you come in here and look closely you'll
see that not only do you have these
blades but on the side of the blade
they're all connected with a ring
typical fans each blade is independent
of each other and what happens with that
is the fan the the air wants to take the
most least resistance path of travel
which means sometimes you're gonna lose
some of the air out the side of the fan
between the fan blade and the shroud
here so you're gonna have air escaping
out the sides but what this ring around
here does is it literally scoops the air
in and it has nowhere to go except out
the backside of the fan so that means
you're gonna get maximum air pressure
static pressure and you're gonna get
maximum airflow as well from one fan
design and also too we have these little
ridges here on the back of the fan you
can see them they're kind of difficult
to see they're right here these ridges
are designed to kind of break up some of
the noise that comes with air flow so
it's not only going to channel the air
more straight for higher static pressure
operation but it also gives a much more
silent operation to the fan because it's
scooping all of that air very cleanly
rather than chopping the air which is
what a basic fan does these fans right
here are very cool I cannot wait to see
how these things perform they have an
entirely new bearing design - they call
it and I want to look this up for so
that I don't get this mess mess up here
bear with me guys half the boxes in
German and granted I do read some German
yeah okay so we'll just go through some
some specs here real quick before we put
these in this build and see what we've
got here we've got 1600 rpms
they require one watt to operate they
operate a starting voltage of 6 volts a
little bit higher than some fan some
fans start at 5 volt these guys are
gonna start at 6 volts they have a
maximum static pressure at 12 volts a
1560 mmm h2o I actually don't know what
that means I just know the higher the
static number the better but they claim
to be really good at static pressure
they have 104 m3h of airflow I don't
follow
airflow much but it does have 60 1.2 CFM
that is a lot of airflow and/or cubic
feet per minute is what CFM is that's
gotta be it is because of that ring
design I can't wait to see how these
sound because they're advertising only
22 and a half decibels at a hundred CF
100 cm sound pressure so 22 and a half
decibels we're gonna see if that's 22
and a half at 6 volts or 12 volts some
companies will only show you their sound
rating based on their lowest starting
voltage which is kind of unfair because
you put 12 volts to it and then it
sounds like a hairdryer and then you get
it and you're going well I thought I was
getting a quiet fan and now I've got
this a really loud hairdryer in my
computer and the bearing design which I
mentioned earlier they call it a bionic
rotor now because it because it's
patented I don't know how much
information you'll find about this
Bionic says bionic loop fan right here
on the bottom designed in Germany
as we all know the Germans make awesome
stuff I mean that by the way just to
show you how smooth these bearings are
most of the time if you spin a fan
you'll see as it slows down it kind of
does a whoop-whoop you know kind of a
little jerky motion as it goes over the
magnet check this out
this thing just goes and goes and goes
and as it slows down you can see right
there it it hit that magnet but look how
smooth that is I'm barely touching that
and it is just so smooth and what's
funny is normally if you spin a fan by
hand
sometimes you can't feel any of the
airflow like with the SP 120 fans from
Corsair great fans I use them in my
system but if you spin them by hand you
don't really feel any air but these
right here the airflow just from
spinning it by hand is absolutely
amazing if these things live up and if
fobia ever makes these in yellow I think
I might end up switching my fans so
let's go ahead and put the system
together and let's see exactly how these
things stack up okay we're back in the
Lupus together you would think we've
done this loop 500 times with all the
videos we've done on this particular
loop system but bear with us we just got
to get through this together
I promise I'll be over soon we've got
the fans in here the fobia NB 1600 rpm
super high static pressure I don't even
know
I personally not run a fan that has as
much static pressure as these fans right
here that we put into this client build
it's really difficult when doing a
review and fans to really relate to you
the noise or the the static pressure I
mean a lot of people know what static
pressure is that's the amount of force
it can push through resistance and then
you have air flow which is the amount of
volume of air that fan can move in a
non-restrictive environment and we're
doing water cooling which is one of the
things these fans are designed for is
very high static pressure you want to be
able to push the fans or the air through
the resistance of the radiator and in
this build right here we do have 45
millimeter thick alpha cool next to 60
45 radiators so with that a lot of
people ask we'll push pull like we
mentioned earlier in the video
when you have a fan like this and with
that really cool ring design that goes
around the outside of the fan that
forces the air through it and it has
nowhere else that can go off to the side
because it doesn't have that gap around
the blades and it's like one big blade
turning the amount of static pressure is
amazing I want to demonstrate something
for you right now because I feel this is
the way to really get across just how
powerful yet not excessively noisy these
fans are at 12 volts they are a little
bit noisy when you run them through a
radiator simply because it's the
radiator making the sound it's not the
fan you have the the air is bouncing
through all those fins so it's not a
very fair test to say that it's a noisy
fan 1600 RPMs is a is a fast spinning
fan but at the same time that's what
gives it a lot of its maximum static
pressure we are running at 12 volts here
right now in these fans I've got a piece
of paper here and the fans are up here
on the top of this NZXT switch a10
pulling the air through the radiator and
if I take this paper I can stick that to
the radiator right there I mean yeah
that's the case for probably most fans
but the the fact that this as you can
see will pull it I mean this it is from
this distance through a radiator it is
pulling the paper out of my hand
you see this I can't even get it in
there to show you with that it's sucking
it up and then the amount of air pushing
through the top even through this grille
as you can see we have a grill up here
that is the amount of airflow that we
are dealing with with these fans so if
you need yourself some really high
pressure static fans for water cooling
or you just want a nice strong fan for a
case the fobia fans definitely hit it
out of the park I mean they come in a
few different colors too they're in red
black blue they've got rubber grommets
on the corner that make it so that
they're a lot more silent they have some
noise dampening in there and I'm telling
you right now the amount of static
pressure that things that these put out
is absolutely amazing there is just no
other way to describe it so definitely a
winter product as far as I'm concerned
and I personally never
said that a product was like an
award-winning product on this channel I
don't do awards but I'm definitely gonna
say that these fans hit it right out of
the park so check out those pans guys
over on aqua tuning us thanks aqua
tuning for sending those fans over for
me to do a review on and as always if
you've liked what you seen you know what
you do you hit the button you hit those
buttons you stick around and the social
media information is down in the
description tweet your questions to me
if you have any tech questions computer
questions be more than happy to
communicate with you guys and help you
out on those technology fronts guys I'm
gonna get on out of here I'm exhausted
it's been a lot of videos a very busy
week thanks for watching thanks for
being a subscriber and as always I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
