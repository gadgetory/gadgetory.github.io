it's that time I have spent the last 21
or 22 hours not straight I did it a
little bit of a break in between
benchmarking all these cards you see on
the table because r-tx is here the
embargo is finally lifting and now we
can see firsthand why the secrecy
regarding the reviews and why none of it
was mentioned and what is taking so long
for nvidia to even acknowledge the whole
gaming and performance when it comes to
rasterization so we've got your answers
guys don't go anywhere but first we
gotta pay some bills msi brings ultra
thin gaming to life at their new GS 65
stealth the four point nine millimeter
bezel 144 hertz 1080p panel nvidia
graphics and 8th gen intel cpus make the
new GS 65 self a true powerhouse with a
small footprint find out more and how to
preorder by following the link in the
description below ok so here we go
review time guys i'm it's been a while
since I've done a GPU review actually I
feel a little rusty at this is what
we're gonna do we are not going to take
a deep dive into the architecture and
check out my friends over at gamers
Nexus PC / PC world these guys do
excellent architecture discussion you
can learn way more than you've ever
learned from me on that so we're gonna
talk about what I think most people
watching me are gonna care about which
is just the raw performance on Pascal
vs. touring and that's what we are gonna
try and take a look at today I'm not
going to get right to the slides but I
wanna talk to you guys about a couple
things with the slides real quick one I
tested a very consistent sampling of
stuff I did with Pascal so you're not
gonna see a lot of new titles on there
you're not gonna see battlefield 5
because that was in beta and the drivers
weren't here yet for that you know I can
see battlefield 1 you're gonna see
battlefront 2 or or any of that stuff
because of the fact that I wanted to
test different engines so don't worry so
much about the title that we used and
the FPS that you're seeing worry more
about the difference in performance
between each card look at those
differences that's where your attention
should be settings are gonna vary
between different media outlets and
different reviewers some people are
going to test on high I tested
everything on the highest settings
that's I like to give you guys the worst
case scenario these are the lowest FPS
you could probably expect as you
back your settings that will go up so
there's that but we tested synthetics
and then off obviously built-in
benchmarks and a few different titles
and the newest one being shadow of the
Tomb Raider so with that here are the
slides and we've got a lot to talk about
okay here we are we are in doom and you
know why I'm testing doom because Nvidia
said that they have really invested a
lot of of time and effort
okay here we are in doom and I'm gonna
be maxing out these settings with
nightmare mode and all that stuff
because specifically Vulcan and that's
the reason why I'm doing this test is
NVIDIA has always sort of lagged behind
AMD in its bulking optimization and the
open source API but NVIDIA has said they
have done amazing things with Vulcan in
fact Vulcan is what they're using for
RTX so I want to see how they're doing
in Doom now as you can see we've got
everything maxed out we're using SMA ace
of temporal AAA or FX a or SMAW or two
saw for just using SMA a so let's just
get right into the game FPS is up here
I'll call it out I know it's kind of
hard to see we are also running 4k so
let's see we got here so I'm right now
seeing a hundred and thirty FPS in 4k
with all settings maxed now this is a
note in the nanana nanan so we are
sitting in the 90s the hundreds it
fluctuates a little bit obviously
depends on what's happening on the scene
but considering this is the sixty Hertz
panel it's obviously not having any
problem running it so Phil says he saw
the FPS drop down as low as 70 but I
then because I'm on a 60 Hertz panel
clearly I don't feel that only
vulnerability so I mean that's worth
talking about I mean unless you have
like 120 Hertz for K panel which does
exist now I don't notice any of the FPS
stiffening on my score dipped obviously
versus my best what but whatever so that
was perfectly playable that was actually
pretty amazing okay so you guys saw that
undo then the 4k performance in
nightmare mode was pretty insane no
obviously the volca Vulkan API is
amazing which is why they're using it
for ray tracing but unfortunately we
couldn't test any of that today because
guess what no titles today with the
exception of a very limited demo of
Final Fantasy that was sent by Nvidia
which we didn't test by the way cuz I
refused to use something not available
to the public to do my testing because I
want you guys to be able to load up your
game and compare it to what you just saw
right now and I want you have to wait
until something becomes available rate
racing isn't available neither is the
LSS 2 things these cards are
boasted about and it had an entire
two-hour keynote about with no gaming
performance metrics mentioned whatsoever
is something we can't even test at the
moment the cards became available so
there is that but let's talk about
acoustics and cooling and then we will
move on to my final thoughts so the
reason why I have the EVGA card sitting
right here is this is a reference PCB
this is the same PCB that is inside the
founder's card right here the only
difference is obviously they implemented
a much bigger cooler and when we saw the
dual fan design I think a lot of us
anticipated like oh it's hot that's why
they finally stepped away from the
blower style because the blower style
cooler basically meant you could throw
the card in any case in a matter of a
small form-factor or large form factor
ATX whatever the cooling would have been
handled entirely on itself it takes the
area in exhausted out the back it
doesn't care about the case airflow
being able to handle the cooling of the
cart it's one of the reasons why we test
an open-air test bench is because the
only thing dictating the performance
level of the cooler on this card is the
cooler itself so anything you see here
is probably going to be a few degrees
hotter in a case but that's why we don't
test in a case because there's no case
that accounts for everybody's situation
out there so we only use the cooler to
determine the temperatures well the dual
fans like this typically they run much
cooler and much quieter which is why we
see them in that AI B's
the problem is Nvidia really missed an
opportunity here to make this an amazing
product because if you take a look at
the heatsink it runs the full length of
the card the problem is it squishes down
really tight right here where you only
have my guess would be three millimeters
worth of opening between the the shroud
of the card and the actual heatsink
where the air has to make it out because
it pushes down and then has to come out
besides there's no exhaust in the back
so none of that air can go sideways the
EVGA cards actually have holes in them I
don't know if you guys remember they
started this back with the icx design
there's actually holds in the fins so
what doesn't make it out the sides can
actually blow through long ways on the
card too but if you look at the bottom
it's the same thing they could have left
this open right here and this could have
I mean it doesn't get seen it goes down
in the motherboard so they could have
had a lot more air come out right here
but they didn't and then it squishes
down again on these parts or squishes
down here opens up in the front and the
back underneath the fan but
becomes completely blocked off by the
motherboard so the only air that can
escape is out the top side of the card
where the logo shows but guess what if
you take a look at where the power pins
are dual eight pins this is blocked off
to where you have a little bit of air
flow in there but now you've got this
much percentage less airflow so what we
found was the temperatures on this card
actually set at least 75 degrees under
load on the stock fan curve and then
when as high as 78 degrees depending on
the title like 4k with super sampling
and all that on testing the cooler we
could see that actually rise up to
almost 80 degrees in an open air test
bench so unfortunately a hit and a miss
in my opinion in terms of the actual
functionality of this cooler the reason
why I said the EVGA card is here is
because this card was anywhere between
10 to 15 C cooler at the same
frequencies than the founders Edition
card because again it's a 2.75 slot and
more than this is like triple the
thickness of the heatsink that's
actually in the founders card and the
fans are a much better design in terms
of how much air can actually move and as
you can see it can breathe through all
sides of the card so now let's talk
about some final thoughts here because
we have over 300 points of data
and fanboy isms aside you can't lie with
the data the data is what it is and the
titles that we tested various different
titles obviously with different engines
and different likes and dislikes in
terms of what it wants in graphics cards
we saw a great great scaling with 3d
mark but 3d mark is designed to do that
I mean this card just dominated in 3d
mark the problem is 3d mark is not
realistic or indicative of what a gaming
experience is like it doesn't take it
doesn't really care about CPU overhead
it doesn't have to worry about gaming or
player models and textures and all that
sort of stuff that are constantly
changing it's on a track it's perfect it
scales perfect that's it's one job but
once you throw this into games like
Shadow the Tomb Raider rise of the Tomb
Raider Metro Far Cry 5 hit man it
becomes a truly different story
obviously 1080p becomes a bottleneck
even for our 8700 K so if you're running
a high refresh rate 1080p you better be
overclocking the out of your CPU
we're running at 4.7 gigs but 1440 and
1080p we use 1080 ti as our baseline to
determine our performance per dollar and
where you like kind of fall in terms of
whether or not you're paying more money
per dollar so or performance what I mean
is if you got 15% more performance but
you paid 70% more dollars for that I
mean obviously that that would be a
terrible financial choice right but
that's what we kind of saw 2080 trading
blows with the 1080 Ti that's exactly
why we didn't see any performance
metrics in there ray tracing or RT X
keynote
I'm not even calling it the video card
keynote it was nothing but a ray tracing
demo and I think they know that if they
had boasted about the 25% or 30%
improvement that we saw I think we saw
up to like 31 percent improvement with
20 atti versus 1080 TI the problem is it
costs like 70% more money so if you're
getting 25% more performance for 70%
more money I mean maybe there are people
out there that can afford to just you
know throw money at something and not
care I mean that's why people drive
Bugattis and Pagani is because they got
more money than oat to do with it just
doesn't make financial sense and
especially the 2080 which is the card I
was hoping was gonna be kind of the hero
card here okay yeah it's cheaper it's
still 800 bucks but it's cheaper than a
10 20 80 TI
and it I was hoping it was gonna mop the
floor with the ten atti but the thing is
it was anywhere from negative percentage
performance and some of our tests it was
getting beaten by the 1080 TI and I
don't think it really went any higher
than nine percent faster than at an 80
TI at $100 more and we're talking a
hundred dollars more than the custom
1080 T eyes which are gonna perform even
better than the founders card that we
tested which means that performance gap
will be even narrower or getting beaten
by even more the 1080p ions from the
test for a 1080i one
so the twenty eighty became no longer a
really compelling argument in terms of
performance
seventy percent more money for some
cases up to thirty percent more
improvement and what's disappointing
about that is if you look at the family
on family progression of Nvidia from
around the 400 series forward you
typically got 25% improvement 22 to 25
in my testing I did a video about it go
and watch it we're at the same price
point the 80 series card for 85 86 87 89
80 and then tight next Maxwell when I
tested we saw 22 to 25 percent
improvement for the same price point
tight next you know excluded from all of
that the problem is now you're getting
that same performance increase at 70%
more cost so I said in my previous video
that they probably just slid the the
naming convention up one where the TI is
now a Titan at Titan price and the 80 is
now technically the TI I was expecting
to see quite honestly the 2080 at the
$100 price point to be the 25% faster
than a 1080 TI and that wasn't the case
and that's why Nvidia didn't show any of
their performance metrics so until DL SS
is out and matured and ray-tracing is
out in matured and developers have a
time to develop for it a new family of
cards will probably be out anyway so my
current recommendation at this current
time is a big fat don't buy so there it
is guys tell me you guys thought
conclusions are my own but I think a lot
of people are gonna echo what I'm saying
or I'm pretty much just echoing what
everyone else is saying but I've been
hands-on with it now for four days
straight worth of testing and I'm done
sort of now I got to overclock them and
test it again but it's depressing and
I'm sad I'm mad
anyway I'm gonna go guys thanks for
watching we'll see you the next one
going video what the man and I'm
dun dun dun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
