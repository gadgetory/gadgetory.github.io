do today we're going to kind of do a
blog here me cleaning up the internet
solution here in this house because if
you are married or you live with a
girlfriend or fiancee or a wife or
whatever then you'll know you can't get
away with this mess for very long
not to mention knowing what a cable
management whore I am I can't stand this
anymore
the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro
from Coolermaster combines modularity
with creativity giving you the freedom
to build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description alright so one of the
reasons why this is such a mess and why
I haven't put any of this back together
yet or neaten this up is because when we
first moved in we went with the Charter
internet which you guys know is the only
real option for where I live you saw the
video where I put together all these
ends I didn't actually show the way this
looked done which is kind of sad huh you
see I've got all the rooms wired up and
things are going TVs and entertainment
centers and consoles and PCs are all
chugging away there but anyway this was
the splitter that Charter used when they
hooked up the coaxial now we didn't like
the Charter TV very much so we went back
to DIRECTV and they installed this thing
well as you can see ya the installers
well I asked them to kind of leave alone
because I wanted to put this panel
together but the installer for DirecTV
simply cut all the coaxials off of the
splitters here for charter and left me
with this thing here which runs over to
the modem so I've got a neat mess up I
want to melt this down I've got to
figure out how I'm going to get power
into here because this requires power
the internet box for the Direct TV
requires power and there is no power
anywhere in this patch panel so that's a
little bit unfortunate so this is the
cover panel for it right here and I'm
thinking what am i probably enough doing
is drilling a hole in the bottom of
putting like a grommet on it that I can
literally just push the you know the
thief internet feed from the router to
the switch and the power for it because
the only power plug down here is down
there as you can see and it's not
perfectly lined up at the patch panel so
it's not like I can push out our
you know knock out one of these punch
pen or punch downs here rfsu punch now I
can't punch out one of these holes and
go straight down if I could then I would
have considered tapping off of existing
power like if that was over here and
then just running on up to here and
actually utilizing although that
wouldn't even work because as you can
see this is where it's designed for
utilize our electrical tape and this is
where it's designed for you to actually
been able to put like a power block or
something we feel like carefully there
it's fine there but then you can see
right there where there's a stud so
because of where it's lined up you
wouldn't have even been able to do that
I'm sure you could have customized
something you could have then you could
have had power right there but alas I
cannot so we've got to find a solution
to that and I want to clean this up and
this is this is the real mess right
there I'm if you move all that out of
the way you can see my switch looks
pretty damn good in there and then
there's that so because I know that the
modem and the router are going to pretty
much always be next to each other
because obviously the modem is feeding
the router and then the router has a
single output going into the switch I
think what I'm going to do is I'm going
to run down to Lowe's and I'm going to
get myself like a small white piece of
wood that would fit like right up right
here and then I'm going to mount these
things with the power strip down to the
the board and then with that I can have
that all nice and wired up neat and I
can mount that to the wall and then I'm
just going to have the power that I need
running into there for things that
require power so I think I'm going to do
it that way because that's going to be
easier than drilling a bunch of random
holes up here to mount the things and
then I can actually then use um jeez a
x-33 will you focus already holy hell is
your ax 33 of you super slow focus
anyway then I'll be able to use our do
cable management on it with all the
wires by using you know different straps
and things to route it nice and neat how
I want because quite honestly if you
look at this this is pretty ugly this is
pretty bad every time I walk in here
even though the wife's half the closets
over there yeah can you tell wife's
closet men's closet anyway uh no I got I
got some stuff but anyway yeah so I want
it to look nice and orderly because when
I walk in here you can kind of see it
more from my
side than anything else all right so
here's the whiteboard I said I was going
to get at Lowe's it's nothing more than
just like a shelf one of those shelves
you don't want to get those little L
brackets and then screw it to so I'm
going to mount the router and the modem
as I said to this thing here and then
this is going to pretty much get mounted
up on the wall up there above the patch
panel that way everything can be moved
as a unit and I also got I said unit now
some people might be asking themselves
well Jay why don't you just hide the
modem up inside that panel because as
you can see it fits in there well one it
there's a lot of cable mess here I can't
actually push the coaxial back up in
there very well I believe it to be
mounted to a stud right there
the other thing is the switch the switch
doesn't really get hot the switch
doesn't really do much that generates
any sort of heat the modem does get warm
and as you guys saw this is a closed-off
patch panel and I don't want to have air
flow issues in there so that's why it's
going to be mounted over here on the
board also with the router the other
thing that's kind of interesting about
the router is that the way it's designed
for hanging and as you can see with you
know the little notch right there is
being faced up with the logo facing the
right way is not the way it hangs it
actually has to hang upside down like
that
now some folks might be asking why I put
zip ties up here instead of the velcro
straps like I have here well the way I
look at it one is I'm a lot less likely
to mess with the coaxial at all than I
am to mess with the stuff over here on
the switch so the velcro makes it easy
to undo it
get the cable I need we you know tighten
it all back up
whereas this I just want sitting here
being untouched now when it comes to the
cable management here I don't really
need this splitter anymore this is just
a splitter that this comes in from the
main feed from the street for the
coaxial or the cable service and then
this used to go to the other rooms
because of the fact that I had you know
the actual cable TV service but I'm not
using that anymore so I don't
technically need that splitter now I can
put a barrel connector on there and put
those two together obviously I would
have to do something to extend this
cable because it's not long enough and
then this is the cable I have here now
even if I mount this thing down to the
back I don't have a lot of slack left on
this cable right here to make it out of
the box and up into the router but if
you look here the Internet box for the
Direct TV is way longer than need to be
it's coming all the way up and around
and back on there so what I'm thinking
I'm going to do is I'm going to switch
these two I'm going to take the longer
cable and put it over here where the
Internet is and I'm going to put the
shorter cable on the Internet over here
to the Direct TV box yeah hooray for
light it was dark in here so I went got
one of my soft boxes and it's pointing
that up anyway now you can see a little
bit better one thing I'm going to do now
is I'm going to take this barrel
connector and I'm going to cook hook it
up to the internet feed and to the other
cable that way I'll have this splitter
as you can see they even just cut all
the coaxial rather than reusing the ends
because installers have to put their own
ends on it's part of the installation
process that you do just to make sure
that everything is kosher so I'm going
to go ahead and get this crap out of
here put a barrel connector on it with
the longer cable one other thing that's
important to do too is because that's
all the slack there is on this cable and
it's not labeled so in the future if I
ever needed to change any of this up and
I was like I don't know what the heck
this cable is you want to mark it mark
your cables it's a big deal
all of these are mostly marked except
with
this one which is the main feed all
right well the exception of power this
is pretty much all wired up I mean I've
got I've now got to take the panel cover
drill the hole put the grommet in it
like I said yeah it's gonna kind of get
it with a hole in the panel but the only
thing I can do there's no other way out
of here I'm not going to drill a hole
either underneath and do like a like a
pass-through like you would do with say
you know like that like I did with the
TV I don't want to put holes in this
wall so that's what I'm gonna do next
and then we can run our power cables
through there and then we'll be pretty
much done there's not a whole lot to do
just mount the stuff to the board over
here and then be done with it here's the
grommet but I got for it the grommet
just needs to be big enough to allow the
ethernet cable to pass through because
all the low bolt stuff in there is as a
tiny little cable it's actually not that
big of a deal so if I need the hole to
go bigger though I've got a step bit
here it goes all the way up to what is
this an inch and a half I believe an
inch and three-eighths so it can go
pretty big if I need it to but that's
what we use to make the hole for the
grommet and of course I'm going to do a
pilot hole so that we don't get it like
you know you're scratching all the way
across the thing and it's actually the
first time using my shop for anything
right now and it's for the patch panel
how ironic is that I do need to build a
computer though for the gaming rig or
the sim the gate the racing sim because
I did finally move that thing in the
house see it's not right there anymore
all right so I ended up getting a little
crazy and making the hole a little bit
too big for the grommet size that I have
as you can see there it's just sort of
moving around in there but then I
remembered that I had these extra
grommets that come with the case-knives
cases and so I can actually get this one
in there I can step it up with a one
more size and get that in there so thank
God for that and it's much thicker it
can be like beefcake oh ring or beefcake
grommet leave that go to the other one
huh yeah like a glove
look at that perfect and it's bigger
than the other whole list so now I can
fit possibly like even a power plug
through there or something perfect there
we go
it's really dirty but just sort of a
test fit to see how well that works out
and there's the feed cable for the
Internet obviously I've got to do you
know Ethernet through there and power
cables and stuff man Ashley's looking a
lot better than I thought I would so I
got the wood piece up here as you can
see mounted on the studs and you might
look at that and go why is it off-center
like that well it's actually centered on
the closet overhead railing thing so now
I'm going to do is I've got to cable
manage all of this up here so that it
looks nice and neat yeah I wish the
board was a little bit longer side room
to actually mount the power strip like
right underneath it on the board I'm not
sure exactly how I'm gonna do that yet
but I think this is all going to turn
out very very neat the wife is actually
gone right now I'm hoping to get this
done before she comes home at which she
can come into the closet here and see
that it's not just a big wired mess
everywhere but then again that was the
whole point of this video in fact I
don't know why I'm making a video on
this I guess you guys like the vlogs and
things but I just don't know what is it
about the vlogs that people like is it
the fact that you feel it's more much
more off-the-cuff it's kind of like
you're there it's it's more relatable
because it's not all produced in you
know super shot carded and be rolled and
stuff like that is just kind of like hey
we're check we're checking out Jay
do some geeky techy things that you guys
could probably do better than me I don't
know guys tell me down in the comments
what is it you like about the vlogs I
like vlogging I mean it's easy I do like
to do creative stuff and obviously
b-roll content and things like that too
so maybe you guys like a big mixture of
it tell me down in the comments it
really does help to tell us what it is
you guys like to see and why tell us why
you like to see it and why you don't
want to see certain things that's
important to a lot of people leave that
out it is go this sucks they don't tell
us why it sucks alright so here's where
I'm at so far and this really kind of
sucks because there's no way to make
that power cable clean there's really
not so I guess it could look cleaner I
mean obviously it's not done it's tough
to deal with all those cables right
there um yeah I mean a shelf or
something would have worked too but at
the same time I wanted a wall-mounted
and it really is going to be a lot
better than it looked before this was
coiled up only because I don't have a
shorter like a 2 foot cable I was going
to make one but I'm running out of time
to get this done before some other
errands I've got to run today but it's
coming together it really comes down to
this damn power plug for the router it's
super long and just ugly and awkward how
am I trying to figure that out and make
it look a little cleaner but for now as
you can see it's better than it was so
let me just go and get this thing
buttoned up well I guess in hindsight
this looks pretty damn ghetto but
whatever um
I've logged it and that's so hey it
turned out the problem is all the power
cords the power cords are so freakin
long and then they all have these power
bricks and like the modem the power
brick is in the middle of the cord and
then just like the Netgear you've got
the thick PC like power supply unit type
of cable there and then you've got it's
you know again that's in the middle then
you've got the cord and neither one's
long enough to reach all the way to the
floor if I just wanted to run it that
way but it works that's what really
matters to me the most is it works so it
is what it is well something else that's
going to have to wait is doing the
channel strip because I'm an idiot and
didn't pay any attention and I bought a
corner one clearly that's not a corner
anyway I have to go back and do that but
I guess if we compare this to the way it
looked when I first started even though
the kylix have jumbled wire of a mess
it's better than it was with it all just
kind of everywhere here and wire stick
now alright so that project is mostly
done I have to stop being so anal about
it because it's in the closet you're not
really going to see it it's all mounted
to that board rather than holes all over
the wall I mean there's just a four
holes in the wall holding the board up
and those we easily patched and stuck
out and repainted you know if you had to
if I have to take that thing down the
other thing is like I said it's in the
closet you're not really going to see it
which is a big deal I guess I mean it's
one of those things where I know it kind
of looks bad but whatever something else
I'm working on here as you can see the
upstairs like entertainment center
things just some IKEA furniture we put
together but look the racing sim is up
here I don't have the other monitors
hooked up or anything to it yet but this
is going to be hooked up and this
upstairs loft area it's going to kind of
be just sort of a probably made you all
dizzy row there did it this upstairs
loft is any more like a game area which
is we kind of need like I said have a
area to play around have some console
games up here is when we PC up here
movies it's going to be pretty neat when
it's all done anyway guys tell me what
kind of stuff you want to see in the
future if you guys want to see more
vlogs maybe I'll kind of introduce a
couple of these in the month during the
month I don't do a lot of vlogs so maybe
it's kind of nice to be able to see
what's happening behind the scenes again
like I said earlier tell me why you like
the blogs if you like them and it will
help me out a lot in the future anyway
thanks for watching guys - hope you guys
enjoyed today's video tell me what a
pile of crap that job I just did looks
like I won't even get mad because I'll
agree with you it doesn't look great but
it looks better than it did you can't
argue with that
alright Internet time to go see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
