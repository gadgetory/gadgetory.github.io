a gray card I almost went down the
stairs what's up guys James two cents
here and it's been a while since I've
done one of these videos and I want to
preface this by saying that NVIDIA has
been one of my sponsors for quite a
while all the founders edition cards you
guys ever seen come through here we're
supplied by Nvidia I kind of feel like I
have a pretty good working relationship
with them and I hope that can remain the
case after this video because since I
like Nvidia is why I'm going to give
them a little bit of tough love this
video is going to pretty much just be a
talking head with me talking to the
camera very unscripted very raw so
forgive me if it kind of goes all over
the place but it's been a while since
I've done one of these and I'm a little
out of practice but I woke up this
morning to some very interesting news I
woke up to an email from Nvidia a press
release basically saying hey guys we are
launching the all-new tight next Pascal
and I'm going wait what the tight next
Pascal launched in like August of last
year that's strange I'm looking through
the dates and stuff and I'm like wait a
minute
April Fool's was a week ago that doesn't
make sense as I'm reading this press
release on the toilet this morning which
is usually how I start my day I'm very
confused I see the date is April 6 and I
started thinking maybe this was some
sort of an accidental re-release of an
old press release but included in this
was the mention of them now including
Mac's support for the Pascal based GPU
so I'm going to know that's new that's
interest I don't understand this why are
we talking about tight next Pascal being
all new and I noticed they're actually
using a little P now next to the X which
we've kind of been doing ever since
August of last year because remember you
don't want to confuse yourself but the
Titan X being confused with the Titan X
or especially the new Titan X being
confused with the Titan X and not to be
confused with the older Titan X but not
the oldest Titan X which is the middle
Titan X but now they're calling Titan X
P but we've been calling type next Titan
X P since August of last year because we
were smart enough to not confuse
ourselves by calling it just type next
but now Nvidia is confusing the matter
by even further by adopting the P which
we put on there ourself so now we have
the Titan X P not to be confused with
the Titan X P to be confused with the
Titan X M so of course the running joke
right now is the next card is going to
be Titan Vista and followed by Titan
seven but one of the interesting things
about the press release though it didn't
go into any of the changes on the Titan
XP which is what was very confusing the
new
an XP not the okay I already went
through that we'd only go to that again
I'm looking at the specs I'm going on
they bumped up the CUDA cores it's got
thirty eight hundred and forty CUDA
cores now versus the Titan X big P so we
use big P a Nvidia is using little P so
I don't know anyway I've got versus the
thirty five hundred and eighty four CUDA
cores found in the Titans that are
currently in my system looking through
the specs also it's got a little bit
faster boost clock 1582 versus 1531
found in the original not the original
the older titan x pc this is this is why
the naming first of all is stupid it's
stupid if they were out to confuse the
buyers and they've done a fantastic job
at that but the new Titan that XP has
again twelve gigabytes of memory which
you'd expect but it's got eleven point
four gigabit per second memory speed
versus the ten gigabit per second on the
older Titan so what they've done is they
have essentially just bumped up the
clock speed the memory speed and gave it
two hundred fifty six more cuda cores
now let me go ahead and get into the
rant portion of this video all along the
titan cards have been kind of known as
the unlocked big chip of whatever it is
whether it was kepler or maxwell or now
Pascal you would sit there and you would
go wow the Titan is as fast as it can
get for that generation and the Titan XP
was expected to be that very same thing
with the new core and 3584 cuda cores
were like that a ton of course how
much better can it possibly get now
here's where as a consumer I would be
pretty upset let's say I bought a Titan
X last year saved my money for 1,200
bucks finally got a top-of-the-line card
and then you fast forward a few months
the 1080p eye comes out that has pretty
much the exact same specs with the
exception of one gigabyte less memory
but it's faster memory comes out at $700
and it's actually edging out the card I
bought for $1200 in performance yeah I'd
already feel like I got kicked in the
face by Nvidia but what if you just
bought that card prior to launch you're
like oh well it's only a little bit
slower but then to find out that only a
month and a half after this guy launches
Nvidia refreshes the Titan xp for the
same price I paid and it's faster in
every single way than even this guy
which is already faster than the card I
paid $1200 for so I paid $12 for a card
that's slower than a card that's 700 and
waste lower than a card that cost the
same price that came out just a little
bit later what are you doing over there
what what is going on over there in that
division
okay so here's another part of the story
I want to go into when I first requested
the Titan X's for skunk works I was
essentially told it's not a gtx card
although it said gtx and geforce gtx
right on the damn thing i was told it's
not a geforce gaming card it's a deep
learning card and that it would be
difficult for them to get them for me
long story short as you guys know how
the story ended i got two of them and i
got put in skunk works and they are
absolutely phenomenal when you're told
they're not a gaming card but then you
come out with a card that's faster than
it and you market it towards gamers that
makes your original statement kind of a
load of crock and then to come out with
a new titan now let's talk about Teri's
crew Terry Cruz's PC here real quick
because it's just about done I'm
finishing that one up and I see this and
I'm going you've got to be me
you've got to be me I've
already got a ton of people asking me if
I'm going to go to the 1080p eye on his
build and I went no that's not a big
enough difference to really warrant
taking all the blocks off and redoing it
just for the sake of a couple of fps
especially on water and I'm gonna be
overclocked but now the new cards come
out and I write an email and basically
like hey get me to the new type next
piece this is for Terry Crews this is
hugely visible let's do it because he's
an over-the-top guy he's powerful that
put as much power in there as we
possibly can and I'm told no because
they are not a gaming card they're a
deep learning card here we go again with
this cycle of deep it's like you already
viewed that that story and then you
obsoleted that story by coming out with
a gaming card based on the exact same
GPU and made it faster than the card you
told me wasn't for gaming and now here
we are again so anyway guys um here's
the moral of this story and and of
course when I think we want to make this
video I'm like I said I'm a fan of
invidious products I don't know what the
hell the business model is right now
I'll be honest I feel like they've
shadowed something here
when this card launched at 700 bucks two
things happen that made people very
happy with Nvidia which typically Nvidia
is kind of either loved or hated there's
not a lot of middle ground people
Beks I felt people praising the price of
this card at $700 how often do you see
people praise a $700 card as being value
you know why there was value because it
was faster than the $1200 card which
made it fantastic and of course the 1080
slid down to the $500 price point and by
the way you should have slid the 1070
down another 50 bucks because then you
just would have dominated the $300 to
$700 GPU market but I digress what do I
know about business this card right here
was praised because it allowed the 1080
to be more affordable and which is a
phenomenal performing card in itself
this guy right here with beating the
Titan X P the middle Titan X P for $500
less now what you've done is you've
pissed off the people who paid $1200
again you pissed them off once with this
and you did it even further by offering
this which we now know was extremely
held back in limited core again anyway I
know there's a huge mistake not putting
them in Terry Crews was billed but even
if they wanted to send them now on the
this isn't about me I'm not putting 1080
tea is in skunk works let alone the new
Titans and not that interested in that
honestly this is where I spend my time
now not in front of skunk works but I
felt like Terry Crews deserved it
so I was a little bit of an explanation
I'm gonna have to do in that video of
why the cards that's in there is like
the older titan but up and you were
Titan and it was suggested that I go at
1080p is but like I said carrying it all
apart just to get a couple of extra fps
not worth it to me so if you are a
consumer and you I'm sorry I'm just
going to apologize on the video's behalf
that if you pay $1200 I showed you guys
what the custom cards are able to do to
4k gaming and of course the founders
Edition Titan X P P P X P P P X P X P P
is going to be even faster it's also
going to only come with the founders
Edition cooler which is
hot noisy I just overall a poor design
in terms of not aesthetics it looks
fantastic but in terms of noise to
performance ratio just go with a custom
1080 TI and you'll be happy that's it
the only reason we made this video was
because of course I woke up this morning
to a million messages and tweets and
emails of people did you see the new
card did you see the new card were you
going to do what are you do guys not
going to do anything I'm gonna do
anything except for sit in front of this
camera and bitch just what I basically
just did anyway I hope we can still be
friends after all of this and what's
going to make this even more awkward is
Nvidia is flying out to be here for the
introduction of the Terry Crews PC PC to
him so that's going to make for some
interesting dinner conversation but
doesn't really matter this channel is
called James $0.02 because I have an
opinion and I want to share it and
that's my opinion on the matter
a fairly strong one I think mistakes
were made
alright guys that's it nothing else to
say 1080i not for deep learning oh and
one more thing so guys don't see me in
any future Nvidia launch events watch
this video and you'll probably know why
I wasn't invited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
