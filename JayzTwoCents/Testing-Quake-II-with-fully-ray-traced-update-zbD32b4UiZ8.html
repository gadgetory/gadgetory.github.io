gonna talk about a 22 year old game a
game that came out and I was playing it
when I was a sophomore in high school
Wow
early just aged myself we're going to
talk about quick too because you guys
may have heard the rumors you may have
seen some of the demos and with GDC
going on NVIDIA has finally launched the
fully ray-traced
quake to RTX demo and it's actually free
you guys can try it yourself with its
unique radiator mounted pump premium
sleeve tubing infinity mirror RGB block
and cam software control the Kraken m22
all-in-one liquid cooler from NZXT is
the perfect choice for small form-factor
liquid cooling to learn more click the
link in the description below now I can
hear some of the grumbling already like
what's it matter they had to go back 22
years to find a game that could do
ray-tracing look putting any of that
sort of argument aside and just looking
at this from a technological standpoint
this is pretty damn impressive we're
gonna go into too much depth on games
then vs. games today and what
ray-tracing is and all that sort of
stuff we've talked about it in the past
but high level what rasterization
basically does is it says that we've got
a point of light and we've got an object
here and here's the texture of this
object and this light should be shining
on this reflecting this silver surface
and then you know putting a shadow here
be it so it's very very algorithmic and
that everything is already pretty much
determined and placed and then
everything else is just kind of faked
we're ray tracing actually says we have
a point of light here light rays are
bouncing and the light ray reflection is
handling everything it's bouncing around
it saying this object is this texture
and the scatter should be like this and
it's going to go off this way and so the
difference in RTX on quake 2 is the fact
that there is no rasterization it is all
being handled entirely via ray tracing
so the fact that we had to go back that
far to get any sort of title that can be
fully ray traced yeah it's because of
polygon count and all that sort of stuff
but it kind of shows where the future of
ray tracing can go when the horsepower
sort of catches up now we're gonna be
using a 20 a DTI for this demo because
we're using my Corsair 1 my test bench
is still at the other studio with
should eventually make its way here so
we're not gonna be testing it with any
other lower end cards like say a 2016
yeah I know some people remain 2060s not
lowland but it is in terms of the r-tx
lineup it's the lowest card you can get
for desktop the other thing too is that
I can't test it with Pascal and stuff
for the same reasons that I just
mentioned I'm not even 100% positive if
you can run this demo on a non r-tx card
given the fact that this is a hundred
percent ray-traced if you could then it
definitely shows how far we've come so
if you guys want to download this demo
yourself and try it out with your
graphics cards and stuff for your r-tx
cards or your help try it with Pascal or
whatever it see what happens I'll put a
link to it down in the description below
you can get it on Steam there is a
standalone which we're gonna be running
right here so we're gonna go ahead and
fire this up and we are going to take a
look at the menu settings and what the
different options and stuff are okay so
here's the menu right here we go to
options we get various things
environment setup all wow ok sky type
original environment map earth scope so
you can change settings in the game and
every time you do that to reload the
game oh I'll check this out okay so you
can go in and change things like the sky
the lighting so we have a hole in the
sky right here but you can see there's
no lighting or anything shining on the
wall because we have a skylight here but
you can see where some of the light is
kind of bleeding and wrapping around the
edge now if we go in here and change
that environment oh there we go so
there's the god rays and stuff that
we're kinda used to so what's happening
here is this scene as being entirely
rendered by this light source so the
lights coming in and it's bouncing and
refracting on these different textures
and surfaces you can see now we as we
shoot we get a light path that sort of
follows so now you can see that we're
inside here the Sun is no longer
applying any sort of light to this space
because we've moved around from where
the light is but as you can see there's
a little bit of Sun glow here in the
corner because there's still some direct
light right there so I wonder if I could
put the Sun in position to shine through
here this is cool how you can go in here
and just play with the Sun position
oh my been a little far imagine like you
could really do some real life there
yeah but it would kind of suck for
everyone else wouldn't it that's their
problem the problem is I have no
reference as to the compass so I don't
know like where this and it's going well
I mean you obviously get the idea right
hey punk look at we're creating a shadow
on the wall at least the gun is because
I'm just a floating gun in a hand so
because there's light sources right here
I'm creating a shadow on the wall right
there and the kind of shadow starts big
and soft and the closer you get to it
boom so I mean you can see we're getting
80 FPS which is okay let's let's look at
it this way 80 FPS on a $1,200 graphics
card this isn't about the FPS it's about
taking a title that's 22 years old and
making it look like this because of
applying new logic to it this is not
overlaid on top of the original game
this is the game completely remastered
using only ray tracing technology - like
this and i neva just like the scene to
render the scene so we can use my phone
as an example you see how the farther
away my phone is because we have
multiple light sources we have one in
front of us we have some behind us one
off to the side there's a light over
here so you see the shadow is kind of
stretching out in all these different
directions based on where the light
direction is coming from and the
intensity of that light source but the
closer I get to the object we're
blocking light to obviously the sharper
it gets so they've mimicked that really
well here as you saw with the gun
reflection obviously the flag happening
right here so you can see that there is
some softness to the flag my gun should
realistically be creating a shadow on
this wall oh no it's down there on the
ground so here's an example of that you
can see the shadow of the gun on the
ground when I jump you can see it sort
of softens up because of the fact that
I'm becoming farther away from the thing
I'm creating a shadow on or casting a
shadow but as I get closer to the wall
you see how crisp that edge becomes
that's something that we that's not new
that's happened with shaders obviously
but that had to be faked that really had
to be faked where this is this is truly
happening in real time where the light
source is creating that shadow you see
how that you could see the texture like
there's depth to it like II tell this is
kind of like a corroded steel like an
old warship or something would look like
there's the original game so oh well
this guy is also red because we were
using earth before so let's go ahead and
just I mean this is what how it looked
circa 1997 so let's go back to our TX
there we go so another thing you could
look at here too is the reflections on
the ground or in the water you can see
the Sun right there because that's
that's the point of which it's bouncing
and it's we're at the right angle to be
able to see it
I think the reflections are a little bit
too over exaggerated but I think that's
also because this is an RT X demo I
think most people know when you go walk
around the world and you look windows
and all that sort of stuff yeah they're
reflective but my phone screen is
reflective and the problem is they're
making everything look like this even
things that are only slightly reluctant
reflective like an example would be this
this Corsair box right here nice product
placement root dude is this this decal
on here is shiny and if I move it around
you can see how it's sort of reflecting
the light but you see how it's not a
mirror because it's textured and sure
it's glossy but it's not an actual
mirror I feel like in in RTX demos they
would turn this into like a glass
reflection like a mirror because again
over exaggerating the demo but that's
one of those things where maybe in the
future we'll see a dial where we can
actually sort of pull back some of those
reflections and make it a little bit
less exaggerated but this is just an
example of like how good this looks this
is just an example of how he can take a
twenty to twenty two-year-old game with
an extremely low polygon count and then
make it feel modern by simply applying
this to it what happened close
shoot me past me maybe the way it lights
up the scene in there and look at the
way the light interacts with the wall as
it goes by the fact that we're seeing 80
FPS and a game that is being rendered
entirely by using ray tracing is a is a
great thing now I know that this is
gonna sound like well this is just one
big Nvidia commercial it's not what
we're looking at here is a technology
that is not it's not Nvidia specific
this is ray tracing is ray tracing this
is this is not something that Nvidia
developed it's something in Billy Nvidia
sent out as a goal to you know bring to
mass market basically and do it in real
time I would love for AMD to come out
with a driver that would allow us to
take their graphics cards and start
playing around with real-time ray
tracing they made a statement that they
can do it in their graphics cards are
great at it simply because of the amount
of shaders are the amount of stream
processors that they have I mean like
4,000 plus stream processors something
that had for a long time a very
different approach to how graphics are
rendered versus Nvidia so Nvidia came
out with you know obviously its driver
allowing you to play around with ray
tracing and like battlefield 5 and stuff
whether your Pascal graphics cards I
really wish AMD would do the same thing
now I like I said I can't test this
right now with Pascal because I this is
an all-in-one unit and it's all I have
available to me right now but I'm kind
of curious if you guys have Pasco
graphics cards did you download this do
me a favor try it out say what your
specs are and then put down in the
comments what your fps is if it worked
if you're running a nother r-tx card
like 2060 2070 whatever then also do the
same thing what is your FPS since I
wasn't able to actually show you what
the other graphics cards are performing
like you can see we're getting 80 81 FPS
right here with with a 2080 Ti and I
know that sounds depressing but this
really is just the first phase of the
future of games they a lot of people
said the same thing about rasterization
nobody cares about shadows no one cares
about reflections or well I guess screen
space reflections nobody cares about
that sort of stuff but then eventually
becomes the way things are done and you
know
know any different until something new
comes along and then the public says we
don't care about that we don't care and
then it becomes the norm and then it's
just a repeating cycle I guess a good
way to put this is this game came out
almost two years after a toy story toy
story came out in 1996 but was obviously
in production long before that and it
took a very long time to render that
video because it was using fully
raytrace CGI and if you go and you look
at the way things looked back in 1996
with the original Toy Story when that
first came out everyone was like this is
so cool it looks so real go and look at
it today and look at how much your mind
has adjusted to the way things have
evolved and then watch the Toy Story 4
teaser and then you'll realize like wow
we have definitely come a long way and
doing that for games is not a bad thing
so anyway as you guys heard me suggest
you know to put down your specs what you
know how's it running on your system
put it down the comments below so people
can find out and then also like I said
this is entirely free you can download
the demo you can go and play it see how
it runs on your own systems and just
another own that frees a good thing
right alright guys thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you in the next
one and I am still gonna do that how
does DXR run on non r-tx cards we just
kind of got caught up with this whole
studio move so thanks for sticking
around while the contents kind of sucked
