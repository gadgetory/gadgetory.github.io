here and it is almost June which means
in most places it's starting to get
pretty freakin hot which is kind of
ironic considering right now in Southern
California at the moment of making this
video it is cold and it is windy and it
is raining we are not used to this in
California it's like a state of
emergency around here the octane gaming
gear combo from coolermaster features
seven backlighting colors turbo mode a
vago 3050 optical sensor along with four
levels of dpi adjustment now you can po
noobs without boning your wallet click
the link in the description to learn
more so with some are right over the
horizon we're gonna be taking a look at
the new GSP cooler for graphics cards
from alpha cool yeah that does actually
say alpha cool not not oh cool because
that that's kind of like the Alpha
symbol anyway the goal of this in fact
when we first started talking about this
last year and I did an article over on
the webpage was the fact that they were
reaching out to the audience asking
people to if you want a free block send
in your custom graphics card and they
would make a block for it and sell it to
the public and they would give you one
for free so they really reached out to
the consumers to find out which graphics
cards were needing to be supported so
they came up with a spreadsheet and then
they pretty much tried to cover every
single graphics card on the market when
it came to you know the last couple of
generations so if you guys were looking
for things like you know gtx 760 4
gigabyte cooler it wasn't easy to find a
full cover water blocks for those
because it just wasn't worth it to
companies like EK or bits power or swift
tech 2 or coolants to make these blocks
for these one-off lesser frequent cards
so with all that said let's go ahead and
kind of turn the camera and get in close
with the block we'll do an unboxing and
we'll talk a bit about the quality of it
and really how this thing is designed
and what makes it really kind of
different it's not your your standard
full cover water block well we'll show
you why here in a minute so go ahead and
cue that transition transition
now this particular block we're looking
at here is for the GTX 970 and this is
for the g1 gaming from gigabyte now I do
wish that their naming convention made a
little more sense because this is
actually the mo3 model but you wouldn't
know what the heck mo 3 is unless you go
and look at their little chart and trust
me their chart is not exactly the
easiest to read so calling it the GTX
970 g1 gaming full cover water block
from alpha cool would have made a lot
more sense but whatever you guys will
have to there's mo 1 mo - MO 3 and
before I'm about hey so you guys are
going to have to just learn what those
are anyway once you open it up pretty
standard packaging here and then look at
that a back plate a back plate that is
actually included with the block that's
not very common you've got all your
pre-cut thermal pads this is kind of a
big deal considering thermal pads
typically you have to cut them yourself
but check this out they actually take
all the guesswork out of it by giving
each thermal pad packaging here its own
little color for reference in the manual
we'll talk about that a little bit more
in the future here you also get a little
package of thermal grease or thermal
compound and allen key two different
size allen keys and all of your
installation screws it's a nice soft
foam to protect your investment and of
course the block itself now the
instructions here are a full page with
all of the parts itemized out they
actually tell you all the different
thermal pads you get as well as the
color of the thermal pad here on the
manual corresponds with the different
baggies that you have here and you have
nice full-color illustration here in
multiple languages showing you
step-by-step how to install the block
now we're not going to actually be
installing this block on a card today
because the 1970 g1 gaming I have is
already being utilized in the Parvin
build but that's okay that's not going
to stop us from showing you how all the
rest of this works out and all the other
information here is all warranty type
stuff and again you have multiple
languages here it's in English it's in
German and it is in
what is that French food that's French
so here is the back plate right here
which is included with the block which
that's nice to see because normally you
would have to buy this separate and
that's really annoying so you can see
we've got the Alpha cool logo etched
right into there and it is facing the
right way so this is where your power
connectors go and there are the cutouts
for your SLI fingers and raised
standoffs for all of the screws now when
it comes to the water block we have the
same grade of aluminum and we do have
each block custom made specifically for
the graphics card that it is being
installed in so now we have to do the
ceremonious removal of the plastic ah
now as you can see we have cutouts here
for all the different capacitors and
things but we do have raised portions on
here that are going to be touching very
specific very strategic points on the
graphics card so this is obviously going
to be touching memory right here this is
going to be touching more than likely
VRMs back here and this is going to be
touching some maybe some more VRMs there
and if the 970 had Ram on the back I
don't recall if it did I'd probably have
raised portions on there as well
but obviously the only part that is
getting active cooling on this from the
block is the GPU itself now this core
right here this is very very similar to
and I'm calling a core I don't know
exactly what they call it this is very
very similar to what they sell
independently that you could use as a
universal graphics card cooler where it
will just mount onto the GPU and then
you have to stick on little heat sinks
on all the Rams and VRMs and things to
keep it cool well what they've done is
they've manufactured the part that
everything mounts into for instance this
part you know the GPU cooler mounts into
this plate and the plate is manufactured
to meet your graphics card
specifications and layout so they have
one part that goes into the middle
that's universal and then what's
different is the actual we'll just call
it a cage it's pretty heavy-duty
actually now this thing also acts as a
giant heatsink so all of these fins here
as you can see they're going to take the
heat they're going to draw it away from
the components and
airflow is going to provide cooling to
VRMs and the RAM as well so it would
have been nice to see it be a full cover
block but then it would have been much
more expensive and it would have been
much more difficult to manufacture this
in a way that would give you more
universal support so when you go ahead
and you sandwich this together the way
that it actually is meant to be
installed it ends up looking pretty much
just like that so as you can see it's a
very aesthetically pleasing block now
when I first was given information about
this block and preliminary samples all
of the logos were blue so I'm really
happy to see that these are a nice just
sort of a gray edged color maybe
slightly white because it's going to
look much better in many more builds but
you have nice high-quality metal here
very weighty the only blue that you can
see right here is in the middle of the
GPU block itself which also has a little
bit of a flow indicator built in there
you can't really see it moving but it
does have a flow indicator in there
which will turn as fluid is going
through there so that's very nice to see
it just feels like alpha cool has really
thought out and done a lot of effort on
this block the only downside to it is
the amount of metal that is on here even
though it's a lighter weight metal
aluminum compared to you know copper
it's pretty heavy so you're going to
want to keep this in mind when you're
installing this on your card and we want
to make sure that GPU sag is not going
to be something that you'll be dealing
with now when it comes to this block
some folks might feel that it's not
worth it because of the fact that it
doesn't have active cooling for the vr
amps and the RAM itself but that really
isn't the case or it's not going to be
something that's that big of a deal
unless you're doing high overclock sand
by high overclocks I don't mean pushing
the slider all the way to the right in
afterburner or precision or whatever
you're using I mean doing unlocked
voltage hacked type overclocks then the
vrm temperatures might be a little bit
of a big deal but this is going to give
you better cooling than any vrm cooling
you're currently getting on your
graphics card because most manufacturers
are not actually providing vrm cooling
in fact we've seen that some graphics
card manufacturers are not providing n
sort of real vrm cooling now we're going
to go ahead and drop a screw will grab
my r9 290x matrix Platinum here now I've
used this card as an example before but
the vrm cooler in this thing is just a
tiny strip of billet aluminum that's got
a little bit of heatsink built into it
and that's it
there is absolutely no RAM cooling on
this thing the only thing getting any
sort of active cooling is the GPU core
itself and then some of the air that's
going to push down through the fins as
touching this little vrm heatsink but
what I have found on this card
specifically in this to be the case on a
lot of different graphics cards not just
this 290x matrix platinum is the fact
that over time the vrm starts to get
hotter and hotter and hotter and then
you get artifacts and instability
because of vrm temperatures exceeding
safe limits even with stock overclocks
now what I mean by stock overclocks is
again anything that is officially
supported in MSI Afterburner but because
this card is officially an unlocked card
you can push the thing past stability
it's kind of the nature of the card so
having a nice huge chunk of metal like
this assisting in the 80 or aiding in
the cooling aspect of the VRMs as well
as the the vram beer I'm using it to hot
that's not really that big of a deal
this is going to be beneficial
especially on a behemoth like this that
really is known for pushing VRMs to the
limit so there you go guys a lot of
people are actually using this I know
some people are going to be upset that I
didn't install it and do a full test to
see how low temperatures are like but I
just wanted to kind of give you guys an
overview of the block and tell you that
it's definitely something worth
considering it's not as expensive a lot
a lot of the full cover nickel plated or
copper water blocks which have
additional cost for the back plates I
love the fact that alpha cool has
included this very high quality very
well machined and very uniform and
high-end anodizing on this thing the
anodizing on this looks fantastic
so it's definitely something to consider
if you're looking to get into water
cooling on a budget and it's going to be
beneficial for your graphics card anyway
so there you go guys tasty sense hope
you guys have learned something with
today's video if you're using one of
these GPU blocks make sure you
speak up down in the comments so that
other people can learn from your
experiences tell us what you think about
it and as always guys follow on social
media or any of that stuff the community
forums or whatever Jase do sense comm if
you guys just want to kind of chat and
just have more discussion about today's
video but besides that
as always guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one hey what's
going on Jays $0.02 here and we're back
with another tech video just like I
promised in the last bike video thing we
just did and the J always pays his debts
sorry I've been watching a lot of Game
of Thrones lately it's really getting
addictive I just started watching it may
