sins and I hear it almost every single
day with people asking what they should
buy for their brand-new computers or
when they're upgrading and they want to
know if solid states are worth the price
are they really that much better than
hard drives do they perform are they
fast and are they worth the price and
today that's exactly what we're gonna
find out okay guys this is gonna be a
really quick and easy video because when
it comes to solid state versus the
mechanical drive this is definitely a
no-brainer with the cost of solid-state
drives really dropping over the last
year so you should really consider
dropping a solid-state drive as your
main operating system drive in your
computer at the very least you could get
a 64 gigabyte SSD for less than 100
bucks but your operating system on it
which will dramatically improve the
performance of your computer but you can
do it like I did you can get a 128
gigabytes solid-state drive and put your
operating system on it
a couple of your favorite programs that
you use on a regular basis or maybe a
game that you want to load faster you
just have to know right off the bat that
having a solid-state drive is not going
to increase your gaming performance
inside of a game what is gonna happen is
things that have to load in the game or
loading the game are going to load
faster do not expect any sort of frames
per second increase when you put a
solid-state drive in your computer when
it comes to gaming so what I did for
this test here that took three different
types of drives I took a 5400 rpm
two-and-a-half inch laptop drive which
is a SATA 3 I took a Western Digital
caviar black one terabyte 7200 rpm SATA
6 hard drive and my crucial m4 128
gigabyte SSD and I put these three
head-to-head in a hard disk benchmark
program called what was it calling it
crystal disk called crystal disk where
it does a read/write test on the drives
and it does several different things and
it tells you the performance of your
hard drive so first up here we have my
5400 rpm two-and-a-half inch laptop
drive and is a three gigabit per second
drive I don't even remember the brand I
think it's a Toshiba
but look at the read/write speeds here
it's reading at only 62 megabytes per
second and writing at 59 megabytes per
second
this is pretty old people what's
happening is as the RPM is spinning or
the hard drive is spinning it's only
spinning at 5,400 revolutions per minute
which means there's less data going past
a needle so it can't read nearly as fast
and coming up second here we have my
7200 rpm caviar black one terabyte six
gigabit per second Western Digital whoo
hard drive that's showing you double the
performance of the two and a half inch
three gigabit 5400 rpm
notebook drive but you're definitely
seeing an improvement here with double
the bandwidth at 6 gigabits per second
versus 3 gigabits and we're writing at
117 megabytes per second and we're
reading at 120 megabytes per second
that's a great increase this is a very
good Drive the caviar black is highly
recommended but you know if you're on
earth if you're on a mechanical Drive
you're gonna notice some programs open
up kind of slow and there's nothing
really you're gonna hear that drive
ticking away and so we get into the
solid state the changes are definitely
noticeable right off the bat the crucial
m4 is a couple of years old and it's not
a brand new solid state so I want to go
ahead and preface this benchmark by
telling you that there are much faster
SSDs out on the market but then again
they're gonna cost you a lot more you
can get 128 crucial em for that I have
for a little bit over a hundred bucks
now sometimes a little bit less if you
shop around but look at these speeds
compare these to the other two you're
getting 201 megabytes per second right
speed and 512 megabytes per second read
speed that is incredibly fast and what
does that mean anything that's loaded on
your SSD whether it be your operating
system a game a program the difference
is night and day
windows on the system boots in about 15
seconds it's extremely fast and when it
comes to the dropping prices of SSDs
there's absolutely no reason why you
shouldn't seriously consider putting a
solid-state drive in a brand new build
or an upgrade it's definitely worth and
just showing you a bit of a speed test
here I put a stopwatch up on the screen
I did a screen capture wiggling around
so you can see there's no shenanigans no
speeding up of the video and loading up
Adobe After Effects here with all of its
plugins and all of its add-ons
and only a few seconds on that
solid-state drive don't forget a Dobby
Photoshop one of the things that takes a
flawless to load sometimes as Photoshop
again opened and only a few seconds no
shenanigans there it is
thanks for watching today's video guys
it's been Jase 2 cents trying to educate
you a little bit more in pcs and empower
you to make the right decisions when it
comes to building or buying your next PC
