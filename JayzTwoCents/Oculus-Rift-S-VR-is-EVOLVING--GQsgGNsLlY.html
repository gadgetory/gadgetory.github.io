descends here we're gonna be taking a
look at the latest improvement to the
oculus family this being the oculus rift
s so there's two improvements already to
the oculus rift s that I'm excited to
take a look at and you might notice
there are no sensors in this because
this uses inside-out tracking or
basically the headset is tracking its
own movement and communicating that back
to the computer but I use virtual
reality for the immersion in realism
when it comes to simulators being either
flying or driving mostly driving but
flying is something I've enjoyed doing
as well now the original unit was using
an OLED pentile which was 1080 by 1200
resolution in a portrait mode per eye
this is actually using an RGB LCD and it
has a resolution of 1280 by 1400 so
we've got a greater resolution and a
different display type that coupled with
the lens improvements means like I said
less godrays and hopefully less screen
door effect you've got cameras on the
front on the sides and on the top and
that is so that why you're wearing this
it can track it wherever it goes because
again the headset is responsible for all
of the tracking now not only of the hmd
itself but the hand controls now the
oculus rift connected to your computer
via HDMI cable and a USB 3.0 this is
very very similar although now because
of the higher resolution we are using a
full-size DisplayPort and USB 3.0 and
these are the only connections these are
the only connections you don't have to
go to in a sort of a breakout box you
not to go to any sort of cameras oh and
check this out if you don't have a full
side or if you don't have a full size
DisplayPort adapter on your laptop or
your computer or your graphics card they
do include a mini DisplayPort adapter so
that's kind of nice to see so all the
oculus software is downloading for
first-time set up I want to talk about
how the fitment of this kind of works so
you have a single velcro strap on the
top which supports the weight obviously
and then you have a knob on the back
which supports or adjust the inside-out
so as you can see you could have a
pretty big head
so fit this like Phil might even be able
to actually wear this but I digress the
actual padding on here feels very thick
it feels very much like a memory foam
the fabric is very soft it's not coarse
like some of the you know if you wear an
HM B that has kind of a coarse padding
on there it starts to feel scratchy and
itchy over time so if you're not using
headphones with this these are the
speakers right here they're right above
your ears so they're gonna down fire
right to your ear but again like I said
you're not isolated from the ambient
environment so you if you're playing
like some sort of a scary game or some
sort of a horror game like let's say
chair in a room or something like that
which is very ambient based where it's a
the ambience is just as scary as the
game itself then you would lose some of
that effect by being able to hear the
ambient sounds around you so I would
recommend probably using headphones with
this or at least try it and see what you
prefer but for today's testing we're
just going to be using
I think straight up speakers
whoa okay whoa hi Phil so I can go here
like check out my boat CS my boat that's
correct
whoo okay get down into there
okay the tracking on this is really
actually good the sound is a little
lacking and as you'd expect given the
speaker size so I would certainly
recommend your own headphones which at
least plug right into the side my hands
are on the wrong hands it's extremely
obvious that there is a resolution
increase okay could you imagine a VR
experience where you could like hold and
play with like the latest and like deep
UTech and all that use big WOW so this
is the 20 ATT oh yeah that would be so
cool huh does it always do that so I'm
gonna say this right now like flying in
VR it'll ruin you you'll never go back
to a panel again ever because you know
what you can't do with a panel you can't
do that sure there were there was
tracking stuff that you could buy back
in the day but what you also don't get
with panels is sense of depth you just
you don't get depth and so I mean I'm
turning right now I can see I can see my
relative position to the runway see that
I you just you can't do that with panels
okay I'm gonna try something I would
never try this with a screen
what I didn't even touch it to do that
so after spending the last couple hours
playing around on this I can I can tell
you for sure
that the resolution is definitely
sharper that alone was one of the
quickest ways to take yourself out of
the immersion effect in VR is trying to
read text if you're sitting there flying
an aircraft like we were just doing or
you're doing assetto corsa iRacing or
project cars like I typically do reading
the dash and the gauges or driving a gt3
car trying to read any of the digital
display was near impossible because it
was just too pixelated and the closer
you got to it the more pixelated it sort
of appeared you made it bigger but of
course you could still see all the
jagged edges and stuff and the screen
door effect was really really bad now
although we only stepped up from 1080 by
1200 to 1280 by 1440 we saw a massive
difference in terms of sharpness and
with text now Phil tried this out for a
bit too and he the first thing you said
was like oh my god I can read the text
that's the first the first thing to tell
to tell you that the resolution on this
is extremely what's not even extremely
higher it's just it's perceived that way
yeah it's definitely the lenses the
flying around in the and and seeing the
Sun of the corner of your eye didn't
cause a glare across all of the lenses
the headsets definitely lightweight and
after about an hour of me wearing it and
screwing around as you guys saw and
doing the setup and doing the flight sim
and playing around I didn't I didn't
feel any sort of neck fatigue and I
think part of that is because of the
angle that have this sitting on your
head now I kind of wish that there was a
clip on the back as well for the cable
one of the things I noticed when I was
moving around was that this hanging off
to the side of me with the PC being off
to my front left was kind of a problem
and this is just a little clip doohickey
they have sitting right here on the on
the strap I feel like they should have
added another one back here that way you
could just sort of get it out of the way
and keep it behind you that's not that's
not even something that you couldn't
make yourself it just would have been
nice
to have it included the controllers are
nice they they have the same basic
functionality as the originals but the
first thing I did when I put it on is I
had them kind of going the wrong way
the hoop is in a completely different
location from the original oculus rift
so this is about being a more optimal
view for the cameras and the tracking of
the hmd rather than comfort yeah what
else is there to say I mean inside out
tracking is is definitely gonna be a
step forward because one of the things
that made it just cumbersome and kind of
a put off to new people when it comes to
VR although it's becoming a lot more
affordable was the setup and the setup
on this was extremely simple plugged in
the headset DisplayPort cable plugged in
the USB and downloaded the oculus home
software and it guides you 100% from
start to finish so that's kind of the
name of the game here with ease of use
but not only ease of use there was
obviously an evolutionary upgrade in
terms of lens quality the display and
although we went from an OLED to an LCD
I didn't notice any difference in terms
of blotchy blacks or anything like that
there was no sort of ghosting when you
moved your head the frame rate although
we went from 90 down to 80 did it I
didn't notice it to be honest as long as
you can keep a consistent frame rate
then the 80 Hertz is obviously not gonna
be a problem another thing I would have
loved to have seen though would have
been the retention of the actual headset
built-in but I think it makes sense as
to why they did that I think that oculus
knows that a lot of people will prefer
to use our own headset so they give you
a like I showed out earlier or showed
you earlier a plug on the side of the
hmd so you can use your own and you have
a built-in ambient speaker system which
gets the job done if you just want to go
in there and kind of mess around to be
not to worry about you know plugging in
headphones and all that sort of stuff
so that's it guys that's our look here
at the oculus rift s a definite
improvement over the standard oculus
rift and one that I I'm gonna have to go
now and go home and set this up because
I cannot wait to test this out with
project cars so are you guys in the VR
if so headsets do you guys like to use
and what games do you recommend that we
try out because vr gaming I guess I'm
probably gonna lose this units my
daughter my
is obsessed with VR she nags me about it
every single day constantly wanting to
play she likes to play games like I said
uh job simulator baby hands and all that
sort of stuff so alright guys I'm gonna
let you go tell me what you think down
the comments below and as always we will
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
