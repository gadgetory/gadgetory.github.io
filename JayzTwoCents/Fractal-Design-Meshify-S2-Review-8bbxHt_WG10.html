since I've done an actual case review
like a standalone case review now I'll
be honest I don't do it as good as
Hardware canucks
those guys are the case review kings of
YouTube but I'm gonna do it my way and
you guys are going to ask me to do like
case reviews again so I figured we'd
kick that off here with the new ish mesh
if is too from fractal design this came
out last month technically better late
than never so we're going to open this
up see what it's all about see what kind
of components you can fit in here what's
different and all of that junk so you
want to get a degree in technology but
you don't know where to start well Full
Sail University offers bachelor's and
master's degrees that are not only
accredited but are also hands on so you
can familiarize yourself with the same
tools and technologies used by industry
professionals with degrees such as
mobile development cloud technologies
and simulation and visualization there
are a variety of degree programs offered
to help you build a very specific
skillset campus classrooms are
professional environments that reflect
the studio's boardrooms and workspaces
used within the industry we all know the
technology industry changes quickly and
full sales programs are designed to flex
as new methods and applications unfold
each degree is designed to prepare you
for a specific role in the industry to
learn more about full sales programs and
potential scholarship opportunities head
to Full Sail edu alright so fractal
design they're kind of like the king of
black squares I guess if you will if
that makes sense let me explain the
fractal design has a very specific
aesthetic that they've always kind of
been known for and they haven't really
deviated from that so as I come out with
new cases there's been a lot of scrutiny
from both public and other reviewers
about it just being an iteration of the
same box that's always existed and I
guess depending on your perspective ah
whoa I forgot about how shocking there's
actually an old video of me showing how
bad you get all right there
oh it arced like all the way back here
but as I was saying before I was rudely
interrupted by static electricity is
that depending on your perspective and a
very subjective opinion obviously in
terms of aesthetics that could be a good
thing or a bad thing I think what
happens sometimes
companies really established themselves
and they kind of create this sort of a
safety net that they like to stay within
they don't like to venture too far out
from that which then means every time
they come out with a new case some
people might just kind of like
collectively groan like oh it's just
kind of more of the same but at least
fractal in my opinion is making very
good efforts in making it different
enough to feel like a different chassis
although to be based on very similar
designs that already exists in this case
with the mesh apply s2 in terms of
dimensions and what you can fit in it
and all that it's very very similar to
an r6 now obviously this is a mesh if I
and it's the biggest mesh if I they've
made the mesh if I see which was
actually very popular and I have one
down here so this is the original mesh
if I this is the mesh if I s2 as you can
see the height nearly identical the
width pretty much the same but if you
look at the overall dimensions you can
definitely fit a lot more where the mesh
if I see sort of and I believe see the
stands for compact to be honest I could
be wrong but that's what I kind of
always in my head remembered like okay
see compact smaller mid-tower still a
mid Tower but obviously deeper because
on this he were really limited to the
amount of graphics card you could put it
here in terms of length with a lot of
new graphics cards on the market for
instance this is a r-tx 280 you can see
20 80 to 80 whatever does anyone really
care so I mean if you look at the
overall length of it you can see I mean
that's pretty massive and that would
take up a lot of space on the front
meaning you couldn't put in you know
radiators on the front and stuff which
you can obviously in the Mesha 5 if you
want to so that's why this is kind of
like one that they just sort of yeah and
yeah well and this is what you get in
terms of connectivity pre-installed as a
USB type-c headphone microphone jack
reset button power button into USB 3.0
so that's already kind of an improvement
over when the r6 launched because the
USB type-c panel was an add-on or we had
to buy the type C version so this is
kind of nice
so the tempered glass side panel is
connected to a metal frame it's not just
the glass with its own nubs that are
like kind of glued to it you've got
these little kind of ball nipples it's
gonna say ball nipple anyway that just
sort of clips in right here you also do
have two thumb screws on it so you can
secure it if you want to
nicholae don't need to that's just on
there for transportation but once that
pops in I mean that's not really going
anywhere but for peace of mind you can
screw it down so in terms of the insides
here it's all black internals which i
think looks fantastic you've got the
wall back here that you can mount
reservoirs to black fan on the back
that's a 140 millimeter to these 140 s
on the front yes to 140 s on the front
so you got three fans that are included
this little plate right here removed so
you can actually install a long 360 rad
on the front or a 420 but what I like
here is the fact that we have black fans
with the white case because what kind of
happens with like the r6 and stuff is
it's also a white interior white
exterior white interior with white fans
but I love this stormtrooper look on the
top you still have the single mod you
vent that pops up very similar to the r6
but as you can see it's all mesh so
rather than being a solid panel on the
top you have a mesh panel that allows a
lot of air flow with the filter built
into that so you can wash this filter
out it's all one piece let it dry stick
it back in there very similar to the r6
this top panel comes off in fact it is
the exact same pieces the r6 if I'm not
mistaken so you can mount your fans and
your radiator to this and then drop this
in as a whole making a lot easier to
work on or you can take this out while
you're installing your motherboard and
your fan headers and your power pins and
go for your EPS power making it
obviously a lot easier to get to to work
on and then on the back of the case as
you can see right here very standard
down for fractal you get the fan
controller which plugs into a PWM
control so you could plug this into like
your CPU PWM header control all these
fans off of one of it our one fan header
you've got three PWM controlled fans and
then you've got 6 DC controlled fans so
very expandable without having to worry
about whether or not you have enough
headers on your motherboard now rather
than having a button on the front I like
intelligent fans I'd be able to speed
them up and slow them down with software
and load and other things you can have
silent and optimized in terms of
performance so instead of having a
physical switch which fractal has had in
the past we have like a low medium high
you just use a PWM on your motherboard
and then once again you have your three
three and a half inch drive bays back
here which you can install either
full-size hard drives or SSDs or to any
two-and-a-half inch device so whether it
be hard drive SSD or something like an
NZXT hue fan controller additionally
3.00 whatever if it's a two and a half
inch or a three and a half inch you can
mount it to that two more SSDs that
amount right here but you could also
relocate these to the front right here
so again very standard fractal design
designs
there's no pun there fractal design
design and modularity now the other nice
thing about fractal cases is they have
wire management sort of built in and
rather than just having little plastic
clip downs which they used to have in
the past I feel a little clip that like
would close now you have these velcro
straps plenty of pass-through of
grommets you obviously have some pass
throughs right here they're optimally
placed so that they line up with where
you'd want them to be a 24-pin USB 3.0
SATA connectors right here would be for
your front panel and USB and stuff like
that
plenty of room down here for a long pair
supply an area to hide your cables away
and there's not really a whole lot to
talk about in terms of wire management
other than its built in and it's not an
afterthought like some cases now one of
the things that's kind of nice about the
latest round of fractal cases and my
latest round I mean within the last two
years or so is there support for ei TX
it's not gonna fit this guy that's just
not fair
so I mean it does support ei TX not what
the TX like this one is right here
but as you can see it comfortably fits
ei TX without covering up all of the
grommets and stuff I mean it's still
gonna be it's nug --is-- you can see the
grommets still are accessible but it
would probably be smart to route your
wires through here first and then put
your motherboard in because of the fact
that it is going to interfere in there
slightly but it's lined up there so you
can get the cables through here but you
would have never fit this in like the r5
you can see you can also fit your extra
long graphics cards like this Strix 2080
right here and stuff plenty of room for
front fans radiator and even a reservoir
mounted right here
if you've ever water-cooled in a define
s2 then you'll know that that you know
that water cooling is definitely one of
the main design elements there now also
too I forgot to mention the top piece as
you can see the radiator is not centered
on that and the reason for that and this
is something that had for a long time in
their case design but I still get people
asking me where on a regular basis about
water cooling is because it's offset and
offset away from the motherboard it
means that once this panel is inside
here you can see that it pushes the
radiator away from the motherboard so it
won't interfere with heat sinks and
stuff which is typically what happens
because the heat sinks get taller on
motherboards as vrm and overclocking
gets improved those sit taller which
means interference with radiators are
mounted up top but when it's offset like
this it gives you much better chance of
it not interfering so basically at the
end of the day what you have right here
is a very mesh if I inspired and high
airflow inspired define s2 now I know
that that's the last thing fractal once
is a case of there's to be compared to
another case but in my opinion this is
something that the audience has been
asking for I've seen lots of people
asking for a larger mesh if I see the
mesh if I see was a hugely popular case
from fractal design so given you a
larger chassis like this to fit more
water cooling in at a price point that I
think is still fairly aggressive and
sense in the terms of being price to
feature set makes it an obvious choice
if you're thinking about doing water
cooling and want a nice clean aesthetic
now whether or not you care about the
angles like this because depending how
you look at it almost look like been
like it's bent or dented but it's also a
very abstract design which kind of
breaks up some of the monotony of the 90
degree angles everywhere because fractal
like I said has not deviated from the
rectangle shape very much over the years
they've gotten a little bit more
aggressive with some of the angles but
now you've got tempered glass side
panels water cooling friendly EA TX
friendly air flow friendly because all
mesh front all mesh top speaking of
airflow you also have an entirely open
bottom of the chassis so you can even
put a radiator down there if you wanted
and have it being an updraft through the
case if you didn't need a very big power
supply or you go with one of the shorter
like you know thousand watt power
supplies so anyway this is where you
guys basically sound off on how you feel
about a case like this I have not done a
case review in quite a long time and
whereas this is a little bit more of an
overview because until you start
building in a chassis you can't really
determine where its shortcomings are I
don't necessarily need to build in this
one to determine that because like I
said internally it's very very similar
to the S to the defined s 2 and the R 6
which I've already built custom hard two
bends in there I'll put a link in the
description below to a couple of
different builds that we've done in
those chassis z' over the last year year
and a half or so so you can sort of get
an idea of what
like to when it's done so I might do a
custom build in this we'll just have to
see though I don't have any need to
build another system at the moment I've
got several builds going on I don't want
to over inundate myself with projects
and then you guys complain that they
don't get done or they're taking too
long or they're multi-part errs so you
guys sound awful oh and what you want to
see I love stormtrooper looks and I
think that fractals really nailed it
with this one if you want a water
cooling friendly airflow friendly larger
chassis that still has to take up a lot
of room on your desk and isn't the
massive like super Tower then this is
probably worth looking at alright guys
thanks for watching tell us what you
think about this case and more
importantly fractal tell them what you
think about this case because they'll
probably looking at the comments alright
guys we'll see you the next one campus
clout sounds like a dolly it's happening
I knew this day was gonna come
I knew they were gonna break in here I
just didn't know how there's a random
guy that I seriously want to open this
on camera be like suck I would love
there to be a little random body like
dude so you wanted to get it do you get
too familiar son
oh very right there are very the
verities breakfast yeah look at me I'm
wasting away to nothing
there are a variety of degree campus
classroom
classrooms maybe the classrooms my man
boobs are from almost an a cup from a be
cup and simulation and seemingly is
taken and their and they're off doing
optimally opt in the mo up EAB EE be for
extra extra big vision visual simulation
and simulation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
