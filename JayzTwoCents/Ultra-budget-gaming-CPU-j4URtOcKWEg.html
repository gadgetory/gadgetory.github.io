to talk quickly because we've got a fire
extinguisher alarm thingy that's going
bad way up there like way up there we
can't reach it and it's beeping on me
like constantly so if you guys hear a
beep
at some point throughout this video and
it's like what does that beeping sound I
sincerely apologize would called
maintenance they're slow and we've got
work to do
so yeah let's do it you guys have
probably heard by now obviously that
Ryze m3 has launched and I said publicly
many times that this is the chip series
that I have been most excited for
because this is going to replace the
entry cost point for gamers especially
those that are currently stuck on the FX
platform and this is going to offer you
some seriously increased performance
well without really costing any more
money so what we have right here is the
rise I've got two new rising SKUs here
from AMD the rise in three 1300 x and
the rise in three 1200 now the 1200 has
a base clock of 3.1 and a turbo clock of
3.4 where the 13 X has a 3.5 base clock
with a 3.7 beat the clock yeah so it's
essentially the difference between the
two there's a $20 difference between
both of them but both of them are
unlocked and overclockable and these
guys right here are basically competing
directly with Intel's a3 lineup
specifically the 70 170 300 now you're
not going to see this build today we are
going to be doing I three stuff I
ordered some parts they came in we'll be
doing some direct comparisons so I
figure will be due today is we just
throw together some lower end computer
parts and see what type of gaming
performance we can get now that we have
much better CPUs at the same price point
that FX was technically yesterday this
is not an official build log or build
guide the parts here are not necessarily
the most optimized that they are you
know lower end spectrum so these are
mostly parts of head laying around a
couple of things I picked up so if they
seem kind of an odd match that's going
to be Y now the fractal design focus G
it's about 59 bucks here at us it's got
a window on and some LED fans it's
pretty cool I have another fan I'm
adding to it right here for an exhaust
fan I'm going to go to 1200 because I
really want to know what the baseline
performance is going to be for those
adopting Rison 3
right now at this current time so we
will see what kind of overclocking we
can get on this to with the built-in
cooler we're gonna be hooking up to our
be 350 tomahawk it's an MSI motherboard
there is me a little bit of overclocking
available on this now for the power
supply what was the EVGA 550 B 3 it's a
beta plus bronze actually use this in a
friends of mine a friend of Mines PC
seem to be working pretty well it's
fully modular and it's not that
expensive come in at about 59 bucks
graphics card I was really torn on this
because the problem is the graphics card
market right now it's flipped completely
upside down because of cryptocurrency
mining once again you can get them for
about 270 dollars depending on which
model you get I prefer the six gig
version which is what we have right here
this is actually the founders card I
would stay away from the three gig
version honestly six gigs is going to be
better for today's games a little bit
longer future longevity I wanted to go
with an AMD cards but they're still so
upside down in pricing I just decided to
go with a 1060 now for memory and we
pick this up today we actually ran down
to Fry's Electronics this morning we
picked this up it specific sun memory
I've never heard of it I don't even know
if it's going to work with Verizon we're
going to try it out its ddr4 it's 2 4
gigabytes sticks they're blacks that's
cool there's no heat spreader or
anything on them even looking up online
information about this brand we couldn't
find out a whole lot so I don't even
know if it's going to work with Verizon
we'll see what happens now you might
have noticed we don't have any storage
on the table that's because I'm actually
cloning the drive upstairs right now
from our other Rison rig so we can be up
and running pretty quickly but I went
with something I've not done before on
this channel and we went with an ssh d
it's a barracuda fire cuda drive and
it's a 1 terabyte so we're looking for
better performance than a hard drive but
not have as much expensive an SSD but
more capacity we'll put that in when
when it's all done cloning so what do
you say we build this thing I think it
just finished actually if you do that
I
you
all right so obviously a jarring jump
cut we are a couple weeks past when we
started making this video because we put
this video on hold and fortunately when
my father passed away and we got a
chance to come back to this now and I'm
more excited about Rison 3 I think
then thread Ripper because since we
started this video thread Ripper was
officially announced we went to the
event we've got our hands on thread
Ripper I failed at unboxing it but here
we are now talking about rise in 3 again
because honestly I'm more excited about
this lineup that I am thread Ripper
right now because this is obtainable by
more people it's got an amazing entry
cost about $109 for this 1200 which we
currently have in there right now and
this thing is a little beast let me tell
you not Vincent sittin you're thinking
about this and especially over the last
week or so when I'm going I need to
finish this video and I'm wondering who
does this processor really speak to and
to me it speaks to quite a few people
obviously it's people on a budget right
because this whole rig as you see right
here we changed one thing since we
started this video we put in an SSD the
only difference between a hard drive and
SSD is load times performance usually
doesn't differ but this whole rig can be
had for about $800 including the SSD or
about $700 with a hard drive so that is
an amazing price point given what you
actually get for your money I mean we've
got heaven right here running in the 80s
PS range temperatures are staying pretty
cool this is a GTX 1060 on Instagram
some folks that I put a 1080 or 1070 in
there I think that would be unbalanced
this is a 1060 and we spent minimal
amount of money on the chassis or the
cooling that's a stock cooler on here
and this chip is overclocked to 3.8
gigahertz you're getting a massive value
with the parts that are in here right
now now you can get some pretty amazing
gaming performance I mean most games are
staying well above 60 fps and usually
the only thing holding you back at this
point is going to be the GPU not the CPU
although I want to point out there was a
there was a couple of times when we
actually saw 100% peak CPU usage but the
GPU usage still stayed at 99% typically
if you see the CPU peg like that you'll
notice usage of the GPU drop down
indicating that there is indeed some
sort of a hardware bottleneck there when
it
so the CPU but that didn't happen here
we saw the CPU get up in the mid-90s and
like I said even a hundred percent and
the GPU still stayed at 99% usage so
we're still good there but you know it's
one of the things where again it depends
on the title itself we've got four cores
in here and so some titles are going to
definitely want more threads because of
rendering large worlds and stuff like
that so you've got to kind of balance it
out based on the type of games you play
or dial back your settings or your draw
distances and things like that to try
and offload some of that load on the CPU
again for $109 you're going to be
hard-pressed to find a better value
especially when just a few months ago
that are just a couple weeks ago
actually that's what the AMD FX
processors were costing and you're
getting so much more performance out of
this little guy then even something like
an 80 350 from the FX series what six
years ago what I'm really impressed with
though is the temperatures to be honest
with you because even with this
overclock the 3.8 gigahertz even running
stress test a 264 Cinebench we're seeing
temperatures stay right around 58 C
again
stock cooler I didn't put the Wraith
cool or anything that's available on the
market in here this is the cooler that
came with the chip for a hundred and
nine bucks so that is an amazing value
now the rise entry lineup to me really
speaks to people who are looking at
building an entry level gaming PC and
still want good performance I think
you're getting better than entry level
performance honestly if you ask me all
the testing we did here was with
settings that you know high but I think
it also speaks to people looking at
building a system for going back to
school I mean face it right you try and
talk your parents into buying you a
computer because it's for schoolwork but
you know really you're just going to
play games on it so why not at least get
good performance from it and it's easier
to talk your parents into a seven or
eight hundred dollar PC then it's than
it is talking them into a fifteen
hundred or two thousand dollar piece I
think they'll see right through that one
it's not for school but it's also
capable of taking on professional
workflow very similar to an i5 would
when it comes to things like premiere
now having more threads would help but
for threads running at 3.8 gigahertz is
definitely going to chug through your
video footage if you want to start doing
some rendering or making your own videos
live streaming not as much you're going
to need more horse
power for that but you can get yourself
something like a capture card like we
did here and that's how you saw the game
footage that we had and you can offload
that on to another system or record that
way and then you can upload your game
footage you not have to do live
streaming if you don't want to but again
the 1200 and 1300 X would have a harder
time with live streaming so anyway that
guy's sorry about the delay on my rise
in three coverage the Red River stuff is
coming I promise everything got pushed
back my whole timeline got screwed over
the last couple weeks and I appreciate
your guys's patience through all of that
and I've got a trip coming up next week
that's going to push things back even
farther but trust me the weight is worth
it thanks for watching guys sound off in
the comments tell me what you think
about risin 3 it's fine there's a lot of
conversation about rise in lately and
the fanboys are coming out on both sides
man I'm telling you right now you've got
the Intel fanboys you got the AMD
fanboys and it looks like a lot like the
the alley fight scene in anchorman I
mean it's getting ugly out there but in
a good way right it's ugly because we
have competition now which is absolutely
great check it out guys tell me you guys
think thumbs up if you like the video
subscribe if you're not already
subscribed and abilities I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
