lift you up
or in this case get sucked into a
ventilation shaft
good job dice now I'm gonna be honest
with y'all I tried to put together just
a simple guys here the bugs that I found
when it comes to battlefield 4 and I
wanted to be mad about it I wanted to
rage about it I wanted to break
something but you know what guys by the
end of all of this it was just so damn
funny that I thought there was nothing
more appropriate than just putting
together some sort of a little troll
video because let's face it that's what
dice did us I loved battlefield 3 I
loved all the previous battlefields in
battlefield 4 now is just like well
we've got all your money
hahaha we don't have to make you a game
that actually works that mean come on
look at SimCity yay Obama so after I had
the helicopter land on my head I thought
it would be fun to jump in the little
boat and maybe blow up some noobs and
stuff but no I had to hear this horrible
pop aah pop aah pop aah pop aah pop
sound what the fuck is this
ok I get it I get it it's a sound glitch
ok bugs happen but how do you explain
this one here I'm just riding along on
the boat getting ready to take on this
boat waiting for us to turn over there
without touching a damn thing on the
keyboard oh look at that I spawned to
see you out of my butthole
explain that one to me which I didn't
touch anything Elroy's see you okay in
this next clip I really hope that you're
not partial to epileptic seizures
because battlefield 4 is quite likely to
put you in the emergency room here we
are just driving along in a tank doing
our thing getting hit by a rocket and
check out the light show oh yeah now in
this next clip we're going to take a
look at something that's actually been
around since a lot earlier versions of
battlefield 3 which really begs the
question why is it still a bug if
they've known about it for the last four
generations of the game as you can see
right there we just collided he's going
down in a ball of flames and I am at a
hundred percent health I have the
toughest little bird in all of history
until I got ran into by jet and then got
given epileptic seizure
again now I love tanks like I really
really love tanks but you know what's
really important when you're driving
that tank is when you can actually hear
the tank yeah
apparently we have hybrid tank
electric-powered we hear when
environmentally friendly people we're
going green check it out
once again yep no engine in this bad boy
now problem number two is in battlefield
3 they had ridiculously huge tracer
rounds so in battlefield 4 they fixed
that problem by making invisible bullets
check it out how in the hell are you
supposed to see what you hitting when
the tracer rounds start non-existent
check it out where's the bollocks
perhaps I'm shooting blanks but then
again I wouldn't have a kid if that were
true either would it well I guess you
just have to guess where the bullet drop
is actually landing there used to be
little tracer round but at some point
during this match they completely
disappeared now this next clip you guys
already saw in the beginning of this
video but it warrants taking a second
look apparently in the world of
battlefield 4 gravity does not seem to
exist as we know it today or maybe there
was a giant tentacle creature pulling
him up there I particularly like how the
guy who killed him took two looks at
that and said fuck this I'm out of here
this is just a small sample of things I
was able to capture and only about a 10
to 15 minute period of time that I had
my recorder actually running and I was
able to catch all this funky shit here
with battlefield 4 we've learned
anything here tonight guys please let it
be stop ordering games from EA stop
pre-ordering because you're not giving
them any reason to bring you a good
product because they already have your
money before you realize that this is a
piece of shit of course things are going
to get better over time as patches come
out but if they already have your money
there's no reason for them to wait until
they have a nice solid product
you heard it here on Jase to sends
battlefield 4 it's absolute garbage
right now it'll get better but until
then dice you can pretty much eat shit
have a nice night hope you subscribe see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
