the white screen a couple of you said
hey we miss seeing your old setup bring
that back so I decided for the sake of
my 10th episode and the fact that about
to hit 100 600 pool with crappy went
backwards so about to hit a thousand
subscribers more than likely this week I
decided to go ahead and bring back my
gaming setup here in my office my
editing studio might why am i doing this
with my hands I decided to go ahead and
bring back the old set if you will my
workstation here in my home office /
studio / game room / man room / dog
house what's up guys Jase two cents and
you're watching episode 10 10 can you
believe it's been 10 weeks already since
i started doing tech addiction this is a
really exciting week for me because i'm
going to hit a thousand subscribers i'm
gonna get really close to a hundred
thousand views and I've got the giveaway
is finally gonna happen and you're gonna
find out in this video how you can win
those munitions 9-millimeter bullets
earphones that I've been flaunting and
whoring out all over my videos no longer
you're gonna have to hear about it this
is it you have to be watching and you
have to be following on Twitter to win
these earphones since most of my viewers
are into first person shooters let's go
ahead and get this started with it
really cool put something in my mouth
let's go ahead and get things started
with a really cool piece of technology
that I found on the Internet what you
see playing right over here is a video
of a manufacturing company that makes
firearms in the United States if they've
gone ahead taken some of their tracking
devices and some of their auto aim
features if you will and they've
incorporated it into a bolt-action rifle
he uses the same kind of technology that
jets do when it comes to locking onto
other heat sources or other targets and
has smart targeting system in it here
and it has two different scopes what you
do is you set the target you want to
shoot at with one scope and then you
paint it with the other scope and what
happens is when the crosshairs figure
out the right trajectory and the right
angle it then fires automatically and
it's guaranteed to hit it to target
every single time the manufacturer of
this technology says that you don't have
to be an expert you don't have to have
shot at you know a thousand rounds down
the range anybody could pick this up and
become you know Chuck Norris or a
sharpshooter in just a matter of minutes
this is really cool technology but it
also kind of begs the question of what
can happen if this got into the wrong
hands doesn't matter what country you're
from warfare
technology is a serious deal so AT&amp;amp;T has
once again won an award several years in
a row unfortunately it's the award for
the worst carrier in the United States
by consumer satisfaction 18t just can't
seem to get their stuff together they're
constantly being bombarded herb they're
constantly being bombarded by their
customers of negative reports of call
quality call drops network stability in
and out of 3g or 4g whatever you've got
but once again if you have ATT you are
with what's considered the worst network
to have in the united states and once
again topping the list comes out horizon
if you have a thi min are you happy how
long did them with them do you get call
drops do you get the horrible data
signals would tell me so Facebook has
been on a pretty active anti iPhone
campaign and now they are urging their
employees to move to Android they've got
some charts that they've been putting up
in their offices showing that Android is
on the rise and android is here and
Android is smashing the iphone and
they're suggesting that all their
employees go ahead and switch over to
android if they're not currently on an
android device yahoo decided several
months back that every single employee
gets a smartphone of their choice and it
doesn't matter if it's a windows phone
doesn't matter if it's blackberry or
iphone or android they get to pick and
they get to pick their device and then
the company will buy it for them and
that's their company phone it's a way of
trying to increase employee happiness
employee productivity and retention you
know give them what they want and if you
feel their employer is giving them what
they want then they'll be happy but it's
interesting that Facebook is making the
serious push for the employees that go
to Android especially since there's
rumors that Facebook is coming out with
what they call the facebook phone and we
haven't really figured out it been told
yet if it's going to be running on an
already existing platform or if it's
going to be an entirely new operating
system designed by Facebook so this is a
pretty interesting thing we're a huge
company like Facebook is officially
backing in particular you know phone
manufacturer or phone operating system
so if you recall in a previous
technician I told you about a story out
of San Antonio Texas where young girl
was being harassed by her school by
being unwilling to wear a required RFID
student ID badge at all times while on
campus this badge was designed to track
students movements throughout the school
to know exactly where they were at all
times and to get accurate attendance for
the school because you know schools are
paid based on attendance by the barians
the various states well this
students said no I'm not going to do
that that's against my right to privacy
because these particular type of ID
chips are not the same as the ones that
you swipe on a door when you go in it's
actually emitting a signal that can be
tracked on a computer at all times it's
not just when you pass certain spots
that are scanning the car so she looked
at it as an invasion of her privacy well
this story went big like I hoped it
would and the parents did not let up the
school districts held their ground
saying we're going to expel you once
this goes required later in the year
which it did it went required she
refused to wear it and then her parents
are notified by the superintendent of
the San Antonio school district that she
was going to be expelled means that she
could no longer attend public school so
that only further angered the parents
and inspired them to take their campaign
national so you've got news agencies all
over the country that are now covering
this story and here's where things start
to get interesting now the
superintendent has officially told the
parents that they're postponing the
expulsion in an effort to address this
matter and come to a resolution that
satisfies both sides of the conflict
what's interesting is the school has
already stated they are not going to
back down and they are going to require
her to wear this RF chip and the parents
and the students have said it doesn't
matter whether or not you're going to
require we're not going to wear it so
there's really no give or take there but
what's interesting here is the school is
saying we will not expel your daughter
if you guys are willing to drop this
anti San Antonio School District
campaign and the parents basically sped
you we're going to go ahead and do it
anyway you pushed us and we're not going
to stop because this is not right until
we get these RF chips out of the school
we are not going to back down when you
piss off some parents and you're dealing
with kids and then you get the news
involved it's never gonna go the school
districts way in most cases in this
situation I've already said I'm in total
agreeance with the child I do not
believe children should have to wear
tracking devices while at school so
guess what guys it happened again Apple
has gotten smacked with another lawsuit
another one completely different from
any of the other lawsuits you've already
seen regarding apple and motorola and
google and that lady whose picture they
stole and then the guy who ordered the
accessories and then got the order
cancelled in the box taken back and all
that sort of stuff now they are being
sued by a company called smartphone
concepts over the fact get this that
they are including earphones with their
phone
I went on a rant in the previous
technician about the fact that the US
patent system is being urged by Google
to go through and refresh his patents
and really determine what is and isn't
good patent laws because of stuff just
like this a little bit of research into
this patent issue now with this company
that's suing apple about including
headphones with a smartphone that's the
actual patent the patent says that the
the ability to provide headphones or
earbuds with a smartphone device belongs
to this company and what's interesting
about that is this company filed and got
this patent for years ago four years now
I'm going to add a word to that only
four years how long ever your phone's
been around how long have it phone
manufacturer has been giving earphones
with their their phones it doesn't
mention that it's got to be a stereo
headset or a single headphone right it
doesn't say it has to be for the purpose
of listening to music or listening to
phone calls I can remember back in the
year 2000 when I got a nokia that came
with a single earpiece for you to listen
to your phone 12 years ago so this just
goes to show you how important it is
that patents can be a very dangerous
thing we're a company can realize that
hey uh you know the iphone came out five
years ago or in their case a year ago
and they're giving earphones out with
their phone so if we file a patent now
that says we own the intellectual
property of the idea of giving
headphones out with a smartphone and
then we just sit on that patent for a
little while let all these other
companies start doing it because they're
gonna want to do it cuz Apple is and
what we do is we pounce and we strike
and we just say that's our patent you
can't do that and that's exactly what's
happened here and this company has gone
after Apple first because Apple has
become the largest single manufacturer
and supplier of smartphones followed by
nokia and motorola and all of the other
google companies like HTC you know again
motorola mobility and you've got samsung
and all those other companies so this is
just the start we're a little guy who
files a patent that says giving them
headphones is my idea and then suing
it's not right it's not Apple has
seriously got to fight this one this one
I don't agree with Apple I don't
understand how anyone could ever get a
is just this just really chaps my night
I can't believe that this is happening
because it's stupid it's a stupid move i
I just I don't understand and my rent
and this one now is totally against US
patent service I don't understand how
stupid you can be when it comes to
giving someone a patent over including
earphones with a smartphone I don't
believe that there's a patent on using
toilet paper so um all of you better
beware I'm gonna file a patent for it
using toilet paper and every time you
guys wipe you owe me a quarter imagine
how rich I would be oh my god that'd be
the all right guys here we go it's
that time of the week again for
technologies dumbass of the week and
this week that dumbass is none other
than Timothy Jackson Timothy Jackson
broke into somebody's car and stole a
couple of smartphones maybe technologies
dumbass ought to be the person who left
the smartphones in the car to begin with
anyway Timothy Jackson's 18 years old
and he said breaking in his car Oh check
it out his iphone in here and a galaxy
we wasn't my car wasn't my car wasn't I
gotta go check my car so he steals this
iphone and he steals this galaxy and he
goes and does whatever a Crip does know
maybe he goes and volunteers down to
homeless shelter I don't anyway the
owner of the car realizes the next day
that she's been broken into sushi files
a police report become and they they
take the police report and that's pretty
much it I mean I've had a car get broken
into before and that's all they do they
take a report nothing ever happens you
just do it because the insurance
requires she thought nothing of it until
all of a sudden that afternoon a random
picture popped up on her Facebook that's
this picture that you see right here
Timothy Jackson sitting there at home in
his kitchen he's going I've got this bad
iphone now I'm gonna start taking
pictures with it what he didn't realize
and I'm sure many of you already have is
that her iphone was sync with her
Facebook and any time she takes a
picture it does an automatic upload into
her Facebook photos and there he was so
police were able to determine by looking
at his photo that it was of course
Timothy Jackson age 18 had prior issues
with the law and they had his picture
already right then and there went
arrested him found the property and the
rest is history Timothy Jackson for
being the absolute idiot who stole an
iphone right because I've said it all
along he's still an apple device you're
an idiot because if everybody can track
it but for stealing an apple device and
then taking photos of yourself and then
ignorantly posting them
to the person's facebook who you stole
the phone from your technologies dumbass
