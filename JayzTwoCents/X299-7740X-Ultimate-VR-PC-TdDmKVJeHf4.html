home theater PC and everyone gets mad
because it doesn't play movies I never
play movies on this it's actually just
my VR rig and yeah so it's time for an
upgrade most people would say the
components in here are good enough into
that I'd say sick and tired of all the
RGB craze well don't worry because the
EVGA Z 270 classified K is full of all
the things that matter like Intel
obtained memory ready you to nvme SSD
support 11 phase PWM for stable
overclocking and a sleek monochromatic
design that is perfect for any build
learn more by visiting EVGA calm it's a
4770 chain with a z97 empower
motherboard and it's got 16 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance ddr3 Gemini cooler on
there with a fractal fan sitting in an
ode 605 case which is it very nice the
brushed aluminum looks good but also got
a cooler master 750 m power supply
obviously you can see it's not a full
sleeve doesn't matter because you can't
see inside this case anyway then kind of
torn though on what I want to go with I
mean I know what I want to go with a
1080 TI because again this is a VR
machine and I want to get all the horse
powers for the VR because we want to
maintain that 90 hurts refresh rate as
much as possible check out my to achieve
a hard drive because I want to go pure
SSD only I thought we'll throw all of
these SSDs in there down the skewing I
haven't decided which SSD you want to go
with kena sighs I want to go with an
MDOT to drive or if I want to go with a
SATA Drive m2 would definitely be
simpler that's for sure and here's the
thing I couldn't decide what I wanted to
go with so I have got this is the Z 270
kami gaming k-6 you guys saw me do a
little review on this when I did the
7600 K and 7700 K build and this has an
i-5 7600 K in it right now when I also
have this guy the X 299 gaming i9 from
asrock which would obviously be extreme
overkill I don't know how overkill I
want to go on this am torn because I
know the audience expects like super
overkill things from me
but at the same time trying to be
reasonable with this and I wouldn't put
an i-9
in there of course I definitely wouldn't
put an i-9 in there I would consider
maybe doing the 77 40 X which is you
guys know the stupidest processor ever
to belong on the next 299 gaming or next
299 motherboard but I'm kind of I think
ok with that
but the problem is if I go with the i9
motherboard the x2 99 then we have to
take a road trip so somewhere to buy
cooler and we're kind of short on time
today because we don't have a cooler
that's going to fit in here
is that a PP well it's my fault if I
didn't I don't know where the mounting
hardware is for this Gemini and I have
very limited clearance height wise on
this but I kind of I've kind of been in
this position like what am I going to do
with the 77 40 X like what am I going to
do with that even Paul's Hardware you
guys I'll link in the description this
video if I remember if not just go to
Paul's hardware's what web YouTube web
page he did a very good video compare
and contrasting the things that you gain
and the things that you lose when you go
with the 77 40 X on the next 299
motherboard it's stupid Amit says it
doesn't make any sense so I figured
let's just continue the trend of not
making sense by putting it in an HT PC
case but again I know how the cooler
that isn't this is probably the only
time in history you'll ever hear me say
ketchup and mustard cables are okay and
I should flip around the power supply
now though because I've been taking the
filters out you know they're people get
all mad like why do you put the power
supply with the fan facing up well I did
it in this case because these these
grills right here on the 605 are
extremely restricted we see how small
the holes are and then there's a filter
inside of that that looks like this
so this extremely fine and dusty meshes
you can see I mean clearly does its job
but this extremely fine mesh is on the
underside of this extremely fine grill
so it really cuts off airflow a lot so
that's why I pick the fans filters out
of this side or the intake fans you can
kind of see the blades through there now
so I think I've opened up the air flow
quite a bit I use double-sided tape for
everything I've done this before where
I've accidentally pulled the cover right
off of an SSD because it
we're good we're going okay oh geez that
was quite violent it just like popped
iron out there don't you know I don't
even care if that looks like that
because like I said this is one of the
fun bills because you'll have to care
about what it looks like you don't see
inside at all I don't know you don't see
inside the thing that sucks about this
is you know what all the comments next
are going to be giveaway giveaway give
it away 247 7000 why are you giving it
with that part out recording re giveaway
worldwide anyway yeah people demand
giveaways because they're so convinced
they're gonna win we're just singing
lucky that day I'm already doing a
giveaway right now anyway of a graphics
card so I don't like picking that by the
cooler but it's not like I can get my
hands behind it
that's good I kind of want to do the i-5
but then the problem is I sort of know
the i-5 is going to slow down a 1080p a
little bit mmm this is going to spend
pretty much most of its life right now
doing VR stuff anyway which is not going
to max out either something like a 1080
TI but there are games to be had in VR
with going with the big overpowered
graphics graphics cards I can't just
throw that cooler on the X 299 board
like I said I don't have the hardware
for it but I hit up my friends over at
Coolermaster they stepped up and we're
driving over there right now and they're
going to give me a new s5 34 cooler the
Gemini because it's a horizontal cooler
it clears it does a good job of cooling
so I want to stick with that so what
I've decided I'm going to do is I'm
going to go with the X 299 77 40 X
because I can't think of any other build
to use that CPU with I already have it
and why spend money on a 7700 K when I
at least have that sitting around and
then I want to see it right because it's
going to be in that case I'd have to
look at how to look at it and go what's
really a waste here is the motherboard
the X $2.99 motherboard is a complete
waste on a 7740 X because that CPU
should never exist to begin with does it
even get to race cars again finally get
to race cars I finally have the reason
to actually get my other bills going
then yeah but yeah we're going to drive
over to cool raster right now is we're
going to f----- got back from cool and
after book I waited for that turn that
be perfectly timed oh yeah we got we
need nap Chum you guys we get we got
another cooler the exact cooler we had
yeah Barry oh sorry my arms are like
weird I'm actually not going to be using
that exact cooler right now I'm going to
be using just the hardware out of it Oh
got ourselves something I haven't had in
a long time
some Yoshinoya you like Japanese fat
food dropping the teriyaki chicken is
pretty good ah now now if you want to
know what that was all about I'm gonna
leave this in as I tell them don't start
every clip with so anyway or so or hey
guys or okay guys because that's what
like beginners do
that's what beginners go okay guys okay
guys sup guys like every single time
they start a clip so I'm always telling
him I dude don't start
every clip with okay so or whatever
right yeah and he just started to do
right now he caught himself and that's
what I was giving herself an aneurysm to
stop I force it enters and when you ah
ah no yeah I do
cuz I haven't use of Cameron forever
it's just go put the computer together
that sounds like a good idea so moral of
the story don't throw away your hardware
your mounting hardware when you think
you're done with it
and
is now the cool thing about this
particular case is it doesn't be fit eh
CX x want it so there it is
I got pretty that is so pretty it's all
like gunmetal eating stuff transformer
like 6th night yeah look at all these
empty slots we got so much room for
activity
Wow I'm going to put so ok that that
makes up my mind I'm going to put an
MDOT to right here because the nice
thing about the Gemini and the way that
it blows down is it will it will cool
the MDOT you I'm pretty sure that that's
the seventy seven forty three point
three if that's the ten core right there
now it's a total waste because we can
only use this rim this ran slots right
there well that's kind of a bummer
clicking except I'm pretty sure that
this is going to clear the cooler and
mommy are you real concerned about that
let's see oh yeah lots and lots of
really clear look at that so I'm going
to use my 960 Evo MDOT to just glad this
looks like a really futuristic cityscape
yes you know guys clear on top of snack
safety let me alone what are you doing I
got the wrench stuck on that oh you
wanna show it and show us I dropped it
and was in there and now it's like
I'll figure it out later so I was doing
a test boot on this as you should always
do before you put it inside the system
obviously it's working
we've got a test boot right here and
these two Tim's on the right-hand side
are occupied I could try switching and
see if there's any difference because
technically I don't have a and B I have
C and D occupied I don't know if there's
a difference again but I guess we have
to put it back in the in the system now
or in the case yeah my capacity so
that's like the accident whatever but
accidental was that imma located like a
mobster hey old Vinny you believe this
guy anything you talk about capacity
let's go yeah you know that let me set
up now dick yeah Oh what do you do now
well the ape in power and then there it
goes like against for the Spanish our
plug is hitting our fans about to be
some modification yeah so it keeps
hitting on the corner of this fan the
power plug and so we're going to do is
I'm just going to break the corner of
this panel
lots of excess with that technique so
there's lots of excess plastic and
material on here no there's gonna be a
lot more clearance right there oh yeah
there we go
modded yeah I'm not a fan of the way
that this cable has to route but I can't
do anything about that because the tsum
using has short cables about to get
Ahmad and SSD well I mean if it were in
the best modders out there if they say
they don't use double-sided tape I would
say you're a liar double sided tape then
every single mater is like a tool kit I
guarantee it
pen begin and Wow
you know eat it and but it's so much
cleaner look I know you guys might have
noticed I've been showing y'all a
founders 1080p I here hasn't been
talking about all this crap but that's
not what not what's going in here no
it's not no it's not what's going in it
I'm actually gonna be putting in an MSI
1080i Seahawk whoo and where I did with
this guy here because I kind of did a
test fit yesterday to see if I could fit
the AIO in here and it was hitting on
this hinge is a hinge in here I hope you
can see that the hinge right there you
can see how close that is to the fan you
never had the fan on there the radiator
would still hit on that nice so what I
did was I took another fan and I
basically hollowed it out I took the hub
out and looked at the fan blades out so
now I have this kind of a shroud and I
just literally I know it's ghetto modded
but it zip tied to the fan and now it
will all fit so I guess that's the next
thing I got to do is get just in there
because if I'm going to be routing
cables around and I will be a bit yeah
and I was kind of concerned about the
vertical height tube but yeah it does
all fit fortunately thank you indicate
so by not putting the filters on the
exhaust side like I kind of showed you
guys earlier this increases the airflow
so we get nothing but good things yes
exactly you have the water cooled and
the issue I was finding with this case
was it can get a little toasty even for
a founders edition card we have a
water-cooled gtx 980ti and x 299 with
the shouldn't exist 7740 xk bulik x
processor now I'm almost positive that
USB is for the card reader because USB
3.0 is it's the only USBs on there so
because of our video what we determined
that having two separate plugs plugged
in matters well a little bit negligibly
negative doubly negatively like this the
Smith says negatively I mean it's not
going to really
performance really but they still can
you want that peace of mind I scare
because I care it's not like this is the
hardest chassis to build in I think we
got it pretty good though it's pretty
open in there all right yeah we gotta do
next we got a power hand I'm sure it all
works you got the juice on it oh look at
that look at that
Oh would you just look at ya we'll get
ya would you just believe it how much
air is coming out of here oh wow ya know
it's a lot that's way more air than it's
ever gone through this chassis well so I
think some of the thermal things that we
were kind of fighting with initially in
the beginning which kind of led to all
of this you're now working so anyway
there you go guys tell me what you think
about this build I couldn't think of
another of a better way to take a CPU
that didn't make sense and put it into a
build that kind of doesn't make sense I
mean who would have thought of putting
an X 299 in a home dear pc chassis with
a water cold graphics card and called it
a VR machine this will be our machine I
know that's really all it's going to do
yeah but tell me on the comments below
what you guys think and yes I know you
probably want to see benchmarks and
stuff I just got done building it so
climb down does it take some time Jason
all right guys thanks for watching we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
