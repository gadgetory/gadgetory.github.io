got my first build of 2017 yeah I mean
what a better way to start the year
besides CES which I'm on the way to
right now by the time you guys are
watching this video but then with a
brand new build featuring some brand new
hardware that just hit the market
when it's dual BIOS 10+2 power phase
delivery rgba CX 3.0 cooler and factory
overclock the EVGA gtx 1070 and 1080 for
the win are excellent choices for gamers
who demand the best learn more by
following the link down below okay I
don't want to bore you too much with the
specs but I know you guys are dying to
see and I'm calling it order 66 that's
what I named the build I thought it was
very city with it being black in red a
lot of black and red builds are highly
overdone and saturated but I've never
personally built a red and black build
for myself I've done red in gunmetal but
not red and black and I thought I called
it order 66 because I thought it seemed
very City and dark side II with the way
it looks especially with the white
accents in there with the LEDs I thought
it looked a lot like the new Thai
fighters 2 that you guys see in the in
the newest movie not not rogue one but
episode 7 granted yes I know order 66 in
the Thai fighter that I'm showing here
from two different eras but I digress it
doesn't matter it looks cool and that's
what I called it CPU why is it is
running the brand-spanking-new kb lake
7700 K from Intel I don't think that
surprises any of you guys it's the whole
reason why I built a new system it's got
a 4.2 gigahertz turbo clock out of the
box but this one I am running right now
this very second at 5 gigahertz and I'm
that's just fun to say 5 gigahertz you
know why I have never owned a CPU that
could state that could run 5 gigahertz
stable as it just went to sleep
it's tiring it's tough work running 5
gigahertz I should probably go in there
and change the power settings huh but
keeping that 5 gigahertz cool at a 1.3
to 5 volts I might add is my
three-year-old Corsair H 100 I with the
fan set to silent and it's doing a
fantastic job of keeping it cool because
I wanted to see what power draw and
temperatures were like on the new KB
Lake we will be talking about that in a
separate video where I talk about
overclocking
and that is going to be a fun video
because 5 gigahertz that's that's fun
right
but I took that new KB like 7700 K CPU
and I had it make passionate love to the
new motherboard which is the asrock Z
270 gaming k-6 fatality motherboards a
long name I know but I'm excited for
this motherboard I've done I'm gonna be
taking a look at a few z2 70
motherboards but I started it off with
the new as rock board because one the
last as rock board I played with you
guys might remember this I am
I sort of took a drill to it I thought I
was making a cool mod instead I made a
moment that will go down in history is
one that I will never live down where
Jade drilled holes in a motherboard but
there are some fantastic upgrades to the
new fatality motherboards one they look
fantastic they've got onboard lighting
that is not too intrusive or
in-your-face it's a nice subtle glow
which I think looks great and it even
stays on when the system is powered off
but you can change that setting if you
don't like that
multiple LAN ports on there it's got
Sound Blaster cinema built-in surround
sound if you guys are going to hook this
up to some speakers directly through the
motherboard and of course the z2 70
chipset as I already said but what makes
this motherboard fantastic is that it's
an amazing balance of both gaming
features and overclocking features you
can have the best of both worlds without
having to compromise and try to decide
do I want to build a gaming system or do
I want to have overclocking features
they give you both and it's all mated
with an amazing UEFI bios that makes it
very simple to overclock both your
memory and your CPU and deal with
voltage and fan tuning built in AI
nothing makes me sadder than an amazing
motherboard that doesn't have built-in
fan tuning and this one has both so you
guys can we'll take a look at that as
well when I do my my official z2 70
overclocking and KB Lake overclocking
guide in the future for memory I'm
running 16 gigabytes of g.skill ddr4
trident z memory it matched again
perfectly with the red and gunmetal and
then for graphics card i went ahead with
my msi gtx 1080 gaming ex because again
it matched perfectly all these all these
colors just went together like this this
build was just meant to be even my SSD
the HyperX savage
it's red and black and you can see it
because the back of the case that I'm
using the Corsair 570 X crystal is all
glass it's glass on the back it's glass
in the front the top I mean you you you
you you have to literally plan out every
cable in this build because of the fact
that even the back panel is glass and
admittedly this has probably been the
hardest bit of cable management I've
ever had to do in any case because
typically you just had to make the front
side look good and then the back you
just kind of all just stick your foot on
there and shove the panel closed because
you don't see those cables but not in
this one it all shows so you've got to
think about it but of course the fans on
this thing are also RGB so you can
change the colors I made them read what
other color would I make them this build
has been a lot of fun I mean even the
cables on here match the build perfectly
with the red sleeve EVGA cables made it
to my supernova 1000 watt EVGA power
supply everything on this build is
well-thought-out and I'll be honest I
spent four hours putting this thing
together for hours and it's not even a
custom water cooling loop that just
shows you how much I cared just a little
sneak peek at how well my 7700 K here is
performing at 5 gigahertz it scored at
1100 9 on Cinebench r15 which is
actually edged out the performance of a
3930k 6 core 12 thread CPU yeah granted
that's a couple of generations old
the 3930k is definitely no slouch and
yeah it beat it out on Cinebench r15 but
I will be doing an in-depth future video
here on how to overclock your KB Lake
CPU I do also have a 7600 K which I will
be doing a video on comparing the two
and whether or not you need an i5 or an
i7 moving forward for new-built I am
absolutely in love with this system it
looks phenomenal and it hasn't taken on
its final form it will be evolving a
little bit here as I take a look at some
of the other motherboards on the market
I've got two more I'm going to take a
look at here in the near future and then
I do think this bill deserves a custom
water-cooled
in its final form so where do you guys
think of my first build of 2017 order 66
I think it I'm glad I waited to do a
build in this case I've had it for a few
months in fact Corsair has been like hey
Jay are you gonna do a build you said
you're gonna do a build I don't see a
build can you please do a build I'm glad
I waited and did
in the KB Lake stuff or did it with the
KB Lake stuff I think it looks
phenomenal anyway guys time to go thanks
for taking a look at my sneak peak of
stuff coming up here in early 2017 tell
me what you guys think of order 66 I
think it looks phenomenal I mean it's
it's going to be kind of a bitch to keep
clean though with all that glass both
inside and out but I think it turned out
great and as I mentioned it's not in its
final form we'll be taking a look at
some other motherboards and a 7600 case
CPU here in the near future so sound off
in the comments here guys we're starting
off the year right 2016 was amazing for
channel growth I mean we ended the year
at eight hundred and eighty thousand
subscribers we are just marching right
along towards 1 million also - it would
mean the world to me if you guys would
check out my CES 2017 coverage I took
2016 off I did not go in 2016 and 2017 I
will definitely be there making a splash
coconut Monkeys going with me we've got
two idiots go to CES it's going to be
fun would mean the world to me if you
guys would watch it anyway guys thanks
for watching tell me what you think of
the new system and as always I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
