here and I'm taking a break from working
on skunkworks version 3.0 yes 3.0 where
I'm finally gonna put in those three
Titan X's and a whole new loop so has
always high bite off way more than I
think I'm gonna need to do when it comes
to these build and as you can see I've
completely gutted the system but this is
a perfect opportunity to show you a
product that my friends over at mass
drop sent to me which is the hurricane
Canlis air system today's video is
sponsored by master of the largest
community commerce platform in the world
had to master up today and suggest
something to be dropped and I'm like
literally drop it you know where they
bring the price down and stuff now I'm
always running out of canned air
especially since I live in such a dusty
area I figured that this would be the
perfect time to give this thing a shot
and see how well it works and it
actually for one lucky viewer out there
you're actually going to get a chance to
win one of these by signing up for mass
drop which is it down in the description
it's completely free there's also a link
to the drop where you guys can get this
even cheaper now the box is pretty
simple just a cardboard box and inside
you'll find some instructions
professional safety we don't practice
safety around here and then you've got
the hurricane itself and some
attachments and a charger so essentially
it's basically just like a little vacuum
cleaner only instead of sucking it blows
so here it is right here it comes pre
charged and
rest in peace headphone listeners this
thing is pretty freakin loud that is
what I'm going to say is probably Kahn
number one with candless air systems and
it's why they call it candless because
they're like never go canned air again
but that's like downfall number one it's
just in order to push enough air it's
got to move a motor extremely fast and
it is extremely noisy now it does come
with a flex tube it also comes with a
sort of a nozzle high-pressure pointer
an extender extender an extender piece
and so it's got a whole bunch of
attachment it's like a tiny little car
vacuum like I said only it blows air now
it's just got the one setting which is
on and incredibly loud now one of the
attachments here is a little electronics
brush now they do advertise that this
thing is completely safe for electronics
so that's what makes it a little bit
better than canned air or canned air
especially when the can is full will
tend to blow out some of the gas or the
actual liquid which is turning into a
gas you know you shake it and or hold it
upside down and you get all that like
spray yeah that could sometimes damage
electronics depending on how much
condensation builds up or how much
you're doing it let's go ahead and see
how well this thing performs I don't
think it says on here specs on how fast
the motor is or anything like that
doesn't really matter but I do also have
somewhere around here ah right here I
meant to do that
I also have a can of canned air and we
have the Canlis air system so I guess
maybe we'll see how well these things do
head to head
so as you guys can see skunkworks says
well a little bit dirty
you guys always think the system so
clean well huh there you go now one of
the things that makes skunkworks kind of
difficult to keep clean is the powder
coating on here as you can hear it's
very textured it almost feels like
sandpaper in some area so that's going
to catch dust really really badly so
we're going to do first is we're going
to go ahead and take our canned air here
I'm going to use the little attachment
the little hose attachment this is a
high-pressure nozzle if you take off the
nozzle it actually blow more volumes so
you can see we just blew away some of
the dust but if you put on the little
red piece then of course you get a
little bit more you know a little bit
more fine action but the problem with
canned air is as the can gets colder you
start to lose pressure and eventually
I'm going to start getting a little
woozy but as you keep using it the can
gets colder and colder and can even
frost over and you lose air pressure and
it doesn't take long to achieve that
it's starting to kind of frost up inside
there so we're losing pressure it's
uncomfortable to hold so let's go ahead
and try out the hurricane and we'll
actually take off the brush attachment
we'll use the little little flexo's here
that is so freaking loud but if you take
the brush attachment you see we didn't
make a whole big difference there in the
texture but if we put on the brush
attachment then we can actually start
sorry guys I'm gonna do what I can to
keep the volume down but that's
incredibly loud one thing that makes the
brush attachment nice though is you can
get in the motherboard and other
circuits and get all that dust off
without causing any damage now it's not
really much else to say about it other
than unfortunately it is incredibly loud
but if you consider the fact that canned
air also loses pressure very quickly
this thing doesn't Alone's it has a
charge it's going to continue to blow
air and you can keep your system safe
and they're not going to have any of
that terrible bitter agent that's going
to be in the air when you use this stuff
to keep people from doing abusive things
with it and you're never going to run
out of air it actually has its benefits
so that's it for today's video I know
it's kind of a short one but how much
can you really say about a candless air
system
and I guess another benefit to this
thing is that if you guys have small
animals you could actually have tons of
fun if you know what I mean but anyway
that's it guys make sure you check out
the links down in the description if you
guys sign up for mass drop like I said
it's entirely free you're entered into a
giveaway where someone is going to win
one of these courtesy of mass drop so
there we go
thanks for watching guys I'm gonna go
ahead and turn around and I'm going to
start getting back to work on this thing
because yeah I I kind of want to keep
playing GTA 5 and stuff and as you can
see can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
