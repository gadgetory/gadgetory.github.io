channel and today I'm going to show you
all about my PC setup
one of the most common questions that
I'm actually asked is why did you go
with AMD one of the reasons I went with
AMD had to do with cost to performance
ratio there are a lot of Intel products
out there that are in the same price
range as the processor I particularly
went with however I do make use of the
extra cores of the eight core processor
my live stream for instance uses every
single core available in the same price
bracket but Intel was the 2500 K they
didn't have the same type of full
threaded needs that I need when it comes
to photoshop and Vegas and After Effects
and all of the other video encoding
software that I actually use so that's
the reason why I actually with AMD when
it comes to gaming I actually chose to
go with the NVIDIA GTX 680 might happens
to be an actual MSI brand but it is a
reference card therefore there's no real
difference between any other reference
card motherboard wise I'm actually
rocking an asus rog republic of gamers
crosshair 5 formula motherboard I chose
this board because of its many onboard
features including its incredible
overclocking ability the actual built-in
utilities for overclocking on this
motherboard are incredible everything
that you could imagine that you need to
adjust is available BIOS is completely
unlocked you can do everything you want
with it and it comes with a removable
BIOS chip so if I want to get multiple
chips and I want to play with various
different setups I can actually plug in
a different chip if I want or of course
I can just set up an actual profile and
I can load different profiles at
different times based on different
scenarios this can be done either
through the BIOS or it can actually be
done in real time through software I
provided with the motherboard memory
wise I'm running 16 gigabytes of 1866
Patriot extreme memory it's lightning
fast memory it's very overclockable I am
actually not overclocking my memory as
it hinders some of my overclocking
abilities of my processor processor I'm
running an FX 81 28 core bulldozer
processor the overclocking ability of
this chip is actually quite amazing
I easily reached 5 gigahertz didn't take
much tuning at all on water cooling it
was quite simple stayed well within
thermal range there was no worries
whatsoever when it came to temperatures
I did tune it back a little bit 4.8
gigahertz though as I didn't like to in
the summertime get anywhere near my
temperature threshold so in the
wintertime I'll probably bump it back up
to 5.0 maybe even 5.2 my graphics card
is actually overclocked to 1.3 gigahertz
it is a 1.05 - it is a 1050 - megahertz
stock clock on that so you can see it
does have quite a bit of an overclock I
did see quite an improvement going from
the stocks beach to the 1.3 gigahertz
both in gaming and synthetic benchmarks
hard drive wise I do actually have four
hard drives in this machine my operating
system hard drive is an m4 crucial SSD
solid state drive 128 gigabyte capacity
I do keep a couple of my favorite games
on the SSD so loading times were reduced
for instance battlefield 3 is running on
my SSD and I do load a map on average in
about 10 seconds when I had battlefield
3 on my mechanical drive it was taking
upwards of a minute to 2 minutes to load
them out case wise I'm running an NZXT
switch 810 full tower case it's the
white Edition I love the white not only
because I think it's stylish but because
it doesn't show the dust nearly as bad
it's got a very smooth finish on the
powder coating very easy to dust dust
doesn't stick to it you can clean it
very easily and I do definitely
recommend this case very cheap when it
comes to the amount of features that you
get with it alright so here she is one
of my favorite features regarding this
case right off the bat is the way that
the side panel actually comes off so you
have the two screws on the side right
here get this third one in the middle
here you listen that and it actually
moves up and down on a spring so the
case can't decide can't come off unless
you actually push it down on that pull
it out so on the inside here we have my
lower double 120 millimeter radiator up
top we have the triple up here the white
phase our tubing the mCP six five five
variable speed pump the EK water block
on my graphics card right here and the
XS PC water block for the CPU I do have
a fan right here that can be angled this
is pulling air in from the front of the
case as well as two fans on the front of
the case right here right here
these are 140 millimeter fans the fans
on the radiators are 120 millimeter
have a 140 on the back actually pulling
air into the case
these fans are actually pulling so much
air through the top that I actually had
to balance out the air coming into the
front and the rear of the case otherwise
I was getting negative pressure issues
which are no good Swift tech reservoir
right here one of the cool things about
this particular motherboard is the fact
that it does have these buttons down
here in the bottom that you may see we
have an overclocking button a start
button and a reset button so if you were
doing some work on this on a bench and
you didn't actually have a buttons on
the case
you know because you had out of vacation
you are working on it you could actually
start your computer simply by pushing
that Start button as you can see up here
on the top I do have a white LED strip
while lighting up the white interior of
the case go ahead and up this thing
start up so you can hear the noise level
quite a bit air moving through here what
you hear right here are the fans
actually 100% fans are software control
so what's window starts up you will
notice the fans will actually slow down
as a software kicks and realizes that
the temperatures are nowhere near the
threshold where I have the temperature
set to so those slow down what this also
means is that when I start gaming or I
do something intensive the fans will
ramp up to pull my air through and there
you go the fans just slowed down to
roughly 60% speed nothing more than that
is actually necessary see if we can't do
this a little bit of MTV Cribs style
since now we're in my game room my mail
my little man cave here we've got our
Gears of War posters right here showing
our love for Gears of War yes I did on

Duty Black Ops poster got to show the
love for call of duty black ops
