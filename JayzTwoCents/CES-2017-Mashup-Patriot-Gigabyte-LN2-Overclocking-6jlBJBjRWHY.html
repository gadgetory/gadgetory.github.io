MSI and the new Z 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
Consumer Electronics Show 2017 checking
out what Patriot has to offer it's been
a few years since I've worked with
Patriot so I'm excited to check this out
because may not be new to you but it's
new to me that they've actually jumped
into the peripherals game here and we've
got a couple things we're to check out
now I know what you're thinking
peripherals
are they're hard to shop for I feel I
mean I already have kind of compared it
to shopping for shoes if it's not
perfect it doesn't fit right and it's
not the color you want you're not gonna
buy it and with there being so many
flavors in the industry it's hard to
choose I have a hard time picking
peripherals myself we're gonna start out
here with the V 570 which is the headset
it's pretty interesting because got
surface mounted controls on here volume
control and it's got an interesting
switch right here this right here
activates an additional subwoofer that's
basically built into the headset it's a
30 millimeter driver hooked up to this
switch on top of a 40 millimeter driver
that's already driving this stereo
headphones now this is if you're playing
action games battlefield one csgo
whatever the explosions are happening
that's literally going to shake your
head that's what it's kind of designed
to do and I'm happy that they made this
a surface switch because if you decide
like I don't want that much base
suddenly you've got a headache that day
you don't to go into software and fiddle
with it to turn that off it's just a
service mounted switch or if you really
want to feel like you're in the middle
of you know battlefield one you turn
that on and your vision might go even a
little bit well you know you turn on a
subwoofer in a car and it starts to
vibrate you might feel that if you want
it it's there so it's also got a
retractable microphone that's going to
be up and out of the way if you're not
using it I like this design rather than
the ones that kind of push up in and out
of the ear can because it's easy to get
to they've also got a mouse over here
this is the v3 70 this is a weight
adjustable mouse which is kind of a big
deal because you're holding it you're
moving it you're gaming with it speed is
everything tracking is everything if we
got the cover off here you can see
you've got quite a few different 30 gram
weights here to adjust the weighting of
the mouse how you want it I like a nice
heavy Mouse so I would leave all the
weights in but maybe you want something
that's light for real fine movements
you can do that we've got RGB on here
that is customizable so you can pick the
color you want or just let it kind of go
disco mode and do its thing and speaking
of colors here is the b7 70 which is
their new mechanical keyboard here kale
switches available in different colors
this is a feel like a red there's no
bump in there so you have different
lighting profile buttons here it's all
customizable so you can adjust this on a
key by key basis you can also do it in
sectors of the keyboard or you can just
let it kind of go in some of the
pre-configured modes well it's also got
a braided cable on all of these
peripherals we've taken a look at so it
means you're gonna have durability with
the cable so if you if you're traveling
with it going to land parties school
basement whatever so yeah I'm actually
kind of impressed with what I see here
when it comes to peripherals because I'm
I'm a hard guy to make excited about
peripherals you guys know that but I
like what I see here okay so I've
wandered over here to the gigabyte bench
where they have some overclocking going
on you got a lot of custom systems going
on right here some water cooled stuff
and I noticed something something they
didn't even point out to me when they
were showing me uh what they had here
and this graphics card is actually an
norris branded graphics card as you can
see right here it's got some some things
on here that I haven't seen in any
graphics card yet we're gonna talk about
that for a second but I wanted to point
out that Oris is actually the premium
line within gigabyte you're gonna be
seeing more Auris products coming out
we've got a Norris gaming 5 motherboard
right here looks very similar to
gigabyte stuff and that's because
there's a ship that's happening here
where were they going to be kind of
taking the gaming stuff the premium
stuff and it's all going to be having
the Auris brand on there but what makes
the scraps card different this looks an
awful lot like the 1080 extreme we took
a look at right where I right fix the
shroud on here but look at the back of
this it actually has a full copper rear
heatsink touching the back of the GPU
socket which is where a lot of heat is
actually expelled you know heat goes
both ways so you pull the front of it
what about the back well check this out
pull copper backplate on there all right
assuming I'm in the backplate it's a
heat sink it's heavy too this is really
heavy it's also got a LED right here
which will shine with the Auris logo you
can turn this off I believe if you don't
want to see that but this is like an
early prototype that says
even have anemia I assume this is a
1080p CD but I could be wrong but I
definitely want to show that to you
something else I want to show you here
you guys remember the x99 phoenix
motherboard that i put in coconut
monkeys build when we did his this is
the new horas motherboard here looks an
awful lot like that this is a Z 270
motherboard but you might notice
something it has an integrated ek
waterblock on the VRMs up here so this
is either a heatsink
or a water block whichever you don't put
water in this what does it heatsink
without it if you want to incorporate a
motherboard into your cooling loop it is
a full copper each a water block so you
can now incorporate the motherboard in
your loop without having to buy anything
extra that's pretty freakin awesome and
of course it's got all the things you'd
expect from you know the was just now
the Horus motherboard but anyway the
reason why I'm showing you that is I
just wanted to kind of prepare you for
the ship that's happening here where
gigabytes moving the premium stuff over
to the oars brand everything right now
is room temperature okay
inside you see the CPU head down inside
there it's attached to the CPU CPU is
deleted it's the i7 7700 and what we're
gonna do is you guys come over here this
this is the basically the simplicity of
of our machine you just push the button
set the CPU point we let's say we're
gonna go to minus 40
I hit minus 40 they send minus 42 and it
just goes there so that's that's that's
basically it you can't really hear it
but
probably
if you get close you can actually hear
the hear the lm-2 running so what's
happening is inside here when you get
this really cold inside when it gets
down to minus ten minus 20 minus 30 it
starts building up condensation and then
ice and ice and then ice and you ruin
your gear if you don't if you don't what
do you call it insulated right okay well
with our purge case because it doesn't
allow any moisture inside the case and
it purges out all the moisture out of
the case continuously and it
hermetically seals in the case so at the
end when you walk you can just walk away
and it will stay dry inside right but
with our with our purge case you don't
have to insulate anything with any
insulation so you can see right here you
can watch the temperatures on our on the
controller drop and as you see how it's
dropping its going to go to 42 and and
rest there so you can set it any
anywhere from 70 degrees Celsius because
it will maintain you can actually use
this as a regular cooler like if you
wanted to cool at room temperature you
wanted to keep your CPU continuously at
23 the you just set it at 23 degrees
Celsius and it'll just keep it there so
you don't have to blow through a whole
lot of liquid nitrogen if you're loading
up drivers or something like that the
range oh yeah so anywhere from 50
degrees positive I think actually 70
degrees down to minus 196 as cold as
liquid nitrogen yet this will regulate
it at that temperature so these guys are
trying really hard to get me to do ln2
so we're talking we're gonna see if
maybe a collab in the future where these
guys introduced me to ln2 and I build a
rig specifically for that because I like
overclocking but now it's like it's kind
of boring now because I only go as far
as I can go on water and that's easy so
maybe maybe you guys will see that in
the future he's gonna I could see it on
it's like we're gonna do it we're gonna
do it I like Ilena
we're coming down all right let's get
out of here before he starts costing me
money</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
