done any sort of crazy builds and we're
gonna start off by testing some hardware
that we've had for a while that we have
not actually used yet that being
specifically the Intel W 31 75 X 24 Core
48 thread processor which Steve used to
capture some records by doing chilled
water and overclocking coupled with the
ROG Dominus extreme motherboard we're
talking about a $3,000 CPU and like a
$1,700 ish motherboard I don't know what
the current price of this thing is yeah
this it this one's a bit extreme like in
every sense of the word you know what
guys I got new merch it's available now
Cod me calm /jc sense we got zip up
hoodies we got tri-blend we got a new
logo I digress since 2012 but the wrist
logo you guys been asking for that
anyway well guys little bit uh well
kinda stuff zip up hoodies have beanies
polos don't take my word for it cuz
obviously I can't do this edie so just
look in the description below and you
guys will find the link Thanks so
fortunately alpha cool sent us this
massive care package of radiators and
blocks and things and one of the reasons
why we hadn't done anything with it yet
is because we were really lacking
cooling for it so as you can see they
sent us over here the xpx pro 1u and the
ridge y21 you is because technically
this processor is actually based off of
its xeon counterpart which is a $10,000
cpu the very same one Linus broke or
dropped and broke and ruined some memory
channels on it so it doesn't use
conventional mounting mechanism in fact
the mounting mechanism found on this
particular socket doesn't even have a
retention system it's actually held in
place by the cooling solution so as you
can see you know we need to actually put
down some protection on this table first
all right so this obviously isn't the
gamers Nexus mod mat this is the Alpha
cool one but because I have to put the
motherboard directly on something for
cooling I guess technically I can use
the cardboard box yeah that's a huge so
the thing with the LGA 3467 socket
at least as far as I can tell because I
never actually built in one is when you
take off this plate
there's no retention for it you can see
where things would mount down right here
here here here all right these are
threaded because these are technically
based off of server counterparts
there's no retention system for it so we
couldn't even mount it and play around
that the time we wanted to because of
the fact that we had no way to actually
mount this sucker down so as best as I
can tell you just put the socket or the
CPU in the socket and then write
whatever your cooling solution is gonna
be now they call this a 1u because this
is actually a water block design for
blade servers so this they call this one
u because the height of it means it will
fit in a 1u blade i presumably they
maybe have taller ones for like two you
may be in for you I don't know but
because it's also a server solution is
why you get all these ports and all
these different options and stuff on
here since we're using this in a desktop
platform we can just use the ones on top
so we just need to plug these two holes
here so your house what we're gonna do
oh and then in terms of why the hell not
because it takes two 24-pin power plugs
as you can see right here we've got two
1600 watt power supplies from EVGA
and then again because why the heck not
we're gonna pair that now with 220 atti
for the win three graphics cards
obviously we're going to be putting it
under water we need memory and I don't
think I have six matching set dims of
any other brands will be stealing six of
them out of some perks for this and then
what else we need to just do like an
MDOT 2os Drive or something like that so
why don't we just go ahead and build it
and see what happens
hopefully it boots on there are six EPS
power plugs on this thing for eight pins
and two six pins I feel like I need to
pull out that third power supply it
sounds like infinity war when you had to
like refire the star yeah
all right here we go this is this is put
it
see if it works
all right well this monstrosity is built
I don't even know if it works yet both
of these graphics cards are brand-new
the CPU has not been tested since we got
it it is a retail sample not a in
engineering the motherboard hasn't
nothing's been booted yet except for the
power supplies or the same ones we use
when we do the RIP TN stuff so we've got
two power supplies here a primary and a
secondary so the secondary I'm gonna
turn that one on first and if I turn on
the primary okay cool nothing turned on
like by default we've got ah LEDs on the
screen saying rog darkness extreme let's
just push power and see what happens we
just shut down turning back on I know if
it's learning Ram I've never booted this
platform before okay so we should be
getting something on the screen yes we
have three keyboards in two mice and
four hubs okay all right so we're booted
up and everything works obviously we got
49 thousand one hundred and fifty two
megabytes of RAM showing because well
we've got six we got six dims in there
which is kind of strange because they're
eight gigabyte DIMMs and at first we
only had 32 gigs showing and so it's the
scary part about this particular CPU is
the fact that like I said earlier the
only thing that holds it down is the
cooler itself there's no retention
system where at least with Red River
which is a similar size die it has that
torque wrench that holds it down and so
you you tighten in a certain order until
you get the clicks and then you know
it's good to go and the reason why with
thread Ripper they state that that's
important is it was a certain amount of
tension needed for the pin contact for
all the pins to be contacting so
initially we were only getting 32 gigs
to show up which means that like what
two of our dims weren't showing up or
something like that so I just basically
went okay well I'll just keep tightening
it you tighten the outside corners or
the opposing corners until the threads
stop because it bottoms out and the
threads don't go any farther then the
two that are in the middle one here and
there it says you tighten those down
next the thing is those threads don't
really stop as far as I can tell it
seems like they kind of just keep going
and so I don't want to cause damage to
our CPU so I don't think I had those
tight enough so when I turned off the
system and tighten those down further
then we got all the RAM to show up so
just kind of a little little note to
mention there so now we are gonna go
ahead and do some like some Cinebench
and some 3dmark maybe overclocked a
graphic graphics card slightly and
there's our 28 cores and 56 threads
right there I think earlier I called it
a 24 or 48 thread it shows how much I
don't know right now we're sitting at 30
C under idle as soon as I hit go that's
a lot of squares and we jumped up to 62
63 ok 63 C under load and a 5400 States
door without an overclock Wow
frequencies at hey 3.77 at 64 c 55 30
alright let's go ahead and save that rig
into CPU chart it's just like yeah
fifty-five oh seven we lost a little bit
of heart
alright well go ahead and save that
results and then that's what we're
running are they're the old the old
trusty seller on the LGA 775 so all I do
is apply XMP and on the Asus board it'll
ask you when you apply XMP if you want
to also apply it all quarterb overclock
and we said no to that so this is just
Ram timing Ram voltage and then Ram
frequency which is based on the XMP on
this which is thirty-two hundred mega
rig megahertz that's not that fast I
mean when we were overclocking for our
you know lnto stuff we were doing four
thousand so that's not that fast but I
want to see what just allowing faster
RAM access for the CPU does if anything
yeah so we lost a hundred points
interesting for sanity let's go back on
a side note we ended up putting the PCH
fan as well as the the heatsink fans for
the V RMS to max because even under idle
conditions
the V RMS were hot like just touching
the heatsink was like holy crap so that
was one thing worth pointing out okay
that now we're back to just out of the
box settings 2133 so interestingly
enough even by going back to the default
settings we still are slightly even
below where we were just a second ago so
we lost like a hundred points from one
reboot to the next we made sure of iris
protection was off all that sort of
stuff that can be running so I don't
know I don't know what happened but I
mean I can't complain about that score
and this is all stocks what we're gonna
do right now is we're gonna go ahead and
we're not gonna save that score or gonna
do a little bit of tuning to the GPUs
real quick we're gonna run 3d mark and
we're gonna get 3d mark in a Cinebench
score and then we'll play around the
overclocks and see how much farther we
can actually push it if that much at all
we're hitting 63 C on water with it
currently where it's at we might only
receive like 4.5 or 4.4 maybe I think
Steve was running like obviously ice
water to get it to the temperature the
speeds that he was getting which was 5
gigahertz so
yeah let's see how far we can get it
will hit 160 12 for 105 107 50 65 16
alright so we added a little bit of
exhilarate culling to this we're pushing
some air down between the cards cuz you
know SLI configs even though there's a
slot between still needs some better
airflow for the top card we overclocked
our graphics cards to about 2130 and
then we added two fans for the RAM
because the RAM was getting kind of cold
or cold yeah we wish she was getting
kind of toasty we gained a thousand
points that's crazy
look at that leave that like each time
the bar moved to the right the
likelihood of hearing it went a higher I
think we're getting a pretty good feel
for where this CPU can land obviously at
this point stability comes with
temperature you it's already been proven
that has a six get colder a perform
better I mean that's why you use extreme
cooling for overclocking 15,000 597
wasn't a 15100 we had to beat 50,000 no
50,000 to something right if I reach the
point to where I can't remember numbers
anymore what's my phone number I don't
know
13,000 284 okay so yeah we're just a tad
above above that 15,000 597 15,000 575 I
mean that like at that that's almost
matched our other score which is funny
because we're not running chilled water
yeah a 480 rad with regular room temp
you know air going through and this is
not the coldest room this is way warmer
than our other studios we have no air
conditioner in here okay so looking at
Steve score with two cards and a 31 75 X
he has CP score 15,000 585 we got a
fifteen thousand five to six on our GPU
still a sixteen thousand eight seventy
so obviously a commanding lead right our
GPU is clearly lacking here I really
want to see how close we can get not
today but this is obviously just us
trying to reignite
the ignition on reignite the ignition
and accelerate with Nas the rip Jian
theory because that was fun
God it's not gonna happen it's not gonna
happen this week but we need to bring in
exotic cooling
I wasn't expecting our CPU score to be
that far I know for a fact he was using
chilled water so what was he testing
that with I know he hit five gigs
because he did that on live stream so
how the hell did he hit five gigs max
turbo core clock we were four point
eight one five but got a higher CP score
than him I think I think this needs to
happen and before we see each other face
to face next month
alright guys you heard it here rip DN is
back on and my Titan r-tx cards are
getting ripped apart alright guys thanks
for watching this long video literally
we can't work at this for like ten
efforts wait too long no I'm just
totally I don't understand what's
happening here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
