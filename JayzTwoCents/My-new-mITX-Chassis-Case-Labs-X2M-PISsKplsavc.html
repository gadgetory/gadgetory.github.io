today we're gonna be taking a look at
what is going to be my new chassis for
my land rig that I'm building I bet you
can't guess who makes it can you
before we talk about the XM - I want to
take a moment to talk to you about a
documentary hosted by Norton security
called most dangerous towns and it
actually follows a few hackers in an
area of Romania that's actually known as
being kind of ground zero of some of the
most notorious hackers in the world my
story is simple I hacked a email account
George Bush Hillary Clinton so much
accounts of the Rockefellers but I am
not sorry for never never in my lifetime
I think what stood out to me most during
this documentary was the interview with
gusoff er who has absolutely no remorse
for hacking into the email accounts of
some of the highest-ranking politicians
in the United States and we're talking
the bushes the Clintons even hacked into
pretty much all of the Rockefellers I
mean it's just absolutely fascinating
what some of these people can do and I
actually had no idea that the internet
in Romania was typically faster than
here anywhere here in the United States
I mean we're talking like complete fiber
optics throughout the entire city
so anyway why don't you go ahead and
head to the link in the description or
the annotation here on the screen and
watch the documentary presented by
Norton security in search of the most
dangerous town on the Internet okay so
today's video is all about the new
chassis I'm using for a land rig that
I'm building you guys know I did the
Parvin build but the parvum case itself
was not very portable friendly it was
made all of acrylic and I wasn't a huge
fan of that now back in December
December guys oh six over six months ago
case labs teased me about an upcoming
chassis that they were doing called the
x2 which was a completely redesigned
micro ITR mini ITX with the micro ATX
variant new chassis for a small
form-factor builds now they currently
have a chassis that's already a mini ITX
but it's a horizontal design and I'm not
a fan of that so we're taking a look
today at the brand spanking new I think
I have one of the very first ones xm2
chassis we're gonna go ahead and dive
into this chassis and show you how it's
modular how you can set it up it's one
of the things case labs is really known
for is it's completely modular designs
where you can definitely make it your
own and kind of set it up for your needs
you don't have to
up your build to the case you can set
your case up to the bill that's one of
the things I love about case labs now
obviously it has a huge side window on
here and it's got a protective film on
there which I'm going to be leaving on
simply because I do not want to scratch
it up but the entire thing the entire
case is made out of a heavy grade
aluminum now I went with white on this
chassis even though I could have done
even a custom color they offered to do a
custom color for me I stuck with white
because I've always wanted to do a white
and green build
I've always liked white and green so
that's what I'm gonna be doing with this
one here now the first thing you can see
here is you have your cutout for your
motherboard which is so easy maybe
because of the fact that it's mini ITX
it's so small in fact you've got all
this open space over here which kind of
leaves you wondering well it's a pretty
decent sized chassis for being a mini
ITX what gives well guys you can
configure this any way you want like I
said you can put in a whole row of drive
cages there if you want you can put in
optical drives you can put in water
cooling obviously we're doing water
cooling you have plenty of room here for
reservoirs and radiators on the top and
on the front and pumps and tubes and
pipes and all that other goodness you
got plenty of room up top here for LEDs
I mean the list just goes on and on I've
already put the feet on this thing and
don't worry guys I'm not gonna hit my
monitor I know you guys are freaking out
there's actually a lot of space between
the back and the monitor is just a
optical illusion but anyway I've already
put the rubber feet on the bottom as you
can see so I guess we'll start on the
bottom a better place than ever you do
have a 140 millimeter fan cut out on the
bottom so you can bring air in if you
want just keep in mind case labs cases
at least at the time of making this
video still are not fan filtered so it's
gonna be pulling in any dirt and debris
that's right on your floor or on your
desk or on your carpets you're gonna
want to keep that in mind
maybe install a fan filter on the inside
but they just it doesn't come with any
filtration options built in now up here
you also have a honeycomb design for the
power supply fan intake so that you can
pull in air from the bottom of the case
again same thing regarding filtration
keep that in mind and so you can exhaust
that right out of the back now on the
back you can see here is your power
supply is going to mount and then you do
have
a rigid mounting system for your
graphics card now one of the things that
I really didn't like about the Parma
build was that it had a very poor at
least in my opinion a very poor mounting
mechanism for the graphics cards on the
back right here you also have a
honeycomb design for the exhaust fan or
it could be an intake technically as
well so it's 120 millimeter and then
you've got your cutout right here for
your mini ITX motherboard now on the
front I've got an optional piece
installed on here and this is the
radiator mount which gives me a place to
be able to mount either to 120 or to 140
millimeter fans as well as a radiator on
the front now the top is already as you
can see it is already pre-cut for
mounting of either to 120 s or two 140
millimeter fans and/or radiator but the
top piece at least as far as I know only
comes in one size you can't actually add
the thicker top piece on here like you
can with like the SMA 8 and the SM
eights and stuff to be able to do
push-pull so as far as I know this is
the only piece available maybe they'll
have other options I'm not sure I didn't
actually order this case this is one
they configured and sent to me based on
what I requested so maybe they will have
a thicker panel but as of right now I'm
not too sure but to give you an idea of
just how rigid this aluminum is this
this sucker is freaking phenomenal and
it's all one piece of aluminum that's
been cut stamped out and then the edges
are press break bent to give it so much
stability in fact I took a tour of the
case lapse facility and it's really
amazing how much work goes into the
quality of the panel's now on the front
here once again we do have the cutout
here the little front panel that you can
pop off and as you can see it's got the
cutout here on the bottom for the power
switch audio options in USB again this
is all configurable so you can pretty
much I just put a stick around there and
s in it whoops you can order this based
on your needs you can get it with just
the power button with just without the
audio without the USB I mean there's a
bunch of different options that they
actually have but here's what I think is
really neat let's say you're not a fan
of having this on the bottom like this
maybe you want the power buttons on the
top well you simply unscrew these two
screws
pull the thing out with all of the wires
put it in the top right here take this
guy flip it over and then you've got
your top mounted buttons so you guys can
actually put it however you want bottom
or top to be honest I haven't decided
how I'm going to do it probably on the
bottom because of the fact that I'm
gonna have so much water cooling in this
stuff that seems like it would make the
most sense but in any case again as I
mentioned the modular aspect of these
cases is certainly what gives case labs
you know one hell of a a name in the
modding community now let's go ahead and
take a look at behind the motherboard
tray now in order to keep this thing
price pointed at a place where more
people can afford it they've gone ahead
and omitted the removable motherboard
tray which case lives you know has
integrated into their cases so there's
no removable motherboard tray but you do
have the ice it's not a slide-out you do
have these four screws on the back so
you can unscrew those and you can take
the backplate here for the motherboard
off and then you can work on the
motherboard and install it back into the
case and then over here you also have
some mountings for your hard drives you
know SSDs and things of that nature I
don't believe that this is actually
going to fit a three and a half inch
drive on the back it's just simply not
thick enough but you are gonna be able
to fit quite a few SSDs on here and the
cool thing too as well is all of these
holes that are drilled they could work
for either SSD mounts and they could
even work for mounting reservoirs and
such on there so you could use these as
kind of hole guides and then drill
through on the front here you've got
these four screws holding in this cover
plate so that you don't actually have to
do any of the measuring for where the
reservoirs and stuff would go you could
just put a mark on there through the
holes on the back and then drill through
this plate directly as well in terms of
cable management you've got some pretty
large cutouts here these are actually
strapped in I can't get them out of the
way but you have some pretty large
cutouts here to be able to run your
cables through you got slots for your
fans and you've got a slot below and
above the motherboard to cable
management should be pretty easy these
are not grommeted there's no grommets on
here another thing that they did to be
able to accommodate you
keeping things a little bit more price
friendly although you could put rubber
grommets in there without too much
problem but this case was actually
designed with all-in-one coolers more in
mind but still flexible enough to be
able to put a complete custom loop in
here and large enough to put a complete
custom loop in here if you wanted and
obviously that's what we're gonna be
doing with this build so there you go
guys that's a quick look here at the X
m2 from case abbs or brand new mini ITX
chassis that I'm going to be doing a
green and white build in I might end up
putting my 980ti reference in here I
haven't decided I still have the six
seven or how do I keep saying 670 I
still have the 970 g1 gaming from
gigabyte with ek waterblock on there but
I kind of feel like I want to go with as
much power in this thing as I possibly
can so putting the 980 TI reference in
there might make a lot of sense
so anyway guys oh and you know in terms
of depth as well I might as well mention
that so here is the wind force card
which we already took a look at the g1
gaming 980 TI
and you can see for being a mini ITX
chassis just how much length you
actually have in this thing but you can
also see how you have to be careful when
it comes to how you set up your your
water cooling config because you're not
going to have a lot of extra space now
granted the cards got about an inch and
a half of extra length on it which is
gonna add up but yeah you can see it's
gonna be a tight fit no matter how you
go about it so it's gonna be a
challenging build but I think it's gonna
look really good and I mean shoot with
how much stuff that crammed in the part
of them this is gonna be a piece of cake
so anyway thanks for watching I hope you
guys have enjoyed today's video follow
on social media if you have any
questions I don't know exactly when this
video went live to be honest with you
I've kind of shooting a bunch of videos
because I'm going to e3 in fact by the
time this goes up I may have already
went to e3 it might be past tense I
don't even know I don't even know
anymore
I'm just gonna go ahead and get the heck
on out of here guys thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
