they're gonna overheat your noob don't
you know that the fluid will just pass
right through the first card and not
even cool it so disappointed J thought
you actually knew something about water
cooling yeah this video is just a little
overdue if I had a dollar for every
single time somebody told me that I was
doing my parallel configurations wrong
and then it wasn't going to work and
that the cards were going to overheat
ever since I started doing red mist and
then skunk works and now skunk works
version 2.0 I would be able to build
another Tower because I'm telling you
right now there's an awful lot of
misinformation and just flat-out
unexperienced people out there claiming
to know that parallel configurations
with the inlet and outlet on the same
side won't work now let me tell you what
they think is happening and then I'll
tell you what's really happening now in
order to try and keep it simple on what
they think is happening I'm going to use
a two card configuration example rather
than the triple card configuration like
I have but rest assured the fluid
dynamics are exactly the same whether it
be 1 2 3 4 5 10 or 5000 cards the fluid
dynamics will remain the same now what
they think is happening is that the
coolant will enter in the first card
that was actually a pretty dirty gesture
wasn't it's going to enter in the first
card sorry pass straight through it
because they think that the fluids going
to go oh we don't want to go through
that block we want to go to the you know
the farthest point out there which might
be Pluto I don't know but in this case
they think it's going to pass right
through the first card go through the
second card back down through the first
card completely ignoring the first card
altogether or at the very least I've
heard some people say well the card will
fill but the fluid won't go anywhere
it'll just sit there because it's like
traffic the fluid can't it's got its
blinker on but no one will let it in the
fluid just sits there in the card
because the flow in and out between the
actual inlets and the second card are
taking up all of the space and that
fluid has nowhere to go
now that is a whole bunch of horseshit
it
work that way people what actually
happens here is the fluid wants to take
the travel of least resistance now how
is it going to do that when you have two
blocks in there easy it's going to split
the flow evenly between the two if
there's an if on this if both of the
blocks are identical if you put two
different blocks in there you're going
to end up splitting the flow between
them but it's not going to be an equal
split because the least resistance block
is going to get more flow and the high
resistance block is going to get less
flow that way you have an equal Inlet
and outlet flow rate now all of this
works because of two major principles
that is path of least resistance and
flow rate as long as those two things
are present no matter what the cards
will always get equal flow between them
not even hurt some people claim to be
experts to go as far as to say well you
have to add some sort of resistor into
the top card otherwise you're not going
to introduce enough resistance forcing
the flow that's bypassing the first car
to actually make that 90-degree Bend I
know I'm a scientist I train Stephen
Hawking I mean that's what so many
people actually think now there's
something else that people tend to think
is going to happen when you have a
parallel config and that being that one
card is going to suffer dramatically
versus the other card in terms of
temperatures now that's not actually
true in fact I have found that
temperatures are a bit more stable and
equalized between multiple cards when
you do a parallel config because the
temperature of one card is not
influencing the other all the naysayers
saying this isn't going to work this is
it going to work Jay you're just doing
it because it looks pretty and you don't
want to admit that doesn't work right
that doesn't make sense that's like I
can't even wrap my head around that one
no matter how much I try so let's go
ahead and guys I've had a valley
benchmark running in the background long
before this video started during this
entire video
in fact I've even had if you can see it
right there a thermometer set up or not
monitor but it's a it's an air meter it
measures the airflow this is how I know
that my fans are actually working oh and
I want to point out something else this
whole test was done with airflow fans AF
140 fans on
remember how people say airflow fans
don't work on radiators blah you're dumb
so we're kind of like just bustin all
the myths on this one aren't we so I've
got a temperature probe on there and
right now the intake temperature to that
radiator because this room is freakin
hot right now because I've got three
graphics cards dumping heat into the
atmosphere it's 81 degrees or 80 point
nine degrees Fahrenheit I don't know
what that actually equates to in Celsius
in fact I can find out let's check in
Celsius that is actually 72 point two
degrees Celsius and we are 80 point nine
degrees Fahrenheit now if I stuck this
on the outlet side of the the back side
of the case it's actually bumps up to
almost 90 degrees so why am I even
showing you this I want to show you in
fact we just went up to if you can see
that you might be able to see because of
the focus we just went up to 81 point
one degrees Fahrenheit yeah it's pretty
warm in here so the reason why I'm
pointing that out is that if I was going
to have cooling capacity issues and the
way the flow is set up in a hot room
like this it would certainly be more
evident so let's go ahead and turn
around and get into the computer and see
what the temperatures actually look like
all right so here is my Triple A
parallel configuration right here it
actually enters in this card first then
splits off to there and then splits off
to there so all three of my cards are
getting one-third of the input flow rate
because they are all exiting out one
third well because you have three cards
and they're going to divide the flow
amongst them so now with the room
currently being let's see right now it
is currently yeah eighty point nine
still in here so we're holding very
constant which means my cooling system
is not heating up any more than it is we
are at full capacity and if we scroll
over here right now and see if we can
get that in focus the cards are
currently sitting at forty seven forty
while they're fluctuating 48 48 48 well
I think we just kind of put this one to
bed didn't we yeah hopefully we can
actually see that let's go ahead and get
the camera a little closer here
sorry about the shakiness but I really
just want this to be put to bed once and
for all so as you can see the top cards
48 the middle card 48 the bottom card 48
yeah there you go
now again I'm sorry about having to
point the camera at the screen but here
is our MSI Afterburner from when we had
those tests running and I just want to
show you top card max temp 50 degrees uh
let's see oh sorry there we go top card
max temp 50 degrees middle card max temp
50 degrees bottom card max temp 49
degrees now you guys saw when we were
doing the test they were actually
sitting more like 48 those are max temps
right there they don't actually show me
the average but as you can see myth
busted so there you go guys James two
cents busting the water cooling troll
myths out there and all I want to ask of
you is if you guys see any forums or any
other posts or comments of people saying
you can't do inlet/outlet on the same
side of a parallel configure them this
video because I know it's not going to
shut them up overall but at least if we
can just get some people educated and we
create this army of people saying
parallel configs do work with inlet and
outlet on the same side will make the
water cooling enthusiast community
stronger as a whole hope those videos
helped you guys once and for all
this videos overdue but better late than
never I hope you guys are enjoying the
videos I'm doing here on x99 and whatnot
follow on Twitter if you guys have any
questions about this now hopefully this
video made sense to you guys if not just
ask me your questions I'll do the best I
can to actually answer them in a manner
which you can you can grasp it because I
know it's kind of a weird concept it's
like it's like helicopters physically
speaking they just shouldn't work but
they do whatever Jase your sense guys
thanks for watching and I get the heck
on out of here
see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
