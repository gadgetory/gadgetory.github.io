why I say it brand-new is of course it
has been refreshed for q3 q4 of 2016 now
we're going to be doing a full benchmark
review of this including our gaming
laptops worth it but because I wanted to
do an unboxing we kind of have to do
that first water cooling parts for
skunkworks were provided by performance
pcs for the largest online selection of
PC modding and water cooling parts head
to performance pcs comm it's not much
more satisfying in this world than the
sound of ripping that plastic on new
electronics just call this like a sights
and sounds of the J's unboxing and there
we go especially a little dent on the
box right there I hope it's a it's okay
so real quick this thing's actually kind
of weighty let's talk about the specs in
this guy the panel is a 17.3 inch UHD
panel that is a 3840 by 2160 resolution
also known as well.you HD it's not real
true 4k but you get what I'm saying it's
a non glare type screen unfortunately
it's still a TN panel it's not an OLED
or any of that stuff so yeah that's
future stuff but we'll get there the
core of this thing is an i7 6820 HK
running at 2.7 gigahertz so that's four
cores eight threads in this bad boy
doesn't unlock CPU so we can actually
overclock this and that's when things
will look at moving forward here to the
GPU in this is a full gtx 1070 it is not
a shaved down core it is not a mobile
core it is a full-blown 1070 now for ram
we have 32 gigabytes 16 gigabyte 6 x 2
of GE ddr4 and it's running at 2666 and
it's g.skill memory and of course got
256 gigabyte m2 mdme PCIe SSD and it's
got a 1 terabyte 7200 RPM storage drive
and it is it is running Windows 10
alright guys the moment you have all
been waiting for where J drops his
laptop
okay presentations pretty good we've got
the laptop right here in a nice
protective bag which is always nice to
see let's go and start with the
accessories here you have got of course
your SC 17 gaming user manual it really
should just have big bold words that say
play shit like literally just play some
stuff anywhere else do you really need
to know
it also has right here it appears we
have a USB to USB type-c adapter on
there is actually rip on the back and it
also has analog three-and-a-half
millimeter plug to a single 300
millimeter so you can use your favorite
headphones on a single jack so also
means you use things like your favorite
earbuds or whatever you might use when
you're on the go so you don't that you
switching around headphones because you
guys know that they have a separate plug
while they got the adapter as well so
here are the power bricks well power
brick I should say it's nice and flat I
like this because it's gonna lay down
flat in the backpack it's not a big
thick giant brick that you would see
like kind like I have with my Asus g7 5
1 o g7 5-1 JK I think it's what's called
whatever and then of course you've got
your other end of it right there then a
whole lot in here which is kind of nice
there's not a whole lot of fluff in the
box if you will this is the part we care
about right here now EVGA recently
started dabbling in the whole laptop
slash notebook slash gaming notebook
market and how does the company that has
been in business now since 2001 actually
its 99 but I digress so here it is right
here but has a company that has been
known for making graphics cards that now
makes motherboards and peripherals
actually do when it comes to laptops
well as you can see this thing is
extremely just simple and I like that it
is an all aluminum case right here there
is no plastic on this thing with the
exception of maybe the grill right here
for the fans you can see it pulls air in
here and then exhaust it there so again
you wanna be mindful pieces on your lap
because you want to overheat the thing
but plenty
events all metal I like that even the
Torx screws that are used on this thing
are machined and they look fantastic Wow
I mean EVG has put a lot of effort into
this
oh also too you have a massive rubber
pad right here and also too on the front
so this thing is not going to go sliding
around anya and then on the top right
here of course you have the EVGA logo so
underneath right here we have another
little protective thing for the keyboard
it is a backlit keyboard will go and
power this thing on and see if there's
any battery juice in there at all nope
looks like I'm gonna have to plug it in
now the right side of the laptop here
you push you have a Kensington lock you
have two USB 3.0 s and then of course
you have the 3.1 type C plug that you
can use for an adapter right there for
wherever else you might want to use one
thing I want to note though is this does
not have an optical drive in there so
EVGA has gone the way of well done away
with optical drives and never to make
this as thin as possible
you got speakers right here on the front
that face you which is nice the right in
front of us or not back here by the
monitor than underneath the monitor or
anything like that then of course we do
have backlighting on the keyboard not
sure if the camera is actually picking
it up it is white backlighting yeah the
keys are a nice field or flat though
they're not domed and they're not dished
they are flat keys you have to use to
type it on this like any other laptop
and then of course on the left hand side
right here we have got our land port
HDMI output and two mini display ports
on there now one thing I want to mention
real quick is the screen is an
anti-glare coating and as you can see
because I have got a lot of lights and
stuff right here you can see that it is
not a glossy finish so this is going to
be nice I've had laptops in the past
that have had glossy screens and
although they make the colors pop better
it also the glare just really sucks so
anyway yeah there's that one other thing
I want to show you too is that the EVGA
logo does in fact light up that's a neat
little feature right there it's just
it's not like in-your-face it's just a
nice simple white backlit logo right
there looks but
now I'm not going to go into a whole lot
of details regarding the performance of
this guy yet because I will be doing a
full-scale review on this guy
but I just want to talk about kind of a
few things the one of the things I don't
like about this finish and I kind of
haven't liked is as you can probably see
finger skin oils get really attracted to
this kind of a matte finish and it looks
dirty quickly same thing with the
keyboard and same thing with the wrist
pad but it's one of those things where
if you know if you're gonna go black
it's just something you've got to deal
with and I'm glad they didn't go with
the way of silver it would have looked
way too Apple MacBook like but in terms
of the form factor the weight it's a
little bit heavy but we'll talk more
about that in the full review but when
you've got a full metal chassis like
this guy right here you need to expect
it to be waiting I mean that's just
that's just the best it's gonna happen
that is all for today now I know not all
of you like unboxing videos and I kind
of like the experience of opening
something new and taking it out of the
box I think we all do so for those of
you that do like it and I also put a
poll up on Twitter and it was pretty
overwhelmingly in favor of doing
unboxings as long as they're followed up
with a review which I am of course going
to do a full scale review thank you guys
for watching today's video now here's
where you guys come in I need something
from y'all
yeah I said y'all in from California
deal with it I need you guys to tell me
what kind of tests you want me to put
this thing through I plan on doing a
rendering test because one of the things
I wanted this laptop for is mobile
rendering and when I'm doing 4k stuff
like now the 32 gigabytes is definitely
going to help it still use 64 but 32 is
going to help the 1070 of course being a
full scale 1070 and overclockable we
want to check out games let me know what
games you guys want me to check out and
what kind of tests you want me to do
I've never done a full scale laptop
review so I'm curious as to what it is
you guys want to see anyway give this
video like if you liked it let me know
guys vote let me know if you like these
unboxings you want me to do more because
I want to listen to the audience on this
one and see what you guys have to say
the majority wins so if you don't vote
you don't count
just like the election coming up I guess
but that's home now you're gonna go
near that thing with a thousand-foot
pole it's time to go guys thanks for
watching let me get my Steam library on
here and start playing some games in the
meantime tell me what you guys want to
see see you the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
