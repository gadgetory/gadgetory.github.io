here at the LG booth that's got a lot
going on here we got some nano sales
stuff to talk about new a9 processors
going in the new OLED TVs but I know
first and foremost of my audience is PC
and PC enthusiasts gaming enthusiasts
and desktop panels are going to be more
of where your interest is now I have
been paying attention big-time to what
you guys are saying in my videos and
other people's videos regarding desktop
panels and what I'm hearing and correct
me if I'm wrong what I'm hearing is that
you guys don't care about flashy and
over-the-top blinking lights and all
these gimmicks you guys want a great
panel you want a high refresh rate panel
good color good price good performance
with all that aesthetic crap coming
later or not at all so that's why LG has
got a really refreshing display here of
what they're bringing in 2018 regarding
some of their panel technology so we're
gonna come over here we're to start
right here this is the 27 UK 850 what
you're gonna notice right here is we are
seeing a growth and you guys I know it's
loud I'm gonna do the best I can here
but we're seeing a growth in HD our
panels HDR is the next biggest thing
getting big better brights better darks
higher dynamic range giving you a more
immersive recreation of color and bright
so this right here as I said 27 UK 850
its srgb 99 percent color calibrated HDR
10 freesync technology so all you AMD
users can rejoice that you got another
free sync panel option here amazing
sounding speakers inside I know you
can't hear it in this video they've
they've not just gone the typical route
of well gamers are just gonna use
headphones and speakers which is very
true but in a pinch or a land party or
something having that sound source is
nice just nice to have well it's
obviously refreshing here though it's a
design philosophy you can see we've got
some elegant black and some nice
aluminum or aluminium for those of you
across the pond a nice curved base right
here it's not crazy or ridiculous now
this is more of a content creator
producer type of panel it's all about
IPS not so much about the the refresh
rate so it but it is 4k as you can see
we got a timeline showing right here but
if you're more interested in a larger
format then you can check out this right
here which is the 32 UK 950 this is a 32
inch or a 31 and a half inch UHD 4k nano
cell IPS panel so the video we did
earlier about the nano-cells Super HD
TVs and it's amazing 60 degree off
viewing access you can have that now on
your desktop so I've taken that they
shrunk it down it's HDR 600 98% DCI p3
but again it has that same base it looks
fantastic and if you're a content
creator of business professional this
can go on your desk it'll look great for
games to 60fps of course and it's not
going to embarrass you and of course
with its Thunderbolt 3 it is daisy chain
of all especially for you macbook users
you can daisy-chain that I'm an
ultra-wide freak and the reason for that
is I like to game an ultra-wide I like
to edit in ultra-wide and I don't want
to have different panels for different
use cases or scenarios I want to be able
to have one that I can switch back and
forth between different use cases and be
satisfied with either so that's why I
like 21 by nine panels especially when
I'm editing in a timeline with my own
Opie timeline or even moving on to some
other editors this right here is the 34
wk 95 you it's a 34 inch 5 K 2 5 k 2k
panel nano cell IPS again HDR 600
Thunderbolt 3 DisplayPort to HDMI and
again amazing sound built-in we also
have this same panel over here in the 38
wk 95 SIA is a 38 inch ultra wide panel
right here again HDR 10 with srgb 99
percent to 38 40 by 1600 so it's
actually stretching that resolution a
little bit farther this is also gaming
oriented because it does have AMD
freesync in there so if you guys are
looking for a single panel to do all
your work and your gaming on any up AMD
GPUs to take advantage of precinct this
is definitely something to keep in mind
that's fine in all J I'm not a
livestreamer I'm not a Video Editor I'm
not a youtuber I just want a a really
good gaming panel and I like a little
bit more of an aggressive look well
that's why LG's got the 34 gk9 50 G it's
a 21 by 9 q HD 34 40 by 1440 again nano
IPs you can see a trend here they've
taken that culture HR that Super HD nano
cell technology and their TVs that we
saw earlier in 2017
and now taking it to your desktop so
we've got a game mode black stabilizer
once again a sync technology but this is
AG sync panel but it also has spear
lighting if you take a look on the back
right here you can see we indeed have
some integrated RGB lighting now it's
not going to integrate with your aura
your mystic RDP or any of that but it is
going to give you some nice ambient
light but it's on the back it's not in
your face it's not gaudy and which is
what I'm hearing most of you complain
about when it comes to monitor
manufacturers going with the RGB craze
that seems to really be triggering a lot
of people but it's also got a subtle
curve to it which I don't mind sitting
right in front of it especially when
gaming all of my panels I've been using
for the last two years now are actually
curved panels but it's very subtle it's
not too ridiculous and of course you've
got all your normal adjustments your
tilt your height your swivel this right
here I have no idea I'm pricing on this
stuff so you guys are gonna have to go
and look up those model numbers this
right here is definitely one of the
pinnacles of their gaming panel
technology obviously they have a lot of
stuff on display right here that's just
a couple of the items that I found
interesting here at CES 2018
specifically regarding LG desktop
displays so anyway if you guys want to
learn more about LG and what they have
on display head on over to LG
and as always a huge thank you to our
sponsors for CES 2018 EVGA for making
this year's trip happen guys thanks for
watching and as always I will see you in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
