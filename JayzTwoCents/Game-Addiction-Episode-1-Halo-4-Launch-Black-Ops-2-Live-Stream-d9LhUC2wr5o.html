you're checking out my brand new series
called game addiction where I talk about
all this crap right here we're talking
about games and I'm going to bring you
everything you need to know when it
comes to the industry of gaming we're
talking pc games xbox playstation wii u
I just spit at you sorry let me get that
we're good I cleaned it up anyway we you
d s all that crazy stuff and this is a
very exciting time to be really into
games because we've got some blockbuster
hits that are coming out in the next few
weeks we're gonna discuss it and that's
a ramble rant why do I always do that
I'm always ranting I don't so how many
of you have ever shopped at gamestop I
bet you have I've shopped at gamestop
traded and stuff gotten ripped off like
you on the trade-in values this week
Frank Christopher Oliveira who is the
vice president of corporate
communications and public affairs and
already just sounds like a shady job
anyway he pled guilty this week to
embezzle II nearly two million dollars
from gamestop and what he would do is he
had this corporation that he built on
paper called cloud communications and
when he would do every single month is
he would funnel some money from game
stuff into cloud communications and then
he would move the money out of cloud
into his personal bank account basically
it's the world's worst laundering fraud
because it's all traceable anyway he
pled guilty today to embezzling nearly
two million dollars here's the thing it
carries up to a 20-year sentence in
federal prison because he was doing it
through the mail so he pred pled guilty
to mail fraud which carries a 250
thousand dollar fine and up to 20 years
in federal prison so I don't know if
they're gonna be able to get this money
back gamestop obviously declined comment
not to me I'm not that big but they
declined comment to the gaming media
source called joystick and no one was
available for immediate comment maybe
that's because the guy that was in
charge of their public affairs is now in
jail
make sense to me so if you follow me on
Twitter and if you don't why not you
should be following me on Twitter you
would know I've been tweeting that I
haven't owned an xbox well on Saturday I
went out and bought a whole new Xbox set
up and now I've got one of these now
feels kind of it's kind of weird not too
sure are you supposed to do with this
like anger face ah gamer cramp oh man
I'm not used to this stuff but seriously
though folks I just picked up a brand
new xbox 250 gig all the crazy to
go with it and I plan on building my
game library and I want to start
including some reviews and such on
various Xbox games so if you've got any
games that you recommend that I play I'm
open to just about anything I'm not a
specific niche I don't care if it's
racing game RPG shooter games doesn't
really matter tell me what I should
check out i'll check it out but i'd like
to hear your suggestions of what you
think i should try out especially since
i'm coming from a pc world and i feel
completely virgin when it comes to
console gaming I just can't believe I
just said I feel like a virgin like the
bird gin yeah and if you want my
gamertag know so I set it back in the
very first episode of tech addiction
that's my other series check it out here
Assassin's Creed 3 launched last week
and ubisoft is reporting that is their
largest launch ever in the UK they've
sold over a hundred and seventeen
thousand copies and fifty-nine percent
of that was accounted for by the xbox
360 alone it's also the second-largest
launch of any game ever in that region
only being beaten by NBA 2k13 so of a
soft couldn't be happier with the
success of Assassin's Creed 3 in the UK
which is really interesting because
since it's all about the American
Revolutionary War aren't you like Indian
killing red coach that's sick you guys
are sick anyway it also beat out the
launch in the United States so that's
pretty cool news i said it looks like a
great game I haven't picked it up yet
haven't decided I'm gonna buy the game
or if I'm gonna borrow the game I hate
to say it but black ops 2 is coming out
to save my pennies gotta save my pennies
so how many of you remember back in the
day grand theft auto san andreas and if
you remember the protagonist or the main
character of the story was Carl CJ
Johnson so one of the backup singers for
cypress hill by the name of Michael
Washington is claiming that they used
the likeness of Cypress Hill as their
main protagonist in the game so what do
they do they suit rockstar for 250
million dollars for using the life story
of Cypress Hill 250 million dollars I
can't Apple motorola samsung microsoft
little guys back up singers games you
just if you're in America you're gonna
get sued now I'm going to get sued for
saying you're going to get sued and I'm
going to sue you for suing me for suing
you yeah so he lost his original court
case he took it to an appeal and he just
lost it to the appellate court as well
they determined that the character CJ or
Carl CJ Johnson looks like hundreds of
black men out there I'm going to sue
anyone who's tall fat and white get
right on that so on sep tember 30th sony
revealed its quarter 3 earnings for the
year and it's also revealed that it's
been down 15 point eight percent in
revenue compared to court or two and
they're attributing the 15-point eight
percent slide to the lack of sales of
the playstation 3 and the playstation
PSP but what's interesting about that is
developers are starting to say that sony
has been in contact with them regarding
the developers kit for the PlayStation 4
who knows we could see a new playstation
4 next year but as it stands right now
if you own a PlayStation 3 you're a
dying breed it appears to be so this
week an illegitimate stream featuring
black ops 2 which was a leaked copy of
the game has made its way onto YouTube
and it's caught the attention of
treyarch leading treyarch designer david
vonderhaar said if you're gonna stream
the game early at least be good at it so
bro he basically said you suck so
treyarch being is cited by the
excitement and the popularity of the
black ops 2 stream said legitimate
streams are coming this week
and there's two streams I personally
want you to check out when it comes to
black ops 2 on midnight of the release
I'm going to be in los angeles at the
Yash and ptfo 24 hour livestream for the
black ops 2 launch event and there's
going to be some big names there

MLG shout caster is bringing it back
