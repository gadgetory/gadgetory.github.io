sentient I don't know about you but I
sure as heck like a good knockout I'm
not talking about you have seen them not
even talking about our fists I'm talking
about put two graphics cards
head-to-head in the same price point
insane who comes out the winner
now today I'm going to go ahead and do a
comparison video these are actually
pretty rare on my channel I don't do
very many of these but considering the
fact that AMD cards have really come
down in price like weirdo I mean it just
was like it was just a mew swears that
they've got the pricing under control
after the whole bitcoin mining craze
just fo barred everything up and so
graphics cards on the AMD side have
really come down in price and let's made
it difficult for you guys as buyers to
determine which brand gets your money so
what we're going to do today is we're
going to go ahead and take the tried
true and tested gtx 760 and we're going
to go ahead and pit it against this XFX
r9 280 now you guys also know i don't
really like to talk about pricing
pricing as dynamic it's always changing
and i can't update what i say in this
video after i upload it pricing changes
like it did with the bitcoin mining
craze i'm not going to be able to come
back and edit this and keep up to date
on the pricing so it's going to be up to
you guys to make sure that if you're
checking this video out way into the
future or in the past you're going to
want to make sure that you check out the
links down below that will take you to
the current pricing of these cards
because anything could have changed now
there's a couple of things i want to
talk about first when it comes to these
cards
now the 760 the EVGA 760 right here this
is not an overclocked version and it's
also there ACX cooler with one fan which
is very similar to the reference cooling
it's got a little bit beefier heatsink
in there but it's only got one fan so
i'm going to kind of take the
temperature tests of these two cards i'm
going to sort of throw them out the
window i don't think it's very fair
especially since the r9 280 here this is
not annex just a 280 it's featuring
their dual fan design dual 90 millimeter
fans but if you want to get really
technical this card is typically a lot
hotter than this card so you're just
going to have to kind of I mean I'll put
what the temperatures are in there with
the max temps were and the minimum temps
but I don't think it's going to be
extremely fair now I'm sure you guys
have already said multiple time
and some of you may have even already
typed it in the comments Jay why the
heck are you taking a 760 and putting
against a 280 we remember guys the point
of this video is what can you get for
your money today and at the time of
filming the GTX 760 right here is
actually 20 dollars more expensive than
the 280 I mean that's just kind of like
mind-blowing now when it comes to their
predecessors these 760 is pretty much
equal to the previous 670 and the 280 is
pretty much just a rebranded 7950 on the
AMD side now one of the things to note
is the 280 card here does not only
feature the you know big 200 or the big
90 millimeter fans you know two of them
has their double dissipation for maximum
airflow cooling and it has unlocked
voltage so overclocking on this guy is
going to probably be pretty cool now
this is again as I mentioned the SC or
this is not an ST this is a base model
but we'll see it's probably still going
to overclock pretty decently now when it
comes to just overall out-of-the-box
specs I do think the 280 is going to
have a little bit of an advantage so
let's go ahead and start this
competition off by taking a look at
styling and let's see which card wins
the visual arena now when it comes to
the GTX 760 it is pretty boring looking
I mean this is just their basic ACX
cooler and yes and well the wear guys
that there are other versions of the 760
available I do know that there is the
760 from MSI the twin frozer that has
you know the multiple fan design on
there they do even have the dual fan AC
X style now I didn't get to choose the
card so don't hold that one against me
but we're going to go ahead and see how
well this one performs it's pretty much
stock base model look if you will it's
kind of plain kind of boring for the
most part this is what you're going to
see when you look at your card the side
right there and the top it's got a gloss
PCB on there it looks very nice you got
a nice rubber connector there that
covers up the bridge so I do think the
styling on here looks nice it's very
basic though if you're going for a
blingy build it's probably not going to
make you super happy now when it comes
to the Department of looks I have to
give this one to
you the 280 because look at that that is
just a sexy sexy looking card it's got
chrome accents everywhere the dual 90
millimeter fans I see I count one two
three four five six copper heat pipes in
there that's going to tame all the heat
that this card is guaranteed to generate
the PCB on the back is matte finish so
you can see right there that's got very
little shine to it at all and the cooler
actually extends above the top of the
card so it makes the card actually look
shorter than it is because it's so fat
but you have to be mindful of that
because if you're going with a case that
has very low profile a very low
clearance you need to look at or see
that you have about an inch extra of
height right there so when it comes to
looks I've got to give this to the 280 I
mean you can see the heat sink extends
the entire length of the card it just
looks really really freaking cool I
specifically requested the XFX model I
did get a choice of the 280 that I
wanted to review because I chose the F
XFX because you guys are always asking
me how I feel about this brand and I
hadn't used the XFX since like the 8800
series was around with Nvidia so we're
talking like five years six years
somewhere around there so I decided to
go with the XFX and I am not
disappointed
whatsoever so round one looks goes ahead
and it is given to the XFX 280 that is
just hot and this looks better to me
than the win 4 so the twin froze or any
of those I just really really like the
looks of that all right so enough
talking about the physical properties of
the card let's go ahead and throw them
in my test rig back there let's check
temperatures to check overclocking
frames per second on battlefield 4
I've got some other games in there I
don't remember what I installed I
installed a few games in there so guys
let's go ahead and throw these things in
the machine not literally I don't don't
throw them in the machine I did that
once and ended up very badly well there
you have it guys before we talk about
some of the highlights of these cards
why don't we go ahead and throw some
benchmarks up on the screen and put some
graphs and stuff up there for you guys
to go ahead and geek out over pause the
video on the graphs that you want to
take a look at and then we'll come back
with some final thoughts on these cards
and see
which one is the winner now as with all
head-to-head comparisons you have to
have a winner and if I had to choose a
winner today
well that winner would by far be my GTX
780 all right all right I know guys I'm
a PC snob I can't help it
it's just who I am but I will say this I
have to give credit where credit is due
and considering the fact that five years
ago six years ago two hundred and fifty
dollars or less for a graphics card
would not have gotten you anywhere near
the performance that you can get today
for less than two hundred and fifty
dollars both of these cards were able to
handle any game I threw at it maximum
settings on a 1080p resolution and
basically just play it without me
thinking to myself all these frames per
second kind of suck no they were over 60
frames per second in every single game
and test I threw at it that's a huge
plus if you guys are using 60 Hertz
panels in 1080p either one of these
cards are amazing at that at that price
point and that performance number now
both of these cards clearly are very
different let's go and talk about
temperatures now to try and make things
fair I ran the 760 at a hundred percent
fan speed because it was reaching its
Boost 2.0 speed of temperature of 81
degrees Celsius between 80 and 81 which
is where Boost 2.0 was set up when I set
the fan to 100% it capped out at 67
degrees Celsius but if you were to ditch
the blower style cooler you probably
sitting be sitting right around that 67
degrees Celsius mark at all times
now the two lady without touching the
fan profile at all just out of the box
it capped out at 70 degrees Celsius in a
closed
with an overclock now speaking of
overclocks the 760 has a factory setting
of 1,100 and I could look at my notes
here 24 megahertz 1124 and I've got a
stable overclock of 1300 and 33
megahertz it's a pretty decent overclock
more than 200 megahertz overclock and I
got a plus 300 on the memory so as a 600
megahertz overclock on the memory on
this bad boy and that's 67 degrees
Celsius 100% fan speed with those
overclock numbers now the 280 much lower
base clock now granted they're not
directly comparable GPUs they're
different technologies altogether this
was exactly 1,000 megahertz or basically
a gigahertz card and I was able to get
an eleven hundred and seventy five max
overclock stable clock speed so one
hundred and seventy-five megahertz or
seventeen percent overclock when it
comes to 3d mark both these cards we're
sitting like right on top of each other
on their base clocks but once I
overclocked the 280 even though it was a
lesser megahertz it just pulled out way
ahead of the 760 in valley benchmark and
3dmark in fact 3dmark score almost
matches what my 680 was doing last year
so when it comes to gaming
like I said ultra settings on all the
games I was able to push everything to
the right when it comes to the
performance sliders and the the quality
sliders and it stayed above 60 frames
per second in all the games I played it
with now for the three games that I use
for the benchmarks battlefield 4 Tomb
Raider and dirt 3 granted they're all
three pretty much AMD titles we all know
battlefield 4 does not discriminate when
it comes to taking a on a GPU the
760 was getting a 61 frames per second
average on Ultra preset and the 280 was
getting a 62 frames per second on ultra
preset so like I said very very narrow
margin 1 frames per second as well
within the margin of error so both these
cards pretty much perform neck-and-neck
now for Tomb Raider 4 frames per second
higher average on the 280 but also you
get tress effects which is something
done available on the cuda card
technically is but it's just not as good
as it is on the AMD card
and then dirt3 119 frames per second for
the 280 versus 110 on the Nvidia card
now both of these cards although the
performance is very similar they're very
different cards entirely now even though
the 760 has a blower style cooler on it
the performance is pretty much the same
with the speed turned up like I
mentioned is if we had aftermarket
cooling so we have to throw that aside
because the overclock on that was
fantastic
the memory overclocked and so going with
something like a SC or a for the win
Edition we pretty much were already
matching those types of speeds and
beyond anyway so when it comes to both
of these cards the fact that at the time
of recording this 280 is 20 dollars
cheaper than the 760 which it's on top
of and I really hope it doesn't fall
over that'd be very embarrassing you
know if I bump the table that things
going over I just better go ahead and
grab that the fact that this card is
getting higher frames per second higher
synthetic benchmarks better cooling
lower noise granted we can't compare the
cooling I know I just said that it's
really a no-brainer that you would have
to consider the 280 if you have room for
the card it's a longer card than the 760
obviously so what do you think do you
guys have these cards if you have this
280 or this 760 speak up down in the
comments and tell everyone how your
gaming performance has been kind of
performance are you getting what game
titles are you playing help people who
are looking at this video trying to make
an educated decision of which card to
buy make their choices so sound off in
the comments which card are you with and
why guys has been js2 since taking a
look at the XFX 280 and the EVGA 760
here on the channel hope you guys got
some information out of this share it
with somebody think it would help follow
on Twitter if you just want to tweet me
and say hey J you're an asshole and as
always I will see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
