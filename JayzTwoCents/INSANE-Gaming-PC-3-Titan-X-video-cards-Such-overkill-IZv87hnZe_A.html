provided by performance pcs for the
largest online selection of PC modding
and water cooling parts head to
performance pcs comm well guys after
more than a solid week of building and
prepping and redoing things skunk works
version three point seven to six item I
I keep track of how many times we
changed this system but whatever it is
it's done
you
you
in terms of performance nothing's really
changed when it comes to performance
parts in fact I haven't even tried to
see if I can overclock my 5960 ex any
farther on the gigabyte x99 SOC champion
motherboard that I'm using here which is
got those extra pins in there that you
know asus has put on some of their
motherboards which is supposed to allow
for better stability and higher
overclocks
maybe I'll play with that in a little
bit but folks so far hitting 4.6
gigahertz which is what I had on the
EVGA motherboard has been absolutely no
problem whatsoever didn't take any
custom tweaking or anything like that
the memory was was running at 2666 right
now even though it's 3,000 megahertz
dims I haven't tried to really fine-tune
anything I just went to the settings
that I knew worked still running the
same 3 3 Way Titan X is in there running
about fourteen hundred megahertz they
are fifteen hundred megahertz stable but
I'm trying to keep the heat down just a
little bit because even though I have a
560 millimeter and 280 millimeter red
I'm still getting out there so quite a
bit of heat that dumps into there now
but one of the things I want to say is
that I did have some discussions with
some of the folks in Mayhem's trying to
figure out why my GPU temperature loops
around GPU temperatures in the loops
were getting hotter and hotter and they
did tell me that as the nano particles
start to break down and change color
like you were seeing and they're
absorbing all of the crud that was
happening in the loop which we still
don't know exactly what it is the
effective cooling of the pastel does
actually diminish so it actually was the
fluid that was causing the temperatures
to go up but what caused the temperature
are the fluids to break down we still
don't know yet and in fact even even
given all the crap that's going on with
them this week I'm still going to work
with them to try and figure out what the
problem is because that would be very
useful information for you guys as a
community and it's definitely an
obligation of mine to make sure that we
can figure this out since I have some of
the clues here to try and make a better
product the only port the parts that
changed in here obviously three new
water blocks so with clearings I thought
they would look really really good I
like the way they look they look
fantastic as far as I'm
learn the clear CPU block and then we
added the motherboard into the mix now
the south or the I call a coupon
Southbridge the chipset is actually
running about 25 degrees Celsius under
load and then the vrm is actually
running a 30 degrees Celsius under load
overclocked so obviously the including
of the motherboard in the loop was not
necessary
but much more effective than running air
cooling in there in fact the
temperatures don't really seem to change
they always seem to be pretty constant
at those temperatures whether under load
or not
now with the air cooling and the massive
heat pipes and stuff that they had on
this motherboard it's only about 15 to
20 degrees Celsius lower than as it is
if it was air cooled it's one of those
things what was like might as well at
least include it in the loop now of
course the main thing I checked and I
let run for hours actually was Valley
benchmark and then I did some fire
strike and stuff no scores didn't change
obviously the hardware didn't really
change I'm still getting about a forty
six thousand graphic scores like 45
thousand and some change when
overclocked that's a pretty big deal on
fire strike if you ask me a 45,000 GPU
score total score for the system is
right around 30,000 at the normal fire
strike normal and for extreme and all
that and run those tests yet but again
like I said the hardware is the same but
so I don't expect it to be any different
but the temperature is prior to fleshing
the loop and changing out the blocks and
all that stuff changing out the fluid we
were seeing a max temperature of 63
degrees Celsius on the hottest card
which is the one that the monitor is
attached to and then I was seeing
anywhere between 55 and 58 degrees
Celsius on the other two cards which
with for water-cooled setup and that was
without overclocking because as the
temperatures increased in the notice
that things were getting really hot in
that loop I kept bringing down the
clocks to our O's all the way back to
stock and those temperatures were at
stock speeds I knew something was wrong
but now today I have actually let Valley
benchmark run for almost a day I let it
run for a solid day got up in the
morning loaded it up opened up the door
in the window in here so we could have
some airflow and then later last night
actually I turned it off and the max
temperature recorded while overclocked
to fourteen hundred megahertz yeah the
cards were capable of fifteen hundred
but I'm only doing 1400 was seeing a max
temp
forty-four see on the main card and
anywhere between 34 and 36 see on the
other two cards and then when it came to
stock speeds it was ridiculously low it
was like 36 see on the main card and 32
for both of the other cards so
temperatures are obviously doing very
very well but performance wise it's
pretty much all the same part so
performance didn't really change I'm
still getting about a forty five
thousand five hundred graphics score on
fire strike and then I was getting about
a thirty thousand score you know
fluctuates a little bit but I was
getting here between twenty-nine
thousand and thirty thousand on fire
strike scores so that's all pretty much
the same as what it was when it was
yellow now I'm not really seeing any
weird temperature fluctuations at all
why using the Primo chill fluid time
will tell time will tell how that's
going to actually work but so far the
temperatures are amazing the biggest
temperature drop that I noticed quite
honestly was the CPU because the old
block that I was using the old supremacy
block was not it didn't have those
channels that were optimized for the X
99 and 2011 - three platform so I change
that out with a supremacy Evo when I put
in the optimized jet and optimized flow
insert for the X 99 platform the 5960 x
specifically and my god the temperatures
came my my CPU was idling at 40 degrees
Celsius prior to doing the update and
then under load was hitting about 65 to
69 or 70 C when I was rendering and
putting max load on the CPU or doing a
264 but now now with the proper block on
there in the proper inserts it idles at
25 C in fact let's check right now I'm
gonna I'm gonna look right now and see
because I'm kind of curious actually but
I want to make sure that I'm not miss
quoting I've already done this I've
spent a lot of time doing this but I'll
make sure I'm not quitting anything as
cam takes a few minutes to actually you
don't like startup sometimes yeah so the
CPU temperature right now is at 28 C 27
C I mean that is pretty crazy that 13 C
drop and I'm running the same overclock
and the voltage and no it's not running
at like crazy low voltage or anything
like that the voltage is sitting right
now at 1.3 2 volts full-time I don't do
the
I don't do any of the turbo states where
the CPU is allowed to ramp down I leave
it running at the full 4.6 at the full
voltage 24/7 and it is sitting right now
at 1.3 2 volts 4.6 gigahertz 27c idle I
am ecstatic about that because that
tells me I could probably play around
with a little bit more overclocking on
this thing and put more voltage in it I
pretty sure I'm not going to be able to
hit 5 gigahertz table most of these
chips don't think like 1% of them made
it to 5 gigahertz but whatever I digress
I'm super happy with these temperatures
the whole room as a whole is cooled down
with this setup the way it is so I'm
pretty pretty happy I couldn't be any
happier now let's talk about the color
obviously it is not as lit up and
vibrant as it was with the yellow
because obviously the pastel yellow was
reflecting a lot of the light and it was
a bright color but I really like the way
this looks now I'm using the NZXT hue
plus lighting system in there which is
nice because unlike using the lodge
assist corner sticks which I was using
before they had a lot of LEDs in there
and they were super bright and they were
not really dimmable you could dim them
you could hook them up to say a fan
header and kind of reduce that
percentage of fan speed which would also
reduce the voltage to that header and
allow them to dim a little bit but they
were not technically dimmable LEDs and
it can burn them out I don't think it
would damage the fan header I don't want
to find out but the NZXT hue plus allows
me to not only play with the colors
allows me to play with the warmth of the
light so I don't have that really bright
hyper white although on camera it's
going to you know cameras and LED
lighting or any lighting for that matter
are always really hard to recreate and
look accurate not to mention it's going
to depend on the way your screen is
displaying it so that might look blue it
might look purple trust me in person
it's a nice warm light very similar to
like an incandescent light bulb which is
giving it a very nice warm glow in there
which is what I wanted because of the
burnt orange color that we went with in
this system it's on a bright orange it's
a very burnt orange as you can see by
the color of the fluid it's exactly what
I wanted it turned out exactly as I
imagined it and by adding the
nickel-plated fittings in there it give
a nice amount of bling and a nice amount
of reflection and vibrance in there
without counting on the fluid to do it
now before I do these systems and
doesn't matter if it's mine or anyone
elses I spend a lot of time simply
staring at it staring at pictures of it
in fact the wife actually asked me if
the amount of time I say that I spend on
these builds includes the amount of time
I spend literally with my feet up on the
desk just staring at it before I even
did the tubing in this I was sitting
over there on my other desk and I was
sitting back in my chair just arms
folded probably for a solid hour just
staring at it to try and visualize I'm a
very visualized person I don't do
Photoshop I don't I don't sit there and
do mock-ups I just do it in my head and
then I do the best I can to recreate
what I saw as my vision of what would
look like an awesome system and put it
all into the case and I think it turned
out pretty damn good of course it's not
absolutely perfect there are some things
about it that I don't like like for
instance the front panel connectors are
red and yellow yeah red and yellow wire
that are not sleeved all the way to the
end so you can see the tips of that that
bothers me a little bit same thing with
the USB plug for the hue plus it's like
red green and white very Christmas minty
colors but you can't really see them too
well what what you really can't see it
looks phenomenal in here is the cables
that were provided by sanctum sleeving
sanctum has provided the cables for all
of my systems it with the exception of
when I had the 900 d that was actually
provided by Lou tro and those were
extensions but all of the colors and all
of the cables that you've seen custom
sleeves since then had been provided by
joe over at sanctum sleeving and he is
like an absolute master when it comes to
this I don't have the patience I don't
have the time and I certainly don't want
to deal with you know quite honestly
 up my system because I got some
terminals incorrect so if you guys want
to do some amazing cables in your system
you've got to check out sanctum their
website is still a work in progress give
them some time it's a very low manpower
operation and he's got a real time job
or full time job that he does this on
the side so thanks for hooking me up man
I know you don't have a lot of time for
that I do wish that the orange sleeving
was a little bit darker and a little bit
less it's it's not neon but it's
definitely bright I wish it was darker
that way would match the other orange in
the system but I do think it's nice to
have different shades of orange in there
part of the problem is this is the only
color orange available
in the type of sleep that we went with I
could have gone darker with something
like paracord I've dealt with paracord
before in bright colors it's terrible
with rubber grommets leaving black
smudges all over them I dealt with that
with the yellow I didn't want to deal
with that again so I just went ahead and
left it that's one of the reasons why I
went with the warmer light on lighting
that way it didn't make the it didn't
look like cosmic bowling if you will
it's not a neon color it just kind of
looks like it on camera but it's
definitely brighter than the other
orange in the system so I do have to
give some shoutouts here when it comes
to building this system because I can't
afford to build these on my own and and
I wouldn't get to bring you guys these
awesome updates and show you how to do
these water cooling systems and loops
and custom work if it wasn't for my
sponsors and first one first and
foremost performance - pcs comm
everything you see here for the water
loop with the exception of the radiators
which they brokered by the way those
were sent by hardware labs all the way
from the Philippines
they sent me everything you guys see the
pumps the loops the tubing the fittings
the blocks everything came from them
including them stepping in and sending
me the proper block when I up and
got the wrong block for the motherboard
which I still have the wrong one and and
I don't have any use for that and they
can't really resell it because it's been
opened so thanks guys for that quite
honestly if you're looking for water
cooling parts you've got to go and check
them out the system looks awesome but
there's nothing modded in here the case
isnt modded case modding is something I
wish I could do so much but I don't have
a shop I don't have the tools but check
out the mods ooh mmm PC tech Lea
Harrington Darth Beavis yeah even though
Darth and I had a little bit of a spat
he and I are still friends these are
that these are modders these are guys
who literally take craftsmanship and
tools and just make some of the most
amazing systems so if you guys want to
learn more about not just water cooling
but modding like true modding and true
craftsmanship that make sure you guys go
and check out their stuff too but with
all that said it is time to get out of
here guys do me a favor hit me up on
Twitter or the comments here or
something and let me know if you have
any questions about the system it's
really hard to anticipate what people
are going to ask so I try and do the
best I can to let you know about the
builds before they're done that's one of
the reasons why I do the blogs but if
you guys have any questions let me know
maybe I'll do a follow-up video like a
Q&amp;amp;A of why I did this or why I did that
because usually every
you see here there's an alternative
there's something else I could have done
and I I chose the way I did it because
that's just kind of the way I saw it but
maybe there are some questions you guys
have about how I did this or whatever
again I did videos about the preparation
for the system for some vlogs in there
as well as some how to bend so even the
SLI bridge I have a video there on how I
custom painted the SLI bridge how I
change the LED color which I think I'm
going to leave white by the way I think
the white is a really good contrast I
tried to make an orange LED using the
same film method like the flash film to
change the color like I did a yellow
only the orange was really hard to
recreate I tried yellow and red I tried
actual orange film I tried multiple
layers it just wasn't turning out right
so I'm just gonna leave it white for now
anyway guys time to get out of here
thanks for following the build log as
always hope you guys like the system if
not tell me what you would have done
differently and cite some reasons why
you would do it not just I don't like
orange I mean that's a given everyone
has their favorite colors I'm sure
plenty of you don't like the orange a
lot of you said you hated orange but
then on Instagram and Twitter told me
you changed your mind because you think
it looks so good so did I change your
mind let me know down in the comments or
on social media anyway guys time to get
out Titans to get out of here apparently
I can't talk it's the new year's Happy
New Year you guys have a safe New Year's
Eve and I will see you guys in the next
