this is episode he's really gonna go
there aren't you I'm never gonna live
that job never so here we are we're
already out here doing a quest we're
going to save a guy I guess and I'm
shooting rockets in the back of this car
and guess what just because I have a
huger huger blast radius doesn't mean I
have any better aim so deal with very
very true so I guess I guess it'd be
nice to get some feedback on our first
let's play I didn't really see too much
besides you know kind of cool yadda
yadda book I'd really like to see some
honest feedback but we got a cut scene
right now holy crap she's sure spot her
name's teensy likes cuddly and short
walks on the beach the jibes oh did see
that you looks couches did you bring me
that 24-piece Ellie is a big girl like I
say I'd like this here some actual
feedback after we're done this episode
and we didn't script this one at all we
don't even have it we don't have a topic
in mind Oh topics no nothing maybe we'll
just talk about these big chill juicy
delicious boobs right I don't think you
can handle that woman and she's like
three times on ice she defends you over
it and fuck you with her clit oh man all
that real herbal look at him but much
like oh ho it's a way that Ghost an
extra what's that next yes yep you guys
look perfect we reach
let me get out on the motorboat hey oh
gosh okay you've heard your winnings
wait wait let's go up here haha wait
here we go here we go yes le sammich le
sandwich that's terrible let's do this
quest wait wait first class fine shower
yeah wipe wipe her peas off I'm glad
that the analytics say that my audience
is 24 in plus because it's a Stiga
doctor I think testing says
inappropriate like motorboating and
sammich a 400 pound woman huh every time
she moves I think she's gonna knock me
out with them things whoa whoa whoa back
up bro it's like it's a Jabba the Hutt
sister the Mexican drinking worm stop it
mm-hmm let's go that's horrible this
whore hey G you got a timer this time
right I'll miss you le i miss you i
don't see a timer no like for our time
on the actual episode yeah it's all in
my head okay we're gonna go this on by
feel in this one room ish huh we gotta
kill these got hair excellent that'll do
it
whoa ever you can't drive over those
things well there's a chopper after us I
need to heat seekers or something there
we go oh my god oh I got blue hey sounds
on to my little friend even under the
day dad get so good mm-hmm Jake that
trunk there for a box of Twinkies all
speaking of Twinkies and horrible
American accents I watched like a
marathon of honey boo boo don't ask me
why it's just it's like it's like look
the deer-in-the-headlight thing you just
you can't look away up we can't look
away and I guess I know I'd spherical
reality TV sting that show is definitely
not scripted that is just no I mean
there and i'm not i don't like reality
TV at all I can't hit the chopper and we
figure this guy first like I don't like
reality TV at all except for things like
cops or you know the stuff that you know
is not scripted but God if the United
States isn't just being inundated with
these stupid shows like the hills and
you know keeping up with the kardashians
and all that shit oh my god I don't even
want my daughter getting anywhere near a
TV cuz I'm afraid she's just gonna get
stupid by the minute just good well
you've already started down there Stace
to prefer what you know damn for me hey
we watch honey boo boo and she learned
about biscuit and where baby come from
and kind of come from the biscay no cuz
it kind of looks like one if you cook it
from Harvey's some arbys I could not
believe half of the things that were
coming out of that child's mouth yeah
couldn't it I think I've seen one
episode and I've never ah
can do it that just that makes me have a
lot less faith in the American race
repopulating don't put me in a box well
I'm sorry rose hey here's a character
car van what happens if we killed it
Isley car vin what can we do I'm gonna
rob them all right I got your tix bro
contact you did it is a weapon crate up
here you can probably use this stuff
okay but I'm uh that's okay I'll go the
incoming car don't blow it was long
ranger what is he doing down there oh
dude him watch this
go grab the loot ah ok grab the loot to
get up on that oh oh my God he's driving
away without me with all he just ran me

not even shoot at it don't worry hey
doing here we go Stan in front of my
rocket for a second okay one sec how
about so we need one more tactical right
yeah reality honey boo boo I can't
believe that Joe it is awful but it's
like you know at what point do the
producers realize you know what the
reality of this really sucks so I want
you to say this and you're mad at them
for this reason and okay go need more
anger I mean you know what really kind
of started the whole scripted reality
thing what I think Jerry Springer I
think wow I didn't really watch Jerry
Springer when it was new yeah i mean
we're talking about 92 he I don't know
pre focal point turn whatever you want
to call it that dude ran for mayor but
no he didn't yeah mayor of what I don't
remember god that's awful I think he
ended up pulling out but yeah he turned
politician of all fenced Jerry Springer
politician and then his like bodyguard
took over a show right yeah he's got his
own no he's got his own show it's called
Steve that's original as creative oh my
god she waddled over here she rolled
past in
to get right on them things you can get
a ride on her back Oh bottle too haha

when I tried this cool ice it was it was
pretty awful took me forever died a
whole bunch lost ton of money but now

pretty easy now we just roll up we hung
car horn and they let us in we rape face
rape faces meet me where I don't even

saw blade Oh see so I have different
blades oh alright we have to get out oh

I may be fo ya little midgets at is Mary
midget oh no no no do you actually have
to kill his midgets yeah I already
killed him oh sure he does a he does a
captain america
I did it I did it next week though yeah
you you totally did all of that I did it
ah Cully one what's this thing is it's
like the eye of kilrogg no you gotta
stick your penis in there and rotate 180
degrees so if you could just get on that
that'd be great hmm it doesn't seem to
be working my penis is now itchy fuckem
every episode involves penis this is not
oh no that's all you drop that are we
gonna travel top it I like the clock
ticking it's like old school yeah was at
the end of that yeah told her wow so I
know no yeah it's a why but that guy was
big and scary and yeah it took me a long
time to be in the first time well get me
this time obviously that's what saved me
just sayin' me make sure I get the right
shot ease on Oh bad guy he's big and
Gary
I guys probably gonna poop on your chest
yes you just did if I kill somebody when
I'm down like that I automatically get
revived but you kill them before I could
this guy is coming for your head that's
okay I'm get it running I love the
midgets oh I see my the voice acting in
this game just makes it all worthwhile
well it is totally good I think video
games have totally stepped up their
voice app I think
alright haha I need help here somehow
the log something is shooting at us
we're all hiding in the corner some
heels over here let's go oh the dialogue
is just so loud oh yeah loaded in my
face I'm down I couldn't eat away me I'm
gonna have to turn dialogue way down
it's so loud nothing apparently I have
to revive me twice no I killed a guy so
I'm up I'm on fire I'm on fire I'm on
fire again I'm down again this is
depressing if this game wasn't like fun
in the sense of everything else about
this game I would have probably quit a
long time ago with how bad I am I don't
I don't get how can you be good at you
keep running like directly at the enemy
well intimidation you know no photo I
need an actual rifle i don't remember
equipping two shotguns
now all right i turn the dialogue down a
little bit I think it's gonna have to
further go down i leveled up a horse to
you know just being in the same room as
you I just you know totally walk around
with a giant rape rape whistle around my
neck I always say it's hidden in who you
know you know see what I did there yeah
yes it's checking all right audio should
be a little bit better now she was
getting way to overbook get louder is
there another boss fight or something
coming up here ah there's four boss
fights oh well I think it's gonna this
is a good point to cut this one episode
call this episode 2 and do you want to
see how much worse I can get at this
game you got to come back for episode 3
