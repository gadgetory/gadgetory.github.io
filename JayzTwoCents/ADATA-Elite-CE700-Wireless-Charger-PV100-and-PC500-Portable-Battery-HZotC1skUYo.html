insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys Jays two cents here hanging out in
the a data suite at CES 2014 now with a
lot of companies starting to ship
devices with integrated induction
charging or wireless charging options
Aidid is leveraging that with the elite
seee 700 wireless charging stand now
what this allows you to do is if your
device has a built-in wireless charger
in it or wireless battery charging or if
you even have a wireless battery case
for your phone or your device you set up
the stand like this right here which has
adjustable height and all you do is
simply take your device you line up the
charging point that's on your particular
device and that should be pointed out
with the logo right here and the moment
you set it against the stand just that
quickly it starts to charge so it allows
you to be able to just easily set
something down when you're on your desk
or whatever not to worry about plugging
in cables or constantly moving cables
around you can just wirelessly induction
charge your capable device just that
easy Abby Lee's seee 700 is gonna MSRP
for about 55 bucks and it's going to be
available in q1 of 2014 now when it
comes to charging if you're on the go
and you don't have wireless induction
charging available on your device you
can always take a look at the pv 100
here which is their portable battery
solution it's a nice hefty design here
it's got a full metal backing so it's
going to be very durable the capacity of
this is a 4200 milliamp battery so for
most smartphone devices you could get
typically two charges at least one and a
half depending on the size of your
battery or you could get a partial
charger in your tablet it's got pushed
on and off it's available in black and
white and this is available now at MSRP
s4 about 32 bucks it launched here at
CES it is also available here in some
girly colors you have kind of a Primrose
color and more of a teal color here if
you are interested in some girl
colors you also have the PC 500 which
again is tailored directly towards
females it's got kind of a floral design
in there and the capacity of this one
here is a five thousand milliamp so you
guys they know the girls talk more on
their phones that's why they give you a
bigger battery right yeah so anyway my
wife's right over there trying to kill
me but again it's got the same teal
colors and the Primrose but these do
MSRP for about $35 couple bucks more and
a little bit more capacity but they've
got what feels very durable it's got an
LED indicator both USB and micro USB
slots on there so Aden has got you
covered on your mobile connectivity and
making sure your devices are nice and
charged so you're not going to run out
of battery power if you're at an event
like this which is very frustrating to
run out of power when you're doing
something like this so make sure you
check that stuff out here from a data
guys at CES 2014 bringing you everything
we can here make sure you're following
