know cases that have been developed over
the last couple of years kind of have a
pretty common feature now and I don't
even know who did it first doesn't
really matter because everyone's kind of
doing it and that is the vertical PCIe
mount or your graphics card mount to
allow it to instead of mounting
horizontal in your case like that you
can mount it upright but you know
there's a couple problems with some
cases it's they kind of get too close to
the side panel they kind of choke off
your graphics card if you've got more
than a dual slot card that's not gonna
work
but what if you've got a case that
you're in love with and you don't want
to change your case but you want a
vertical mount anyway
well you install an aftermarket vertical
mount adapter and that's exactly we're
gonna look at today one specifically by
cable mod not the first one on the
market won't be the last one on the
market but nonetheless the first one
we're gonna take a look at here today do
you want to be cooler do you want to be
more desirable you know what guys I got
new merch it's available now karma calm
slash tasty sense we got zip up hoodies
we got tri-blend we got a new logo I
digress
since 2012 but the wrist logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys we
all kinda stuff up hoodies beanies polos
don't take my word for it cuz obviously
I can't do this edie so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks so cable mods been
developing this for quite a while now
in fact I've had to put a couple
prototypes they had set me and they were
like hey we change the design a little
bit so wait for the new ones here it is
right here available on their store it's
also gonna be launching on Amazon when
it's available I'll put a link in the
description below before we unbox it I'm
gonna show you why we have a few things
on the table here not only we have skunk
works still bleeding from our last video
or kind of cleaning itself with our
cleaning solution in our loop we've got
a giant case like this which could
obviously fit pretty much any graphics
card under any condition one that does
not have a vertical mount by default and
then we've got this fractal design meza
phi c which is a mid tower case as you
can see it's very short given the length
of the graphics card as you can see it's
a pretty short case in terms of depth
because I want to see how this fits in a
large case and a small case we've also
got ourselves here in RTX 2080 TI this
doesn't really the graphics card itself
doesn't matter it's the form factor
we're looking at pretty standard size
graphics card standard size PCB to slow
thickness about 11 and a half inch card
I believe ladies we've also got here our
Strix
GeForce r-tx 2080 which is a triple slot
card it's got a taller profile and it's
longer so if you compare it to like the
standard 2080 ti you can see that you
know obviously getting this to fit in
there is going to be a bit of a
challenge so we're trying to different
form factors in terms of graphics cards
as well as cases now I know that cable
mod has done a lot of testing with this
graphics adapter which is one of the
reasons why it was delayed a little bit
they pretty much took measurements of
every card from Mike I don't know how
far back they went but they got
measurements of pretty much every single
card on the market that they could get
their hands on to make sure it was going
to fit they want to make sure the taller
cards were gonna fit the shorter cards
were gonna fit and all that so if you
want a manual though they give you this
print a piece of paper with a QR code
that you can click to get the manual
instead of just printing it on this
piece of paper so that's kind of
interesting anyway of course you've got
your riser card this is your PCI Express
cable so this is what's going to
actually connect to your motherboard to
obviously make the connection to your
graphics card they include a 90 degree
angled DisplayPort because you'll see is
the weight the way that this is mounts
in there it's going to recess in the
case a little bit so you need to have
you know be able to reach it and have
accessibility so they give you this 90
degree cable here's another 90 degree
cable right here so they give you two of
these which is kind of nice I guess if
you have more than one monitor they want
to get you covered for that you've got
your mounting screws and then of course
the actual adapter plate itself now it
does take up one two three four five six
seven slots to in order to mount this so
you need to make sure that your
motherboard and your case have seven
available slots you can see you're going
to basically lose access to all of your
other PCI Express ports so if you're
running things like a sound card a
network card RAID controller card
anything other than your graphics card
is pretty much going to lose access so
there's definitely a trade-off here
already right off the bags we're gonna
go ahead and mount this right now sort
of get it prepped now to in the case
show you how that's done
and then we will do our test-fit so this
is the way it's gonna go in like this
it's going to get a lot of support in
terms of weight from all of these
notches right there which as I already
showed fit right into the case like that
then you screw this down with the normal
screws you would mount any PCI Express
adapter right there before you do that
you've actually got to put on the bottom
piece here this is where your riser card
or the cable is going to actually mount
to so you'll see those three screws
right there three screw holes just goes
up on there like that and then you can
take three of these screws to mount it
one of the things I'm curious about they
don't want to test on this is how it
handles the weight of the card because
the cards nowadays because we're getting
more and more powerful the heat sinks
are getting larger they're getting more
dense graphics cards sag has certainly
become a thing that companies have been
getting creative with on trying to
combat alright so this is essentially
goes like that
now you'll see it's not actually
touching the bottom of the bracket right
there because that is where this guy
comes in the holes are elongated they
are oblong so you see how you have some
movement there so before you tighten it
down you're gonna probably want to find
the right position with your graphics
card and then you can tighten that down
to where you want it to be and that is
essentially the entire mechanism right
there so as you can see it's still a
little bit loose because I want to make
sure the distances we're all set right
someone do now is on tape the card back
off tighten those screws down and that's
the whole mechanism so that would mount
into your appropriate slot your 16x slot
for your graphics card and that's the
whole bracket so let's go ahead and get
it all installed and see how it looks in
the case so I know it's gonna fit in
skunkworks obviously this this is an SMA
8 from case labs it's a huge case that
we're still cleaning obviously we've got
the system prep running in there right
now to clean out our loop in preparation
for our next upgrade but we're gonna go
ahead and install it in this guy here so
the nice thing about this shielded
ribbon cable is you can bend it as you
need I'm gonna go ahead and plug that in
too but I digress so the easiest way to
probably do this is just gonna be to
move this cable out of the way for now
rather than trying to plug it in first I
think that'll work alright so that's
plenty of room
and I might put in all the screws but
obviously I'd recommend putting on all
the screws so you have all the support
you can possibly get the difficulty of
this is going to be purely dependent on
your case and how tight it is but it's
actually easier to tighten down like
this and it is a normal graphics card
just chilling in there because a
graphics card coming this way usually
keeps you from being able to get to
those screws so I'm putting on the top
screw in the bottom screw so far it
seems to be doing a pretty good job at
supporting the weight if you've never
held an RTX founders edition card they
are heavy that is pretty much installed
just like that so now you can see in
this case it'd be very silly to have
these dual loops like this with this
loop doing nothing in a graphics card
just sitting there but you can see what
I mean now about the fact that it does
completely block all of your expansion
ports so although this is a great thing
in terms of showing off your graphics
card there is sacrifice involved you're
gonna lose access to those slots even
this 4x right here up top that has not
it's not being blocked by the bracket
the port obviously is being blocked in
terms of the back slot so that's
something to keep in mind but what I'm
going to test right now I want to see
how easy we can get this graphics card
out of here while the bracket is
installed instead of having to take the
bracket all the way out there we go
there we go yeah so without the graphics
card mounted that's obviously pretty
flappy and dangly because it does mount
up there like that but you can see
obviously our our card riser slot right
there it also goes a little bit under
kind of a crooked Bend but that's not
gonna really matter because you can't
see it so what about the big card what
about the big dog see we got here that
went pretty easy oh yeah if PC building
was an eSport I'd be your optic a little
bit on the saggy side but I mean we're
we're asking a lot of this bracket which
is really just floating here and
remember I only have two screws in there
right now now we're not gonna be using
the Strix card over here because even
with it sitting normal as you can see we
barely clear my front fans right here so
unfortunately this one's out although it
would have definitely filled up that
space significantly but as you can see
if this was a standard case that had a
vertical Mountain in here you can see it
would go right here where these this
meshes that would push it right
up against the side glass and that just
would not work that wouldn't just not
that not be good so that's what we've
dealt with with some cases on the market
that have integrated vertical mounts so
that's why stuff like this is actually
kind of nice even if you have one what I
want to show too is the cable look at
the look at the crazy angle on that
cable right there these are not just
standard DisplayPort you can see they've
made this cable so that it can actually
fit properly in the bracket right here
now it's no surprise it's easy to
install in a big case like the case labs
SMA 8 but let's take a look at the mesh
if I see right here because this is much
smaller I've got an air cooler in there
I can't get my hand up here to plug in
the cable like I did over there because
it's got a water block so I'm gonna lay
this flat and I would pretty much expect
this to fill up a lot of the space
notice I said fill up and not Phillip so
if Phil doesn't think I'm talking to him
right now alright so there it is
installed in our mesh if I see which I
think it's like a perfect fit alright
fill your opinion what do you think on
that especially because the length in
this case is perfect like it's almost
aesthetically OCD pleasing alright so
there you go guys that's the cable mod
vertical PCIe adapter it's a little bit
more expensive than the competitors like
I said but at least it gives you these
custom cables for it gives you two of
them it's very well thought-out I think
it looks great in the mesh if I see it's
almost like it complements this build
perfectly the build quality the
anodizing quality it's one of those
things that if you are into the
aesthetics of your piece I mean this is
an aesthetics piece it's not really
functional in the sense of giving you
any additional performance or anything
like that it makes you able to see your
card most of these companies put a lot
of effort into their shroud they care
about the way it looks like this not so
much like this which is how your typical
typically used to seeing it I've seen a
lot of people ask me to like Jay why is
the cooler on the bottom of the card and
how always having to push up at least
like that now it's a little bit more
natural where the heat can kind of rise
out of the card get caught in the case
airflow and exhaust that heat even
better whether or not that's true though
that's up for debate and something we
could test in a later video between
orientation and see which is better by
using this bracket because as I
mentioned the case is that people have
done this taste test with normally push
it up against the glass which makes
vertical bad but this vertical when it's
in the center of the case like this
actually give you any sort
temperature benefit but as mentioned
though you do have to sacrifice some
stuff on this you lose all expandability
in terms of your pci express no
expansion card sound card to capture
card - no sli i mean that so few people
actually run SLI that's probably not a
deterrent but if you're looking at a way
to make your single graphics card look
better in even a small case that the
mesh if I see or this giant case like
the SMA 8 we had no problems of fixing
the bracket to the cases obviously a
small case and a big GPU is going to be
a concern but that's the concern even we
don't use a bracket like that so guys
sound off in the comments below yes this
is a bit of a vanity piece it's not
something that's necessary it's not
going to give you much if any sort of
performance improvement this is straight
up about looking at your hardware and if
you spend a lot of money on it wouldn't
you want to see it alright guys sound
off in the comments below tell me what
you think again I'll put links to where
to buy in the description down below and
you guys can go and have a look at that
so again a huge thanks to cable mod for
sending me one of these to take a look
at and we'll probably find a way to
integrate one of these into a permanent
build in the future imagine with a water
block showing that'll look even better
alright once again thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you in the next
the only lift I need is the push-up bra
I wear under this shirt all right no
rack up a little huh all right so we're
not gonna be using this table mod is
introducing their vertical PCI adapter
oh hey what's up guys James $0.02 here
and have you ever wondered nope I've
never wondered that ever I don't know
say yeah yeah this we got this we got
this we got this and I'm curious as to
how well this is gonna work yes okay we
got all the group all the goobers out
for a while has been waiting as videos
are hard to make yeah I know what I'm
gonna say now you ever had a case that
weight was gonna say no I haven't had
food yet that's why the bottom row
pretty much are now when we're gonna
take a look at here today we did the
intro I'm going all right I need craft
services now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
