guess what via long waited fractal
design node 202 is finally available now
considering the fact that this is not
exactly the easiest case to build in
that would be a good idea to go ahead
and do a build guide for building inside
the fractal node 202 I mean what do you
do when the case you're going to build
in is roughly the same size of an e ATX
motherboard as you can see it is going
to be a little bit of a challenge so
hopefully this video will make it just a
little bit easier to fit all this junk
inside that tiny space
okay so you got a lot of components here
to fit into a pretty small space so
there's some things you got to keep in
mind when you build in small form-factor
obviously the node 202 is a mini ITX
motherboard compatibility so mini ITX
motherboards they're a little bit
interesting in that all of them pretty
much are going to have very different
arrangements whereas like standard ATX
motherboards typically you've got the 24
pin on the same spot all the PCI Express
slots are going to be in the same
position all the fan headers are pretty
much the same an ITX motherboards they
all are going to be very different based
on the manufacturer so you're going to
want to keep that in mind with the way
that things get installed in this case
we'll go over that today there's a lot
of pre-planning that's involved but mini
ITX motherboard specifically in this
case four components we are going with
the EVGA z97 stinger with a 4790k
installed yet probably is a bit of a
high end in terms of hardware that we
can put in here but then again that's
kind of the way we do things around here
the most important part though probably
is going to be keeping in mind the
cooler selection now obviously this is a
stock intel cooler and in fact this is
off of an i3 so it's even a little bit
smaller than the one that would come
with the 4790k so overclocking is
completely out of the question with this
cooler now there are other aftermarket
coolers that you can fit in this case
it's got to be anything up to 56
millimeters obviously keep it under that
so you have a little bit of headroom a
lot of the coolers on the market though
are taller than that should be very very
cognizant of the size of the cooler
you're putting on here not - it makes a
cooler that fits Coolermaster makes a
few coolers that fit but you definitely
are going to want to keep that in mind
there's not a lot of clearance on the
top of the cooler for memory here we've
got 16 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance
ddr3 1866 dims again nothing too crazy
and then for a graphics card I'm going
with a and this is a this is also going
to be another part that you want to be
cognizant of of part selection is the
type of blower or cooler that is on your
card this is a 970 SSC here from EVGA it
is a it is an atmospheric style card
where the heat is going to be put into
the case and the cases jobs
to remove that heat typically I would
suggest a blower style cooler that's
something that's got a fan on it that's
going to exhaust all of the heat out of
the back of the card then the case is a
little less involved when it comes to
the cooling of the GPU but because I
don't actually have a graphics card that
is going to meet the power requirements
of the included SFX power supply that is
in here I had to make some compromises
here in fact the 450 watt fractal design
SFX power supply in here is going to be
a recommended 500 watt for a 970 but
we're not gonna be doing any
overclocking so we still are going to
have enough Headroom but because of the
style of graphics card that I'm using
I'm decided to go ahead and put two
additional fans in this case they do
have two 120 millimeter fan expansion
slots in the GPU compartment to help
keep things cool we are using the
fractal design venturi fans here and I
did use SP fans instead of the airflow
fans specifically in this case because
they're PWM and I want to keep PWM
control and I also think the static
pressure is going to help because we do
want to do positive pressure in this
case to keep things nice and cool for
hard drives it does fit to 2.5 inch hard
drive so either hard driver SSDs no 3.5
inch support shows a little bit of a
trade-off there which again is kind of a
theme when it comes to SFF builds
there's going to be some give-and-take
now you can get one terabyte SSDs pretty
easily now you can get multiple terabyte
hard drives so depending on what the
ultimate use of this case is going to be
home theater PC small form-factor gaming
PC you're going to want to be mindful of
the amount of storage that you need
because it's too small
2.5 inch drives that will fit in here I
obviously wouldn't be able to put a lot
of let's say digital media on this
machine which would lead me to want to
use some sort of a Nazz or a home
network to kind of put all of my media
files on there this is going to be dual
purpose it's going to connect to mine as
for home media and it's also got the
horsepower to run games in the living
room which is what I'm ultimately after
so now we've gone over the parts
selection and why we chose these parts
let's go ahead and take the case apart
let's show you the way it's laid out and
kind of some things to keep in mind when
building in this case that way you don't
have any surprises when you go to dig in
here yourself for the first time so when
you
open it up you're going to find your
accessory box you've got your auxiliary
power supply cable here and then the if
you get the sfx version it's going to
include a 450 watt fractal design 80
plus bronze sfx power supply all of your
cables are bundled up in the corner here
and then you've got harddrive audio
cable or audio cable and then your USB
3.0 and then of course your front panel
connectors now there's some things that
I would do on here to get set up
depending on the way you're going to be
doing your build now for instance you've
got the SFX over here but as you can see
the actual power port is all the way on
this side so they've got this cable
that's kind of routed through here to
the SFX power supply the only problem is
it kind of runs over where the fan is so
I'm personally going to reroute this
cable along the bottom here that way it
doesn't interfere with the fan I get
sandwiched in between the graphics card
the other thing to keep in mind too is
like I said kind of do a quick test fit
here of your motherboard place it in the
you know its proper position and see
where everything is going to lay out
because the biggest challenge of
building in an SFX
or a small form-factor power supply is
getting everything basically managed
when it comes to cables it's there's
nothing more challenging than building
in something that doesn't have a whole
lot of room but yet can still fit a lot
of hardware you've got a lot of cables
to deal with so as you can see even just
getting the motherboard in place here is
taking a little bit of preparation but
as you can see here the 24 pin is going
to be a little bit of a challenge simply
because of where it's at it's right next
to the power supply so we're going to
have to take that cable and kind of
squish it up over here our modular our
memory dims are right in between that
and the SFX power supply so it's going
to be very tight all of our fan ports
are up here at the top so they're going
to be pretty long run from the fan spots
over to here and then our eight pin EPS
power supply is also all the way over
here so there's going to definitely be
some planning involved now you might be
asking yourself about the graphics card
what the hell about the graphics card
where do you put the damn thing well
they also include these PCI Express
riser card which is relocating the power
supply into it or the graphics card into
its own compartment that way the heat is
a bit isolated from the rest of the case
because the only opening between these
two compartments is this spot right here
where the cables run through this
opening to get from the two different
compartments but once you put together
the riser card it's going to basically
look like this it gets mounted down in
here you'll see that in detail when we
do the build and then your graphics card
goes right there because we're going to
do the optional installation of the fans
here because I want as much positive
pressure in this case as I can we also
have to go a step further and remove the
bottom plastic cover right here so that
we can actually access that and also in
here are your filters here for all of
your intakes in your SFX power supply
and all of that it's pretty simple to
get this off it might seem a little bit
scary the first time because they
literally are just little tabs that pop
on but each one of these tabs you can
basically just push them back work your
way around and then the thing will come
off in one piece ok so once you get
those covers off this is what you're
left with here is pretty much just a
frame which makes things really easy to
build in since we're going to do our
fans pop the filter off and as you can
see there's not a whole lot to it it's
really easy to build once you get all of
this access to it now one other thing
we're going to do real quick before we
start this build is we're going to go
ahead and remove the hard drive tray or
the SSD tray whatever you are putting in
here just one screw right here in the
middle and want to work a screwdriver
screwdriver is a hard slide it forward
pull it up and then you come out to SSDs
to this we'll set this aside for now and
then this is pretty much what you're
left with
all right well as you can see it wasn't
really all that bad the biggest thing
with building in a small form-factor
case any case that it may be is to plan
every manufacturers got their different
idea of what would be the best form
factor layout and you're never going to
get it to be absolutely perfect because
they're also at the mercy of the layout
of the motherboards like we mentioned at
the beginning I kind of feel like the
stinger board here is one of the least
friendly motherboards to deal with when
it comes to building a small form-factor
just from the placement of some of the
components but we got around that as you
can see the stock cooler here I know
it's a little bit blasphemous for me to
use a stock cooler on a 4790k after all
it's all about overclocking it's a z97
chipset but I think we're going to be ok
at least letting this thing run at stock
speed in fact we'll do it we'll do a
temperature test before this video is
through and we'll see exactly how it's
doing but I'm not too concerned about
that the the cables and stuff yeah
they're not all blacks lead but then
again for the price point of what this
kit costs you know with the SFX power
supply and the case you can get past
that because this is not a windowed case
this is it this is a closed up case it's
designed to go on your desk or in your
home entertainment center and you're
just not going to see any of those
cables now as you can see right here -
I've got the graphics card sitting here
we've got the 120 millimeter fans right
behind that as we can see right here
we'll take the filter off so these are
going to be feeding a lot of air onto
the graphics card which is also going to
be pressurizing this case so that we
force some of this cool air over into
the compartment where the CPU is and
then out the side vents which are all
the way around this case so I don't
think cooling is going to be an issue
noise shouldn't be an issue either we
win with the venturi fans not only
because it's a fractal case we're like I
was put in a fractal fan it's also very
low noise I've already done video
reviews of these fans as well they're
absolutely amazing and I still think the
static pressure given what's right in
front of them being the graphics card
was the right choice rather than going
with airflow because there is
obstructions on the front and back of
this of these fans here especially when
we set it down flat which is how it's
going to be in my entertainment center
now speaking of flat they do also have
these rubber
feats which you can see right here which
simply stick on to the outside of the
case make sure you get them you know
nice and neat in the corner that one's
like disappeared under the case and then
they will give you some space between
the ground and then the bottom of the
case and as long as you have some
airflow it's going to be more than
enough in the end it all worked out
pretty well I think fractal design
especially with their SFX power supply
in here did a good job of making sure
the links are long enough but not too
long and given the size of this case
like I said this is not much bigger in
terms of footprint than an e ATX
motherboard just a little bit bigger but
not much anyway let's go and do this
button to back up let's put it on over
here with the test benches and let's
just load up some valley benchmark and
maybe some a 264 let's see how the
temperatures do and then we will end it
with that but I think we've got my new
homeowner home theater / mobile / gaming
rig it's kind of a triple purpose thing
here I think it's going to serve me well
as it doesn't overheat but I'm pretty
confident so let's do that I got the
rubber feet on the bottom we've got
about a quarter inch a little more than
a quarter inch of gap for air flow for
those 120 intake fans I installed on
there the optional fans and I'm
surprised I I ran out for about 15
minutes in a 264 for the CPU anyway
thinking that with it upright and the
big vent along the side of the case
might have actually allowed a little bit
more convection where the heat could
actually or maybe maybe it's radiation I
forget so that the heat can actually
make it out the vent on the top and not
worry about how much the 120 intakes are
pushing and positive positive pressure
influence on the temperatures and I'm
gonna apologize right now about my eye
this is how much I've been staring at
the screen the last couple of you know
the last day a couple of days actually
and it's all red and bloodshot you guys
are we were the old eye you guys
remember the old Jay who spent all night
making these videos and would be like
hey guys it's all rigidly uh anyway that
I digress back to this I thought maybe
laying it flat would give me worse
temperatures but it didn't really matter
it didn't really seem to matter which
way I oriented the case so that's the
first thing I want to address second
gaming performance I measured
temperatures with the benchmark because
I could let it run and run and run and
run and then I also measured CPU
temperatures with 806
for so obviously right now we've got
gaming going and I want to I want to
point something out remember what I said
earlier in the video this is not the
most optimal setup I'm not using the
right kind of cooler on this CPU I mean
the stock Intel heatsink you guys know
is they make them with the attention to
be throwing them in the trash I know
most people are going to ditch those so
CPU temperatures are kind of like worst
case scenario the graphics card I'm
using is a blower style card like this
we've got the fans that turn and then
the air is pushed out kind of all four
sides of the card and then it's up to
the case to exhaust all of that heat
well obviously this case has no exhaust
fans so we are running purely positive
pressure with those 120 s to try and
push this air out of the case ideally in
a case like this I would always
recommend going with a blower style
cooler like this where all of the heat
or all of the air is pulled in here and
all of it is exhausted out the back with
the exception of some like the Titan
have some vents in the backs of some
might make it into the case but let's
say 90% of the air is going to make it
out of these vents in the back which
would be most ideal so I don't have the
most ideal graphics card in there
because I didn't have a big enough SFX
power supply to power my Titan or 980ti
and then the CPU cooler going with some
sort of like a low-profile Noctua or
cooler master cpu cooler that's fifty
six millimeters in height or lower would
have definitely been more ideal so with
that said in that justification as I
know it sounds like I'm trying to make
up for bad numbers they're really not
bad at all I just wanted to make sure
you guys know these are things to keep
in mind when you build in this specific
case GPU temperature right now is
sitting at well it's bouncing between 79
and 81 depending on the test and this
has been running for about a half hour
so that's pretty good temperatures are
fairly stabilized
that's heaven at 1080p with tessellation
on normal and all the DirectX features
on anti-aliasing up for X and then we'll
open up MSI Afterburner here we can see
how things were doing see our CPU
temperatures during during this will
hover in anywhere between 50 and 76
degrees Celsius on the core it's not bad
at all on the cores of the the CPU you
guys know games
to be a lot easier for the CPU than say
stress testing like a 264 Mac CPU
temperature that we achieved was 81 but
you can kind of see hopefully the curve
right here a little bit where it wasn't
it's fairly flat and we already cooled
back down to 55 degrees Celsius and the
fans are slowing down aida64 I ran this
in multiple configurations with the case
standing up and laying down like I said
temperatures didn't change which
surprised me I honestly thought what
does 120 is being on the bottom with
only a quarter inch around the case for
to suck air in that it would have
suffered a little bit but it really
didn't and that might be because I use
static pressure fans and that's why I
justified using static pressure instead
of airflow given the orientation of the
case because that's how it's going to be
in my entertainment center our max
temperatures reached all the way up to
97 C our average was eighty five point
six C now before you guys go holy hell
that's hot remember this is an i3 cooler
put on top of 4790k and the average is
what we care about the maximum on a 264
is always going to measure those spikes
and since we were measuring we were
stressing the cache we were stressing
the floating-point unit calculations and
we were stressing the memory we were
literally doing we were bulldozing the
CPU to see what temperatures would do
keep that in mind but the average is
what we care about at eighty eighty five
point six was our average temperature
there and the modern CPUs from Intel
don't thermal throttle you something on
the mainstream enthusiasts it's a little
lower with the x99s and x79 stuff but
4790k will thermal throttle at 105 C so
as you can see we had 20 C of headroom
before we even started to thermal
throttle in this tiny case with no
exhaust fans and the wrong CPU cooler so
you can see for the worst case scenario
more than acceptable anyway guys I hope
this videos helped you understand a
little bit more but the node 202 that
we've been waiting on for so long
thanks for fact to Josh from coming down
here and helping me get this video
together he did some camera work for me
and I did all the prep don't get him any
credit for this build I did all the work
but anyway time to get out of here guys
thanks for watching and as always I will
see you in the next video
inside that show no because then it'd be
really obvious it was a dirty joke and
remember we only do in your endows
around here in your endo and your mom I
feel so Paul's hard way right now like
with this setup and the way the camera
is and like hello welcome to another
amazing Paul's video where today we are
going to build this graciously supplied
computer from a list of sponsors and
vendors and at the end it probably won't
work but it won't matter because I will
still be happy and smiley because that's
just the kind of guy that I am hey
what's up everybody Jerry here AKA barn
achlys and today we're gonna build a
computer how many little help because i
kind of forgot how to build a computer
