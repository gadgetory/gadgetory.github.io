not done a whole lot of AI Oh water
cooling loop reviews on this channel
that's probably because I'm a bit of a
water cooling snob who's all caught up
in his own little world thinking
everyone should have a fully custom loop
we'll just go ahead and put aside naive
J for a little bit here and we'll bring
it back down to earth because I know not
everyone's comfortable with doing a
complete custom loop that is why a iOS
exists in the first place they're
inexpensive they're easy to install and
they're maintenance free well at CES
EVGA showed off some of their new water
cooling products you have a companies
from making greps cards power supplies
and motherboards it's now making water
cooling loops they've been making cases
eventually you'll be able to have an
entirely EVGA built system maybe Jay
sent me over to of their closed-loop CPU
coolers so they're actually called even
says so on the box closed-loop CPU
cooler and UPS wasn't very kind for this
one so I've got the 120 right here and
the 280 sitting on the test bench let's
go ahead and take a look at how well
their first implementation of an AIO
actually went so what's a thing
you know I'll be honest I'm a kind of
impressed by its proportionate I know
right all right let me show you
something here I kind of like the thin
one but this one about form-factor yeah
but mine can fit in tight spaces with
girth you can open tight spaces it's
like a master key whether you like thick
or thin the ITX lineup from fractal
design is sure to have something that
tickled your fancy remember it's not the
size that matters it's all about how you
use it not exactly the Gertz open
variegated skirts is no contest though
there's content good
I immediately unbox the 280 and stuck it
on my x99 system with the 59 30 K that's
currently overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz
and then I kind of put the 120 aside
we'll talk about this one yeah it's good
we're going to see how good the
packaging is like I said UPS was not
very kind to this one so I've not
actually opened this one up yet it could
be a leaky mess in there I doubt it
we'll see but anyway yeah the 280s on
the system and that's the one I actually
benchmark I didn't really feel that
putting a 120 on an overclock 59 30 K
with six cores and 12 threads with hyper
threading was was very fair but this is
a perfect cooler for something like an
i3 or an i-5 with a mild to moderate
overclock the EVGA did partner with ASA
tech for this so the radiator is going
to be pretty familiar it's actually a
high fpi radiator it's going to give you
pretty good heat capacity for a smaller
size now the 120 I'd be pretty
comfortable with putting this on
something like an i3 and i-5 or even an
i7 if you didn't put a high overclock on
that keep your AMD sockets pretty cool
especially things like apple ons and sm
socket CPUs I have no doubt that this
would have a pretty good job at cooling
most CPUs I just did not feel like it
was very fair to put this cooler on my
59 30 K which is overclocked we're gonna
go ahead and let the big brother take
care of that one but I will be using
this probably in a future small
form-factor build because this is this
is just worth using one of the things I
really hate about a lot of the
all-in-one coolers that are on the
market is everyone uses that god-awful
ugly fep tubing you know I'm talking
about the one that looks like it's
ribbed for her pleasure yeah I hate that
stuff it's stiff when you when you twist
it it tends to want to pop on the cover
off here I don't want to hurt the
thermal compound but when you twist it
it tends to kind of want to go its own
way EVGA uses a paracord sleeved rubber
tubing it's the same tubing that they
use on their hybrid coolers starting
back with the GTX 980 hybrid that they
launched it's extremely flexible and you
can see that I can practically knot this
thing if I wanted and it doesn't kink
it's so friendly when it comes to
installing if you guys have ever built
with an a IO and fep tubing you know
that once you start to twist it I just
hit myself in the face with the cables
which you can see here with the rubber
tubing I can practically not this thing
and it still won't King clue that it
just wants to straighten itself back out
before it kinks is so amazing I love
that I'm not going to pull on too hard
though I don't want to I want to pop the
damn thing out that would actually
probably make a significant anyway then
moving on I'm not convinced about this
fan we're going to do another video in
the future about these fans it's it's a
very radical design where they basically
took the sides of the fan shroud here
and cut it out I don't know if they're
trying to pick up air from the sides of
the fan or if they're trying to create a
more directional airflow without it
being a normal like conical shape I
really have no idea now when the fans
are running I could feel a bit of back
splash but the temperatures don't really
seem to show that there's any sort of
issue when it comes to that so what I'm
curious about is if later on and do
another test where I put another fan on
here and see if it actually improves
temperatures I don't know we'll just
have to see but anyway the block right
here is a pump block combo what would
you expect from an AI oh and it's very
very basic now it's all kerlick on the
top right here has a glowing EVGA logo
that is RGB that has some pretty nifty
modes if you will can flash it can
breathe it can be CPU temperature
indicator it is a full spectrum RGB so
you can customize the color you're not
just stuck with like the basic seven but
yeah so the software though it's still
very beta it's running behind me right
now but I'm not even going to show it
because it's not even fair to show that
because it's still not in its full form
yet hasn't gone super saiyan or taken on
its final form so we'll talk about that
a little bit later on when it's more
matured unfortunately it wasn't ready in
time for this video so all I had with
screenshots to go by on what it will
look like when it's done but it looks a
lot like precision does for your
graphics card if you have an EVGA
graphics card or any Nvidia graphics
card it looks a lot like precision now
the neat thing is because this is RGB
you are going to be able to sync your
cooler with your graphics card if you
have an argue being equipped EVGA
graphics card so that they are in sync
and not doing two different things and
looking like a disco puke of RGB rays
going on inside your computer if you
want that you can do it more power to
you I won't judge now when it comes to
powering this thing EVGA has kept it
simple we've got a single three pin what
looks like a fan plug on here that
powers the pump the LEDs and the fan
will
about that the second end fans in the
case of multi fan units but you need to
make sure that you have a header that
you're plugging this into on your
motherboard that's capable of at least
at most a one amp draw most CPU and CPU
optional headers on your motherboard or
me PWM so they're going to be able to
handle this level of power draw that
should be fine just start to definitely
check your manual though if you want to
plug it into something like a system fan
header or a optional fan header or a
chassis fan header sometimes those don't
have as much of a power draw capability
as the CPU fan headers do so I would
plug this into CPU if you can otherwise
consult your manual if you want to plug
it in somewhere else now coming off the
pump here you have a PWM fan splitter
now the CPU cooler is going to kind of
control these fans but you could plug
these also into your motherboard
directly or a fan controller if you
wanted to say screw the software all
together you have that flexibility it's
not some sort of a proprietary plug but
because there's also optional software
to control this as a system if you want
it to it means there's a mini USB plug
on the side of the pump now that means
it terminates into a USB 2.0 motherboard
header plug on one end if you don't have
enough headers on your motherboard you
could actually replace this with a
standard mini USB cable from a charger
like a GoPro or something and plug it
into the back of your motherboard by
routing it through like a grommet hole
or something and you can control it that
way might not be as tidy but there's at
least option ok so that's a lot of
talking and a lot of glamor shots but
what about performance we all know it's
how you do in the long run the early
matters well Ben stress testing all day
after getting around some temperature
reading bugs which I found out was the
problem with hardware monitor we'll talk
about that in a separate video because
it's a very important topic to talk
about using a 264 to monitor
temperatures on the stress test dressing
CPU FPU and cache which is literally a
torture test not just a stability test
as a torture test pumping as much heat
as it possibly can into the system I put
one point three five volts on here just
to see what would happen we saw a
package temp of 79 C that's warm we'll
talk about that in a second 79 CE and
core temps ranging anywhere from 65 to
about 75 C on the course now yeah that's
a lot and so is 1.35 volts I wouldn't
actually recommend running that on an a
io 24/7 I want to see if the worst
case scenario is going to be so now that
I know what that stupid voltage on a
high overclock was going to get me in
temperatures that are still below
t.j.maxx on that's not just department
store guys especially what they call the
maximum temperature allowed on a CPU
before throttling starts to happen
anyway yeah it's not just a place where
you buy shoes it's also takes care of
your CPU we saw that we were under that
so now I went okay what happens when you
put in a voltage that's more appropriate
for everyday 24/7 driving of this
overclock will still maintain four point
three at one point to five volts
completely stable doing the same a 264
tests we saw a Mac at a Mac äj-- we saw
a Mac's package temperature of 65 C it
came down 14 C just by bringing the
voltage down a little bit and we saw
core temps averaging in the mid to upper
50s perfect that I would run that all
day long
and be completely comfortable with this
cooler again that's at these stock fan
curve you can manually adjust the fan
curve and get it even cooler at the
sacrifice of sound but again I was
testing it with as it shifts now we're
about games though games obviously are
not as stressful as a dress what about
games though games are obviously not as
stressful as a torture test like a 264
so I loaded up GTA 5 put all of the draw
distance and everything max I want to
draw the world out as far as we could do
because that's going to put more stress
on the CPU as well it is a very CPU
centric game lots of stuff to load and
yeah temperatures guys well in check
high forties on the package and the
cores we're sitting in the mid to upper
40s and then some of the higher core is
hitting as high as the low 50s so that's
that's awesome
now putting this thing all the way down
to stock settings though I saw max
temperature package of 44 C and then the
cores were actually staying in the upper
30s to low 40s definitely well within
check now not only does it support all
the current sockets both on AMD and
Intel both brackets are included they
are going to be providing a free am 4
upgrade kit with the bracket that's
needed for that once Rison actually
launches if you get one of these and you
upgrade to rise in later you will get
one of those brackets for free upon
request you have to contact them so
anyway there you go guys I think EVGA
first attempted
a i/o is actually pretty good but they
didn't have to do a whole lot they've
worked with ASA Tech in the past on the
hybrid coolers they just had to come up
with their block design some of the
software and implement it I think they
actually did a pretty good job a iOS are
what they are I mean they are good ways
to get your foot wet no pun intended
with water cooling and then if you feel
like using this as a gateway drug to the
you know bigger and better full custom
loops you can do that so don't forget
they also have what they showed up at
CES their quick release design where you
can actually add radiators and add
graphics cards and stuff we will be
taking a look taking a look at that in
the future when it becomes available
it's not available yet but it's
available you know they're going to send
it to me I'm such a water cooling core
it's not even funny
so thanks for watching guys if you enjoy
today's video going hit that like button
if you guys want to also help out the
channel there will be a link to this
product once available on Amazon down in
the description this video if it's not
available at the time making this video
I'll go back and add it later but it
helps the channel more they don't ever
know by using those affiliate links so
if you want to use it do it if not no
problem that's okay too but it's time to
go yeah I've got it this video it's late
oh boy
