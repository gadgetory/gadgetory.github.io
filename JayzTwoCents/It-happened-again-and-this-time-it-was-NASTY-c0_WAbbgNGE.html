this is my editing rig you guys remember
I built this a while back custom bent
tubing glass reservoir and that awesome
Kurla des n't primo Cho view fluid
unfortunately over time it yeah it it
caused problems so we're gonna be
cleaning up this system today we're
going to talk about some of this I mean
look inside the block right there yeah
we got some we got some work to do today
damage do you want to be cooler you want
to be more desirable well you're in luck
because right now you can own your very
own JS 2 cent swag and immediately be
the cool kid on the block max out your
sex appeal by following the link down
below this has dust filters too and so
so dust filters as you can see are not
like the end-all be-all they're not the
bee's knees
this guy up here careful careful
look so as you can see we've got an air
bubble right here in the top and I think
the flow is starting to be impeded
because this started falling out a while
ago I noticed it would mix up when I
first turned it on and then turned it
off would kind of settle now it's just
completely settled and I think we might
be getting some it mites probably in the
radiators it's probably in the reservoir
obvious it's in the reservoir you can
clearly see it's in the pump that
powdery stuff so let's talk about the
Primo chill view for a second before we
get into cleaning this because when I
did the first video about that with the
green stuff we put into NIC system
remember the video I showed it actually
like cleaned the blocks because I don't
know maybe was slightly abrasive nut it
didn't hurt the tubes in any way but the
blocks got shiny I've had many
conversations with primo chill since
then because this system obviously
failed but the thread Ripper system back
here and you guys I know you guys are
gonna make we'll just sit sir no we turn
that on all the time and mix it up it's
still as good as day one there's so many
variables there's so many things that
could have possibly contaminated that
and this was a brand new loop it was
never used with any other fluid it
didn't interfere with any other fluids
the radiator or the rad was cleaned so I
don't know why it did that but we need
to handle it today because we noticed
that when I'm rendering videos this
thing gets hot and it's a 14 or it's a
16 core 32 thread
it's a 79 60 X so yeah time to clean
this up drain it and see exactly what we
get
this is the computer cleaner calm vacuum
I got it on Amazon I'll put a link in
the description below so I'm loosening
the very top normally I would come in
here and just release the top screw on
the reservoir but I can't really get in
there so because this particular and
Nick you're gonna fill your pocket not
to jump but this particular radiator
because it's so thick has fittings on
both sides of it so I can just loosen up
one of these fittings to let air into
the loop and then as soon as I do that
if Phil shows the reservoir here you
will see it all just start to pour
straight out and there it goes because
now we have air being going in replacing
the fluid going out it's physics folks
fluid out it has to equal air in and
vice-versa that's why it's hard to fill
in hard to drain if you don't have a
proper drain setup and an inlet for air
now I've had a lot of conversations with
primo chill about these types of
problems they're aware of this problem
I've showed them pictures of it and they
show me that they are constantly
changing and tweaking the formula to try
and make it more general public friendly
the problem is there is a huge variance
in metal quality in various components
and they have no control over that they
have no control over the quality of
metal being used and the radiators have
in the blocks in the pumps and the same
goes for Mayhem's when I had the
Mayhem's problems they were dealing with
the same thing so I took off the two
fittings on top of my ek radiator and
these are like a black chrome where
normally they're very shiny chrome in
fact let me compare me should compare
this to the other ones I'm talking about
well yeah it cut the edge of the thing
so this is normally what the plugs look
like but this particular radiator had
like a dark like a dark chrome or a
black chrome so this is typically what I
see with ek but whatever reason this one
had a dark the dark chrome and if we
flip it over look at that so you can see
this was clearly the inlet where it was
flowing into that side of the radiator
this is clearly the outlet so it hits
this plug first and then doesn't hit
this was much as it's exiting the
radiator as you can see because I mean
these were I guess these are copper
whatever this is completely ADA way
detector it looks like even the o-ring
was starting to get eaten away this
completely ate away the coating so I
think these might have been the problem
right here it's very possible because
it's touching the coolant it's gonna be
affecting the coolant as it goes by and
then over time which is why it failed
slowly I think these are the problem and
unfortunately now this is the result
it's in the reservoir it's in the tubes
it's in the block it's in the radiator I
can see it when I looked inside and
unfortunately the radiator is just it
looks like this in there
time to open up this block and inspect
the damage i'ma take the fittings off
too I expect to see gunk can build up
under the fitting threads this has
happened to me but the past cells as
well actually that was not too bad
but look at that that is oh yeah see
that one there it's like stuck together
I've never had this knot just fall apart
when I do the screws that's like it's
like glued together with all the crud
like it there oh man you can see why the
flow is being impeded fun fact this is
actually the bottom of a thread ripper
this is the bottom of a thread ripper
block but I put an Intel bracket on yeah
I know I see my thumb look at this oh
man
so this is just a bowl of hot water
and we are gonna I mean look how quickly
it like dissolves though I mean there's
that fortunately it seems like it's
cleaning off Who am I see below that
like the all the nickel plating is like
gone there you see it it's it's like
scraping off with my finger though I
think it's a layer no it won't rust it's
copper rust doesn't copper doesn't rust
so I'm trying to get off all this
buildup right here this is build up its
not actually corroding the nickel it's
shiny nickel underneath there so yeah
I'm just trying to get as much of this
off as I can look how dirty it got like
in the threads there though like why did
it it's like why did it get dirty in the
threads okay and we are gonna be legit
using toothpaste on this to clean this
because of its abrasive properties we're
trying to scrape off and you've been
build up to places like an amazing life
hack you ever notice that like
toothpaste is good for everything and it
smells nice it smells better than the
crap at the smelt like when we first
brought it up so we pretty much got all
the discoloration gone you're gonna see
there's still some you know nickel
discoloration that's normal but the big
deal is it's smooth now when I touch it
before it was a gritty it felt like a
thousand grit sandpaper
and that just gives you a rough surface
for crap to collect - but now it's super
smooth so life hacks you can clean your
blocks with crest 3d white again with
the toothpaste oh listen to that grit
that's what we want though clean baby
clean but it worked
do you see that toothpaste guys life
hack so I just did that one time with
the toothpaste this one has not been
this one's really dirty so let me show
you now just take the toothpaste just
put a little bit in the hole it looks
really dirty like this toothpaste is
very dirty looking but that's right so
take the screw that you use to you know
seal up you're gonna hear all this grit
because that's the toothpaste doing its
thing and then just just sort of work it
in there like that go all the way to the
end bottom out come back and fly them
out back and then just just kind of work
it like that and then you actually see
the dirt like makes its way out and it's
stuck to the toothpaste now rinse it and
and that's what it looks like just after
one time one time so this is the first
time I've ever done this but hey it's
working so there it is all nice and
clean all the brown is gone all the gunk
is gone we were able to reuse this block
I mean you can clean just about anything
as long as nothing's like corroded and
you're good and I'm not even clean this
is the first time I have used toothpaste
man I just thought to myself like life
hack articles always talk about the
amazing cleaning properties of
toothpastes so link in the description
below I'm not gay I'm not even kidding
there's really a link in the description
below check it out not a sponsor
all right so it's back together actually
ended up using the Mayhem's xt xt one
clear with blue dye in there so it
actually looks the same as the other
stuff did after it all fell out but i
had to do a complete disassembly i was
hoping i could just do a flush in fact
it was even advertised that view would
just flush with simple distilled water
clearly that wasn't happening this stuff
solidified still not entirely sure what
caused it i think it might have been
those fittings i don't know
as you saw it two of the same fittings
two very different colors both of them
reacted in some way so that brings up a
very important topic here about just the
the variation of metal quality between
different parts and manufacturers and
even you could have two of the same part
from the same manufacturer and have
different variances in fact i've got two
different radiators from the same
company that are two different shades of
black because again it's different
cycles it's it's different runs or you
know production runs maybe even
different factories who knows so anyway
this is not as perfectly clean as it
should have been to be honest the
radiator although I was using my
pressurized pump to force a lot of
pressure through it that looks dirty I
know to try and force out anything that
might have been stuck in there and then
we reversed it and went the other
directions that way it wasn't just
flowing one way we got pretty much all
the junk out there's still tiny tiny
little bits that we've noticed as we
fill this up or kind of moving but
they've already stopped moving so I
probably collected in the radiator but I
should have used a cleaner for like 24
hours the acidic stuff and let it eat it
all up but this is my editing rig had to
get it back up and running so yeah do as
I say not as I do use the proper
cleaning methods whether it be blitz Pro
cleaning or the you know system prep
stuff whatever method you want to use
but we're up and running and I'm glad
that I was able to get this fixed so it
seems like the bad luck I have with
fluid continues which is why I am back
to a
your fluid so anyway there was that
right now we're idling at 28c and what's
significant about that is even one when
I would turn on the system without load
right because it just turned on its
gonna sort of warm up over time the when
it was upstairs and it was all clogged
like it was the second I would turn it
on it was like 37c and then when we were
doing the reason why we even did this is
because when we would hit render on a
video it would just immediately go up to
like 88 C where normally it would sit in
like the 50s and 60s it's a 16 core CPU
that is overclocked to four point eight
gigahertz so yeah the problems were
obviously very very noticeable and as
you guys saw with the block it's a good
the any wait any longer because we were
about to probably completely obstruct
our flow yeah we decide to make a video
about this because I had a lot of
comments come my way J you said the
Primo chill view was good why my system
plug I have to remember that I was
working with pre-production stuff and
obviously there's a lot of variables on
a fluid like that plus I didn't know
that there was an eight-hour restriction
on that stuff which is why it was in
here because that came out later don't
use it for longer than eight hours this
system saw a lot of temp and a lot of
use so there was probably not a good
system to put it in that's why those
types of fluids are great for like show
systems and show builds but whatever for
the sake of I was almost gonna put just
an AI o in here but I know you guys
would have shot me if I did so I cleaned
up the loop entirely did a complete
rebuild on this in less than a day and
yeah I'm tired it's raining we're gonna
go this were up and running thanks for
watching guys and you know if any
problems come up in the future I will
bring it up and I will talk about it but
this system saw about six months of
consistent use and that's what happened
in about six months thanks for watching
guys as always I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
