to finally do a video about something
I've been wanting to do for a while but
you haven't had the opportunity until
now and that being playing with an
external graphics card hooked up to a
laptop to see whether or not it's
actually beneficial and worth doing with
a unique freeform modular system menu
master cake maker 5 from coolermaster
allows unparalleled flexibility with its
adjustable internal layout and exterior
customization options learn more about
how you can start customizing your own
case by following the link down in the
description now today's video is
actually featuring the Asus Republic of
gamers XG station 2 which is a
Thunderbolt 3 connected device it's not
their first time doing this they
actually built something like this all
the way back in 2007 and they've been
kind of revamping it ever since now the
connection speed of thunderbolt 3 is
actually 40 gigabit per second which
equates to 5 gigabytes per second now
that's significantly slower than what
you get on PCI Express especially gen 3
16 X which can give you 16 gigabytes per
second each direction of bandwidth
so this Thunderbolt 3 is effectively
three times slower than what you get
with PCI Express so I guess the question
is and what we're going to be looking at
in today's testing is whether or not
putting something like a high-end
graphics card in one of these is
actually doing yourself a disservice but
when we talk about that let's kind of
take a quick look around the XG station
this is actually a very well thought out
piece of equipment it's actually got
fans on the top to help exhaust hot air
from your open style coolers but I'm
using a founders Edition card in here
because I'm also going to be comparing
the results of this to my MSI gaming
laptop that has a full-blown GTX 1080
and the base model we're going to
testing here also has a GTX 1060 in
there so the question is how much
improvement are you really getting when
you go with something like this now it's
got its own built-in power supply
supplying up to 500 watts to your
graphics card and it does have dual 6
pin or dual 8 pin power plugs on there
so you're not gonna be able to use
something that requires three power
plugs because this one only has two so
keep that in mind of course it's got
glowing LEDs and it looks very pretty
it's got a lot nice angular design it
really is well thought out even this
cathode on the front which is always lit
is pretty neat looking especially when
it's closed and that's what
see through the front not to be fair
this is more than just a graphics card
docking station it's actually a
full-blown cone activity docking station
for any thunderbolt connected device
including mac but we're going to talk
about mac today obviously we're talking
about PC but it is obviously Mac is kind
of the reason why a lot of this even
exists but I digress
it's got 4 USB 3.0 is on there it's got
one USB 3.0 type B connector it's even
got a built-in network card and
obviously your graphics card goes in
there too because the cool thing about
this is you can take your thunderbolt
connected device plug in one Thunderbolt
cable like you have right here and have
everything else connected to this guy
right here you can have monitors hooked
up to this you can have your network
cable hooked up to this you can even
have your mouse your keyboard headset
USB headset all hooked up to this so
when you want to go be on the go you
simply unplug your power unplug
dependable 3 your laptop is free and you
can go to class go to work travel
whatever you want to do and then when
you get home you just plug two cables
back into your laptop power and
Thunderbolt and then everything is up
and running as a full-blown workstation
so it's more than just a graphics card
connectivity device connected to the
connected device talking's hard but one
thing you have to keep in mind though
with that 5 gigabyte per second
bandwidth is obviously Thunderbolt
networking Thunderbolt graphics all the
USB connected devices are going to eat
up some of that bandwidth now the
question here is whether or not this is
going to slow down high end graphics
cards at least that's what I had for
myself so let's go ahead and take a look
at some of the results right here
so the baseline for this test was my msi
gs70 3 vr stealth pro longest names ever
these days I swear but I digress again
you could say the baseline actually
wasn't bad the gaming experience on this
laptop is very very good for what it is
especially with i7 in there and ddr4 but
what happens when you plug a gtx 1080
founders edition into the XG station and
start playing on what you can say
there's a bit of a bump but I'll be
honest it's not as big of a bump as I
was hoping for which then made me go
what happens when I test it with my GT
73 vr Titan which again has an i7 8
threads of processing power ddr4 and a
full-blown discrete GTX 1080 in there
so obviously as you can see having a GTX
1080 built in to the laptop is giving
you a significantly better gaming
experience than it is when it's running
through thunderbolt I actually talked to
Asus about this and it kind of makes a
lot of sense as to why this is now
typically you're going to see anywhere
between about 30 to maybe 40 percent of
degradation of gaming experience when
you're going through thunderbolt that
has a lot to do with not only the
bandwidth of the cable it also has to do
with the CPU overhead as well where the
CPU is having to also make heads or
tails of what's happening with the i/o
of this device right here so not only
does the laptop have to say send a
communication to this device saying hey
here's what's happening this is going to
process it and send it back to the
computer and the computer has to also
make heads or tails and process what
this is telling it before it can start
to render it on your screen so there's
some latency in there and there's some
CPU overhead now something I'm going to
do to try and measure how much
performance we're actually losing by
going through thunderbolt like this with
an external graphics card as I took my
nvidia gtx 1060 there reference cards
it's not a founder's for the 1068 and
call it founders and I put that inside
of the XG station 2 here and I'm going
to compare these results by running the
discrete external versus the discrete
internal to see what kind of performance
Delta there is here's a 1080i together
they're right there you're definitely
not getting the full potential or your
full money's worth when you put a 1080
into a solution like this and start
running it on a on a laptop
I ran the same test in a couple of
benchmarks I'm using here and
unfortunately we saw once again a
degradation of performance which shows
that obviously running over a
Thunderbolt cable is unfortunately not
going to realize the full potential of a
graphics card so if I had in the back of
my mind kind of thought that maybe this
would make a good benchmarking solution
for graphics card testing nope not at
all obviously it's not going to be
indicative of what real performance is
going to be with something like this
plugged in either natively on your
motherboard or discreetly soldered in on
your PCB inside of your motherboard on
your
on your laptops and stuff but it will at
least allow me to have a kind of a neat
testing station here if I want to see if
a graphics card works if it's bad or
something but it's kind of unfortunate I
was really hoping for better overall
performance with something like this now
I can see the benefits of it I purely
can of turning it into a docking station
the problem is this particular unit
right here costs 299 dollars that's $300
so if you throw another 1080 in and it
can be almost another $700 you're
talking about a thousand dollars for a
situation like this to make a smaller
laptop like that well run better but
nowhere near the performance of what you
would expect if you had a discrete
graphics card in fact even the 1080 over
here the unplugs described this thing is
so big that's what you said anyway the
Titan guys this is a massive laptop so
obviously you are trading off quite a
bit in terms of size and sheer
performance but look at these two
together can you see that if you see the
stealth on the bottom there yeah it
really looks like well it kind of looks
like you're watching the nature Channel
if you know what I'm saying but anyway
yeah it's all the performances here on
this guy but it definitely comes at a
weight disadvantage because the reality
is the excitation here with a 1080 in it
is about the same cost as this on top of
the laptop you could have just bought
that now I thought that my results here
might have been wait and I did hop on
the phone with Asus who told me that
there could be up to 30 to 40%
performance degradation realize
depending on the graphics card that
you're using depending on the
thunderbolt switching mechanism that the
laptop is using and there's a lot of
things that are at play here there's
some additional CPU overhead because the
CPUs having to handle additional
communication with the i/o on top of the
game and on top of the graphics
rendering and then display and all of
that so there's some induced latency as
well as some additional CPU overhead in
mind which or which kind of brings up a
very good point here I'm using a 7700 HK
in this laptop that's a good laptop it's
a 7th gen it's got hyper threading it's
eight threads and it 23.9 gigahertz so
if you're using a slower laptop that has
maybe no hyper threading in the lower
clock speed then you're going to see
probably an even larger gap between what
you would get with a discrete graphics
built into the laptop versus something
like this or desk desktop graphics card
like this in here versus in a desktop
you're going to see quite a bit of a
performance degradation with something
like that which is kind of unfortunate I
think we're getting there we're getting
better at this
but unfortunately with the price of this
this is 299 dollars on top of the price
of wherever graphics card you're going
to put in there so even if put a 250
dollar gtx 1060 in there you're still
looking at 550 dollars for this and as
you can see you're still not getting the
full performance of a gtx 1060 and it's
even worse we put something like a 1080
in there because you're talking about
$1000 for the total package price of
this and of course you're also gaining
the base station aspect of an unplugged
inori devices in it having one cable
connect everything personally for me
this is now my subjective hat this is
just me talking about me what I would do
I would not do this for a lower-end
laptop unless you had a laptop that has
no discrete graphics in it whatsoever
and updating your laptop is completely
out of the question for whatever reason
because I think it'd be better to take
the thousand dollars you would pay for
this and the 1080 and save a little bit
longer and get a better laptop because
this cost the same as this the laptop
and this station and a 1080 but it's all
self-contained
obviously we gain a lot more weight a
lot more heft and a lot less portability
with it so I guess that's kind of a
trade-off anyway guys sound off in the
comments tell me what you think about
this thanks for watching and as always I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
