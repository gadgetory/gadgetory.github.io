and we talked about it at CES AMD is
finally launching a new flagship card no
it's not Navi
everyone wanted Navi and we
unfortunately didn't get Navi
but we do have Radeon 7je to define our
six in white what do you think fine our
six in white okay okay it's an arsenic's
but it's not new in fact it's not even
all white I mean what's with the black
front really coming from the guy with
the black and white car black hood like
okay that's different it's the same
that's not the same exact same thing not
the same fine change it then how with
the custom wrap from slick wraps front
panel whole cakes whatever you want even
custom designs us that's right we did do
that video about the custom wrapped our
six choose any of their existing designs
or customize your own upload it and
they'll make it for you see wow you
really can make these custom with rats
now the embargo from boxing has just
lifted but unfortunately you guys have
to wait till February 7th to see any
performance reviews
I hate unboxings I don't really like
doing them but I put out a sweet asking
do you guys care about unboxings and
about 2/3 of you we're like yes we do so
if you don't want to watch this video
don't and you can't get mad at this
video get mad at the 3rd or the 2/3 of
people who outweighed the 3rd whatever I
digress so this also is important to
mention that this is not a retail
package this is not the way it ships and
that's one of my problems with these
companies sending us stuff to unbox well
not all the companies anyway ambe's kind
of more notorious for it than nvidia and
video at least when they launch graphics
cards they come in the retail packaging
what you see is what you get this
unfortunately is I don't know what the
point is I know what the point of
sending us custom packaging is for media
because I want to experience the retail
extreme I want you guys when you get
your package to know what to expect to
get so don't expect to get what you're
what's in this box
well the card yeah you should expect to
get the card but what's inside this box
is unfortunately not the way you're
gonna receive it so we got this really
nice kind of a I don't know tire black
it's a very matte black that's very dark
dark grey almost with some polished
accents here to look like the Vega logo
we got AMD Radeon 7 and that's it
something else it kind of look like a
PlayStation like that to me it looks
like a giant PlayStation but anyway you
guys ready oh wait Stuart's ooh oh my
okay so you get this acrylic pedestal
it's got an RGB light in it but what's
kimete though is unfortunately it's like
stuck in there we can't get it out can
we well no when we did the Vega unboxing
they gave us like the actual chip like
separately so you can see the way the
core architecture actually is you can
see all the extra RAM this card has 16
gigabytes of HBM to significantly up
from the first HBM card which we saw
with fury our fury X which had 4
gigabytes and then Vega having eight
right biggest eight yes and now we've
doubled that to 16 obviously this is a
card stand so you can take your
beautiful card now put it in your system
and just display it with an RGB light
that's not reflecting off of anything it
doesn't refract or anything nothing else
in the box
other than the card there's no yeah
there's nothing else in here so I don't
know what you guys get with the card I
don't know what power adapters or
whatever that you get so anyway
obviously they've got this completely
redesigned cooler because I don't know I
don't think they're copying in video I
mean I think it's pretty obvious that
we've been asking for cards I have more
than one fan quite often because the
blower style cooler although I see the
point of why it exists the blower style
cooler kind of takes the case out of the
equation because it forces all of the
air through it and out of the chassis so
it doesn't have to worry about the extra
heat being dumped into it the case where
the case we don't have adequate airflow
or at adequate ventilation and so it
gets hot which means the card slows down
because the case couldn't do its job so
the blower style cooler was definitely
necessary for for that reason but
unfortunately it really limited how far
the cards can go and it seems like
companies like Nvidia and I don't know
so much AMD because I mean AMD has
always had board partner support Nvidia
wood started competing directly with
direct sales and stuff with their own
board partners they've had to start
finding a way to sort of stay relevant
in terms of cooling and stuff because
although the PCBs may not have changed a
whole lot when it comes to cards from
reference to the AI bees a lot of them
just put their own coolers on a IVs
which means you get better thermals and
better overclocks just because of
temperature
more under control than a blower style
cooler so obviously now we've got the
new design triple fan because you're
gonna have significantly more airflow
down through the fins to keep the card
as cool as possible now they're not
calling it Vega this time around it's
just blanket statement of Radeon seven
it's interesting because Vega 64 was
called 64 because it had 64 C used in
Vegas 56 had 56 to use so there you go
so that really makes this more or less a
Vega 60 if you will because it's even
though it's a smaller process it is
still the same architecture of Vega it's
still big it and it's got 60 C use and
it's got a higher core clock and yeah so
the specs actually we talked about this
in the CES video kind of step down
slightly but core clocks went up and all
that stuff which is why we saw
improvement so I wish I could give you
guys a little bit more you know
information than just an unboxing but
Twitter said they wanted to see it and
here it is so I think the new cooler I
love the fact that they stayed with the
brushed so we kind of go through these
cycles companies come out with new
coolers and designs and it's kind of
like they need to stand out on a
non-existent wall like you go into Micro
Center you go into best buyer or
wherever you buy your stuff Fry's
Electronics and maybe motherboards on
the wall but there's no GPU sitting up
there so you don't just stand out in a
crowd so they all come out with some of
these crazy over-the-top designs and
it's just sometimes they're extremely
ugly like like the MSI Lightning card is
probably one of the most gaudy cards you
can possibly buy in terms of aesthetics
I've lately been on this very
minimalistic kick kind of like with the
Corsair one and it's super sleek design
I really like just the brushed rare raw
aluminum look like this I it's not even
anodized black and I'm fine with that
because it's just so freakin sleek and
when Vegas 64 came out what two years
ago now I just was beside myself and how
good it looked in fact because of this
card coming out I've already decided we
are going to be doing a raw aluminum
build kind of like we did the gold build
four based on the Titan cooler we are
gonna be doing an AMD build utilizing
thread Ripper and the the new Vegas 60
card as I'm calling it and basing all of
the raw aluminum appearance
we can on there so anyway guys tell me
what you think down below unfortunately
I guess I can't give you temperatures I
can't give you performance at CES we
couldn't even go into the menus and see
like most of the settings and stuff
because that was all super locked down
so February 7th is when you can expect
to see how this bad boy performs now if
you can't tell by now or you've already
written a comment this is obviously
satire I think unboxing videos like this
are completely pointless so we had a
little bit of fun with it obviously this
is the Radeon 7fe said still applies
though just it was it wasn't that one
yeah come in tight and then pull out
right and if it stroke on the first
words it's always the new not the same J
I subscribe to you know the same
subscriber I Jade to so what's your
point technically a fart isn't a thing
the flatulence my fart is an action
right no a fart is a noun is it you can
put you foot one part right see no
wonder why people say English is dumb
make up your mind already now if you
can't tell by this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
