to wait to do this video until maybe
tomorrow or the day after wait and see
what some of the what the comments were
they're gonna be rolling in because I
knew they were coming in you knew they
were gonna come in but they came in a
little bit faster than I think even I
expected so let's talk about why I chose
the 3770k Ivy Bridge over has well even
when I was at fries and I was at micro
Center and both of them had Ivy Bridge I
took the back both of them had Haswell
motherboards z87 motherboards as well as
processors in the store motherboards
were already available as of Thursday
when I was at fries and the processors
were available if you knew somebody
let's just say I know somebody at micro
Center I had the opportunity to pick one
up on Thursday as well as yesterday now
yesterday I knew good and well as well
was coming out today
I know weeks ago it was coming out today
we also knew weeks ago exactly what we
were getting would has well I've seen a
lot of people throwing around where you
could have gotten more for 20 bucks or
you know you could have just spent the
same amount and got has well here's the
bottom line first of all I live local to
a micro Center so I got the 3770k
brand-new for to $29.99 okay it's one
hundred and ten dollars cheaper than
Fry's and I think it's maybe even a
little bit cheaper than Newegg was now
when I was at Fry's I got them to give
me what the pricing was going to be for
the Haswell their price was three 39.99
i saw an ad today that micro Center had
the Haswell because I was immediately
emailed when it was when it was free or
when it was available as well as when I
was there yesterday that the cost on it
was 270 $9.99 for the 4770k now it's $50
more than I paid
the 3770 yeah we're talking only 50
bucks right the motherboards however to
get a motherboard that had the same
overclocking capability and the same
quality that this motherboard is and you
guys have you follow me on twitter you
know the last few days I've just been
going nuts trying to figure out what
motherboard I wanted to use because
let's face it the motherboard the
motherboard is is is a quality
motherboard is needed for overclocking
it drives everything something goes bad
on the motherboard everything fails
clearly I want to deal with RMA's and
such especially on a platform that is
discontinued the the nearest quality
motherboard to this one or I should say
same quality motherboard was one of the
Asus or the MSI mPower at nearly $300
this motherboard had a price tag of
$29.99 on it however I got them to lower
the price of this down to 220 - because
that's what Newegg had it for on
clearance as well as 40 bucks off even
though I didn't pay or buy the micro the
the CPU from micro Center because I
returned it and then came and picked up
this one after the fact I got 40 bucks
off of my price matched up to 22
bringing it down to 182 dollars for this
motherboard now you add 50 bucks to the
processor and you add the hundred
dollars more that the motherboard is
going to cost we're talking 150 dollars
additional what I paid for this now what
do I get for 150 bucks
Linus a new egg there are some Chinese
sources have all been putting out as
well as overclocked net forums hard
forum
queue Kyle as well as my remembers name
anyway the editors over hard OCP all
those guys have been putting out has
well benchmarks they all show a standard
5 to 10% improvement over Ivy Bridge and
when it comes to RAW processing power
however they show a 25 to 40 percent
improvement in internal GPU I clearly
don't use an internal GPU haswell's
improvements were entirely based on the
thing it's either the 4500 or 4600 I
remember the
the actual number of the internal GPU
they're trying to catch up to the AMD
a10 series when it comes to the internal
GPU so this very view advancements when
it comes to the architecture of has well
because has well is the toc-toc K talk
version of the tick-tock cycle that
aimed that Intel uses have a feeling
based on the comments that I'm seeing
from people in this video the lot of you
don't understand the release cycle of
Intel and how they always go tick-tock
tick-tock and what that means is tick is
an architecture improvement talk is a is
a clock improvement as well is the talk
version of what IV was to tick because
IV changed the way some of the memory
controllers worked at Z 77 and things
changed internally with Ivy Bridge
because it dropped down to the 22
nanometer process where Sandy Bridge was
a 32 has well is a 22 nanometer just
like the Ivy Bridge however all the
improvements went into the GPU with some
slight clock improvement when it comes
to the actual clock speeds of the course
$150
I wasn't gaining anything over this five
to ten percent for 150 bucks is not
worth it now I hear people saying okay
fine so what did you gain over AMD did
you gain 5 10 percent did you gain 20
percent did you gain nothing
I saw people say that well AMD performs
exactly the same as Intel here's the
bottom line don't you think that's the
very first thing that I tested the very
first thing I did was run all by
benchmarks on my AMD stuff prior to
removing it logging it and then
comparing it to the Intel here's the
hard facts on that that I exhibited and
I experienced when it came to going from
the 8350 to the 3770 they were exactly
the same when my am D was overclocked to
4.8 and this was on stock clock of 3.5
with turbo turned on the moment I bump
this up to 4.7 and by the way I have a
magic overclocking chip every now and
then you get one got one hanging on the
wall right there it's my old East 6300
1.86 gigahertz that was running at 3.4 2
gigahertz its entire life never died
I got another one of those right here
this thing went to 4.7 when I set
internal or when I set the V core
voltage to the factory setting on static
and left it 4.7 on stock voltage which
is getting me insane low temps and
insane efficiency this thing blew my AMD
out of the water when it came to
rendering that video that I put up that
you guys are hating on rendered in just
over three minutes three minutes my AMD
tends to render at about real time plus
ten percent so if it was a 10-minute
video we take about eleven minutes to
render because a five-minute video was
about five and a half this thing
rendered at about a hundred and forty
five percent real time with all of those
transitions as well as resampling on the
reason I moved to Intel first of all was
because I with the exception of the 8350
never adopt first generation of a new of
a new generation are the first run of it
the 8350 because it was so cheap I just
went ahead and bit the bullet spent 180
bucks or whatever it was and went with
the AMD 8350 to see how it was
technically it wasn't first generation
because the FX bulldozer was already the
same architecture so say Ivy Bridge to
Haswell was kind of the same of 81 50 to
80 350 so technically I didn't buy the
first generation I never buy the first
runs of anything when it comes to new
technology that's just the way that I
work I'm also holding my breath slightly
for for iv'e I want to see what they're
going to do on the extreme remember we
only have Sandy II right now all the
extreme processors are Sandy Bridge 32
nanometer and actually maybe larger than
that believe it's a larger dive I'm
holding out to see exactly what the
consumer level six core processors are
going to bring because I would ideally
like to go quad channel Ram because of
rendering quad channels going to make a
huge difference so I saved 150 bucks
which I'm going to spend on my channel
and I'm going to pick up an aver media
gamer HD so that I can have smoother
rendering and smoother capture for my
live streaming so I made a choice to
stand back
one generation take the money and put it
somewhere else into the computer to
bring you guys a better experience when
it comes to the streaming that you guys
are constantly asking for and because of
that I see people saying oh we've lost
the one youtuber that was sticking with
AMD guys I went with whatever was
working for me at the time I don't
discriminate
I don't hate AMD I don't hate Intel I
don't hate Apple
I don't hate Google I use what works for
me I couldn't give two shits what you
guys use because I only have to be
concerned with what I used if you guys
use what you like more power to you
there's nothing wrong with that but the
fact that people are now saying that
they're gonna unsub or talking about
maturity levels and such the bottom line
is use what works for you it doesn't
matter
AMD Intel you could go armed for all I
care if it works for you so what the
bottom line was the jump from Ivy to
Haswell wasn't worth it so I jumped on a
killer deal to go with third-generation
Intel which was showing me almost 30 to
35 percent improvement over my AMD once
this thing was overclocked now a lot of
people like to say the 8350 matches the
3770 every benchmark out there are even
tech syndicates and a lot of people are
still using that video as the definitive
end-all AMD versus Intel video
unfortunately every benchmark from every
reputable source Tom's Hardware hard OCP
overclocked net it doesn't matter where
you go all of the testers and all the
editors show overclock and B matches
stock Intel the moment you overclocked
Intel which is just as easy if not
easier than AMD because there's no more
you don't have to deal with any of the
frequency range of like Northbridge it
just pushes just beyond so I'm really
happy with this I'm very sad to be my
AMD sub sitting right there on the table
I am sad to be getting rid of that trust
me and here's the bottom line at the end
of the day if AMD's new steamroller
steam rolls over Intel I can go back to
AMD if I want to fortunately this little
gig of YouTube is what's allowing me to
make these changes to get first-hand
experience to bring you guys the videos
that you deserve without talking out the
side of my
for being biased I think that alone just
really ought to make you guys think
whether or not I'm a fanboy Ora
enthusiast I'm an enthusiast of all
things PC I don't care what platform it
is you guys should be too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
