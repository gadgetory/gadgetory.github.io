about to cover and the fact that I went
out today and bought an iPad air makes
me feel just a little bit dirty inside
like like maybe there's just something
wrong with this I don't know what's
going on guys Jay's two cents and I'm
bringing you about the four thousandth X
99 and 5960 x video - your sub box but
my video is going to be different than
everybody else's because it's well my
video and nobody's done my video yet I'm
doing my video right right now so if you
already saw my video then there's more
wrong than the fact that I bought an
iPad so if you've been following
absolutely any of my social media then
it should come as absolutely no surprise
to you that I went out and purchased a
59 60 X Intel i7 on launch day and
because of that I've gotten a lot of
comments from people as well on the
social media platforms saying J what the
hell was wrong with your 4790k wasn't it
good yes it was good but that's a
mainstream and this was my very first
opportunity to own an enthusiast
platform and I just went ahead and went
for broke with the extreme processor
because of the fact that it's got those
eight cores eight true cores 16 threads
with hyper-threading and 20 megabytes of
cache I thought you know with everybody
saying how beastly the CPU is when it
comes to just chewing through content
creation
I mean JJ said it Anandtech has said it
everybody who's reviewed the cpu before
me who had the engineering samples have
said that this thing is just an absolute
multimedia creators wet dream
damn and I want to have a dream too I
had a couple of different ways I could
have done this video I mean I could have
talked about specs and that it's like
you know most of my viewers do not care
about the nitty-gritty specs they kind
of want to know how does it overclock
and how does it perform so what we did
today is we ran a whole bunch of tests
you can see them on the monitor behind
me and I did these tests both at stock
speeds as well as my max overclock now
I'm going to go ahead and kind of give
you a little bit of a spoiler alert here
my max overclock was not necessarily
jaw-dropping but at the same time this
scaling of overclocking on this
processor is absolutely phenomenal and
then that just once again goes to the
fact it's got eight cores 16 threads and
yeah the Zeon's been offering stuff like
that for a long time but this is
unlocked and overclockable alright so
before we start talking about my
overclock specs let's go ahead and talk
about how this thing performed at stock
speeds and I ran three tests on this I
had a bunch of different tests that
could have done I started doing like
passmark and things like that and I
thought you know instead of doing
synthetic benchmarks I wanted to do a
real-world test so I could actually
gauge J was the price tag of this
processor worth it and what was the
price tag well for me it was 899 dollars
because I live near micro Center and
Micro Center is all they're suckers
because they sell it for less than cost
but then again while I'm there I tend to
buy other things so really who's the
sucker in all of this so for the
benchmarks I use Cinebench 11.5
Cinebench 15 and then I used Sony Vegas
11 and rendered a 1080p on best preset
for internet encoder which was actually
24 million by 10 million variable
bitrate so that was what I use for this
test and in order to put as much oomph
into the render as I could rather than
just being a simple MOV to h.264 type of
conversion I went ahead and put in there
some sharpening to the track I did some
color correction I did some contrast
correction we've got sounds we got
overlays transitions things like that so
I wanted to see you know in a short
amount of time how much stuff I could
actually throw in there so I did a 100
second or 1 minute and 40 second
render both at stock speeds and over
clock speeds all right so enough talking
about my methodology here Senate bench
11.5 gave me a score of 15 point zero
one no that's at stocks beat that's
three point five boost clock three point
five so that's already a ton more
than my 4790k was getting my 4790k was
getting just under ten with two thousand
megahertz RAM on my 4790k overclocked to
four point seven so already we were five
points higher on that four Cinebench
fifteen I got a thirteen eighty eight
and then for my 1080p 100 second test it
took 131 seconds to complete that render
test so 131 seconds was already a heck
of a lot faster than 4790k could do it
it would have probably taken near three
minutes to do that one minute forty
second test based on all of the types of
transitions and stuff I put on there and
the computer just went to sleep behind
me now the other aspect of this was how
were the temperatures I mean eight core
16 threads and what the whole way has
well sort of launched the 4770k in the
4790k a lot of people were probably
expecting at least I was expecting there
to be some serious temperatures to try
and rope in and wrangle I mean I thought
temperatures were just going to be
absolutely untamable considering the way
things had been going in temperatures
for the last couple years so at the stop
3.5 gigahertz I think it went up to one
point one four one point one four seven
volts we were actually sitting in the
mid 40s and some cords were actually
sitting in the 30s during the render
test now to kind of put things into
perspective the room is sitting right
now at 76 degrees Fahrenheit and I went
ahead and did an a 264 engineering test
for 10 minutes just to see if those
temperatures would creep higher and no
they stayed right in the 40s with a
couple of cores hitting like 50 or 51 so
very very tamable but then again when it
comes to cooling as you can see kind of
got a monster rigged for cooling here
we're talking a 480 millimeter by 45
millimeter thick radiator dedicated to
just the CPU so yeah my cooling it's a
it's a it's a little extreme you see
what I did there
well my max overclocked guys was nothing
short
of average really it was a 4.5 gigahertz
now I've tried all the different
overclocking methods on this in fact
that's why my video is later than
everybody else's now Paul's hardware was
able to get a four point seven five
gigahertz overclock that is massive
that's a 1.75 gigahertz overclock over
the base clock of the CPU that isn't
that is absolutely insane we haven't
seen those types of overclock numbers
since Core 2 Duo days I mean that was a
long time ago pre Sandy Bridge it just
wasn't anything that we saw in a long
time now mine at 4.5 seems a little bit
lackluster but that's still a 1.5
gigahertz overclock on top of the base
clock that is nothing nothing short of
amazing when it comes to over clocks I
think Paul's CPU was able to do it at
1.30 6 volts for that four point seven
five gigahertz overclock mine took one
point three to five volts in order to
get me the 4.5 gigahertz overclock so it
took more voltage to get less speed but
hey at this point I think as you start
getting between four point five and four
point seven five it's going to be a
little bit of a difference but not a
whole lot at least that's what I'm
telling myself to keep from being matted
and jealous of Paul that's my story and
I'm sticking to it and one thing I also
meant forgot to mention for the specs of
these benchmarks is the fact that I am
also running a g.skill 20 400 megahertz
ddr4 16 gigabyte kit so four times four
dims that's the memory configuration on
this I probably should have mentioned
that earlier in the video all right all
right enough so send a bench 11.5 at the
4.5 gigahertz nineteen point one eight
so we jumped from 1500 one to nineteen
point one eight send a bench 15 we jump
from 1388 all the way up to 17 58 and
the 1080p 100 second render test took 1
minute and 43 seconds to render it took
three seconds longer than real time are
you starting to see why I wanted this
CPU now every minute I can save
rendering videos for this YouTube
channel means I've got more time to be
doing something else on the system or
not having to wait for the render to be
done to start being productive in some
other manner just to kind of put that
into a mathematical perspective if 103
seconds was 100% time that it took to
render that video at stock it only took
78% of that same amount of time to
render at overclocked so we're actually
talking about a 22 percent improvement
that is huge and of course we've got the
temperatures to talk about temperatures
we're sitting right in the mid to upper
60s and couldn't be any happier with
those temperatures
I would like lower voltage to do it but
hey one point three to five volts is
still well in the safe range guys has
been Jays two cents these are my
overclocking results here with my 59 60
X if you're a content creator or you're
a heavy renderer you do 3d CAD or
anything like that you have to consider
the CPU yeah it's expensive but the
enthusiast platform lasts a lot longer
than the mainstream platform tends to do
and there's going to be there's going to
be some time it takes for the CPU to be
trumped and even if they come out with a
brand new processor next year that's
marginally faster this CPU is going to
last you a long time guys when J's $0.02
hope you enjoyed this video follow on
that social media if you want to give me
 for upgrading even though I just
built skunkworks two months ago
but hey it's the price you pay in order
to stay on top of bleeding edge
technology and yeah trust me it bleeds
both in speed and wallet pain alright
guys catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
