provided by performance PCs for the
largest online selection of PC modding
and water cooling parts head to
performance pcs comm well here we go
guys day three of the well part three of
the skunk works v3 update there's a lot
of threes half-life 3 confirmed we're
starting off today with me being a
dumbass and now having to go over to
Lowe's because I had marked out some
holes last night to drill and of course
one of them was off by about an eighth
of an inch and trust me an eighth of an
inch over the length of a tube really
shows so now I've got to go to Home
Depot I've got an idea of how to make
this work and we'll talk about that in a
minute I thought it stuck this one off a
little bit interesting as we are
actually in my wife's car which is a
2005 Dodge Durango and it's funny you
can tell we never drive this car because
it's ten years old and it has
eighty-three thousand miles on it so
we're talking like eighty three hundred
miles a year this thing rarely gets
driven and what's also probably a little
bit embarrassing as I Drive the little
Nissan with will sit not really little
it's an Altima but I drive the Nissan
with a bike rack on it and my wife who's
really short five foot three drives a
Durango with oversized tires and a v8
yeah all right so what I ended up doing
that makes me a complete and utter
dumbass was I stayed up way too late
working on this build and I tend to do
this a lot where I get really kind of
involved and obsessed in this build and
for any build and I don't want to go to
bed and want to go as much done as
possible so you do things when you're
tired and then you make mistakes well I
made partially the right move last night
by going okay I'm too tired to cut but
I'm not too tired to measure and when
you're cutting based on measurements and
your measurements themselves you're not
gonna pass me I got a Hemi bitch sorry I
tend to get a little road rage eat this
guy tried to go around me in a little
Ford Escape and it happening brah do you
the v8 bro anyway yeah my wife drives
the more powerful car and we call it we
call this one the white tank so I
measured when I was tired and then I got
this morning and I went ahead and
instead of double-checking my
measurements I went oh I can trust my
membership my measurements and started
cutting well one of the pass-through
fittings now slightly off fortunately
it's often a front to back orientation
rather than a side to side because that
would be harder to fix so there's a
slight gap on the backside of the
fitting when I large the hole or
elongated the hole so I could slide it
to where it needs to go and now there's
a gap in the back and it's bugging me so
what I'm doing now is I'm heading to the
hardware store and I'm going to I'm
gonna see if I can find me a washer
that's big enough to fit the
pass-through fitting but also to mask
that hole that I can paint black it
won't look as good as if you know the
pass-through fitting was just mounted
into the mid plate without any problems
but it'll look better I think that
having that
there another gap wouldn't even be
visible most of the time but it will
bother me knowing it's there so this is
what we're doing we're gonna see how we
can fix this here so as we'll see how it
goes for those car guys out there that
are wondering more about the car or the
Durango it's really not worth mentioning
it's got a 40 series flowmaster on it
resonators are removed a three inch
catback and Canon intake that's it
there's nothing else to do there's
nothing else worth doing to the car it
does have an exhaust leak though and me
being the car guy that I am it's very
hard to justify fixing an exhaust leak
and not replacing with headers but oh
well I want to get rid of this car this
summer later on this year so I'm not
gonna be putting any major work into it
but this thing is a torquey monster
that's for sure
all right so here's what I came up with
like regular like galvanized washers and
stuff we're way too big in order to get
it to fit this fitting this is the
pass-through fitting by the way guys
this is what I use to go through the
floor of the case nothing special it's
called a pass-through fitting I picked
up these rubber washers here because the
only way I could get like galvanized or
zinc washer big enough to fit this
through was it was like that much bigger
than the fitting I was gonna look
terrible so I saw these rubber washers
here and I thought huh as you can see
there they're not too much bigger than
the fitting and because they're rubber
they are gonna be nice and dull and
black and I can easily cut out this hole
with a razor blade or something I got a
few of these that way I can practice on
and then just slip that through and then
put the lock washer on the back and then
we'll cover up the little gap that I'm
trying to fix so there we go that's what
I came up with we'll see how well it
works well I would say that my idea
worked out perfectly
so I just took some scissors and a razor
blade and I took the giant or the small
hole and made this so as you can see I
think it worked out flawlessly here's
the one in the system that I already did
and yeah I think that works out
beautifully so before we move on let's
go ahead and catch up on what we've done
so as you can see I've started the loops
here quite a bit so here's the CPU loop
right there that's the outlet of the
pump it goes up and into the CPU block
comes out of the CPU block and it's
funny how many people were like normally
to do good you don't want on but oh sure
you can there's a thing called head
pressure and it will push up just fine
anyway it comes out of the CPU block up
into the radiator out of the radiator
and into the reservoir and as you can
see the reservoir does have a push down
tube installed in there
right there so it pushes the fluid down
into the fluid in the reservoir now that
open port right there I'm thinking about
incorporating that with my drain I just
haven't decided how I want to do it yet
cuz I don't necessarily want to pass the
drain through the floor here is the GPU
loop right there it comes out of the
block I'm not a huge fan of the way the
fittings have to be like that the wife
says she thinks it looks good I would
have liked to have seen it be just
straight up a bend into it I know I
could have done it with the tube the
problem is where the reservoir or the
pumps are won't line up with the rest of
the GPU blocks if I use too 90s now I
have lots and lots and lots of fittings
I mean bags and bags and bags of
fittings provided by performance PCs and
whatnot but the problem is if I use two
90s then it's too low on this end if I
use a night an extender over there then
it's too low on that end and I just
couldn't get him to line up but I think
that that's a small sacrifice right
there in terms of looks and I think it
looks fine with me and it really doesn't
bother me it doesn't bother me as much
as that little kink and they'll have the
bend it on the old tube or the old
system but I think it's coming along
nicely so now I've got to go ahead and
now I've got to take care of that hole
right there which is going to be a
pass-through for the GPUs and then we
can get the bottom plumbed up the only
thing I really need to do on the bottom
is install both radiators and I haven't
decided yet if I'm gonna do flex hose
down here I'm probably gonna have to do
flex hose at least between the two
radiators and then the you know inlet
and outlet or however they're going to
be I didn't want to do a mixture of flex
and ptg and I'm not gonna really have a
choice because I have to get the
radiators in there and even though the
bottom floor does come out and you can
see that the the bottom down here is not
solid as you can see
there I can just undo those screws and
remove that panel at the bottom and have
access to the entire lower compartment
and the reason why that's there in the
case labs cases is they do have
pedestals so it would give you access to
the pedestal on the bottom and past up
through it through the case if you use
the pedestal as you can see on the way
the pumps are mounted I do have them the
wiring like completely tucked away back
there with holes drilled as they go
through the back you can see the red and
black but that's because the heat shrink
even though it's on there as tight as I
can get it as close as I can get it
that's quite the bend I did sleeve them
as you can see gray and black these are
the power cables right here for the
pumps and then this right here is
actually where my fan header goes for
the lower radiators so that's where the
the fans are going to go for the lower
read and I think I'm gonna take the
lower radiators and it's very dusty they
I'm gonna take the lower radiators off
of the smart control and because I've
got so much more radiator space and I
need I think I'm just gonna put on the
slow-speed adapters and let the them
just always blow on a very slow speed
well as you can see the systems not done
as much as it might look like it it's
kind of missing coolant and stuff but
you can see we got the wiring in and
stuff but we're gonna do a more in-depth
look at this a little bit later on but I
have spent now about a solid week on
this and I'm a little bit tired of it I
always get really tired of it so I
decided rather than trying to
proactively answer questions that I
think people are gonna ask and then
still get asked a bajillion times I went
ahead and did a hashtag on Twitter
called ask skunkworks where you guys
could ask your questions that I would
answer kind of the more popular ones or
maybe questions I felt would answer more
questions then maybe some of the more
generic less specific
so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and take
the Twitter right now we're gonna answer
some of those questions
all right so Joey G on Twitter asks is
this your favorite computer you ever
built for yourself or someone else you
know I think the reality here Joey is
that I am never a hundred percent
satisfied I am never ever done tinkering
updating or messing around with systems
so is it my favorites I would say it's I
like it more than my last one obviously
there's been upgraded hardware in here
but I wouldn't say it's necessarily my
favorite cuz I don't think I have
favorites as weird as that is Zhu Shiba
says are you happy with the case you got
from case labs or would you have gone
with something different
after having built in it well Zhu Shiba
this is not my first time building in
the SMA eight but red mist was the first
time I built in one the case was
actually fairly new at that time and I
fell in love with the case during that
build so this is actually my fourth time
building in an SMA eight one time for
red mist and this is now my third time
building in my own case and I absolutely
love the layout of the SMA eight if you
have the space for it because the thing
is freaking massive it doesn't look like
it on camera plenty of people say it
doesn't look that big it's freaking huge
Heath Dedmon asks what made you think
about naming it skunk works well if I
always wanted to be a naval aviator and
I loved military aviation now one of my
favorite manufacturers of military
equipments for aviation is Lockheed
Martin
and their advanced development programs
or ADP is actually called skunk works
and when I got the case this was
actually the very first case labs case
made in gunmetal in the SMA a trim that
was actually put out for production I
had the very first one all of the
glamour shots from their website is of
my exact case and I thought that the
gunmetal looked very stealthy and when I
thought stealth I thought Lockheed
Martin I thought skunk works so I put
the two together and that's why she's
called skunk works now because she
stinks or anything although she does get
a little stinky at times Robyn H asks if
you had to choose a new color scheme for
the build and couldn't use yellow what
would you choose well to be honest at
the risk of being called an absolute
fanboy I would have loved the gunmetal
with an NVIDIA green and not because I'm
a huge fan of Nvidia but because I am a
fan of that color scheme a dark contrast
with a bright green in paint ball I
liked bright colored paintball markers I
had black and yellow guns and I even had
green guns before and I think that
bright green looks really good at pops
especially with white LEDs I didn't
switch to yellow because yellow is my
favorite color and that's why we went
with yellow in this build something else
I think would have looked really good in
here though would have been more of like
a monochrome which would have been
gunmetal white and black but that's
becoming more and more common especially
now with the x99 deluxe from Asus and
the MSI crate edition I thought it would
have been a little bit too mainstream so
I just went ahead and stuck with the
yellow Jamie McGinnis McGinnis sorry I'm
mutilating your name
he asks or she I guess it could be both
what was the hardest part about building
skunk works and why did you decide to
build such a big sexy ass beast of the
PC well to be honest there's not really
anything hard in this system it's just
very time-consuming lots of measuring
lots of cutting as you guys saw earlier
I kind of screwed it up so time was
spent fixing that things that would have
really taken a lot of time and been
difficult would be custom case mods
which is things like you know PC junky
mods does Richard suros Darth Beavis
things like what they do that's hard and
you've got to have a lot of knowledge
and a lot of tool craftsmanship and very
creative to be able to do that sort of
stuff and the reason why I don't is
because I don't even have a garage that
I can
work in so this is my workspace and I
can't do hard stuff in here
Adrian asks how strong is your radiators
and what do you need three Titan X s
isn't it enough with one or two well
first of all my radiators are strong
enough to do clean deadlifts and second
of all why do one or two when I can do
three Titan X's 3 is bigger than two and
one last time I checked this is a good
one hip hip isn't he busting on Twitter
epic beard by the way if money or
sponsors were no object what things
would you like to do to skunkworks you
know to be honest this is pretty much a
No Limits build there's not really
anything I would have or could have
changed in this build I mean the 59 60 X
is already the top end Intel i7 that you
can get without doing dual CPUs which a
motherboard like that wouldn't have fit
in this case anyway for Titan X's as
much as it would be awesome and I
actually would have been able to do it I
could have gotten another type next the
scaling on it is so bad and the heat
output would have been so high and the
power draw would have been so great that
3 is really my sweet spot if you guys
remember when I was benchmarking my 7
80s in this office I was dimming the
lights in the house and I'm a little
worried about what the circuit on a 50
year old house like this the 15 amp
circuit would do when doing benchmarking
on 4 type Nexus so to keep things safe
and to keep my house from catching fire
this is pretty much the max build that I
could do which was fairly limitless and
damn am i lucky to be able to do that
it's really a weird life now
jedd 1920 says do you ever feel that you
will make another project that will
replace skunkworks I'm sure it will be
replaced someday something new and more
exciting in terms of case will come out
really cases are kind of the central
focal point of the builds and right now
the SMA is still my absolute favorite
case on the market so until that changes
I don't see there being any drastic
changes with the system I mean
after all this has been an evolution of
the PC a staple for my channel as long
as my channels been around and it's gone
everywhere from an 81 20 AMD FX all the
way up to the 59 60 X so to answer your
question yes at some point it will outdo
itself it's outdoing itself right now
from where it was a week ago and that's
kind of the way we're gonna keep this
ball rolling so it doesn't roll over top
of me cuz that think it's freaking heavy
here's one I get asked all the time and
this is from Logan he says what's your
reasoning of doing separate loops temps
noise what yeah all of the above I can
control the temperature of the GPUs
independent of the CPU and I can control
the fans independently and have the GPU
fans ramped up or in this case I'm
actually not going to control those fans
I'm going to keep them spinning slow
based on load and different things
happening with the system when I'm
rendering I don't need the GPU fans to
be going full speed I need the CPU fans
to speed up and same thing with gaming I
don't need the CPU fans to speed up
I need the GPU fans to speed up but in
this case I went with way more surface
area than I need on radiators that way I
can keep the speeds slow so I might not
even control these things at all
separate loops also means that if I have
a problem with one component like say
the CPU or the GPUs or a GPU I can lis
completely drain one or the other
without having to affect the other and
then have to deal with bleeding a
massive loop and refilling it again so
it keeps things segregated Joey G once
again asking did you think skunkworks
would be as big as it is in the computer
community I'll be honest with you I'm
surprised it's as big as it is or it's
widely known as it is because there's
really not a whole lot special about it
it has high-end hardware in there and
it's got bent tubes and stuff but I'm
not the first to do that I'm not the
last to do that and I'm not the best to
do it so I don't know why it's as
popular as it is maybe it's because a
lot of the modding communities don't
have representatives in there that have
huge YouTube channels so maybe it's just
more the fact there's more people
watching my build than say forums and
things but men there are so many better
builders out there I mean we're talking
like world class builders I already
mentioned it before Darth beetus PC
junkie mods MP
Tech that bill Owen those guys are
freaking gods at what they do Lee
Harrington Darth Beavis or Richard
sorrows and bill Owen those three alone
are the world class representatives of
custom pcs this doesn't hold a candle to
anything that those guys do if you don't
believe me just go look up their work or
just go to any freakin PC Magazine and
you'll find something of theirs and just
about every addition alright and me asks
not me but me on social media says now
that you did a PT G build on skunkworks
how did it compare to acrylic tubing and
how long to heat both all right well PE
T G gets softer at a lower temperature
so I have to heat it as much it's much
more malleable I can get very tight
bends on there and it's much much more
durable than acrylic let me go ahead and
demonstrate I've got two pieces no I'm
not gonna take out a hammer and start
smashing them again this time I've got
two pieces of tube here this is PE T G
and this is acrylic based on the
recommendation of people saying go out
and get yourself a tube bender rather
than having to cut with a saw I went out
and bought one but there's a reason why
I never use one of these before and I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys why now
when it comes to putting this thing on
to the PE T G you just kind of clamp it
on where you want to cut and then you go
round and round and round and round and
round and you just keep tightening as
you go and as you go around you
eventually will cut through the tube
this actually works on copper it works
on this btg it works on galvanized it in
fact a lot of people use big ones like
this to cut things like muffler pipes
and things like that it's very common in
mechanic's plumbers
this is how most people do it but as you
can see it takes quite a little bit to
cut all the way through this thing but
as you can see once you do it's much
cleaner you know how the shavings
everywhere you just file this down and
it's nice and smooth allow me to
demonstrate why I never used it on
acrylic this is the exact same sized
tube as that one there which is a 10 by
13 10 millimeter opening 13 millimeter
exterior same exact piece the moment
I'll go farther down the moment you
clamp it down and start cutting it it
basically will crack on you did you hear
that
now I didn't do it any different than I
do with the PPT G now let's look at that
so that's what happened to the acrylic
right there the moment you start
clamping it down tighter to cut so
that's why I never used one of those
with acrylic well that's the end of part
three here of the skunkworks vlog it
actually took place over two days I'm
gonna go ahead and edit this now put it
up I know it's a little bit longer
because the QA but the last of the parts
I need to get this thing filled will be
here tomorrow and we will go ahead and
do an epic conclusion to the skunkworks
update and then that will be followed
with benchmarks and things once I get
all the software loaded back on this my
SSD main drive didn't change but I do
have to get all of my other hard drive
stuff backed up and then moved over so I
will take a little bit of time but
anyway guys thanks for watching and as
always you guys have made all of this
possible this has nothing to do with me
being an awesome person or anything like
that this has to do with you guys being
awesome viewers because if you guys
weren't watching these companies
wouldn't be interested in sending me
these parts to see what kind of cool
builds I can come up with that just
makes this really a freaking dream job
so with always guys thank you for that
and in order to say thank you let's just
say in the future there might be
something you guys don't want to miss
trust me on that might involve
one of my 90 days all right guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
