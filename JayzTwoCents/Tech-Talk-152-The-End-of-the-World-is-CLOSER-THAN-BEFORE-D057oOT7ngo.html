oh that wasn't so bad
we're only three minutes late based on a
last-minute OBS so what's up guys JC
sense here we are doing Tech Talk number
152 with Jays two cents and Bart
inoculants
sub carnacki lols so I made the stupid
mistake of going yeah sure I'll update
OBS right before we want to use it
nothing good comes up updates right
before you need a system right Jerry
that's right but we do it every time
hell I'll take it one step further I've
updated my BIOS before a live stream
before oh gosh yeah well I actually that
happened to you when I was up there when
you got william remember we tried to our
our life a stream and nothing was
working on your machine and I was
vlogging it and you were getting so
irritated with me I'm always irritated
with you that's when people don't
realize I guess that means you're a good
friend or actually I guess that means
your family actually your family if I'm
always irritated with you and I just
want to kick you in the balls it
probably is it's it's family that's
we're not friends your family everyone's
saying that my mic is only coming from
the right ear I can fix that hold on
Jerry you take the show while I go touch
the camera okay all right well welcome
everybody to Tech Talk number 152 yeah
we're gonna use the F as five next week
because Jay is trying to go way too
professional way too fast with live
stream Here I am sitting over here with
them with the best camera equipment that
I have best audio equipment I have and
everything in J season like broadcast
level shit over there he's got he's
literally looking at my face on a
teleprompter guys I don't know if you
saw his little pre stream he did over on
Twitch with periscope but he literally
has my face on the lens of the camera
like I didn't even know teleprompters
could be used for such a thing but hey
whatever it takes to get him to look at
me uh guys also I have a camera too
today I usually don't do this on Tech
Talk but I figured since Jays going all
out balls out I'd go ahead and use this
now I got the robotic camera this is my
GoPro Hero 4 attached to mr. robotic arm
that I'm working on
so hey welcome back Jay did you get a
working now yeah you he's still working
on it okay he's gonna go work on it some
more so if you guys didn't see over on
morning coffee well it should call the
afternoon coffee or afternoon Red Bull
yesterday it changes every single day
I unveiled robocam you guys wanna see
robocam check this out here we go rollin
domed up going to the high shot see it's
like I don't have a camera man like
Jada's because you know he's all baller
status I got to use cheap little 3d
printed robotic camera man almost all I
own camera work I got in constantly
training me but I have to actually keep
setting up OBS now while we're going so
screw it I'm never doing a no BS update
right before a stream again sorry
probably a good idea so yeah I got
robotic camera man here so if you guys
want to see that or you want to see
what's on my screen you know I just push
this button just pop around we're
working on the code to smooth it all out
right now right now we're just using a
beta code from a long long time ago but
it's pretty cool turned out good close
up
guys just a test real quick you should
hear me in both ears now not just your
right ear although my right eye was
making love to your right ear I love all
of your ears so when I make love to your
left ear dude nice and now we're back to
the main cam so is it all working now
Jay are you satisfactory means here what
was the problem was it just cuz you
using professional audio equipment Lee
had one XLR plugged in or what I don't
know every what's this right here is
clipping now I'm not clipping on my end
it's weird I mean let me listen back to
it hold on nice so is it all working now
Jay are you satisfactory ease here what
was the problem was it just because you
use some professional audio time you had
one XLR plugged in or what oh my god the
professionalism here man is unparalleled
son parallels here guys you can even
look at my window that's what my window
looks like you guys want to see my
computer you wanna see the computer here
let's drop it down you guys to take a
look inside the computer just think it's
so baller there you go so if you guys
know now I guess you can oh shit my HDMI
cable got pulled out fix the audio
see it's hard to tell who's lagging with
observing oh shit and now you just
unplugged your camera I'm trying to fix
it right now hold on we're back we're
back i I didn't put enough slack in the
cable for the movement that I asked it
to do it it excellently it didn't fucked
it up I'm sorry I'm sorry Jay here I'll
turn it around Wellesley right there I'm
sorry I apologize
it was I'm sorry I'm so sorry I didn't
mean you oh god I almost hit in the face
all right we're going back to main camp
really on camera let me unmute the
stream and see if I can hear you hold on
okay I can hear me
uh come on you guys say something maybe
how I feel on the show yeah I can't hear
your audio is not working on stream it's
not working on stream no I'm like I'm
watching the stream right now and your
lips are moving and nothing's coming out
I can hear me but I can't hear you but
when I talk the meter moves nothing no
BS ever ever ever I don't know half the
people are saying audio look at this
look at the chat half people are saying
audios fine half the people are saying
Jay turn up how do people are saying
Gerry is too loud Jay is low Jay is I'm
definitely louder than you I I don't
have it up very loud I can't hear let me
turn up my actual feet over here give me
say alright here we go troubleshooting
the audio is really quiet on the stream
just in general both of us are you guys
noticing you have the Turner of audio
way the hell up Nick come down here take
the channel 2 on the FS 7 take it off
auto and put it just the game I'm afraid
if I go up any higher I'm gonna clip I'm
already in the yellow we need a we need
a third part no no it's not that if
you're if you're in the yellow that's
that's not it's something else
I mean that's that's what it's sending
to the stream so oh wait hold on do I
have hold on I think I might know what
everybody in chat saying audio is
perfect the audios perfect audio is
perfect Jay is clipping Jay is too low
like everybody's given a different
answer so this could be a you know can
be YouTube issue cuz you're just sending
up one stream okay the wife just texted
me and says she can hear me fine I'm
just a lot quieter than you
okay so want me to turn my game down no
oh I just pulled you down testing
testing testing testing testing test
okay what Nick would you put me up to
you
okay how is that everybody versus this
we had this all set with the Epis Evan
let suppose good with the Epis Evan it's
just the teleprompters for the air we
give us five I mean the Epis Evan is
with teleprompter attaches to you so you
just had to go more pro man you're like
fs5 don't know it's it's not my fault I
mean according to be s everything's
working fine like the the audio meters
are pegging negative 6 on both of us I
don't know Jay I kind of feel like I'm
hearing racecar driving excuses here now
everyone's saying Jerry's too low that's
impossible
[Laughter]
here I can adjust my volume just by
going like this or like this look just
you know I'm a very dynamic human being
I don't think I have the component on my
compressors up halfway so I should be
pretty level stop touching stuff Nick if
you guys can't tell you're spamming the
chat so fast that none of your message
is matter because we can't read them no
the chat literally just looks like a dot
matrix printer running offline all right
so I'm gonna do this blah blah myself
off ah oh yeah what are you doing there
I'm just yeah he's doing things
oh but yeah you monitoring through there
so gonna tell you anything though it's
not clear it's like a puppy there
mm-make watch me just put your face in
front of the camera quick at least say
hi everybody it since you're right there
now come on Little Nicky
yes I can't see you because I see the
teleprompter okay everyone's saying it's
good now okay we're just gonna leave it
here I'm not touching anything anymore
actually my edit shit J this is a
professional this is a professional
podcast now I'm adding a game filter
there
alright I'll switch back to my primary I
should be HP good now we're both were
both hitting like negative 6 nice
beautiful that's a good place to be
Kari good welcome to the show guys only
12 minutes late that's actually good
that's like that's good you got you
gotta make him you gotta make him want
it you got to make him crave a Jay Jay
is clipping kind of robotic I don't
think I'm clipping but you know if I am
clipping so what I mean you said you
sound great over here but again that's
Skype but I imagine if you were clipping
the microphone I unless well you got a
separate microphone going in the other
camera right my camera will not allow
the microphone to clip oh you've got a
was got it got a built-in compressor
oh that's cool oh wait the compressors
built right into the microphone yeah
it's built right into the Sony preamp
Sony has the best audio preamps of any
camera that's pretty badass that is
badass
I have yet to use the one on my new
camera yet because I have to I use the
Mk II 440 mic and it has an 8 inch mini
jacket but it only allows XLR on that
camera to use that the auto game mm-hmm
if you use the internal mic thing where
you just plug in like a little mini jack
on the side of it you have to set up you
have to set a level well I mean it's no
clever ya know I remember I've got two
of those mics and they're good but my
problem with them is like you said they
the three input settings on them are so
vastly different and the I'm gonna take
the gain off cuz everyone's like you're
clipping so you put the gain on okay
the other problem too is that like their
fall-off range is so it's so narrow so
it can sound great in a certain range
and then once you go P up past that
range a little bit then it just falls
off like terrible oh yeah no no and I
honestly I think that's by design
because it's designed to be a little bit
more near-field so that if you're in a
loud environment like it works great
a lot like a vlogging camera you get it
within like 2 or 3 feet of you yeah but
I know what you're talking about when
you put it across the room it just you
lose all the dynamic range out of the
voice like all of it je fais red now
yeah I saw the replay I looked pretty
red when I was uh well but I was
laughing um I don't I don't I don't like
this level of fubar but it's bound to
happen
right what do you do a live show
anything could go wrong it kind of gives
you a new appreciation for like the news
right totally anyway you got the new
robotic arm thing there how much does
the better I do I already told him about
it well you're off like doing all your
little camera of thingamajig ins but
anyways I can tell them exactly what it
is the robotic arm is created by a
company called hattington Dynamics and
they're basically trying to create
robots for the masses that can do
anything like 3d printing you know a pic
in place using them for assembly
actually they want to make an arm
assemble another arm is one of their
goals well all the parts on this with
the exception of just a few things in
the electronics are all 3d printed all
the joints on this all the effectors all
the wheels all the cogs everything was
done on a desktop 3d printer so these
are incredibly effective in cheap little
units to operate compared to like a lot
of the stuff out there that's like you
know tens of thousands of dollars for
something similar but what really makes
the arm special isn't necessarily the
build of the arm it's actually the
software behind it and right now I'm
just using their old really really basic
software for moving around and looking
at things like if you want to look at my
computer screen for instance I can click
I'm using my stream deck here to control
this I did that programming yesterday so
if I click over the camera now you can
see my screen I can also bring you down
you can look at my keyboard it's
wobbling yeah you know the reason why
it's wobbling right now is because the
servo is overcompensating basically it's
going this way and then it's going this
way and then it's going this way so yeah
it's fighting me as I push on it watch
I'll push on it see I push it it just
comes right back
yeah it's that's why it's jumping around
like that is because it's it's basically
thinking it's completely rigid and
there's no flex in the system which
isn't the case it's sitting on a table
on carpet so so it's overcompensating so
they're writing the code right now to
fix that but yeah this thing when it's
done it's gonna move completely smoothly
they're they're doing this in
CIM Attucks programming right now that
allows it to accelerate and decelerate
smoothly it also knows exactly where it
is even by the weight like if you add
weight to it it'll actually push back up
to the proper position because it's not
just going by the steps on the motors
it's using these optical encoders and it
can figure out how much flex there is
between the joints and compensate for it
so how many weights in that handle this
one can handle one kilogram of weight as
it is right now unless you count
counterbalance it then you can cancel
out the weight you can go up to several
pounds I was gonna say I wonder what
would happen if it was if it had a
little bit of weight added to it just so
that it can smooth out the motion oh it
does heavy cameras are smoother cameras
because there yep so yeah and we tried
that we try to see I'd like if I put my
finger on top and I just add something
there's some static weight to it as I
move it makes a dramatic difference like
watcher I'll just move it over like the
window watch I only add some weight to
it I pushed it past this limit so I was
like ah screw you
uh-oh there goes I think it's like
trying to figure out where it was but if
I add a little weight on the joint it
does definitely smooth it out a lot so
though he's talking like only a few
ounces you know yeah see this right here
see that's much smoother and that just
would be putting a little bit of
pressure down on the top of it with my
finger what like what if it was like
rubber bands oh just to create some kind
of dynamic pressure on it their
attention yeah ah you could do that but
I'd prefer them to do a method that
didn't actually put resistance against
the motors but uh I don't know that
might actually work that actually
doesn't sound like a bad idea to try but
they can work it out in software the
cool thing is the robot knows exactly
where it is because of the combination
of the stepper motors and the optical
encoder wheels which can get down to 50
microns just give you guys an idea how's
higher resolution than desktop 3d
printer as far as being able to go back
and touch the same place in 3d space
over and over and over again but the
software they have for the acceleration
everything like that it knows what kind
of loads in tension are on it and it can
calculate that so that when it moves to
its destination it comes in with the
right deceleration that it doesn't
overshoot and slingshot and if that's
the code they're gonna send me next that
things like all we're pretty printed
isn't it
except yeah most of it is like if you
look at it here so the arm the only
parts on this that aren't 3d printed
other than the electro
sar this arm right here is a
carbon-fiber rod right there and then
this arm down here is a carbon-fiber rod
but all the connections the joints
themselves the gears the only other
thing is the transmissions the bearings
and the transmissions obviously are
metal but they're off-the-shelf parts
but the whole base everything here the
even the optical encoder wheels which I
thought was strange I was like how the
hell deep 3d printed optical encoder
real because I'll let you guys know the
optical encoder real what happens it's
basically like a brake beam that goes
through a bunch of little slots in a
plastic disc and based on the light
shining through those slots that can
determine exactly what the position of
something is and these are 3d printed
and you'd think with how shitty 3d
printers are it wouldn't work but they
actually wrote software that compensates
for it so you can put a shitty printed
optical encoder disk on there and it'll
basically learn all the little shit
points on it by moving the arm to all of
its extents and compensate for it what
about as those points wear down as they
point down you have to recalibrate the
robot but luckily there's no con to
physical contact with it the optical
encoder skates over it so there's
nothing touching it so technically it
shouldn't degrade unless you bash it
into shit okay Jay looking at the news
reporter right now Jerry never talked
about because Jerry has a different
camera angle he's down there Jerry once
you point your camera real quick if you
turn at your at the screen to show what
I look like now can you show oh sure
sure yeah I can totally do that I'm
gonna go and flap around Jerry has a
cooler angle
let's go screen the big camera there Oh
God okay that's what you look like his
campaign was much different he's got a
lower angle here all Bulls can peek
under the desk but he hasn't paid a
monthly subscription so he can't be
under there yes so my robotic arm you'll
be able to see a lot once again doesn't
he figured out yeah it's funny I was
actually looking at your your camera
right now right cuz I'm looking at the
camera
if you guys haven't seen the periscope
ordered the Twitter pictures I we've set
up a monitor on our teleprompter so that
when I'm looking at Jerry that
teleprompter is nothing but Jerry's
camera so I'm looking at Jerry right now
I can't even see the camera lens but you
guys think I'm looking at you it's just
like the news right so I forgot that
it's a mirror so I'm wondering like why
is all Jerry's images backwards
I do think that's a pretty cool idea
though because I've never thought to put
an image on a teleprompter you know I've
always thought that they're
predominantly used for text but it makes
sense if you want to look at a camera
make eye contact with somebody you're
interviewing that makes perfect sense
that's what they commonly do or is that
just something that you're you're like
fuck it I can do it I'm gonna do it I'm
sure people use this like a teleprompter
in all kinds of weird ways you know so I
don't know we tried to put a monitor
underneath it like on the floor but it
was wasn't lining up right so I was with
the atomos under there I mean the most
as a is a 4k monitor reason MP but how
about we get into the title of this
dream the world the end of the world is
closer than it was yesterday
that's right all right we're talking
about the Doomsday Clock for those you
guys who don't know what the Doomsday
Clock it was a basically an artist's
conception from some guy named was it
what is a mortal mortal Langsdorf I
guess he worked on the Manhattan Project
and so so so basically the idea of the
Doomsday Clock is how it's a symbolic a
kind of gesture of how close we are to
nuclear annihilation now recently
they've also added climate change on
there too so it's how close are we to
human extinction either by nuclear or
environmental reasons or a combination
above basically they've they've come up
with a formula or an algorithm that
determines based on current world events
the current status of countries and
politics and all this stuff and the
technology advancements to determine
when the human race will annihilate
itself and they don't and it's not
specifically to the date it's just how
close we are
well not like symbolically but but not
not the specific date but how much
closer we are and once you hit 12
o'clock that's it that's game so when
the nukes are launching that's 12
o'clock so what you guys need to know
now is according to this we have just
moved 30 seconds closer to midnight that
we were so now the clock is at 11:58
p.m. yep closest we've been since the
50s
like like sounds like the Cold War right
and before that it was world war two
that moved it if they find is crazy is
they have this timeline this arbitrary
timeline very arbitrary that is built
upon current events on an open-ended
timeline trying to determine the end of
time when they're both time has Nolan
reference so it's like well we're just
established we have 30 seconds closer to
12 o'clock but we don't know exactly
when 12 o'clock is gonna happen so 30
seconds could be 30 million years for
all we know true sure I think it's more
like a running Def Con though you know
like you have the Def Con levels when
you're going to war I think I think it's
kind of more a running tab of that where
you don't necessarily step down the
levels you know right when the end of
the conflict happens you step down the
levels based on how close you're getting
to disarming less nuclear weapons less
tension as the tension goes up you know
this also goes up in combination with
that and they said the reason that it
went up was because of the nuclear
proliferation our presidents you know
angry attitude towards other foreign
powers there's a whole bunch and climate
change climate change factors into it
too but that's that's why they're saying
that we're getting ever so close to the
think of it like odds it's it's more of
the potential for nuclear war today is
higher than it was yesterday well yeah
because because advancements of
Technology even in third world countries
are those that might even be willing to
use such weapons which by the way I'd
still like to point out the United
States is still the only country to ever
actually use a nuclear weapon in war
that's true it's one of those things
where as time progresses the technology
of uranium and plutonium or whatever
that shit is this is going to increase
with a lot of these nations what what I
think is what I'm curious about is has
that clock ever gone backwards has
anything in society ever been like faith
in humanity restored we're gonna put 10
seconds back on the clock oh yeah yeah
no I wish I had the whole let me see if
I can find it I think I still have a tab
open for it there actually is a
projection that shows that it did go
backwards need aliens not just forward
progressing it actually does go
backwards when good things happen
nucular nuclear hey I forgot every time
you say the word new nuclear you started
debate on the way it's actually
pronounced to do cooler a nuclear it's a
big-ass boom followed by a lot of heat
okay all right here we go I think I do
you think if a nuclear device was
detonated in society and someone's
yelling oh my god
it's a nuclear bomb do you think
someone's would be like it's not
pronounced nucular
its nuclear as the as the wave if they
are they've got some serious priority
shit they got to deal with before agents
oh I can't God I can't find the graphic
but there is a graphic that shows that
it did it did go backwards significantly
every time like when the nuclear
disarmament happened in Russia and the
United States after the Cold War it
dropped way back like 20 minutes before
midnight I mean it was like way down but
now it's the closest it's been since the
Cold War so then so that's I mean that's
saying something Wells if you believe
the Doomsday Clock but realistically
it's kind of a fear mongering device if
you look at it but at the end of the day
all it's saying is that based on the
amount of nuclear weapons that we have
the basically the mental state of the
president and the people around him that
are capable using those weapons the
hostile intent towards another country
that also is a nuclear power that was a
big one that pushed it up because you
have to acknowledge that you know even
though North Korea can't launch a
missile 20 feet to save their lives
actually it's not true there actually
got some pretty good missiles now I got
some lunch at OHS quite a few people
have mentioned this but James M and Chet
actually took it to detail he said fall
of the USSR in 1991 let it back to 11:47
p.m. we're now at 11:58 so yeah we're
really really really cool remind me of
those those pastors that try to predict
you in the world and they're always
wrong right they're always oh yeah
they're always wrong but that's because
they use it as a way to get money from
people well it's basically just an odds
game right I mean just just because
you're guaranteed to have 99.9 percent
odds of winning something doesn't mean
you're gonna win it you know it's like
it just means it's likelier well that
makes sense it was likely er because we
have a president that's capable of doing
something we have missiles yeah it's not
likely er its nuclear you sure a way
Locklear hey whatever happen our I would
like to liken it in to the RNC Luke
tables in world of warcraft house dumb
boots only have a nine point one percent
drop chance but it's kind of nice
actually guys you have those myself
I wish I could meet them so it's kind of
like when you're you're trying to run
after some sort of the rare mount that
support 1% drop chance and you see
people with it it's HAP it can happen
that chance is a chance no matter what
right I just hit myself in the face with
the camera I saw that did you put a
smart I thought I had the position just
right just one
like clubs me in the face with a fucking
GoPro so basically I forced you to hit
yourself in the face
you did you did you just you just caused
me to punch myself in the face your your
genius what does it you're no you're a
political genius
hey yeah totally politically incorrect
guy you never me that's why I could
never have just like that that live
stream boy your cam in our studio I'd
forget it's going one day and then like
my life as I know would be over yeah I
can't have one of those up here in the
nerdy K because i dial honestly dog shed
eating him Televi i didn't have a shirt
on when we were doing like soundcheck
well I couldn't let here I couldn't see
below your waist when you turn it on you
were sitting just like that with my
shirt off and I was a bit worried for
the first I did have hands off but
that's a rare occurrence up here just
see you know ok so yeah anyways doomsday
doomsday clock guys we're the closest
we've been in probably 70 years 60 70
years to nuclear annihilation when did
this war or a tsunami killing us all
when did they start just not important
what's that when did they start the
clock the clock when you see if I've got
that piece of information the clock was
started let's see here June 1947 would
be the first the first time that that
Myrtle Myrtle guy came up with the idea
but that wasn't when it was actually
like it was it was just an artistic
project at that point but then I got
taken further than that I have a feeling
that it was like in 1947 is something
along the lines of man the Doomsday
Clock it's brought to you by Lucky
Strike cigarettes like it was sponsored
it was a spark so one of the blurbs I
got is a set is that our science and
security boards track the number of
statistics looking for example at the
number and kinds of nuclear weapons in
the world the parts per million of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the
degree of acidity in our oceans and the
rate of the sea level rise that's what's
currently calculated into the Doomsday
Clock figure this seems to be rising but
California be be drying yeah I think you
guys are probably gonna break off and
become a boat at some some point you're
gonna be the world's biggest luxury
cruise liner not right choice
Oregon's gonna sneeze and we're just
gonna turn into like a vapor of dust
gone look on the bright side you guys a
lot of plenty of water then all around
you I'm drinkable today obviously
practices the impediment off-camera
excellent execution
maybe I practice talking normal for the
camera did you ever think about that
hmm people are so mean you know every
time somebody trolls me I get really sad
and I cry a little double pieces Jay I
saw you in real life why you right now
on the screen so we're even
yeah there you go you see isn't that
weird when people say that I've had
people do that they just they just
message maybe like hey dude I saw I saw
you at the grocery store I didn't want
to bother you
Robin it's because you were getting that
hemorrhoid cream that's why I didn't
want to say hi to you yeah they let me
walk into the condom aisle and they're
like ooh shit mostly because you look
like to sample before you buy so manyy
gets like a bringing him home Adam all
baggy what does the injector for the
hemorrhoid cream have to be like three
inches long is it for his pleasure
I mean I don't complain I mean the
applicator is part of the fun I mean if
you gotta have em roids if I imagine
it's like a it's like the movie alien
it's like the tongue like another face
comes out of it right yeah let's not
draw mental pictures next time I go to
the doctor to get my prostate exam I'm
just gonna be seeing that little don't
get don't get a proctologist at six foot
four J I highly recommend going for like
the smaller like like like my doctor
used to have dr. Lee this little asian
guy with tiny little fingers I wish he
was the one giving me my proctological
exams someone said why do you know that
I assume justice Souter says why do you
know that I assume he's talking about
the length of the hemorrhoid injector
thing yeah how do you know this Jay well
I did used to live in my parents these
leave that shit hanging up on the
counter oh god never mind oh you just
brought it you just dredged up a really
scary memory so growing up in Gorst
Washington like literally a town with 15
people like I knew everybody in the town
there was every single person in the
town we what's the city name literally
the first letter of everyone's name just
mushed together and that was kind of
sounds like it doesn't it it kind of
sounds like hey man they got like a
landmark now they got a place called
Ellen Dan Gardens it's a bonsai garden
so dude they're on the map now and their
post office is like 14 little mailboxes
in the back of the kwik-e-mart
they couldn't even make real life
full-size trees in a state like
Washington no couldn't do it couldn't do
it so
so anyways growing it when I was a kid I
used to go you know into the bathroom
and rifle through the drawers looking
for shit there was always this tube that
was like this big it looked like a like
you know how paint you know that when
you get a paint tube those aluminum
those old aluminum tubes that like paint
comes in you like squish up yeah yeah
they're like they're like metallic suits
okay so there was a giant one of those
in the drawer and it had just I can't
remember what the name on it was but it
had just had some really plain looking
text on and everything and then like
later on in life I was walking through a
store and I looked and I saw the exact
same tube and it was uh was it that
vagine' artificial vaginal moisture
cream for old people and we were living
with my grandparents so I was like tubes
in the bathroom slowly going down and
down and down and down and down
throughout the month I'm thinking it's
like toothpaste for old people
no old grandpa was breaking off a piece
and grandmas busy he was you know what
though I would say that the artificial
vaginal moisture cream is better than
the the you know organic vaginal
moisture cream that you buy in a tube
don't think you can buy organic exactly
why artificial is probably better in
this instance that'd be a kind of a fun
job to run there you know what are you
doing here today well I'm here to donate
some vaginal moisture I'm milk and Betty
please put your legs on the stirrup and
grab a handful of those paper towels
over there and I'll just wring them out
pour your knees to your chest and push
you can only get this here on tech dog
folks I did warn the wife before the
stream I said this dream is probably
gonna get weird today if you guys
haven't noticed with we're gonna
probably not talk a whole lot of tech
this week yeah you know what you wonder
why I'm in a good mood what I really
know why I'm gonna give you this is you
in a good mood I thought you're in a bad
mood why this is you in a good mood why
would you I think it's just the way you
look you just always look angry
like you've got resting bastard phase
well tell me something I don't know all
right so you're happy you're happy look
at what that white happy because as soon
as the end tech talk I and mind a little
mini vacation until next Tuesday oh
fucking a dude were you going away okay
good enough he's like I'm going to this
hotel on this street and I'll be there
for 14 hours of it yeah the wife and I
the wife and I are cool
a little a little mini-vacation it's
gonna be nice dude that's awesome that's
awesome where the kids kids go
understand would it be a vacation if
they were going not really know wouldn't
know there they are staying with the
sitter see the youngest our youngest is
now old enough to where she's not all
like attached to the boob anymore that
she used to be yeah and so you've seen
before like how attached she is no yeah
it's not like that anymore like now when
we leave where she used to freak out me
like no were you going on would you go
Birdo take me with you now she's like
we're leaving and she's like bye
she's that age where she's just like she
associates you leaving with just getting
away with murder she associates us
leaving what she gets to do stuff now
because babysitters they know how to
play the babysitter right gonna play
everybody they're like little geniuses
yeah uh all kids know how to play the
babysitters
although Xander he he does and ER for
some reason just listens to whatever you
tell him to do and he doesn't really
fight you on it it's like Xander's idea
of a wild time is seeing just how many
rules he can follow like pretty much
yeah it's really weird like you know if
he's being disagreeable that there's
something wrong like he's sick or
there's like a physical ailment with him
because he's just not like that like the
other day he walks upstairs and he looks
in the room he goes hey Dad can I come
in the room and I was like no go
downstairs is like okay she's like in
that that's like how he is he's just he
doesn't really get upset about things
you go down he's playing with the toy or
something like hey can I have that he'll
hand it here whatever and they'll sit
there you'd be like I'm gonna keep this
forever and he's like uh can I have it
back they were like no it'll be like uh
okay and then I'll go grab another turn
I'm like I'm just messing with you kid
come here you know I'm trying to teach
him sarcasm but he doesn't get he's just
like okay I guess it's yours boy leave
this to me yesterday he's extreme Israel
oh yeah he gave me one of his diecast
little Subarus
that's a big deal to him massively like
he let me borrow it once like he gave it
to me and then he came back later and
said I'm just letting you borrow that I
want it back
and then finally the other day he
brought it to me and he said because we
told me had to clean out his room and
get rid of some toys he brought it to me
he goes daddy I really know you want
this you can have it and put it on your
desk upstairs and I was like you know
what that's a big step for him normally
I would bite the head off the people in
chat going I thought this was tech talk
not blah blah blah talk but I won't do
that because we had such a long hiatus
and there's so many new followers since
the show went on hiatus
like February a year ago yep that they
probably don't know any better that the
only thing tech about Tech Talk is the
technology we bring it to you via
otherwise or via however you want to say
it otherwise this is whatever the hell
we want to talk about that's right Lee
is the chipset bro so there's a there
was a donation coming here I want to I
want to read just because you had a
couple of decent questions I think that
could spark some conversation yeah these
people these people are like supporting
our drug habit so let's say these are
their stuff are you drinking your liquid
drugs right now mm-hmm my squeezing arm
says hey guys thanks for the great
content both of you inspired me to start
my career in IT two questions
the first one I think sir is a pretty
obvious answer he says our cash
donations okay or weird like at a
convention or something
Jerry weird but we'll still take them
it's weird but Jerry will definitely
take your cash may I would I would
probably rather you go like like we go
get a coffee or something rather than
you pay me cash yeah JJ has figured out
how to actually run a real business I'm
still pleb status though so yes I will
take your cash and I'll probably give
you a hug and then I just send it on the
corner street I just ride around on my
arm I write my self-righteous horse as
Logan I have no I have no problems
accepting support from people oh my god
this one was directed to direct directly
says Jerry which sorts which search
would you go for if you had no BA that's
kind of an open-ended question though
which what now certs certifications Oh
what certification would I go for I
probably like an A+ and even though I
hate Microsoft now pry em CSE just cuz
it's like so versatile I think you
needed eight plus like just I know
there's so many people eight pluses now
I don't think it's gonna even get you an
interview for one oh the truth no no but
the thing is without an A+ if you have
an M CSE stand alone you don't need the
A+ like honestly even on the MC se you
can get a lab job anywhere and they'll
just expect you to figure shit out the
A+ though however is really good if you
want them to even look at your resume if
you have no certification the A+ is the
good entry-level certification that
everybody looks for so based on the
things that we were looking for when
when I worked in IT and we were hiring
people which didn't have a lot of
turnover we had like two or three new
hires a year and a couple turnovers a
year was CCNA was highly regular like
sought after because we did a lot of
server and stuff with you know yes the
Cisco certifications are hard to get
though that is a really hard cert to get
they are hard to get that's why I'm
saying that
want to go to route of getting searched
to not go to college put the money into
a CCNA or he said mcse or and it's like
the thing is a lot of IT now anybody can
honest to do like 16 year old kids can
do stands just straight-up vit work you
need something that says you are at
least of the next level and networking
is quite honestly where that's at and so
having that cisco cert and whatnot is
definitely gonna get you noticed in my
google died over there there we go no
it's like things are just being weird
I have not updated my test bench yet
because I'm terrified of the new the new
kernel code micro code updates and
firmwares let's talk about that dude
computers are dropping like flies right
now with the new the new micro code and
firmware updates this this intel spectre
and meltdown issue yeah it's a mess it's
Souness bad right now well it's
completely I'm expected it was like one
of the biggest vulnerabilities ever
found at a level that isn't easily
solved yeah so in in to my knowledge
nobody has at least it hasn't bubbled up
yet to anybody has used this exploit
successfully in an attack but everybody
acknowledges that it absolutely 100%
could be used if the hackers figure out
exactly how to leverage it it would be
catastrophic because it affects not just
all well which one is its meltdown just
affects Intel right and then there's it
spectres on the whole town if meltdown
it's more of a specific Intel my issue
in terms of kernel level but right and
then the specter is the one that affects
all base basically all a sticks and it's
one of those things where yeah cuz it's
arm x86 x64 was that was the other one
that it affected that the cell phones
run some of the clock some of the
Qualcomm it's like it's like they all
ripped each other huh because the same
vulnerability is in all these radically
different architectures well they're all
radically different architectures we
don't they all based off x86 you know
I'd imagine that they would be because I
mean they all had that they they all had
to start with probably the Intel
compiler I'm gonna go out on a limb and
I'm gonna say the most detrimental thing
to the Intel kernel bug in terms of
devastation and being you
against the public is intel fixes true
MA and Microsoft's yes because Microsoft
has recalled the firmware wet twice now
what I started out the firmware though
the windows update what I started to say
is there are three parties that involved
here there are the CPU manufacturers so
AMD and Intel great AMD is just trying
to mitigate the amount of damage Intel's
gonna be sending their way with their
fix all right that's the reality of that
AMD is indeed affected by the specter
bug but meltdowns fix was affecting a
lot of AMD systems AMD system who ain't
even boot after that was funny though
that the irony of that is awesome you
know the guy didn't tell us like yeah
we're gonna do this little microphone ik
lick this whole thing ever just fuck
over every rice and processors the I the
other group of people involved that make
up a category of this trio is the
operating system developers so whether
whether it be Microsoft or whether it be
Linux right these these these people
have to go in and patch based on the
fixes happening on the hardware level as
I understand it though that was a
temporary thing once the microcode fixes
deployed then the OS fix is no longer
necessary yeah but the problem is how
well if these companies communicating
with each other to make sure one fits
hasn't stumped on another and caused
catastrophic failure which is what's
been happening yeah the other well
judging by how fast they're movin
absolutely like they're not talking the
other thing is the motherboard
manufacturers they're having to fix a
lot of this too at a firmware level
mm-hm and so the firmwares have been
failing left and right so it's one of
those things like right now the scary
time to build a computer in my opinion
just it's just on the software side of
things because I'm tell you right now my
stuff is working I have done everything
I can to stop automatic debates from
going through which you know Windows 10
is nearly impossible
install new firmware is and stuff I'm
one of those people that falls in the
category I'd rather let the exploit
exist until this is truly fixed then
deal with all of this like massive
running around with your head on fire
levels trying to fix it because that's
exactly what's happening they're moving
so fast trying to fix it that they're
causing more problems and actually
repairing and especially for the end
user on the on the PC space this this is
affecting data centers more than anyone
else obviously but in terms of these
standard PC users are being lumped into
these massive rollouts of fixes it is
causing so much harm right now in the
community
yeah plus plus the BIOS updates which
are ultimately the top level update
that needs to happen to correct this
issue because they're gonna be the thing
applying the microcode fixed to the cpu
uh they're dangerous is shit right if
you mess up something in a BIOS you can
brick machines and the enterprise level
Hardware often doesn't have backups like
the consumer level Hardware does like
usually like the motherboard I having
here the gigabyte motherboard has a
backup BIOS if you if you tank the BIOS
on that machine you can still get into
the backup BIOS and presumably recover
it on enterprise level shit they figure
the people that are working with those
machines have enough sense that they're
not gonna brick the boxes so usually
they don't they don't even bother
putting the backup for Amazon you know
we toast them they're toast it's been a
long time so I've actually seen
motherboards like mainstream
motherboards shipping with multiple
buyouts there okay so EVGA was really
big
I'd say z87 z97 Z 107 I'm not sure but
they had multiple BIOS my Z 99 or X 99
classified had three BIOS on it I think
it was executed either z97 or x9
classified had three BIOS three and I
trusted me I used him there were times I
just like worked my OC so bad even a
clear CMOS was failing me so it was one
of those things where it was nice to
have that but I just the newer stuff ya
see multiple BIOS is on there anymore by
us BIOS spicy sees how do you say that
that what's the plural of BIOS BIOS it's
just BIOS the BIOS is's the BIOS is is I
like that but but anyways on the
Gigabyte motherboard I'm running in
Houston it does have the backup BIOS
because I only know cuz I did
the patch I went ahead and bit the
bullet and got in there and you're right
there was two versions there was the
original patch they did the microcode
update literally two days later was
another version so you know they revved
it cuz they because just like everybody
else they fucked it up but so far I'm
stable I've installed the update I've
tested everything the system is still
rock stable not seeing any notable
performance change that though I haven't
gone into deep benchmarking yet and this
could presumably kill performance in
very specific scenarios right because
the whole point is changing how this
random memory thing that lookup
mechanism that speeds things up will no
longer be possible
Kyle Buchanan's a super chat said Jay
when this gets done will you make a
video to update we make a video to
update the microcode motherboard
correctly I assume when he's asking me
as if I'll do a video about how to do it
the right way the answer to that is no
and the reason being is every single
motherboard manufacturer
has a different way of doing it some use
some use a BIOS level flashback some use
or some use a Windows or a built-in
software that will go to its own
bootable and then flash itself there are
too many versions for me to do a video
to apply to even the majority yeah plus
that's not something you really want to
be telling people how to do if they
don't already know how to do it cuz the
liability on that's gonna be high I mean
the pucker factor on a BIOS update if
you bump the power cable unplug the box
UPS dies and chokes blow a fuse I mean
there's a million different things that
can completely fuck you in the middle of
it so a funny story when when I started
YouTube I had an FX 8120 in a crosshair
5 formula goes across there 5 right yeah
crosshair 5 formula motherboard asus rog
motherboard so i was like the best AMD
motherboard you could buy at the time
and it didn't have a multiple bios
switch but it did have like a removable
bios chip so like i could actually pull
the chip out with a pair of pliers like
needle nose pliers it wasn't soldered in
in any way yep they had this really
weird issue back then and i don't think
it exists anymore but if you tried to do
a BIOS firmware update with an overclock
applied it would brick it would it would
just block a mid bios rather than tell
you like you have an overclock applied
please reset factory defaults prior to
no it would just go and it would brick I
actually had a my brother-in-law and he
still has this motherboard today
actually he had the exact same
motherboards we've built like identical
systems so I actually had to take his
chip out of his motherboard plopping it
what I had to do was plop it in my
computer and then get into BIOS while
the I was running pull the chip out
because it would work right as it loaded
the BIOS into into memory right so right
now for memory take his chip out put it
in while I'm in BIOS then do the BIOS
flashback to fix my bad BIOS so it was
doing this because it's awesome because
the chip wasn't soldered in so I'd
contacted Asus and this was before my
channel was like anything I didn't know
anybody decease I contacted their their
customer service and their their RMA
remedy was to send them the chip and
then they would send you back a new one
that's hilarious yeah I never knew that
you could actually hot-swap those things
I never tried but
we're talking abouts the old american
megatrends chips yeah they just look
like a little uh what do they call them
not a not a sodium no that's got the
little pins that are like human here is
coming off about my my they look like
little computer bugs they were yeah bugs
right so yeah I mean it was just so
funny to me that at the time that a top
tier motherboard you can you could load
the BIOS and then once it was loaded
into memory just pull the BIOS chip out
switch it flash it you're up you put the
bad chip back in yeah it works but I
just find it funny that they would
rather deal with this RMA service this
this RMA process of telling people
sending your chips and they would send
another chip right it was it was in a
little bubble envelope sure I cost some
pennies it's like way cheaper than going
through any other process but why could
they just put in a piece of code that
says revert back to factory settings do
you want to proceed yes reverts off it
goes well I mean come on that could have
been fixed with the BIOS update the
irony involved in that but still oh I
see what you're saying load the other
chip into it it boots up and then then
pop the old chip in and revert it know
right from what's in memory er know what
I'm saying is why why would a soos go
through the RMA process of saying send
us your bad chip we'll send you a new
one if you happen to break your board by
trying to buy us flashback with an
overclock applied because yeah I know if
he caught that piece of information
that's what was breaking the BIOS was if
you tried to do a firmware update wallet
overclock profile active so rather than
have them have a piece of code in the
BIOS flashback that forces it to revert
back to factory defaults it just allows
itself to try and flash and Brix itself
oh I see what you're saying there should
have been you're saying they should've
been a catch-all and they're saying wait
a second don't do this while you're
overclocking and then they could have
saved themselves a whole lot of hassle
down the road or even force itself to go
back to defaults and then do a restart
before flashing that's how a lot of the
other more the board's operate now yeah
I kind of getting the impression these
days that because there's so many
crutches and so many ways to recover
from stuff that developers are really
getting lazy that's and being a
developer myself I've actually seen like
the evolution of that through my career
at Microsoft was you know now that you
got Windows Update and you can just
deploy these patches and it used to be
on every three months now you can do it
every month now they're doing every week
now they're doing test builds it's to
the point now or it's like when you're
sitting at work you used to be sweating
bullets being like holy shit if I fuck
up this bug
fix and I'm gonna break thousands of
computers I'm fucked um they're gonna
fire me and nobody's ever gonna find the
body but now it's like I'm gonna I'm
gonna go home at five o'clock fuck I'm
pretty sure it's gonna work you know and
then it goes out and breaks a bunch of
machines but it's okay cuz windows
update to this rescue we can just fix it
again and again and again and I feel the
same way with games especially
electronics arts games if you're
listening EA the updates surpassed the
original size of the game by a factor of
about 10 throughout the lifecycle of the
game because they're constantly going
through and fixing it now granted they
usually have a little thing there's a
good stuff date contains new DLC and new
graphics and shit but no there's always
that little subset of fixing this bug
fixing this bug fixing this bug and it's
like back in the day we had cartridges
loaded into systems you bought software
and software etc on floppy disks and
there was no internet they had to get
that shit right the first time otherwise
it was a physical recall of all the
product and putting it back out which
was massively expensive right and they
don't do that now I can't remember there
ever being like I can remember there
ever being this situation like that when
physical copy was the only way where
they had to do that I mean maybe it's
because I grew up in the in an era that
a lot of these young folks now that
follow us have never experienced which
is where the game had to be done and
complete and fully tested prior to
hitting the shelf I think hitting the
shelf is the thing that's really strange
it doesn't really happen anymore right
so well the hell of a lot more testing
was done I can tell you that because I
remember which a Nintendo game was it
was a maniac mansion I think can
somebody confirm this maniac mansion I
think was the game where I got the
cartridge when the game first came out
and there's a place in the game where if
you went to it you did one action it
would basically remove all the actions
before you fuck up your ability to get
past that point you were basically stuck
it was a hard bug in it yeah but you
could but there was actually another
version of the cartridge released with
the bug fixed hmm so you could go and
get the new version of it you know that
was like their version of Windows Update
but they didn't they didn't swap it out
you had to actually go buy it and I
don't know if those maniac mansion or if
it was another game but yeah there was
there was like a literal braking issue
in it and there was also the same thing
happened on the original Xbox you
remember before Xbox 360 and Xbox one
the original Xbox I remember there was a
game on there where you've got to a
certain point and if you did this action
it would completely ruin your ability to
finish the game like it trashed your
entire safe I haven't run
games yeah but there's one there's one
in specific I'm thinking about the
Microsoft didn't they litter literally
put out there fix - everybody was make
sure when you get to this point in the
game that you don't do this make sure
you know that's like their their their
patch right because there's nothing they
could do it people that were already to
that point but I do feel like software
quality has gone way down also you could
argue that the complexity of software
has gone way up I mean back then a lot
of the shit was written in native code
directly bare-metal now you've come to
this evolution where you have Windows
and Linux that have multiple rings you
got the kernel you got the hell memory
managers then on top of that you got
libraries upon libraries on top of
engines and now the developers like you
know int main void create call function
create game level good people return
you're done that's all you know it's
it's it's approaching that point now
where it's so easy to develop software
that you don't have to understand the
fundamentals of developing software any
more unity for instance if you've ever
programmed a game in unity and I'm sure
a lot of people in chat have it's a
drag-and-drop experience yes you can go
write a bunch of code and everything
behind the scenes and make it do exactly
what you want but you can quite
literally go into the game and drag a
fucking sphere out there in a 3d game
and then go in and write just a tiny
little like five pieces of code they're
like make the ball fall and bounce and
it does all the gravity all the physics
everything in the world so you don't
have to be you don't have to have that
situational awareness the developers
used to have to have like when you were
doing memory management on a certain
architecture you'd be like oh shit this
is x86 you can only address for four
gigabytes of memory so I need to make
sure that everything I do doesn't
address over four gigabytes of memory
now it's like fuck it address a billion
gigabytes of memory Windows will figure
it out its memory manage you're smart
but then you're working around all of
the other bugs in other people's code
yeah I don't it resided in that in that
genre of work anymore that career it was
such a burnout being in that that office
I'm telling you the developer oh my
brain doesn't work just thinking about
it that was such a grind if I'm honest I
miss working at Microsoft I mean if I'm
completely honest with myself I don't
think I'll just work like working for a
giant company like that work for a small
company where one guy's fuckup affected
everybody and everyone ate shit over it
you know what I mean yes I mean that's
Mike Microsoft there was a high pucker
factor for making mistakes but we did
have a lot of nets too I mean it
for you to fuck up on the level where
you're it's like you're gonna get
terminated you literally had to have the
bug somehow make it from your computer
into source Depot then you had to make
it from your branch to the branch above
it then you had to make it from the
branch above into the test branch and
then from the test branch into the
actual like company-wide internal
release branch if somehow you made it
through all of those processes with your
fuckup well then you're like a legendary
fuck up and you're gonna get called on
it but most of our stuff was what would
catch those issues I needed we did
address in here real quick do it he's
off there he goes mighty Jesus yeah that
I thought about for a second someone
putting in a demo how to put a zip tie
on your wiener what are you doing here
somebody asks a question in chat isn't
went by what's the best way to attach a
fan to a case without screws so zip ties
no I'm gonna I'm gonna show a very
specific way that I do it though I've
done this before actually and it works
very very well it's just I need a fan to
demonstrate and I'm I don't want to move
a whole lot because then I might Jack
something up thank you sir so this is
the way I used to do it okay so can you
zoom that it oh you can't we're not
using the motor lens on there no don't
touch it don't touch okay if you touches
something something's gonna break
okay so here's what I would do you got
your fan you've got your case don't
change your camera angles I'm a member
I'm I'm looking at the lens cuz I'm
talking to the audience but I'm forced
to look at you now because of the
telezart
I'm sorry I can't concentrate when your
face is really big okay no I'm not gonna
zip tie my wiener like you said what
Nick you gave me the side cutters back
there stop it's not that funny no it's
not that funny yes supposed to be the
zip tie my wiener it soon as I pulled up
the bed thank you sir yes guys I was too
lazy to turn around grab that I'm on a
stool okay Jerry
stop it sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
sorry okay remember guys what what you
see down in the corner of this stream
I'm forced to actually look at when I
look at the monitor because I had the
bright idea of studying Jerry up on the
teleprompter and telling me about it
so here's what I do if I need to attach
something and I have no screws I've
rarely had to do this but I did it
before you take your zip tie you stick
it through the fan like so right then
you put that through the case you take
another zip tie you just pull this zip
tie through like that and then you snip
the ends like so you are a genius and
then that's how it stays in the case so
that's the way I don't in the past okay
I never thought of doing it that way
that's actually pretty precise there
trying to wrap it around right you know
you have the hole for the fans may not
have a way to go back around so you just
zip one through zip it back the other
side snip-snip you're good there it's a
good idea hello lifehack never use
screws again guys you heard it here you
zip ties to hold your ads on and
everything it's a tie your wiener yeah
the zip tie your wiener when it falls
off you YouTube can be beautiful and
brave and whatever you put your wiener
in the fan only when it's at full speed
you like my little cooler fan that I
have I need something that's quiet that
doesn't show up on the on the microphone
so I just got like one of those cheap
little USB fans that I love so much you
will sit you're on the battery pack
running all day you want to see
something really cool
hey Nick come here I love having a
remote-control quick I'm testing my wind
filter here give me that as well grab me
that that other in wind fan dude how
good does that work edible fan hey Jay
check this out
so I got the fan pointed right at the
spit the spit guard right uh-huh
now watch come into a difference that
makes yeah I imagine it actually doing
its job hell yeah
okay this is the in win Mars fan I love
in wins fans I feel like in win it's the
only company that's actually been
innovating and changing a boring topic
like this fans if you guys haven't
noticed a sec sponsored just kidding
they've sent me these there's some money
I know just fucking with you hey wait
fans I don't do videos about fans
anymore I mean what are you what is it
about a fan I don't have the equipment
to actually test it properly be like
this is exactly how many h2o mm of HG
ode pushes instead of pressure here's
the CFM's and here's the noise oh nobody
wants to watch that crap this boring so
the only thing companies have been doing
to try and make fans exciting is let's
a million levels of RGB on it and let's
charge $35 a fan and that way we can you
know they can't even afford the lube
after what they paid for their fans
companies banks razor companies have
taken them raised any fans no no I'm
saying razors started the whole LEDs and
everything shit you only use at night
every picture of every product they've
ever made is in the dark so this is the
in win Mars fan now this fan admittedly
is not cheap but it does something that
no other fan can do so is it like not
too expensive or is a little it's all
metal oh shit okay I didn't know that
that's an all metal design but it's got
its a standard 120 millimeter mount
right but are you ready for this look
what it can do what so you can Matt is
neat so you can mount this anywhere in
your case let's say you want to focus
airflow direction down on some yeah you
can just rotate this and that's fucking
brilliant yeah does the wire go through
the arms so that you don't have to have
like a wire hanging out there or yeah
it's it's all it's all like going
through the arm itself where does where
does it plug in where does the fan
header plug in is it on the frame risen
on the fan this is the base of the arm
okay I've lost it oh it's right here
derp it's right here so it is on the fan
so you do have to route the cable well
here's the thing though it's it's like a
little mini jack it's like smaller than
like even a 3.5 millimeter but that just
plugs right into it like that is that
part metal to that you're the one the
round part everything everything is
metal except for the little blades no
the blades are platform finger or no
just kidding
so that's badass this is perfect for
like the testbench and stuff right
because I can mount this down and then I
can actually direct airflow where I want
it so this is kind of like an evolution
of the gooseneck mount way saying I
don't what are those called again I want
to go see how much these things cost and
when Mars fans like I said they're not
cheap but they are definitely they're
definitely my favorite company right now
in terms of
and currently unavailable but here's the
thing are you ready for this yeah there
are two there are two power connectors
this one right here is a you can see on
my camera but for you right yeah okay
yeah so this is a standard PWM that goes
into a little mini jack right here mmm
and then that plugs into a header and it
has a pass-through so it's it's got a
pigtail on it or you have a USB right
here so just like your little your
little USB powered fan I can plug mine
in watch we shut down the system hold on
to be I will short it I got this I think
oh look you got a battery pack you might
be better off using a battery pack let's
see suspense is killing me here
holy shit so no it's it's USB powered so
you could put it on your desk and make
it go so I don't think I'm actually
getting power off that USB though it's
yeah txt motherboard and yeah so that's
why would you not be getting power of
you as we because what a motherboards
now have data only ports like a little
weird
bro you might shit oh this I gotta see
it work I know let me plug it into the
PWM yeah just do that one
oh that the screws it's a burner to cool
like the base is actually threaded so
it's just like a slick idea yeah well
it's me cuz it actually would work as
like a desk fan a desk fan here's the
CPU fan yeah these things surprisingly
move a lot of air like when I got these
I was shocked at how much air pushes
like I can have this thing sitting about
eight feet away from me and still feel
the breeze it's four dollars so yeah
that the usb on the end of this keyboard
is not powering for some reason is it is
it a pretty quiet fan oh it was turned
off there's a switch on the thing Oh
how's how's the it's quiet I don't here
pick it up on the mic well let me turn
it hold on let's see her try not to
break it
yeah no it's boil oh why am i listening
my microphone up nobody got that I
thought no I don't hear it at all man is
it a pretty good amount of air coming
off it well it's also running off like
only a so I haven't hooked up to the CPU
header which isn't like Oh got you fan
control do you have a pump header cuz
usually the pump headers just run balls
out at 100% it also has an LED on it you
see the white LED oh I thought that was
just metal reflecting that's cool so let
me actually turn on the USB header now
that was so funny do they even sell
those right now or do you have like a
pre-production product cuz everything
says that they're not they're not in
stock I don't know see in win Mars fan
well because I want to get one just made
me want this fan and I can't find it
sorry I can find millions of in win
cases though damn I'm not even not even
new hangout USB headers I'm gonna find
this thing if it kills me now if the
stream goes dark you'll know why you can
with short it yet don't short the USB
some other words don't like that $59 via
their own store this is a $60 fan that
can't be right
alright see we got here if their fans 60
bucks I'm gonna be like Mia oh there we
go
it's actually actually builds a lot of
air well it's not gonna work out there
so yeah they they even said so I'm just
reading their little mission statement
on their on their site here it's like
first little cooling functions the Mars
can also be used as a normal desktop fan
to cool yourself when the gaming
intensifies the power 2.5 millimeter USB
connector and transfer power voltages
from 5 volts up to 12 volts on hostis
which for easier and convenient
operation while using it outside of your
chassis do you see it on my desk right
now yeah pretty good breeze yeah oh hell
yeah it's quiet okay yeah I can't I
can't hear it at all oh so let's turn it
pretty fast yeah I cannot find these
things in stock anywhere chat crashed
their website did that buddy people
really just go over to in wind so anyway
a win this is this is obviously my
opinion but in win is one of those
companies that I had kinda had my eyes
on him for years and in the beginning I
feel like they were kind of I don't know
they didn't have like the greatest of
products that their cases were okay they
were like running the mill but then like
right around 2012 they started just
going out with these crazy designs and
they they sort of become known for this
super premium brand now like they're
really expensive well I've seen the
limited runs they did like what was the
name of that one case it was like just a
weird like Picasso looking metal plate
with a glass on it yes frame oh is that
yeah they had that at a PD excellent and
I was like oh my god that's a beautiful
day it's a single piece of like a
aluminum sheet that's this break tin -
its stamped and and brake press brake
fit into that position yeah and it was
like real tempered glass on it - right
it wasn't like the plastic sides like
you get on no same thing like my D frame
behind me right here this green one it's
it's not glass on it right now but it's
all tempered glass like thick tempered
glass do you like quarter intercept like
that yeah who are they who are the guys
that used to make those really premium
aluminum cases back in the day that
everybody wanted those Acacia lives in
mountain mods
no even before that yeah yeah that was
it yeah they still around
are they still considered like a good
premium brand because back in the day I
mean they were like the premium case to
have they are indeed expensive there
they are they are expensive there's no
doubt about it so anyway if this vans
sixty bucks that's pretty steep but I
could see it
being niche like this I mean what do
they stick you for not what does it
knock to a stick you for if you want an
ugly brown Noctua probably 30 bucks 30
bucks so double and knock 2004 have
neither lead articulate over 30 bucks
yeah I don't I think that's a little
little on the spending side then again
these more often because know when we do
our streams right it's obviously it gets
kind of warm right so that's why I want
to use this because a regular desktop
fan is too loud yeah in this right here
unless I put it right up against it it's
but it's a nice breeze and they'll run
off this battery pack forever I'm gonna
point your mic at the fan okay do it I
want to hear this music oh now I can
hear it yeah can you still hear yeah
just barely okay I know it's it's it's
dead it's just about dead right there
I'm like I'm like a foot away rigor so
wow it's moving a good amount of air I
have no idea what the CFM volume is but
can you hear me oh yeah but you know
what you know what this thing cost four
bucks it looks ugly as shit though you
gotta hit it with some crime on and you
need an adapter if you want to plug it
into your motherboard but hey five bucks
man so apparently I have D dust in wind
site I'm sorry guys I just got a lot
quieter are you did you put your mic
back in the same spot there we go much
better much better very directional lab
so apparently I inadvertently ddosed
win-win I'm I have to write them an
email later let them know what happened
like sorry guys we send a bunch of
people over to look for your $60 fan
that's not in stock I swear okay so we
got how many people were in chat right
now I don't even know 3500 33,000 about
3,500 okay so 3,500 people in here let's
just say let's just say half of them
went over to the website curious as to
what the price was if it doesn't take a
lot to bring down a retail site I guess
1500 viewers cuz wreath I mean in wind
probably is used to more than a few
hundred at the most like when a new
product launch which is a you know
people hitting their site so I guess it
doesn't take a lot to bring down a site
anymore
well a lot of the companies that create
these sites do it through cloud cloud
services and what they'll do is they'll
buy a certain amount of bandwidth you
know per month or whatever and it won't
skit it takes too long to scale yeah so
like they get hit really hard it's like
Oh God we're getting amount of traffic
that wasn't seen before and it takes the
system a little while to adapt to it so
everybody just probably cost
like in win like 20 bucks a scale so the
specs on the fan it is using just under
one lot of power it's for just under 40
CFM I'm it's a decent met of airflow not
a lot of pressure the site is literally
not not not loading it is dead dude it
without says service unavailable the
server is temporarily unable to serve
your request due to maintenance downtime
or capacity problems please try again
later it's a 503 service unavailable air
from Apache so ya know we it's dead dead
I'm gonna I'm gonna email them real
quick yeah you might want to like let
them know that we just we just tanked
their site let's back up now I just hit
refresh it's back up okay yeah but now
the audience is gonna keep screwing with
you probably yeah and I probably just
like scaled their plans and now they
gonna pay a bunch more money and
everything I've got I've got all this
texture on the thing it looks like it's
a thirty eight point seven three cubic
feet per minute air flow yeah so I don't
know is that good or bad I don't really
know what to compare it against no it's
it's it's like middle ground
okay I mean so it's 25 DBA or DB
decibels alright in terms of noise I
mean it's it's going right now I'm not
sure it's it's probably I'm sure the
audience can hear it yeah
well 25 decibels isn't that loud no it's
really not I like this oh this is neat
I've got a I've got a few of these so
I'm gonna probably start using the
especially the summertime I just like
the fact that you can mount them to a
standard 120 millimeter spot like I know
let's say you have a radiator that's on
the top of your case right yeah yes in
between the radiator in the case doing
pool and you've got mounts on the bottom
of the rad and it's just say you want to
get some directed airflow onto your VRMs
or something you could mount one of
these underneath it and just swivel it
and point it at the vrm if you're most
people that's like a hundred percent
function over form and there you go yeah
oh there's sites dead again all right
all MLM I'm on it yeah I'm pretty sure
more than likely somebody in the chat
decided to be all be da C with them but
I don't that shit's gonna happen no
matter what I don't think anyone in the
chat is doing anything I think I think
it's just enough people are going to it
say sorry for breaking your site's
patchy 5:03 air it's not like it's not
like it's not it's loading slow it's
like literally Apache cannot handle the
volume okay so we're gonna write the
apology letter to Edwin live so I was
showing off the new Mars fan on my live
screen and people all went to these
sites to look it up and broke it my bad
are they just are they just in win on
Twitter there at Amon USA I think
somebody in win USA you see my bad
moderate moderate person said senpai
notice me there you have been noticed
and now you may go alright so this is
okay and when I'm just gonna message him
and say J is 2 cents broke your website
this is something that I underestimate
all the time I underestimate what
happens if I mention a website and
people go to it like I felt really bad
for her NZXT because when I showed off
the cam software which I legitimately
used and still do actually on skunkworks
it's how I control my view lighting I I
wasn't asked to do a video about cam I
just showed it off and so many people
went to cam to try and use it that they
completely tore down the site the
problem is cam also connects to the
website for a lot of its functionality
so cam immediately stopped working for
everybody using cam oops so it made a
made NZXT look kind of bad but but the
funny thing is they had they've since
changed the way that software works in
terms of pinging the server to activate
like to turn on because of that so maybe
something good came out of it well
remember back in the day like a long
time ago we had that one Tech Talk
episode where you're basically you add
was it like some kind of cloud DDoS
protection or something like that you're
basically like cloud pill out and it was
cloud fair even cloud fair it was like
please don't do that again so somehow we
ended up getting them hit with like 20
Giga second or something bandwidth or
you're like oh Touche okay so the the
old website and what we Bri what we
bring the website back the old website
was being hosted in Austin Texas
and in a legit data server data center
yeah in Iraq and doing its whole thing
and it was like so that attack was so
brutal they actually segregated me and
that physically moved my machine off the
main grid because not only did it bring
down the site it killed the switch like
physically killed this one yeah and that
dude told you I remember cuz you told me
you said that the guy said because
you're basically impervious to DDoS
attacks so you actually surprised him I
don't think I'm learning about the DDoS
attacks even Anna even Amazon nope
Amazon can be taken down everyone can be
taken down
yeah even I mean Xbox Live being taken
down as a hell of a fee too because
considering my car the size of
Microsoft's datacenter and how much
space they lease out from other
competing companies yeah like it's nuts
that they can take that down but luckily
that flaw is starting to go away though
the way the Internet's distributed now
it's it's starting to make it harder and
harder and harder for that shit to work
it's not it's not impossible but if
we're eventually gonna hit a point where
being able to route that traffic and not
have a stop before it gets to the
destination is gonna be your you ought
to be pretty clever to make that happen
in the future especially with all the
ipv6 stuff yeah I mean the Internet's
gonna move a lot it's gonna move forward
but then so will so will the techniques
so yeah whatever that's a lot of the
bots that are running on these ISPs and
stuff it's really easy to identify them
now like it used to be that the DDoS
networks would just send out small
amounts of data from each of the clients
so it wouldn't be noticeable but the
problem is now when you have like
Comcast being so big when you have a
hundred thousand BOTS all suddenly start
sending roughly the same amount of
traffic at roughly the same amount of
time all targeted at the same
destination it's it's pretty easy now
for them to have you know business
intelligence on the switch and
everything they can start shutting them
down and closing the ports all right so
we've got 15 minutes left in the show
it's time it's time to stop being
serious we've had too much Tech Talk in
this Tech Talk I feel like we have I
feel like we've definitely fulfilled the
tech Tech Talk quota here now I can't
talk about things Nick and I like to
talk about in our car rides hey Nick
we need a topic throwing at us which we
talked about no not the cars that's too
straightforward
quick come on now get weird
come on get weird but stuff very talked
about that we talked about the length of
the insertion shaft of the hemorrhoid
cream we didn't cover all the weird
stuff yeah I can get weirder of course
you can get weirder let's go to the
audience aren't I it's gonna get really
weird then you got nothing
let's go the audience all right going
the audience Nick's got nothing here go
to the audience get a top I'm gonna go
take a piss really quick when we get
back let's talk about something really
fucked up okay all right here hold on
let me switch over to robocam here okay
okay I'm gonna get there you watch my
screen yeah they're here watch you're
all even bring it down so you can watch
the screen while I'm gone here we go oh
whoa that's weird the delay is real Oh
Jerry just tripped over his mice camera
again well that didn't work for very
long because I think Jerry pull I think
it pulled out his plug again all right
weed stuff legal weed now that's boring
trannies as in transmissions that's
where I hope you're going with that no
we're not talking about chicks with
penises pedophile sex dolls there was
the sex robot at CES there was that
Jerry Jerry you employed stammering
slugged are the camera unplugged it's
all black
oh did old battery wood didn't it the
GoPro cuz I put a USB cable on there
that's data only like a dipshit so
what's our topic do we got one I don't
know people want to talk about trannies
and I don't mean cars yeah that's right
it's hot but we're better off staying
away from robot strippers that was a
real topic at CES surprised nobody's
mentioned putting a flashlight on the
robotic arm because that question came
up a lot during my stream Nixon the
answer is yes mechanical grip you really
you see you can't even get weird use my
talk about car mechanics don't you shrug
at me
hi robo arm fleshlight no I already said
I already talked about that on my stream
yes it is completely possible this is
old that's a good one hey did you see
the Burger King net neutrality
commercial no dude it's hilarious Burger
King cave all the companies that you
wouldn't think we give two shits about
net neutrality they created a commercial
where they set up the store is having
the whopper have a fast track passage of
a package so for $25 you get your
whopper instantly otherwise you had to
wait like 10 minutes or 20 minutes or 30
minutes and they had like real customers
coming in the store and they're like
well sir you only bought the whopper
those $4.95 oh you have to wait 20
minutes to get it they're doing that
because they're trying to promote their
other packages to sell chicken fingers
and stuff like that
in the and the customers are just
getting irate over it they're like
they're like you know we don't we don't
know the rules we just we just work here
it's really funny all what I said yeah
it's real no it's not I don't think it's
a real honest ain't that a customers
think is real yeah in the in the in the
video it appears that the customers
think it's real and they're getting
frustrated they want to talk to the
manager the guys like you know I don't
make the rules I'm just following the
rules and he points up at the sign and
the sign actually has the three levels
of whopper purchase like the whopper
packages up on the up on the actual sign
it's it's pretty good okay I think they
killed it Nick Nick texted me more of a
statement we are than a topic that the
pullout method is not safe sex I don't
know I got away with it for a long you
got away with it with what the pullout
method mmm dude I may be worn a condom
like three times in my entire life like
the rest of the time was just like I
hate these things they're stupid and
part of the point of that small well I
used to just bust the seal out of the
top of the 16 ounce coke bottles you see
that you seen that picture that you see
that picture I was going around for the
longest time it was like a sticky note
from mom or from dad or somebody it was
like I just want you to remember to
practice safe sex tonight and they like
pinned a condom to like the cork board
with the note on it yes yes I do
remember that friggin hilarious okay so
many people asked me for the post Malone
PC I already saw that yeah Chet let's
hear it I basically have a policy right
now I basically am ignoring anybody that
asks before the
Malone PC all the answers they need are
in that video that I did with him
everything they need to know was set in
that video so anytime somebody asks me
what's going on with the post Malone PC
all it proves to me is their
comprehensive skills need improvement
okay so what's going on with the Terry
Crews PC okay well since you asked so
nicely guys it's based on beer bongs and
Bentley an album that has not launched
yet
the PC will not launch until the album
has been launched
I need the inspiration from the album to
do the build
why would I launch a PCE that he
requested be based on his new album
prior to his album dropping what kind of
logic escapes you guys that keep asking
me where is the post Malone build all I
know is I better have a bong is the
reservoir is all I'm saying
everything's on everything's on the
table but I can tell you I can tell you
that the case is custom built is going
to be the only case in the world like it
is it a Bentley that's been converted to
a case no unfortunately maybe it is it
is a it is a case that is a one-off
based on a new case coming out it is the
only one in existence like it and it is
going to be literally right up his alley
oh it's a one-off case being created it
being created by manufacturer are you
modding it no it's being built
specifically by a manufacturer that I
reached out to holy shit okay so
initially it is gonna be the only case
in existence like it until everybody but
the video goes viral then it's gonna be
like now introducing special edition
postman case tonight we'll play in
penciler films because there's so many
people they haven't seen that shit oh my
god I don't have a screen capture like
setup oh you don't damn it dude penciler
films go look it up after the JED that's
some old-school like they took all the
GI Joe therapy essays in Boise the most
some I I had them all pretty much
memorized they're they're fairly
derogatory to hit mistake Givens dick
don't give him
well your wake is doing on my leg it's
so good it's so good so my favorite one
is the computer you gotta walk us out
he's like yeah the kids walking up to
the dog is uh he'll now what's that dog
and then the dog wants to bite it was
like yeah this guy walks up so it's one
the GI Joe guys he's like hey computer
stop all downloaded and then help
computer guys I confuse we got double
games on it they make no sense they
basically are the original GI Joe
cartoons back from like the 90s and 80s
when we were kids and they're just
completely redubbed
and it's hilarious it's so yeah it's so
good pork chops it's making pork chops
and oh my god comedy just isn't what it
