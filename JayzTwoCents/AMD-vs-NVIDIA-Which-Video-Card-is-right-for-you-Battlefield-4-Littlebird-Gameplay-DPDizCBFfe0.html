coming at you with a refresher
commentary about AMD vs nvidia and what
you should pick and why how to choose
and God forbid how to figure out this
entire mess that is the market of
graphics cards today now before we get
into the topic this game we're looking
at battlefield 4 of course and I'm
flying around in a little bird showing
you guys how to stay alive and no i'm
not going to break out on john travolta
start doing disco stay in lap no no no
we're not going to do that we're gonna
go ahead and keep this professional at
least some light professional because
this is me we're talking about anyway
AMD vs nvidia it's a couple of things I
want to put out there right now because
I know this video is going to be out for
a while and it's going to get quite a
bit of use at the time of making this
video mantle is only available on gcn
architecture cards on the AMD side it is
an open-source API that has until right
now the time of this video has still not
been utilized by nvidia chances are it
may not be utilized for quite some time
so want to put that out there if you're
watching this video on twenty fifteen or
twenty sixteen or twenty 198 because it
was in some time capsule yeah we still
use computers back here bro anyway it is
one of those things that is not
available I haven't been drinking I
promise it is not available on nvidia
yet now i just want to kind of put out
there I think it'd be crazy for NVIDIA
not to utilize the mantle API because it
does perform a lot better than direct x
when it comes to cpu utilization it
allows you guys to use lower end pcs
without bottlenecking your graphics card
nearly as much but we're not going to
talk a whole lot about mantle in this
video because it's one of those things
that's still too new and i'm still not
as first-hand experience on mantle as
i'd like to be so we're going to go
ahead and save that topic for another
video now when it comes to buying
graphics card what you shoot what should
you pick and what well of course there's
the golden rule in the golden question
you have to ask yourself before you
even consider the answer and that is
what are you going to be doing with your
graphics card are you going to be
playing 1080p gaming are you going to be
playing high-end gaming at 1600 p or
even 4k are you going to be doing any
sort of video editing or photoshop or
anything intensive that's going to be
using the GPU acceleration and insisted
rendering or god forbid are you gonna be
doing cryptocurrency mining why do i say
god forbid well guys you've sort of
jacked up the market what do I mean by
that well when I made my video back in
2012 nobody Bitcoin mining it was around
but nobody was really paying much
attention to it no one cared you guys
were kind of just a little elite group
that did your own thing then you guys
realize that AMD graphics cards really
kicked ass at doing your mining and so
you guys started buying them up buying
one two three four cards at a time eatin
up the entire market creating a supply
and demand situation where AMD just
couldn't keep up in manufacturing
companies were running out of stock and
prices were going up so what has
happened back in two thousand twelve I
would have told you in a heartbeat AMD
graphics cards are the better bang for
the buck 2014 I would tell you that's
not the case I would tell you they are
overpriced based on their gaming
performance because they've somehow
turned into a cryptocurrency mining
heart piece of hardware and gaming
became secondary that's just really
disappointing because with mantle
launching and only being available on
AMD cards at the time of filming this
the world has just not really been able
to experience it because the cards are
too expensive and too hard to find now I
know some of you are probably already
yelling at your monitor going we'll wait
a minute in my country the nvidia stuff
is still more expensive than AMD by like
a lot you know what guys I'm not a
beware in the world of all one time I'm
not God I can only tell you what things
are here in the United States and in the
United States right now the AMD cards
have inflated by at least twenty percent
on the price for example when the r9 290
launched in october of 2013
it was about three hundred and
ninety-nine bucks a four-hundred-dollar
graphics card that was competing with
invidious six hundred and fifty dollar
gtx 780 notice I didn't say ti we're
talking about the base clock 780 you
know the one that still has the locked
cuda cores and it's not fully unlocked
it's a slightly gimped Titan yeah well
here we are today vidya gtx 780 costs
four hundred and ninety nine dollars and
the base r9 290 five hundred and eighty
dollars eighty dollars more than the
faster gtx 780 not depending on the
games that you're playing now I own both
of these cards I own a gtx 780 from EVGA
and i own and r9 290 from msi the r9 has
the gaming cooler on it which gives it
better cooling and the EVGA was a stock
cooler a reference cooler but it now
currently sits on water now how did
these two cards compare when they
overclocked well they held each other
hand in hand side by side on every test
I threw it only minor differences in the
benchmark scores in fact it really
surprised me because if the card from
our 9 or the 290 was still 400 bucks I
would tell everyone in a heartbeat by
the r9 the 290 don't get the 780 you get
the same performance for a hundred bucks
less put it somewhere else in your build
and just get an amazing bang for your
buck well today that card is eighty
dollars more than the 780 and there's no
reason to spend more to get a card
that's hard to keep in stock hard to
keep cool and has really just become
appealing to cryptocurrency miners now
with mantle being thrown into the mix
again I can't talk too much about mantle
you can tell you that the cards are
going to get a little bit better than
some of their AMD or Nvidia counterparts
if the API is being utilized by the game
developers which more and more are now
when it comes to bang for the buck it's
really difficult to suggest AMD for
instance an AMD r9 290x is nearly seven
hundred dollars at the time of filming
this video
and the 780 Ti is fifty dollars less
than that and a lot more powerful with
290x when it comes to gaming in every
aspect now if you're going to be doing
rendering or assisted rendering like I'm
doing right now i'm using my gtx 780 s
accelerated or the graphics processing
unit the GPU to do real-time playback
absolutely lag free and flawless now AMD
has opencl which I've used it I've
plopped the 290 in this cut in this
build just to kind of see how they
compare and it's good but the rendering
times suffer a little bit compared to
the 280 but you know when you have
slower rendering and you've got to keep
rendering in mind like I do it didn't
make sense to put the 290 in my build
full time I had the choice I could have
put a water block on either one I chose
to do the 780 because i looked at the
big picture and said i'm playing games
obviously like you see in this video but
i do a lot of rendering and stuff as
well so it made sense to go with the
cheaper card that had better performance
for me now maybe you guys just really
like AMD there's nothing wrong with that
but keep in mind you are gonna be paying
more for ultimately a little bit lesser
performance in the end and to me that's
just not a fair trade-off that might be
considered fanboyism which is going to
cost you a little bit of money just
because you want to have three letters
on your graphics card that say AMD now
the vice versa kind of goes for NVIDIA
because another topic is 780 ti vs. 780
I personally feel that the 780 as a
better by its very close to TI
performance if you overclock it without
paying a hefty a hundred and fifty
dollar extra price tag so guys tell me
what are you using and why are you using
it are you in a team nvidia or a team
AMD if you're shopping for graphics
cards and you're experiencing the same
issue i'm talking about here with our
nine cards being inflated go ahead and
tell us what your experiences are and
what it is you plan to buy i feel bad
for gamers because the cryptocurrency
miners have really taken something
intended for one purpose repurposed it
for another and has really really jacked
up the market for everybody else guys
has been Jays two cents i hope you
enjoyed this video if you have you can
follow me on twitter or facebook the
information is down in the description
and we can talk more about it I love
interacting with you guys and I love
helping you guys with your builds I'm
just generally talking tech with
all my fans as always guys and till my
next video I will see you well in my
next video are hopefully Twitter or
Facebook yeah anyway I'm gonna get on
out of here and go suck some more on
battlefield 4 see you later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
