gonna change gears a little bit no we're
not doing a headphone review that's next
week
today I'm gonna talk to some of the
smaller youtubers out there and maybe
even some of the more medium sized
channels who are considering some
microphone options don't worry if that's
not your cup of tea I've got some great
content lined up for you guys in fact
you can see two pieces of it right
behind me
the first thing we have coming up here
early next week is going to be the
gigabyte g1 gaming gtx 980ti custom PCB
this thing right here is advertised to
be faster than the type next we're
definitely going to be putting that to
the test and that AMD video that I've
been teasing for like six months about
how an AMD 8350 performs for gaming
compared to something like the x99 and a
5820k or even a 59 30 K and we're gonna
do some gaming comparisons and see
whether or not AMD really is
bottlenecking or if you should consider
building an AMD system for gamers on a
budget so that's actually built behind
me and as you can see it's running I may
have taken me six months at least I got
it done but today we're going to talk
about Sennheiser's new clip mic digital
the new EVGA silent series power
supplies offer excellent silence and
efficiency through their new EVGA Eco
mode technology and also features a
seven year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more
now I'm asked quite often usually by
newer youtubers or people who are just
starting out hey Jay what mic are you
using I want to get one too
this isn't cheap guys this is a
sennheiser DW 100 g3 wireless microphone
and I use it for things like trade shows
and stuff it's actually why I bought it
but I continue to use it here in the
studio because of the fact that it keeps
me mobile I can move around don't get
tangled up with wires I used to have a
wire running to the camera and then I
had a almost like a shotgun type mic
pointing at me and that was kind of
annoying too sometimes I'd forget to
turn on the recorder so I use this thing
here it comes in about $500 so it's not
cheap whatsoever but that's why today's
video is really kind of important it's
the fact that the clip mic uses the
exact same capsule that you'll find on
this kit but it's designed to work with
your
device now I don't know if they have a
micro USB version that you could use
with your Android devices but this
particular one I'm looking at is
designed for iOS devices with the
Lightning connector so it's iPhone iPod
and AD iPad iPhone 5 and up now it uses
the Apogee app which is a free download
and you can do all of your recording on
there and all of your sharing of the
files on there but rather than talk
about the Box let's go ahead and take a
look at the capsule so this is it right
here it's pretty basic the entire thing
is self-contained it's got its own amp
built in so it's gonna take the power
signal from the iPhone it's going to
convert it into the proper signal for
this capsule because like I said they
basically took the one from this kit and
adapted it to a lightning connector so
it's a little transformer in there
that's going to convert it to the right
power signal you've got a pretty long
cord so you can run this through your
clothing I it's exactly 1 J's arms band
which is probably gonna be right around
6 feet and then it does terminate here
into a lightning connector and it has
it's a little converter on here which is
going to convert it to the power coming
out of the iPhone iPod or iPad and
convert it to the right signal strength
for the capsule here this is a powered
capsule so it's gonna give you
everything that you need I'm already
tangled up on my bike also included in
the box here you have a little carrying
bag that way you don't lose it you can
keep it in your bag of goodies that you
may take to trade shows or whatever
however you do your videos and then in
this thing you have the little clip-on
part and the little windscreen so it's a
exactly again identical to the one that
I'm using right here best because the
capsule is there me2 capsule do you
think I could remember me2 but i don't
so really there's not a lot of talked
about when it comes to the packaging so
why don't we do this why don't we go
ahead and set this thing up I will clip
it on right next to my DW 100 g2 or g3
sorry and then we will do a kind of a
side-by-side comparison
completely untouched exactly as it's
recorded no post-processing no boost
bump or treble or no noise cut or
anything like that or hiss cut we'll
just go and put them side-by-side and
see how they sound
all right so I've got both mics plugged
in as you can see they look exactly
identical and I look a bit more silly
than I normally do don't I
don't answer that so I've got the Apogee
app loaded up and when you plug in a
recognizer microphone that is designed
to work with this app it will
automatically unlock all of the features
which is great to see because last year
when I took a look at the road lav mic
or smart lav you still had to buy the
full version of the app which is like
another 8 bucks or 6 bucks or something
like that so it's kind of nice to see
that it was like oh hey you're using a
microphone that we're advertising with
so here's all the features now you can
see right here you do have a built-in
audio meter so you can check for
clipping bop bop so you get into the
yellow but better and if that's too loud
or too sensitive you can adjust the
sensitivity so if I move that up it's
clipping clearly and if I move it down
then you can see it's much lower so you
can tailor in the audio gain exactly as
you need it
you've got next take and you can add a
take take away a take take a take I
don't know so it's got a nice adjustable
feature set built in here but pretty
much all we're gonna do right now is we
are going to go ahead and hit the record
button and we're gonna compare how this
sounds to the one not the other one I'm
wearing that really expensive one which
is the same capsule so I'm assuming it's
gonna sound the same so now we are
recording with both microphones and I'm
heading to e3 later this week and I
don't really know exactly what I'm gonna
say so that's probably something I
should have thought out before I started
recording but that's okay because now
we're just gonna go ahead and listen to
this twice which is terribly tragic for
all of you to have to be listening to me
talk like this twice so now we are
recording with both microphones and I'm
heading to e3 later this week and I
don't really know exactly what I'm gonna
say so that's probably something I
should have thought out before I started
recording but that's okay because now
we're just gonna go ahead and listen to
this twice which is terribly tragic for
all of you to have to be listening to me
talk like this twice so today's video
was really tailored towards people who
are looking at getting better sound and
better mobility or maybe you have a mic
like I do and you need a second mic for
a trade show or maybe a private
and you want to do like an interview and
you don't have the money to spend on two
of these bad boys so this is a really
good option you can mic up yourself or
mic up your talent whoever you're doing
the interview with stick this thing in
their back pocket or hide it and then
you've got a second microphone you just
have to add it into the production and
post so I hope this videos help some
folks out it's certainly a lot cheaper
alternative like I said I don't know if
it works with Android or if they have an
Android version but currently right now
this one works with iOS devices with the
lightning connector so I hope this
videos helped some aspiring youtubers or
content creators out we're gonna be
getting back to some regular PC content
as I mentioned here with the stuff
behind me some really fun stuff I've
also got an MSI gaming 6g or they call
it 6g but the six gigabyte it's 980ti
from you know MSI's we got a lot of
980ti stuff coming at least two more I
don't think I'm gonna do much more
beyond that but these are two custom
PCBs that definitely deserve taking a
look at so please tell me in the
comments what kind of content you guys
want to see if it's a good suggestion I
will use it maybe even give you a shout
out if I'll use your idea so there we go
guys thanks for watching as always
follow on social media if you just want
to harass troll or comment on this video
head on over to Twitter do it there it's
fun because you guys only get 140
characters to troll me and it's a lot
easier to follow them the comments
section here so alright guys thanks

you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
