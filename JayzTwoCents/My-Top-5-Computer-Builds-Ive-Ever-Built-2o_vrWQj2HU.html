are closing out 2016 and although a lot
of people are doing these rewind videos
and they're showing the best of their
2016 years I might do that but I'm gonna
do something here that I've never done
before and considering my channel has
been over four years old now I decided I
want to go ahead and do a video about
the top 5 favorite builds I've done on
this channel since it started I know
someone be a really sick of the whole
top 5 trend but you know it's a good
round number although it's odd so it's a
good odd round number if you will but
it's technically a be more exact a
couple of honorable mentions in there as
well
with its unique freeform modular system
the new master casemaker 5 from cooler
master allows unparalleled flexibility
with its adjustable internal layout and
exterior customization options learn
more about how you can start customizing
your own case by following the link down
in the description now this first one is
pretty sentimental to me it is the
ultimate gaming bill that I did a few
months after the channel started I was
contacted by a viewer who was impressed
with my work and he was interested
having me build a computer for him but
the budget of well I think was four
thousand dollars at the time but what
makes this one sentimental to me was the
fact that it was my first paid client
build based on the channel it was the
first time the channel was contacted in
efforts of having me build something for
pay which was kind of neat it was the
first time I really made any money on
the channel it was also one of the first
times I got to play with like the latest
high-end hardware that was available at
the time it had a 3770k in it it was
water-cooled had two MSI twin fros or
six ATS in there had 16 gigabytes of
ballistic memory we did a little bit of
case bonding to it too we ended up
removing the drive cages from there and
mounting the cages or the hard drives to
the back of the motherboard tray had
dual radiators in there and it also had
a custom window that was mounted in
there that I did myself with a dremel
and a file and all that stuff so I hold
a little bit of sentimental value to me
because like I said it was the very
first build that I was paid to do
because of the channel I've been paid to
build do builds all the time before that
especially working in IT and then I had
my own little computer building business
I sort of did on the side but it was the
first time the channel had generated
any side revenue and that was big now of
course when you mentioned publicly in a
video that you did a client bill do you
get a bunch more people contacting you
about being interested in getting more
clients done or asking how much it's
going to cost me to build them a
computer so that's why number four here
holds a little bit of sentimental value
as well for the same reasons as number
five because it was my second client
bill that was actually paid to do on the
channel it was by a gentleman named Eric
and he wanted a small form-factor PC but
not too small but not too big he wanted
be able to move it back and forth
between home and work and stuff so we
built him a pretty cool PC using a
silverstone case that was a very upright
rectangular shape but of course it was
sporting the latest and greatest at that
time as well which was a 4770k it had 16
gigabytes of RAM in there it had a GTX
780 in there which really really was
like a dagger in the heart to me because
I was still running my 680 and I wanted
a 780 so bad but it couldn't afford it
and what you guys know how the story
turned out later ended up having three
of them but I digress this is about
Eric's build right here and it was
really fun because it was my first time
building in a case that was so unique
and different
like the Silverstone case and of course
I did how to build a PC video using his
parts as well so it was like it was like
two birds with one stone I was paid to
do the build and I was also doing a
how-to video and that was when I came up
with the idea of also coming up with
like a certified you know certificate of
authenticity if you will saying that I
built the computer because you'd be
surprised many people out there now are
selling computers claiming I built them
for them to try and up the price which
is funny because I still think if I
build or touch your computer it's gonna
going to go down in value but that's
kind of besides the point
keeping with the trend of client builds
red mist 2.0 is actually one of my
favorite builds here coming in at number
three now why 2.0 and not 1.0 well
that's because I got the opportunity of
correcting some of the things I didn't
like about red mist 1.0 because we had
some limitations with budget and time
and 2.0 although it took a long time to
get done was a big deal because we got
to do again latest and greatest what's
almost latest and greatest if you will
the 59 60 X CPU in there is a beast but
unfortunately by the time the build was
done the 69 50 X was already
you know yeah we won't we won't going
too much into depth in that one it's a
little bit of a sore subject for him but
again a ton of ddr4 memory and two
gtx 1080s on water in his build was the
first time I got to experiment with
water on the Pascal series because you
know when you're doing all these builds
and stuff you're doing these videos a
lot of times my stuff tends to get put
on the back burner there's things I want
to do
there's things I want to do with skunk
works right now that I still haven't
even had the time to do because of the
fact that I'm so busy doing everything
else it's kind of like when your
mechanic your cars tend to be the last
one to get fixed because you're busy
fixing everyone else's so redness was
kind of fun because it gave me an
opportunity to really kind of decide
where I wanted to go with the upgrade
for skunk works and that's why I like
red mist 2.0 because it just it looked
better it performed better
it was just badass and I was also
getting to build a PC for a friend
because the owner of red mist although
he contacted me as a stranger when we
did red mist 1.0 has become a friend of
mine and we talk a lot now outside of
YouTube and doing builds and stuff for
him and it's also led to I think I think
a cool relationship and dynamic because
he also got me in touch with case labs
because he was a friend of the one of
the owners of case labs and so he was
actually my contact in my end case lab
so whereas I was helping him he was
helping me it just turned into like a
big ol kumbaya so that's why he comes in
at number three with red mist 2.0 now
number two I think number two might
surprise some people here because it is
the fractal define nano s bill that I
did using the glass tubing and the 4790k
and of course the z97 stinger
motherboard a lot of water cooling
crammed into a little bitty case using
glass tubes it was the first time I use
glass tubes but more importantly it was
the first time a company had contacted
me asking me if I was interested in
building a computer to be showcased
featuring their product I had never been
contacted by any company in the past
about building a computer that they
could show off somewhere so that also
led to the Newegg event where I did a
live demonstration in front of people on
how to build a computer and we use the
defined Nano s for that build in a
air-cooled configuration but next to it
on stage the entire time was
the defined an OS which people could
come and take a look at and see up close
using the glass and it was the first
time using glass materials it was the
first time a company had ever paid me to
build a computer and it was just kind of
like stepping stones if you will client
builds a huge but when companies start
to recognize your work and want you to
build computers for them it becomes a
pretty a pretty nostalgic thing that's
why that computer has stayed together a
lot of the builds I've done that I've
shown on the channel that weren't quiet
builds are temporary and they come apart
and sometimes I'm really huge fans of
those but the parts have to be reused I
don't have endless parts around here as
much as it might seem like where I can
just keep building computers so that one
got to stay together and I got to keep
it which was which was actually pretty
cool in fact it even got featured in the
latest holiday build where you guys love
coconut monkey you know he was bent down
he's like golly as to custom-build in
front inside a fractal define nano s
featuring you know blah blah blah blah I
can't remember the line which is funny
cuz he had a hard time saying the line
and I could nail it now I can't Neil and
I bet you he can Jeepers is a custom
build by JS to set aside a Faculty's eye
and define an OS I love the holidays so
my most favorite build on this channel
should be absolutely no surprise the
super high-end skunkworks didn't even
make the list
my favorite build I've ever done in this
channel is actually the build I did with
my daughter where I taught her how to
build her own PC she was only five and
she still uses it to this day that was a
moment where I got to share a passion of
mine that I make an entire living on
today that started when I was the same
age she was when we did that build so it
really was a true generational video
where I just got to I was so proud of
her because she built 99% of the
computer on her own there was only a
couple little things I had to help her
with and she she uses the crap at a
computer today it has nothing to do with
the specs I had There the specs are
nothing to write home about it's a AMD
a10 78 50 K it's got 16 gigabytes of
Radeon 20 400 megahertz memory ass got
AMD branded memory in there and it's got
an r7 250 sapphire graphics card in
there which is passive cooled it is it
is definitely nothing to write home
about
but it's also time to upgrade her
because she's starting to do things and
play games now where the
computer is definitely starting to show
its age so we are going to be doing a
video here while she's on her winter
break on her upgrading and probably
building a whole new PC anyway so that
that should definitely be a no-brainer
that father-daughter moment she already
breaks the mold she is a girl she's into
computers she's into games smashing
stereotypes every whichaway that you
possibly can and I couldn't be more
proud of her or that build or just what
we accomplished with that build so
skunkworks didn't make the list it
doesn't even stand it doesn't even hold
a candle compared to that all right so
some honorable mentions here you guys
might be asking yourself why didn't
skunkworks make the list well that's
easy skunkworks is never in its final
form as the channel is growing and
progressing the build behind me will
continue to evolve with the channel as
well it's always a center piece of mind
it's always changing even the colors
have changed it's been yellow it's been
orange and now it's green who knows
maybe may try blue next time I don't
know it's always changing because so am
I so is the channel and the way this
whole channel runs is always evolving
and that's what skunkworks represents so
it's kind of hard to have a favorite
form of skunkworks it's already gotten
like I want to say five different
versions starting at the 4790k so it's
really hard to actually nail that one
down to a favorite bill because it's
never done but two honorable mentions
though that I have to mention that I've
also been some of my favorite builds on
here are by far one I surprised coconut
monkey with him building a computer not
realizing he was actually building his
birthday present this last summer was a
5820k 16 gigabytes of RAM it had gtx
980ti in there it was a it was a pretty
badass build and it was in a Corsair 780
T I think it was 760 T something like
that I don't remember exactly which case
it was I let him pick the parts and put
it together and he didn't know that the
whole time he was building his own
Christmas or a birthday present and then
of course another honorable mention is
the PC I recently built for my friend
who is in the process of opening a
charter school geared towards group home
kids and giving them a gateway to
college and he's someone who actually
got me started in getting passionate
about PC gaming I was always into PC but
piece of gaming especially and he's one
of the biggest influences that you guys
have
never known about behind-the-scenes of
this channel so I surprised him with a
build
there was a video on that you guys can
watch it here and I got him he was
shocked as hell he didn't know what to
do he was he was actually shaking which
is crazy but anyway let me know which
builds are your favorite and I think for
2017 the Terry Crews build will be on
that list guys Terry Crews build is
coming we have to get through the
holidays there's so much going on that's
why it's taking so long holidays Jack
everything up for everybody as you know
but those are just about over which
means we can proceed and with that I'm
going to go head and proceed to get the
hell on out of here
because I'm done talking and you guys
are probably done listening so anyway
thanks for watching guys something big
is also coming right at the beginning of
2017 I can't wait to share it with you
guys it involves all of you and it gets
all of you a chance to also be the elite
a PCMR we'll talk about it more a little
bit later thanks for watching guys as
always I'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
