two cents and you may or may not know
who I am I run a popular pc and
technology channel here on YouTube
teaching you all kinds of ways to bring
your pc to the next level and one of my
sponsors is aqua tuning now aqua tuning
UK is celebrating their fifth birthday
and in celebration instead of receiving
gifts they want to give back to you guys
by giving away the really awesome nick
sews cool answer to 40 d 5 water cooling
kit this is a custom kit that's got
everything you could possibly need to
water cool your cpu it's fully
expandable and you don't need to buy
anything it's got everything you've
already need now they're going to be
giving that away it absolutely no cost
to anybody in the entire world there is
absolutely no limitation to where you
live to win this kit but there is a
couple of caveats in there where if
you're outside of the US Canada the UK
or Germany or the Europe you're probably
going to have to pay some sort of import
tax on that kit so unfortunately we
can't help that but the import tax would
be a heck of a lot cheaper than if you
went out and bought the kit anyway so if
