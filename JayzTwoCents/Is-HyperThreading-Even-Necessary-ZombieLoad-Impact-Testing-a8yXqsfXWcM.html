going on outside of our old set while
we're building our new ones so we're
kind of in the shitty position right now
where it's noisy no matter what we do so
I apologize for that but until our set
is done and they're done we get to deal
with the noise and being semi-homeless
but that's okay
so here's one day we're going to talk
today about the new vulnerabilities that
are going on with Intel processors but
we're not going to talk so much about
the problem we're talking about the
potential effects of the problem on your
day to day and then we're gonna kind of
test whether or not disabling
hyper-threading only affects our
performance like 7% which is what Intel
is trying to make you believe the new
bridge PCIe cables from cable mod fuse
two separate PCIe cables together with a
single close comb for an incredibly
clean look
you can configure yours however you like
using their easy-to-use configurator and
from now until May 27th you can take 15%
off your order using the coupon code May
15 this coupon code is good for
absolutely everything on the cable mod
global store so if you've been looking
at pimp your rig with cable monte r
now's the time to learn more click the
link in the description below okay so
like I said we're not gonna talk a whole
lot about the problem itself if you guys
want to learn more about this new
vulnerability it's called zombie load
and it's specifically affecting like
predictive computing and so that is
gonna specifically be dealing with Intel
CPUs and hyper threading and you can
drill down into that more it's called
MDS but you can drill down into that
more if you go and do some searches but
what I can tell you the problem
regarding this and zombie load is the
fact that it could be affecting clouds
how much information have you sent to
the cloud how much data have you ever
just connecting to the Internet your
information is in the cloud packets are
sent packets are received and so we have
server farms and data farms and all that
that could be potentially affected by
this so that's a whole different level
Enterprise Solution that's going to have
to be figured out in terms of patching
and MCU or micro
updates so I looked at this way I'm like
what is the impact going to be for you
my average viewer who's gonna be general
use computing maybe some video rendering
or live streaming and gaming so today
we're gonna do some testing on both
hyper threading enabled and disabled on
our 8700 K not our highest n CPUs that
we have because we want to kind of try
and keep it sort of realistic to the
real world we have a twenty eighty on
here another twenty atti so this is more
like a 1080 a 1080i and I guess
technically not really lower than that
but whatever what we want to see here is
what the impact would be like if you
wanted to take the extreme measure of
protecting yourself by disabling
hyper-threading now like I stated
earlier it's a really convoluted complex
problem that I don't know what the
solution is gonna be a long term on that
I don't think intel does either but they
made a statement that it's okay you can
disable hyper threading and you'll lose
like seven percent performance well it's
kind of funny because Apple said the
same thing only they quoted 40 percent
of a performance loss so I'm kind of
curious as to what that number really is
we're gonna test that today and see what
the real impact is gonna be to my
average viewer alright so as you can see
with our 8700 K it's still running at 5
gigahertz that's only like a 300
megahertz overclock on all cores so this
isn't out of the box performance but
like I said what we're testing here is
what the bottom line what did we lose
performance wise on my rig by disabling
hyper-threading so obviously your
results may vary depending on your
motherboard if you have a hyper
threading CPU you more than likely even
on a unlike a B Series motherboard would
have the ability to disable hyper
threading so you could test this on your
own and it's only one switch you have to
flip inside the bios of course each bios
is gonna be different so let's do this
I'm gonna go ahead and let me do a
3dmark run first the reason why I like
3dmark is the fact that it gives us both
a physics test which is CPU and it gives
us a GPU test which is obviously high
frame rate switch CPU can hold that back
we see it all the time especially when
we're doing like our high a you know Ln
two cooling benchmark runs that the CPU
does indeed affect the graphics core so
that is what we are going to test
for sort of our baseline there probably
a Senate bench will do a Senate bench
run as well and we are going to do time
spy extreme will do both screw it will
do time spy extreme and will do regular
time spy will just kind of do some tests
and then we'll just disable
hyper-threading and do the same test so
here's our baseline the very first test
that we did everything is on
hyper-threading 5 gigahertz and all that
no overclock being applied to our
graphics card that's important there's
no afterburner running any of that so
we've got a graphics core 5223 a cpu
score of 36 45 for a combined score of
49 oh for now we obviously know when we
turn on hyper-threading it's gonna go
down but anyway there's our base mark
our baseline 4904 with our two
individual scores so let's see what
Cinemark gives us or Sinemet Cinemark it
Cinebench whatever could you imagine if
they just combined the two tests 3d
benched in America ok so our baseline
test right now I'm not going to go
through the scores really I'm just going
to show you which ones we did because
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
put them in a graph format we care more
about how much performance we lost
rather than what the actual score is
that we started with because when we end
up with this kind of the point here so
we did Cinebench r15 with
hyper-threading on all 12 cores 6 cores
12 threads doing their thing at 5
gigahertz we did times by extreme and
Rigo times by because they both respond
very differently to workload because
it's this is technically a 4k test
versus a 1080p test or a 1440 test we
did 1080p Metro Riddick's in again no
overclocks to the GPU so we want to see
what happens to our average frame rate
because this is a high frame rate game
two hundred eight point nine frames per
second so we want to see how what
happens to that once we cut the that
workload potentially in on oh by a third
I mean hyper-threading people think is
like doubles your performance it doesn't
same thing in 1448 and we also did
shadow of the Tomb Raider in both 1080p
and 1440 mostly because this is a very
CPU centric game as well so we also did
a premiere of our kingpin video so we
did a premiere render with a 99
we're doing this on Phil's test bench
and then we're gonna re-render it or
edit rate whatever yeah it's a test
bench today and then Phil is gonna also
rerender it with the exact same settings
and same export settings with
hyper-threading disabled so those are
our tests so let's go ahead and disable
hyper threading now in your particular
motherboard it's going to vary we have
an asus motherboard here this is a Strix
z3 70 or z2 70 hey they started working
again apparently that union break is
over so anyway I digress let's go ahead
and go into the BIOS here now I'm just
mashing delete some of my pf8 whatever
look at your motherboard manual I can't
tell you how to get into BIOS on your
motherboards but I can tell you on Asus
you can mash delete and then what you're
gonna get as a menu that looks like this
if it's an rog board it's it's red it
might be blue depending on which
motherboard you have so you just go over
here to advanced CPU configuration
hyper-threading disabled f10 save so now
we just turned off hyper-threading
entirely so now we have a six core six
thread CPU do you think we're gonna lose
more than seven to nine percent alright
so we ran all the tests and stuff so the
question is now how does it all stack up
well if you take a look at these charts
that were kind of showing you right now
you'll see that hyper threading for
gaming really doesn't make that much of
a difference believe it or not it's a
subject I haven't really given did
Davitt dive dive Dobin dope I have not
done a lot of testing with how hyper
threading directly relates to gaming
performance but we do know as CPUs and
stuff become more you know utilized in
games and multi-threaded it could indeed
have an impact now what you're gonna
notice what these percentages is that
this is just the one task it's the one
game running and the comparison of hyper
threading on hyper threading off you
know half the logical course but we saw
as low as 0% loss like 1414 Metro all
the way up to about what fifteen point
six are sixteen point eight percent loss
in premiere fun fact about premiere
though is if you're running a CPU that's
got an IG P you in it we showed in the
past on how you can enable hardware
acceleration where the AI GPU built into
the to the
CPU can handle all the h.264 encoding on
a hardware level so it doesn't really
matter at that point because once you
enable that we got the exact same score
or time pretty much about 11 minutes
with hyper-threading on and off but
that's because it's offloading it to a
whole separate die anyway an interesting
thing though is with time spy we saw the
exact same percentage drop with
hyper-threading on and off in both
extreme and non extreme but what's
interesting is that we did say see a
bigger reduction in normal versus
extreme because of the lower resolution
higher frame rates which of course the
CPU could start to hold it back but we
saw in time spy we actually saw the
graphics core increase ever so slightly
like 60 points or something like that
probably still within margin of error
but we did of course see the CPU drop on
both of the physics test because it is
100% CPU seems to be roughly around
where Intel was saying the performance
loss would be you know 7% to 9% nowhere
near the 40% that Apple is saying the
performance loss could be but we don't
know what those testing perimeters were
we don't have any details about what rig
they use what CPU they used what we
think Apple could be wanting to make
Intel look a little bit worse than maybe
it really is because who knows what
their future holds in terms of
proprietary hardware they could also be
trying to cause a little bit of pressure
for Intel to do something more quickly
we don't know so at the end of the day
I'm much more comfortable now telling
people like it look if you're building a
system just for gaming it makes sense to
save some money and go with like a 9600
K or a 9700 K versus a 9900 K but again
this is a six core CPU where a four core
would obviously show us more of a gap
but yeah so this kind of really changed
my way of thinking on the way I might
build some of my future systems when we
start thinking budget and even high end
because gaming systems just the for the
example of gaming do not get hit that
hard with hyper-threading even on the
multi-threaded stuff like far cry and
shatter the Tomb Raider and all that
sort of stuff but again it really
depends on what you're doing to computer
if you have tons of programs running a
background task going if you got VMs all
that sort of stuff then obviously you
want as much of the horsepower as you
can possibly get alright guys thanks for
watching I just wanted to kind of put
this out there if you were curious about
what performance you lose if you turned
off your
hyper-threading on your Intel CPU not as
much as we initially thought which
really truly surprised me so alright
guys if you think this is something we
should investigate further in terms of
hyper-threading and games and how they
correlate let us know what titles you
think we should test there's so many
titles out there it's impossible for us
to really determine what the most
universal titles are so this is where
you guys help us try and determine that
all right we're gonna go now thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one and I get a set to build because I'm
done with this crap so we're gonna do
this in a bench now it's time to start
we'll kind of show the FE two guards
burn and then the Bert and and that's in
an orphaned or</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
