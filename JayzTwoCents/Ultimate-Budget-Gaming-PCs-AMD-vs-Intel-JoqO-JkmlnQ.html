apologize if I sound nasally I'm
starting to get sick I get sick like
once or twice a year and yeah so I'm
vitamin regimen get up but today you
know where else we're doing we are
taking two low price or low cost budget
builds if around 500 bucks I stay around
and it's very difficult to take an Intel
bill to cure it to an AMD built for the
exact same price but I did my best I'm
going to talk about some interesting
things here with this and I put my own
money on the line so that's always fun
cooler masters master key Pro Series of
keyboards offer sixteen point seven
million color RGB genuine cherry
switches a variety of sizes as well as
surface mounted controls allowing full
customization without the need for
stand-alone software learn more by
following the link down below alright so
I've got about thousand bucks into
today's video so please smash that like
button if you guys at least appreciate
the effort though that said guys just
talk about what we got here we've got
two systems an AMD build which I showed
on Twitter that I was gonna do I got the
new athlon x4 950 which is a am for
excuses ddr4 and although it's an older
architecture
I think it's cool because it gives you
some forward compatibility in terms of
socket right you could buy an excavator
bulldozer CPU on the am3+ socket but the
problem is you have no forward
compatibility that's a dead end there's
nowhere to go so at least this gives
decent forward compatibility although at
this price point though it does limit
how far forward you can go because like
the motherboard we're using doesn't have
overclocking abilities and the power
supply we're using doesn't allow us to
go too big in terms of power draw so
we'll talk about that in a second and
then on the Intel side over here you
guys got Matt on Twitter that I wasn't
comparing it to something like why would
you just do a budget bill that would
compare it I've haven't really done the
budget comparison so we're doing that
for the first time ever on this channel
we're comparing it to the Intel G 45 60
which is a dual-core 4 thread CPU so
it's got hyper threading versus the
Athlon older architecture but for
physical cores so that should be fun but
but here's the hard part when you do a
video like this is getting it all to
price up evenly because they're not
evenly matched in terms of pricing the
CPU for the Athlon is $59.99 the Pentium
is $89 CPU and although I got it for 59
bucks at micro Center
I put the pricing of what most people
were gonna pay because one they don't
ship and a lot of people don't live near
a micro Center so just to keep things as
fair and level as possible I'm
ahead and put in there the retail
pricing also - even though we're using
like the same series of motherboards
from from gigabyte for this to try and
keep it as apples to apples as possible
even though it's apples and oranges
there's a $20 difference on the
motherboards 69 again versus like 89 so
you definitely are paying more for Intel
so let's run through the price what
we're what parts were putting in here
real quick
they both are gonna be running the same
exact graphics card the MSI GTX 10:59
1050 TI 1050 1050 Ti would up the whole
thing by like 65 ish dollars so I want
to keep this around 500 as close as
possible also - these are the single fan
cards which are more expensive because
our ITX format versus the dual fan card
so in order to keep pricing down in the
description below we want to list out
all the prices and all the parts I use
the dual fan which is cheaper same
graphics card just a dual fan longer PCB
and cheaper so I went ahead and did that
but the interesting thing though is this
is the first time been able to do a
budget bill for around 500 bucks and
includes solid state drives and not 128
gig Drive 250 gig drive and Samsung
Evo's at that because pricing of nand
has really come down so now for 89 bucks
you can get a 250 gig a Samsung Evo so
those are evenly matched we're also
running eight gigabytes each on these
systems of ballistics ddr4 the speeds on
these actually I can't remember the
speeds of 2400 so they're perfectly
matched on that again I showed you the
motherboards are pretty much the same
exact series one Intel one AMD neither
of them feature overclocking so that's
something to keep in mind this is an
a320 chipset versus an h2 70 m chipset
it might be a tiny bit up overclocking
available on that and then for power
supplies there are two different power
supplies with the same price we've got
the master watt light from core cooler
master which is a $35 power supply and
then over here we've got the EVGA 450 B
which is a bronze whereas this one is
just an eighty plus so 50 watts less but
higher efficiency rating again got this
one for 37 so 2 dollars difference you
might be wondering why I didn't buy the
exact same power supply I got them at
two different times in the store I went
to didn't actually have the EVGA for 50
B so I just went with something that was
in the same price point and wasn't a
cheap knockoff throw away type of power
supply one might forget forgetting any
here no it's it paces yeah I feel talk
about the case these are just $25 cases
whatever the cheapest ATX case I could
find was we've got a Diablo tech diamond
case here we've got a raid Max comment
these are no frills try and cut your
finger off type of cases because of
unrefined sharp edges no cable
management no lighting in fact there
might even be only one case fan in each
of these fortunately these are low power
parts so there won't be a lot of heat so
that's just a placeholder of 25 bucks
you guys can use it in case you want
obviously so we've got a 48 dollar
difference here 526 on the intel side
versus 478 on the AMD side now here's
where things are interesting and I'm not
sure how I want to proceed I know for a
fact I'm going to build both these and
compare them but if you add 58 or if you
add 48 dollars to the AMD build you
could actually remove this guy and
include this guy now that's an
interesting comparison because you've
gotten barre3 or Rison 3 1200 verses
which it's new architecture versus 2
cores with hyper-threading 4 physical
cores on new architecture so why here's
what I think I'm gonna do I think I'm
gonna compare these two as in like the
cheapest entry-level PC gaming builds
you can pretty much buy for each
platform and then I think I'll throw in
the rise in 1200 and then see what
happens because then we're talking like
this is like 3 or 4 dollars more than
the Intel well that said you know we got
to do now we're gonna build him I was
gonna ask on Twitter whether or not they
thought I should do this comparison I
already know the answer so let's just do
it you know I brought out the Rison I
felt like BAM
why do you keep facepalming when I do
that
now when we're talking just now compared
the so the Emlyn now although so the
clear winner is the eight oh you're good
now I got it ya know so in all of the
tests so far that we've done the Intel G
4560 Pentium has beaten the x4 950
Athlon and pretty much every single test
across the board clear winner not even
by a margin just like way out ahead
which I guess makes a whole lot of sense
right it's more modern technology it's
cable eight processor although it's two
cores with hyper-threading the 4
physical cores of the older architecture
just simply are not enough to keep up
with the Intel but then again it cost
you 50 bucks more than what you
currently see with the AMD so you should
be getting more performance but I do
feel like if this is your price point
you can't go any higher then the G 4560
is definitely the place you should look
so a couple of titles that were pretty
interesting like Diablo 3 they'll have a
built in benchmark we just did some
playing on that and even on the Athlon
we're getting a stupid amount of frames
no problems playing it on high settings
at all
World of Warcraft was an interesting one
though because that's very CPU intensive
as much as it uses GPU for things like
shadow and rendering and textures and
stuff like that it showed a high frame
rate like I showed a decent frame rate
right 870 290 FPS the problem was it was
extremely stuttering and I couldn't
figure that out I couldn't figure out
what was causing that and then we jump
on over into the Intel system again the
frame rates were about the same but
extremely smooth so there wasn't figure
out what was happening between those two
so that was an anomaly worth mentioning
though but let's talk about player
unknown battlegrounds which is a title
that so many people right now are
playing it's actually the most played
game right now on I think steam and I
think it already passed csgo if I'm not
mistaken on the last chart I took a look
at pretty much identical situation on
both days which is kind of interesting
because it is an unreal game engine but
it's also CPU intensive and it was even
though the menu it looked like we were
getting lower fps in the Athlon system
once we once we in the world and
everyone was spread out and all those
players weren't condensed in that little
starting area then the frame rates
weren't great but would you what would
you expect
and a game that is gonna leverage CPU
and need CPU we were getting anywhere
between like 30 FPS up to about 55 FPS
in some instances up over 60 if you were
like indoors or something but still
playable experience Nick played it
played a whole round and it's very first
time and got down to like what you're
like number 22 12 Oh number 12 excuse me
yeah I'd I'd like I think I was like the
fourth one to die when I played some of
that anyway Beau's playable if you if
you're looking at just getting into PC
gaming and not breaking the bank and you
don't care about all the eye candy
you just care about the story then
either one of these systems would do
good right fifty dollars or more on the
Intel you get definitely $50 worth of
performance increase over the Athlon the
Athlon you can have for under $500
easily like 478 dollars ago I think the
total was but like I said the beginning
this video what happens if you have the
extra 50 bucks to spend should you spend
it on the Intel or is it worth then
going with Verizon three twelve hundred
so let's go and throw this in there
compare it to the Intel again then let's
see what we've got it
I think the story is gonna change a
little bit so I installed the Rhys n3
1200 and redid my tests and before we
get into the results I guess I should
just go ahead and show you the results
yeah they did better than the Athlon as
we expected not it didn't do a whole lot
better than it which was kind of
surprising which member whitson new
architecture it's on Verizon or Zen
architecture whereas Athlon is on old
school architecture and it was still
trailing behind the Intel in things like
actual games but in benchmarks like
heaven right guys 1716 in the untell
system and it got a 16 59 in the
synthetic so it was only a little bit
higher was definitely in between the
Athlon and the Intel which surprised me
it really did they were so close in
performance I was really having a hard
time telling the difference between
which system was what when you're moving
about them so I had a little idea I said
you know we've got another youtuber here
in the same building I figured why not
bring him in and see what he has to
think I just got called out because Nick
said it was his idea actually was his
idea was a good one I'll give him that
okay give it gonna bro yeah there you go
it's my idea now though system line
let's do it
so 1080p low I mean at first glance it
seems to be running pretty smoothly
no FPS counter that's important yeah no
FPS counter so I can't cheat this is not
great for keyboard to school um it seems
to be running a reasonably smooth it's a
little stutter II though alright this is
uh this is decent I'd say it's very much
playable I just noticed the a few
stutters here and there but generally
speaking it looks to be a pretty smooth
frame rate it looks looks really good
like the frame rate it's actually not
not that bad it's it's pretty smooth you
did I definitely see what Austin's
saying with the jittering but from afar
it almost sold as you know just kind of
the bike going over over like bumps in
the road and stuff it actually you know
I mean it's definitely playable it's not
it's it's not uh not the prettiest
looking thing I could tell you that but
at least it's playable all right so this
is system two so supposedly the same
settings first glance this looks to be
pretty similar I'm that's in any
stutters but let me I should get on the
motorcycle and stressed a little bit
this looks to be a bit smoother so
before when I was on the motorcycle
that's where I saw some torn frames and
yeah a little stutter there it's pretty
close there like I don't think there's
any kind of hugely significant
performance difference that I can see oh
yeah at first glance this looks to have
a little bit of a more consistent frame
rate before I was noticing just a little
bit of stuttering but this seems to be a
little bit smoother she's really got to
had to get myself out of Austin's mess
yeah this this definitely looks a tad
bit smoother - you guys are fruit
smoothies we were talking about
Micra stutters yeah it's not it's
definitely not as bad as the other one
it's there but it's not it's not as not
as it's not as a obvious I guess it's
it's definitely yeah it is to reiterate
what Austin is saying it's definitely
smoother and otherwise like things look
generally the same so back with system
two we have Diablo what settings is this
running up Basin I said oh okay so this
click in the one two three
my Starcraft skills are coming back to
me even though this is nothing like I
mean this is a pretty solid experience I
don't exactly have a lot of sort of
skill or experience with Diablo but I
mean I would have no problem playing
this as is to my eye this is basically
flawless like I'm not seeing any sort of
like major dropped frames or anything
like that I have zero problem playing
all the way through the game like this
this looks really nice like I'm curious
to see what it'll look like on the other
machine but this looks really smooth
like to the framerate visuals look
really nice yeah I mean I'd totally play
this on the computer again alright back
to system 1 and I actually do think I
see a little bit of a difference I
should get into some action here but
oh man this is a lot harder without like
any kind of framerate counter to be able
to see like a big difference okay yeah
now see it's you just forced to use your
eyes now yeah I don't want to use my
eyes I want to use a cheating tools it's
really hard for me to tell a major
difference here we might be a little bit
slower but man it's it's hard for me to
tell any significant difference
oh yeah what I should not have gone in
here this is a bad idea what am i doing
right now
yeah I think the I think the framerate
if there is a difference is probably
vaguely worse on this one but I really
can't tell much at all it's very very
close if I had to take a guess I'd say
that specifically when we were playing
tom clancy's system to seemed to be a
little bit smoother as far as Diablo I
would give it maybe a slight edge - -
but it seemed pretty close to me I feel
like gobbles a game that there could be
a bigger frame a difference in I can't
quite notice quite so much right I don't
know yeah I don't really know um I mean
I haven't played either game I don't
know what optimization horizon is but so
what happens when IJ corners us it's
like hey yeah try these random pcs you
have no idea which ones right so before
I reveal which ones which then if you
have a preferred system that you've got
a plan I would slightly go with the
system - but it's a pretty small
difference I think either would be
totally fine I'd do system two as well
like it was it is definitely like
smoother overall I feel like especially
on the Tom Clancy game but
yeah I I think system Jews definitely it
really is picking up okay feel like I
could be totally happy like if I wasn't
really looking for them I don't think I
would have noticed them that much it
wasn't like ruining the game or anything
but having them side by side you could
tell the difference
yeah I'm legitimately impressed with the
Pentium right now actually the thing
that's kind of frustrating though about
doing budget builds like this is no
matter what price point you pick you're
always gonna get those people that say
well I'll just save up a little more and
get this and then if you saved up more
then you can apply that again we'll just
leave a little more and get this you
could you could just a little more save
all the way from a budget build like
this all the way up to some stupid like
skunkworks level build if you just kept
applying that logic because
realistically the next step up for the
Intel if we put it about 20-ish $25 a
head of the Rison system is to go to an
i3 7100 right and then we put that and
then we go well we got to use a 1300 X
and we put the 1300 X and is like well
we got to go with an AI 373 50k and it
just never ends so that's why we're
stopping it here guys
I'm not declaring a winner I think the
Athlon is a really good bargain I really
do but the Pentium obviously is a better
performer and it should be because it's
more money detect it even outperformed
the risin 1200 in many tests so
depending on what side of the fence
you're on though I think it very
compelling options especially for the
budget build you can get that 60fps
pretty much without a problem if you're
willing to sacrifice down to medium and
low settings depending on the title
anyway guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching today's video who do you think
won the competition Intel the Athlon or
the Rison I think you got some really
compelling options on both sides of the
fence and that makes this kind of an
exciting time especially at the low
budget price point but anyway also -
we've got Nick come over here we've
don't forget guys you got some merch you
guys can buy we've got Nick modeling the
amazing J's 2 cent shirt in black he's
not even on frame go down a little bit
so there's you gotta go sideways you can
go down and get the there ya go
alright guys thanks for watching as
always we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
