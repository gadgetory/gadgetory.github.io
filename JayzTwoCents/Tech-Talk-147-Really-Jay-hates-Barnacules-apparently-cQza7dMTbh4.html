seeing people different background on
least one of us I know my just got
dirtier yes guys there is gonna be a
sync issue between Jerry's mouth and the
video because Skype sorry change
nothing's changed over the last year
nope
we got a rolling intro right remember
how to do that hold on I'm gonna push
the button there we go people
tick-tock-tick Jana Jana I forgot what
the playback stream livestream bro
something I never do my guy
when he gives her live streaming like
game some things never changed now I
gotta mix up my my protein oh I forgot
to shake this up before we started sorry
guys okay I ate a Nutter Butter why are
we here I don't know why do I not see
how many video we have 880 people in
here on a Saturday night yeah no I'll go
it'll go up more than that I guarantee
it
I drove all way back to the studio on a
Saturday to do this stream just cuz you
didn't wanna do it from your crappy
internet at home no I should have decent
internet home I just I was getting ready
to do it like set up a home and I
realized all my shits here so it was
like I think it'll send a better message
than the community if I'm on a
soundstage I think it helps I think it
helps if I have a camera and a mic when
I do a live - it does fair enough I
can't it's my phone
I'm sure we have some blind people Noddy
and so they wouldn't mind I need to make
the check bigger hold on pop out check
there we go that works um so this is not
a Tech Talk that's why there's a
question mark in the title wait is it
yes there's still a question mark this
is not a Tech Talk guys Tech Talk is not
coming back it's dead we're just we're
just hanging out and there's no that
says we can't do this every now and then
because as Jerry said earlier in his
stream he and I had a long phone call
yesterday
much overdue phone call and that's all I
mean much there's no excuses for that
there's no excuses for disappearing as
much as I have but it is what it is I'm
not gonna come up any excuses busy or
not I pulled back from communications
with a lot of people and things and
entities and I think the problem is I
pulled a little bit too far back yeah
and it wasn't just me either I mean it
was it was a lot of beating my wife with
my wife would
say I'm gonna talk to her pretty much so
come to bed Jay wait are you there Jay
are you there oh shit he's back in the
snow I think I think the sad truth is
like I I don't go to bed at the same
time as my wife often enough so but this
this today the whole point of this is a
throwback and this is not to explain
myself I saw a lot of people demanding
that I explain myself they honest they
honest of truth here is I don't need to
explain shit but here we are hanging out
anyway
Jay I think you should explain yourself
well we see my channel got really big I
got so big man
the subs were so big man it was like
wasn't collapsing in on me no my new
best friend Terry you know we are oh my
god oh my god the rumor mill so
everything's good everything's good guys
he paid me I appeared as required
well I've satisfied my contract well
well the money is in a trust until we
complete this dream that's true that is
true someone said fuck off we want tech
talk no you fuck off well I mean I mean
I mean you go away my wife and they're
in friends or family our friends are
watching I don't know if their kids are
still awake so I need go away oh man so
so now this is a PG stream dammit no
what we thought we might do today I had
to put an end time in the stream just
cuz it makes you kind of do that I
figured we just kind of like we'd hang
out we talked we talked about some some
of our favorite past moments over the
last five years because contrary to
popular belief that five year
anniversary video did not omit Jerry why
do I have a Canadian coin oh yeah I went
to Canada um sorry see do you see what
my do you see what it's like being me
that's bad we thought we would go down
we thought we'd go down memory lane with
Tech Talk kinda like the way we ended it
but I did not omit Jerry from my five
year video I know this sounds like an
excuse but I was thinking video creation
not necessarily live stream but I did
have Jerry's intro to the video that we
made in there but I decided I wanted to
put my dad's clip in there as well and
when I did that and I scooted the
timeline down the clip that had the
begin so it was when in the beginning
part of that dirtfish clip right
so there's gonna be like it was you and
you're like hey guys Jerry you're a gay
barnacle ISA we're at dirtfish rally
school and it was gonna cut into that
flyover the problem is that clip got cut
off when I scooted the timeline down and
I didn't have the magnet on so it went
over top of yours ah so you
subconsciously cut me out same result
that's perceived ever say the same
result no but I probably downloaded 40
40 or so clips and videos for my
favorite moments and you know how many
of them just like I couldn't fit in
those videos are tricky to make I know
that I've made them before - they are
tricky to make nobody nobody mentioned
that there that there was like no
skunkworks
they sure noticed there was no giri but
they didn't notice no skunkworks and
that weird no that's a good thing that's
a good thing actually well there's still
people that know who both of us are that
we're not like completely segregated on
the internet I just got a text message
the kids are playing so we're good we
can use our foul language yes fuck shit
fuck balls okay we hit Oh guys the
donation is please don't don't donate
don't feel don't donate tonight there's
no need for the donations honestly I
appreciate them but I'm also not gonna
try and track them and make sure I
respond to all of them guys this is just
on talk to go to the air you can feel
that you can feel bad just keep donating
my bits come hold on you know what the
sad thing is you know one day I did that
that actually and we actually almost hit
it
we won't that wasn't the day but you're
like and you're giving every penny to
your wife for Mother's yeah I was giving
every penny to my wife and it kept going
up and I just kept upping it upping it
up and finally I was like screw this mm
like end of the 1896 was like all I
wanted to do was have some Sarah
McLaughlin pant playing in the arms of
an aged like tear CGI go down my face I
love this Tech Talk is dead kill myself
left my ass off no it's funny had a guy
on one of my videos other days and geez
ten times better than you'll ever be fat
ass it's like two J's er I'll never
reach it I'll never understand those
comments oh I used to be a fat ass you
know Jay used to be a fat ass he just
isn't anymore I wear an obese to be sure
though it makes me ten pounds lighter
it's a it's that tri-blend
it is um lean super soft lightweight
shirt because you know totally every out
counts how are you how are you doing on
your workout stuff by the way you still
looking really trim and fit terrible
terrible terrible you still look like an
ethiopian like like I've put a few
inches back on in my midsection don't
worry the Internet's quick to point it
out it will never change no I mean when
my I was I was back on track man I was
riding three times a week I was lifting
three times a week I was eating right
and I took about three weeks of that
routine for the weight to start coming
off again yeah and literally when I was
at the height of like back in the saddle
I was where my dad died and everything
derailed and that's that's to be
expected but here we are now about a
month in the week passed his death and
I'm now feeling more normal again so I'm
back on track so why right now I'm
drinking my protein I wanted coffee oh
yeah there's a coffee shop here in the
same building I could have gone to got
coffee instead of making good coffee job
- yeah really good like the good stuff
not like a Starbucks yeah no that's
that's that's awesome I'm glad that
things are getting back to normal for
you plus I mean your your old man had a
hell of a send-off - with this service
that was pretty cool
I was glad they sent that like that's
that's neat that they do they do that
for everybody that's served in the
military for okay so there's different
levels of honors so his his was
technically a nine gun salute okay not a
2120 one's like a the highest honors
that's that they use usually use that
for like dignitaries and
other like high-ranking officials and
stuff but I ended up I stopped the video
because right at the end of that they
play taps and I was like I'm not
recording taps so yeah and that wasn't
really that was a hard moment like
really bad moment and then I I felt the
need to kind of get up and talk in front
of everybody so I did that I talked to
her that's hard man I did that with my
mom with my mom when I was the first
person up talking and I lost my shit
well I felt the need to keep it together
because everyone else was falling apart
so yeah wish I had that superpower I
don't you know who I feel really bad for
the people who run those ceremonies
no that was my no fifth that was my
fifth military honors ceremony for
family members all four of my
grandparents and then my dad and so it's
one of those things would know maybe
this was my fourth
yeah bottom line is I've been to a lot
of them yeah every single time the
person doing the presenting who's
leading like the the Navy the Department
of the Navy ran this one so it was half
Navy half Marines and so the person that
comes up and talks like in full full
dress and everything and then they
present his his his honors flag to in
this case my mom and then they gave like
a little statement right gotcha dude the
officer was like practically balling his
own eyes out you know and it's how do
you not though like I mean you're in the
military you're costly every day with
your brothers you see everybody who work
with as your brothers I mean though he
didn't know your dad directly I mean he
sees them through what he did yeah I
mean that's got to be a really hard
thing to deal with
James tricker said what a sad life you
miss isn't said no I'm past sad I'm on
to happy memory mode and in all of this
grieving brother no no my whole point
bringing that up wasn't there was sad I
thought that was an amazing way yeah
like remember him and send him off like
most people don't get that kind of a
send-off it took it took three weeks
from the moment he died to like having
the honors scheduled and people could
get enough time for a lot of
out-of-towners to come in there was a
lot of people from my town that came in
and so that three weeks really just
sucked because there was no closure yet
the he hadn't been put to rest yet so
there was just a lot of limbo and myself
in limbo is not a good thing I'm - I'm -
streamlined to be in limbo and so that
was really really hard the nights were
long sleep was was rare and and that was
when I'm sure you noticed like I dropped
off the face of the planet and honestly
that was when that that was when things
completely went quiet and I expected
that to happen I really didn't expect
that to happen it was just I don't know
like I was telling you I got sand in my
mangina I was taking things out of
context people were we're seating things
in the my ear that I was listening to
and you know how I am I try to say I
ignore all the hate and I ignore all the
people but you know it's hard sometimes
for me you know of all people
yeah that day I wear my emotions on my
sleeve way too much and it's not
something I easily change that's the
problem it's like I'd not even really
get it faking it right and so it just it
is what it is if there's a but I'm glad
I'm glad that you called me the other
day we got to talk for so long and I was
actually the one that ended the call I
mean we were talking for so long so yeah
so I do appreciate that I do and and I
think people just need to realize that
you know when I was
when I when I felt like you were pushing
me away what I thought happened was I
thought it did something wrong is what I
thought at first cuz I I don't know why
I couldn't tell you why I just jumped to
that conclusion but I felt like maybe I
did something wrong - maybe like
embarrass you or step over a line or I
thought it made you mad because usually
my friends back away from me it's cuz I
did something that I did I made a mat
you do something no no we've been pissed
at each other before I mean you you you
and I have had some good conversations
you yeah but you and I when we're pissed
at the other person we take the
opportunity to like tip okay so when you
and I have had differences in the past
we never like gave the cold treatment
and it's like what's wrong nothing are
you sure something's wrong nope I'm fine
no it was like what's wrong I'll tell
you what's wrong you know and that's the
way it's always been it's never just
been like I don't talk to you yeah
that's why it was weird it's because I
was expecting that I was like I was like
you know come on or we just gonna you
know tell each other what the hell's
going on here but then I realized I kept
trying to say you know it's your dad
wasn't you know I was looking at that I
was going he's not over yeah he's just
not over - I kept telling myself that
he's not over that yet and you don't get
over that for a very long time like even
right now I mean you say you're doing
better but I mean I know what it's like
right yeah I mean for my mom it was
price six months before I didn't dream
about her every night you know
so I okay go ahead I want to hear this
no I was gonna say that there's a
there's a really weird story to happen
me yesterday I want to tell I already I
already told my family but it no it's
not like a ghost story or anything at
that I firmly believe that that my dad
is is not hanging around here there's no
reason to right I believe the exact same
about my mom too
and so my I feel bad for my wife but
I've not actually had a direct
conversation with her yet about my dad's
death because I don't know I I I just I
don't know but the the thing with me was
the only way I knew how to handle
anything was to just like put my head
down get work done and I feel bad for
Nick man oh god Nick is watching he
knows he knows I feel bad but I was the
biggest dick to work for for that
through like that time period like we
were having fun you know and I'm and I'm
and I'm not I'm not I'm not a slave
driver and getting that's not a colored
joke guys I know the guy is black but
still I'm not like
and in the end double racism he's not
even black his dad from Panama but
anyway I'm a straight shooter very blunt
very direct like we got to do this do it
now stop fucking yeah right but I'm not
disrespectful but for the once when my
dad died and then I came back to work
then the same day it was the same day I
went to LA I was really quiet and just
kind of sticking to myself that was when
the AMD SIGGRAPH thing was going on for
the right for the thread Ripper and yeah
Vega launch and and everyone was coming
up to me to give me their condolences
which was fine and I was good there but
it was when we got back and we went to
the studio and I was like I'm fine I got
this man I was I guarantee you I'm
surprised he didn't quit because octor
Jekyll mr. Hyde he surprised he didn't
quit because I didn't know how to handle
I didn't how to handle anything at that
moment like my my Center my balance was
gone I had no idea what was going on
anymore I didn't know what was left it
was right I just was like I got to work
but I don't know what to do I've got
deadlines to meet but I'm not creative
right now it was just like a really
terrible time and he did his best to
just stay out of the way but yet try and
do what he needed to do without me being
able to give him coherent directions and
it was really bad but we're in a good
place now at the risk of sounding like
like really bad towards you I think Nick
knows why he signed up for like you guys
have been friends for so long he knows
he knows how you are and plus that
combined with your dad dying like I'm
pretty sure he expected that like I'm
not saying that it makes it any better
that you're you know and asked to him
but I'm just saying I think he kind of
understands like that's why he didn't
just like storm off and be like OJ's
just being a dick you know it's like
ever I got the same with my mom died I
pushed every many way we have anybody
even came in the room or said anything
my wife was pregnant at the time you got
to remember this woman pregnant was and
ER she coming in like look at me and I
would just be like I can't even look at
you cuz even looking at you reminds me
over mom did you being pregnant like
reminding me of my mom and everything
remind me of mom so I just say I just
stayed away and she gave me space for a
long time and I finally started to come
out of my hole but yeah I was the same
way I was just like fuck everything fuck
life damn near suicidal it was a rough
time man but that's just how you get you
don't know what to do and the thing is
like so I'm not a crier you're a crier
I'm not a crier right absolutely 100
century people
we'll think because I don't cry like
publicly or in front of people that that
means that I'm not emotional and that's
not true
because the biggest thing I learned
about my spell itself at the age of 36
is at the moment my dad was gone that
was the biggest baby there ever was but
the thing was I didn't I didn't I didn't
go to my wife to vent I didn't go to you
to vent and go to Nick to van I went in
the bathroom for a half hour with my
head in my hands you know I went in the
closet I went in the I sat in the car in
the driveway for an hour that kind of
stuff you know and it was really hard
because I didn't know I didn't know how
to move forward because everything I do
with regards to like everything I really
did with regards to like my work ethic
and everything I felt like my dad was my
grounding pole right and and then with
him not being there anymore was suddenly
just like well now what the fuck do I do
but I'm I'm past that now and I still
had my moments of weakness regarding
like really missing him and stuff like
that but yesterday when I was leaving
the studio there was a package we were
waiting for that was supposed to be
delivered the day that I was doing a
thing in Hollywood with a guy at a place
right ha and the package was the
signature required package they dropped
it off at the UPS Store and I had picked
it up yesterday so I went to the UPS
Store to pick it up and as I was like
parking and getting out of my car this
other car was pulling in the driveway to
the UPS Store and I kind of just peered
it like looked in the window as the guy
was driving past me you know make sure I
contact someone get run over as a
pedestrian right yeah and the guy looked
exactly like my dad and I don't mean
like oh that guy look kind of like my
dad is like no I had to like triple take
and I was like that was really weird
so I'm going into the store and as I'm
doing my thing as I'm coming out of the
store the guy was making his way into
the store and like so we were crossing
paths in the parking lot and as I'm
walking closer to him I'm like oh my god
this this is my dad's doppelganger this
is my dad's twin and of course giving
him that's happened I'm just like I
almost like I want to touch the guy and
be like you're a real thing right
because I was at this point I'm thinking
like so I haven't had like you know like
a spiritual visit for my dad since he
died none of that stuff no I mean like
very but seeing somebody looks like him
definitely like resurges a bunch of
memories like rapidly like right like
I'm looking at him again yeah the only
the only type of experiences I've had
since my dad has died is
his moments where I'm feeling like
literally like I just can't hold it
together anymore yeah I would just get
like this amazing calming feeling and
feel like there's a hand on my shoulder
and that's the way my dad and I always
interact it we didn't hug and stuff like
that we just did like the hand on the
shoulder kind of thing right and that's
what tells me that he's at least still
around in some sense because that brings
like amazing level of peace but I saw
this man and I'm thinking I and I'm
looking at him like a deer in headlights
right and it's kind of funny because I
noticed he was looking at me the same
way like the same way and I'm like this
is really strange and we crossed paths
and both of us like three or four times
stopped to look back at the other person
almost like that we should have said
something but didn't and it's funny
because he didn't have that look on his
face like what are you looking at like a
back away like what do you know like a
crazy old guy yeah it's like oh he had
sort of a leaning in like I kind of
recognize you and and a couple of things
happen now seeing myself like okay this
guy's real why he just walked in the
store this the door opened up this ain't
no ghost experience right first of all
my dad hadn't driven in the last ten
years because of his strokes and stuff
so he wouldn't be driving a Prius either
and which is what the guy was driving
always happy to though that was the
thing I really remember about your dad
is no matter how bad it was but I told I
told her my friend that's visiting from
out of town and she was like well what
if she's like what if maybe that guy was
like wow he looks just like my son right
and in fact I thought about him like
well if the guy looks just like my dad
it means he kind of looks like me and
maybe if he has a son his son looks like
me who knows right
maybe that freaked him out and Jenny and
I was talking to Jennifer today and she
goes what if he had a son that died he's
looking at you like he looks just like
my son that would be really weird right
yeah but I mean we've all made all our
dopper doppelgangers and usually it it's
like yeah that looks pretty close I've
never met anyone that literally was like
dude we're talking Carbon Copy I almost
wonder if that's a common thing when you
lose a loved one cuz the same thing
happened to me where I kept seeing my
mom out of the corner of my eye
everywhere I went didn't matter where I
was grocery store whatever had the
corner of my I'd be like oh it looks
like my mom then I go take a closer look
and I'd be like oh it looks nothing like
her you had the reality a side profile
reality is he probably was like is that
that Jace - since getting skinny he's
probably like man I don't know if I jazz
intro signature or something
it's good you can always look you can
always the Micro Center goes ups doors
same thing
it's kind of funny because you can
always tell when someone's looking at
you when they recognize who you are with
the to embarrass to say something like
yes my wife donates today my wife
noticed is it more than than I do right
so does body but yeah this was a
different stare it was strange
anyway guys it's not this isn't a set
topic no I'm not I mean of course I'm
sad but I'm not in that place right now
yeah I'm not I'm not that place I'll be
back at that place I'm sure I mean this
is like a merry-go-round right that for
me it was like it was like six six solid
months before but then after that the
weird thing is it turned around and all
the dreams I had about my mom were like
super positive and I did conversations
with her in my dreams and I wake up and
be happy and it was it was weird I'd
like it completely turned the other
direction for me being sad and like
really missing her just kind of being
like it's like she's still around I
don't really notice she's gone but yeah
I talked to I talked to Nick at the
funeral in the after we call it
after-party because my dad was my dad
was very strict but he never he didn't
get very many wishes in terms of his
funeral he just all he said was he
wanted his honours he's like I earned my
honors I want my honours dammit give me
my honours right that's all I cared
about
fair enough and the other thing was I
don't want people wearing black and
being sad I want a party I want a party
with balloons a jumper and hula hoops
and that's what we had we had balloons
jumpers and hula hoops and fifties music
playing that's awesome so yeah and we
had and we had like more food than
anyone could eat but yeah so yeah that's
that's I mean what does it say about a
guy who demands that at his party his
death be a party right yeah I remember
my Nana was the same way when she went
she's like she even told me which is
live she's like I'm not gonna be around
forever when I go you guys better get to
rather have a party and if one tear
comes out of your face you're getting
booted the hell out of there yeah and
Shane they said that they actually made
the pastor say that when he said I'm
friend he's like if I see any you crying
I have to kick you out so don't cry
and we were like you're not serious
right bro I'm kind of surprised that I'm
kind of reading through chat here I'm
surprised so many people are demanding
we talk about tech that means they've
never watched a Tech Talk
they have never watched the Tech Talk
I'm thinking that they've heard rumors
maybe this is like a second generation
like the children or grandchildren these
are the people the knew of tech talk if
you learn anything even says Tech Talk
on a title is because let's be honest
since you want me to get you guys in
here total click mate Jay is teaching me
how to how to be a better youtuber right
when you have
- use your ended series as a clickbait
right sure true story Jay Oh your dad
passed as the defender says my dad
passed begin of the year but he was
never a part of my life living on the
other side of the country's so it's hard
to miss him well that see that now
that's sad I'm sorry they're right and I
feel bad because I don't stay in touch
might my dad's like lives right down
next to you and I don't talk to him
twice a year yeah uh so what we thought
we might do though because I have screen
capture set up here to it I thought we
might talk about the last five years
because the Tech Talk really is five
years old as well I started that stream
when I had like 200 steps and I know
there any with the exception of the
drunk streams maybe we'll revisit some
of those I mean that's kind of a snippet
so those are fun but most were quite
good requested streams hands down yeah
I'm wondering uh what do you have any
memorable moments that stand out to you
I don't know me being like having more
subs than you for like three years
when you started as a bigger channel
that's probably my most memorable moment
oh and when you passed me those moments
you know so you jokingly like when I
fucking mirror when I when I had when
okay so you hit a hundred hundred
thousand subs when I was still at like
60 or something like that right 50 or 60
some of that I can't remember who was
like you you were you were ahead of me
when we were in the teens I remember
that yeah I had like twenty and you had
like 17 and then I think I was the first
one to get my plaque so yeah I think I
hit 100k before you went on PKA which
give you a huge bump yep that would that
actually is true it did and then you
know you just you just continued a
pretty steady trajectory of just a
different than your path than I did yeah
but I remember one night there was a
point where I started to catch catchy
like my daily numbers were surpassing
yours but I was still behind you and
overall right mind you envy you yes and
I've ever when I passed you in views
you're like whatever bro let's race to a
million like you wanted to race so badly
I'd I refused to race you because I knew
the moment it became a race I would
probably lose I know I'm the lucky one
it was like instantly erase not a race
until I won like dude what happened what
happened cuz I think I think it was like
the date was it the day that you passed
me that we had there was a Tech Talk or
the Skype call or whatever and you're
like yes I'm in the lead and you ain't
ever gonna catch me yeah
we're gonna catch me I was like just
watch me J you ain't ever gonna kiss
relievers is like like a mural I was
like yeah I ran out of gas I ran out of
gas
uh III hate the competition though I
really I love the competition in terms
of like if we're on the racetrack and
stuff like that but I don't like the
competition of racing other channels to
success because that means and the other
person is not having the same level of
success and that bothers me and whatever
one I noticed succeed in be heavy that's
true sure well said I just I'm one of
those people where I always do better
work like you when I work to my cousin
always did better work when I had
somebody who was pushing me uh-huh
somebody was pushing me in so I don't
see it so much as a competition it's
like I see it kind of is like a
challenge mm-hmm but it's like that
person is challenging me like I need to
do something and I don't know what the
hell went wrong with me but something
got wired backwards at once some point
it had nothing to do with you you know
words you know I were yeah I just I
sabotage myself at some point I don't
know why I honestly I look back on and I
try to think about it over and over
again and make every excuse in the book
but I'm like no I just straight-up
sabotage myself but now now it's one of
those things once you realize it then
you're like oh man okay I'm just gonna
do something about it if I'm trying to
figure it out it doesn't matter why it
happened I just need to fix it and for
the record I'm not crying
I have a cold it's cold okay I know
cryin was crying crying I almost did I
almost did cry though I'm talking about
ceremony pushing really hard working and
you get they get a paint here I've had
the paint here I know it's kind of like
me pulling nose hair that's true so you
know what you know what actually as far
as like favorite moments like going back
even not not even necessarily like Tech
Talk was like the first time I met you
in person like when I flew down there
you know you know get the whole ninja
cat thing that was that was pretty funny
I have rewatched that that video that
vlog you did it for you coming down here
like probably five or six times in the
last few months you know you think I'm
over here hating on you but I'm actually
secretly watching the content you're
putting up once every six weeks
hey I didn't think you were hating on me
I knew a hundred percent sure you're
hating on me until you told me otherwise
you didn't catch that backhanded that
backhanded compliment come on I said I
wanted content you put up every once
every six weeks every six weeks come on
I put up a video a week now man I'm
catching up man I'm catch it up catching
up to what nothing
I'm looking at the views right now
45,000 views and everybody's angry that
I could be a hamburger on a Bible how
did I go for technology and 3d printing
to cooking a burger on a Bible I would
have just used that opportunity to say
holy shit and as often as I could
somebody somebody said that I cooked the
holy shit out of that burger and another
guy was like the blow-dryer didn't do
anything it was the book the hell fires
burnin that burger oh my god I was funny
baby always you have the dislike ratio
that's probably worst of it even you
have ever done why you didn't just like
just unwrap the burger and point the
dryer at it and hold it there you know
what I think you come down to is if I'm
completely honest I think I was at the
point where I was just kind of getting
bitter and I was just being self
sabotaging like you know just whatever
fuck I'm just gonna make whatever I want
and see what happens you know and no you
knew the second grab the Bible with
exactly no I knew I knew it so it's not
like I was shocked or anything no no I I
knew that that was a really edgy move
and that was probably gonna cause a
ripple of shit because a lot of people
to follow me you know our our religious
people and so yeah so yeah that's on me
that's on me but I still thought it was
funny as hell so if I could do it again
though I'd probably use the Quran or
like the Torres no then you're
interested a holy war man somebody said
you wouldn't do it the Quran I was like
a what if they had it was in the drawer
it's like head cut off and I was like oh
wait probably right so I figured I'd
start off memory lane with the last
drunk talk I just sort of skipped ahead
and it's I skip to the part where you
were like mid-sentence and then passed
out while talking it's so about the last
one the last word you like oh you know
it's funny I haven't watched that back
since we shot it I remember the part I
remember the part well I only remember
because I rewatched it where you were
like you were talking about manju you
passed my generators oh good then you
were like help me help me help me and
you were falling off the couch that's
how you're being in that I thought
you're being metaphorical saying help
you like grow your channel so I just
watched you fall off the couch I don't
even remember this I would say it back
play a bag I wish I was away from me to
share my screen with you at the same
time here no no just give me the time
index it's like they do on PKA just give
me the time index and we'll just start
on the mark
the part ride disappeared in the net oh
yeah there's Riley put my face in the
camera my wife took over hold on I gotta
find this final episode dude oh my god

the hook but we got destroyed cuz I
didn't drink remember I told you I
didn't drink for a long time before that

like I just keep making videos and
you're like this let's go off the couch

so I fast forwarded to bars so I
literally fell off the couch mm-hmm yeah

yelling help help help and I thought you
were being like helped me with my
channel so I realize you were falling

problem is all these tech talks have the
same like thumbnails so someone's gonna

shirt so far - Cleese following someone
someone's gonna find that I know
barnacle Oh 122 somebody said it was as
122 long Jonah okay 122 Jerry
oh well it's called Jerry fell down on
stream so we're very intuitive our
naming conventions here all right on
that full screen this guy no-go theater
mode make it bigger all right that way
with a little cameras bigger all right
three type X no where's the time it has
already ate it was in the beginning
wasn't it I think so all right so just
start at the beginning call it it was
like after the intro all right okay and
play on three two one go
I'm walking into the room okay that's
right because you started the stream
elevator
this guy will learn to take a piss
before I'm ready to start the deck
during life hey for the record I did
learn you but I not take a piss before
the stream tonight a little bit early
today I don't want to give anyone the
opportunity to start yelling late
according to this it's still got few
minutes yeah look at that they just went
live with a minute 47 on the countdown I
didn't even have my FS alive yet then no
you did not wash your answer dude I can
take no no I didn't wanna hang on
because I didn't have to touch my penis
like pissing on the sea isn't on the rim
no tire ation of the hips and then when
you get it right I kind of do this thing
where I like stand up on my tiptoes a
couple times really fast and it kind of
gives me this shrieking action but it's
all like just on your knees now a little
bit I don't care I know why I mean you
actually made like a giant funnel for
your toilet seat that's a good fun you
see my awesome add a video it's like a
pressure washer yeah I remember I
respond to it looked like poop until you
showed your expanding would do wait wait
was that on the video or is that on the
picture I was on a picture yeah I didn't
turn it on they shoots across the whole
bathroom and you know that hits the door
I respond I got rid of that thing by the
way that thing's poster I think sure you
saw the video because that was like the
pressure on that thing is epic I did in
another layout of your house if that
door was open it no your kitchen
it actually banged off the door like
halfway down the hallway and I had to
sew it up with the towel and that's how
babies amazing Joe this is tech jack
hundred and twenty-two Jerry almost died
but you can't kill a cockroach
Olympic long jump
it's like I would imagine I'll let you
tell us it's gonna start tonight with a
little bit of card you're about to eat
your air conditioners really love that
sir
I oh here we go you baited me down hard
[Laughter]
yeah you're showing them the bruising
you ate your ribs hit the ground I hit
Martin I couldn't catch Rizzo my feet or
my hands sideways and I fell woman's
other other than me eating shit i'ma
find right here at 2:30 fourth where you
show the bruise on the pole here Gerry
landed on the ground so hard yourself
like a huge bro that was best fit sub D
mo subdermal hippie to ginger dude that
was a bad one that was a durable
hepatitis right there that shit took
like a month the hill oh my god jeez
what happened is J can attest to this
he's always shit all over the floor so
one of the light poles was laying across
the floor and I hooked my foot under it
I couldn't get my foot out so I just
carried the weight forward and then I
couldn't put my arms
down because they were caught so I had
to twist place all sideways just go down
on my side it's basically if you're a
cyclist it's the equivalent of falling
without being able to clip out here once
you tell everybody about how I did that
when I went on a bike ride what's up
everyone Jesus - since here because that
wasn't that wasn't on video we didn't
get that on video did we no but I
there was a vlog in one of these videos
where you it was on the sidebar it was
the vlog you made and you actually
showed like your knee was all scraped up
you went over the handlebars like you
was yeah yet when it happened to us I
was falling you guys crust was like the
busiest intersection of your town like
six lanes and my shoelace that you told
me to tuck in got caught around the
spindle and it tied me to the thing and
then it locked up and I went over there
and Nick was laughing so hard because it
was the slowest motion thing ever I'll
try to balance the bike before going
over and I just went down on my knee
alright so I'm to the right of you and
and you're a little bit behind me right
yeah so we're crossing the intersection
and all I hear is oh shit shit look
you're just like in slow motion like
kind of doing the splits yeah as you
were like kind of like spider-man in the
position he's in when he's like
web-slinging on the handlebars with your
legs were going up as the bike was going
over it was pretty funny actually and
then and then Nick's like get out of the
intersection yeah there's light turned
green and I'm still sitting out in the
middle of everybody all tangled up on my
foot so Jerry basically does the whole
like I can't believe that just happened
and like kind of like lays down the
street like hahahaha he's laughing and
the light turns green and you're in the
middle of the intersection hold on sorry
alright no it looks like everything's
okay so far all right oh that was scary
okay everything's good everything's good
so far you know what'd be funny what's
that I'm just gonna type in know where I
can do that I don't wanna give I don't
wanna give red at the satisfaction of
having legitimacy in terms of like what
we think about it but I think it'd be
funny to read like angry rate posts
about us if you don't you just do the
next best thing you've just read the
YouTube comments that's always fun oh
god I should read the YouTube comments
on today's video there you go let's do
it let's go
then we'll go read the ones on my Bible
burning baby oh so this is one of my
most disliked videos in a long long time
it's over 10% dislike so I had reviewed
now actually it wasn't a review it was a
sponsored video about Intel obtained and
you know it's funny as everyone was mad
everyone's mad about me like Intel shale
Intel shows that I think live evil
Seagate that actually paid for it but
anyway the blazing past budget-friendly
video which one is it yeah and that's
not my title by the way I told them that
was like the worst title ever but you
know they worried that size corporations
don't understand SEO because that's like
terrible SEO but anyway Intel obtained
doesn't make much sense at least for the
money that was a pretty straightforward
comment Seagate sells the finest
short-term storage you can buy unless
Westar digital green then it's even
shorter
oh man bias much in your last video you
talked about SSD prices coming down down
okay downs for 140 bucks you can
definitely grab some Samsung 500
gigabyte SSD plus you have to have
obtained capable mobo and CPU that's not
bias this is an ax bias how is this bias
it just says J you just have accept it
okay well then people said that you have
to accept it then I guess holy shit but
Oscar just bought you you have to take
him to dinner now it's mx-5 its MX 50
which i think is mexico's a nice hose
that mechoso that's like three cents I
think it's like three dollars
no I don't know I really don't know
please buy me a taco just treat him
nicely you know when you look at new
Taiwanese dollars or TWU DS or NW DS
whatever it is NT died November anyway
it looks like a lot right cuz it's like
you go to Starbucks know like that'll be
$42 you're like what
yeah or you go to Japan or whatever it
is I'll be seventy two million yen here
like oh shit Starbucks coffee oh my god
let's see here J up until now you're
sponsored content was okay be it that
big LG TV or the kids toy for Little J
but the 16 gigabyte Intel obtained is
utter nonsense we have seen the concept
in the past with small SSDs including
hybrid drives instead of octane and it
didn't work out and then the same thing
happening with obtain in its current
state it's a bad joke and nobody cares
about it despite the Intel's
our campaign trying to drum up interest
up until the point this is a long
comment long comment much oh my god up
until the point obtained becomes
something like persistent ramen or L for
cash it won't be relevant with its
premium price point for consumers some
special edge cases aside hope you retain
refrain from further such sponsored
content as I said there was nothing
wrong with the pieces you did in the
past there was anything wrong with them
until it like worked him you know you
know what that guy should do is he
basically already wrote an entire script
a video he should go make it oh wow I
love this response I love this response
he said this response says you have some
gall telling someone what sponsored
content they should and should not run
he was paid to run this and he has to
provide for a family if you don't like
to present a tech just move along well
played well played thank you for
defending did you J do you sell older
broken parts I love the comments that
are like like a P o box and please send
your parts here that you were no longer
using what I should take like a 1080 T I
break it on camera and then offer it to
him for like Twitter buzz oh this is a
good one Michael Michael he said hey I
got a joke Intel's motivation oh my
goodness I'm so glad yeah so but it
wasn't just it was it was a cosponsor
video between Intel and Seagate so let's
see Jays two cents van fans hit like
help me to reach 1k subs oh this guy's
like companies chillin chillin like a
villain I think people are missing the
point of what obtain is and yeah it's
not the first thing of its kind but it
people were actually questioning the
legitimacy of my tests well all of my
tests are on video by the way they're
not in the video but all of my tests are
on video so I do have video backup of
showing what the timings were but yeah I
mean opt in I think it's a neat thing
people just hate it cuz it's Intel if it
was if it was 30 bucks and it was like a
DJ I don't be like yeah this is cool but
the moment Intel's name is on everyone
just loses their shit true but I will
agree I will agree that it really sucks
them to take advantage of obtained that
you are shoehorned into a 7th gen Intel
CPU
you know in new Intel motherboard and
and I don't see why this couldn't be
backwards compatible but that is a
little weird
but I mean it's done again a sales
tactic right I mean is there anything
relevant in the chipset that's required
that it actually utilize or is it
literally just a soft block according to
Intel's like all of their marketing and
technical info they claim that there's
proprietary stuff in the two in the in
the 200 series chipset that's required
but then again I mean how am I gonna
verify that true sure I guess there's no
way you really can let's see oh this is
a good point too I was interested just
until the point that he said on your OS
drive only where he's referring to where
I said octane can only accelerate your
OS drive right so if you have more than
one drive in your system and it's only
gonna accelerate the one I was just
interested in to the point where you
said your OS drive only there's a lot of
people who use an SSD is a primary drive
and HDD as a secondary drive it would be
interesting to have that one get a boost
don't get me wrong I think it's still
kind of good product just not the best
way for many users out there you know
then why is it only one thing gets a
boost or why does only one opt-in drive
get a boost that's weird you mean why
it's only one hard drive get boosted by
obtain yeah I don't know I don't know
that's really bizarre so they said the
funny thing is they if they really
wanted to showcase like obtains full
potential they would have sent me the 32
gig memory module but they sent me the
16 gig and the thing is like even in
their own software there's some features
and statistical data that you can't even
track because it says you need a 32 gig
module to even track it so it was weird
they sent me one that was like not even
like the full potential of what it could
be but I think I think people are just
really really angry obviously because
it's Intel and because you're forced
into a chipset people are already kind
of mad at so so you guys that's why you
should watch my tech review see
completely unbiased cuz I'm too lazy get
sponsorships and I don't review tech the
cool time eeeeenh I mean here's what you
understand should we talk about content
creation side we should we should
absolutely I think people need to
understand what sponsorship means with
the amount of people who and continue to
find ways to block the amount of like
the revenue we can create through ad
blah
and other and other things right it's
impossible to live on ad revenue now it
just is they I have no choice but to
take this type of sponsored content and
I would do another piece of sponsored
content just like this again if I had to
because this this keeps the lights
turned on this makes up for a lot of
buffer in terms of how long I can
operate with the kind of you know the
sponsorship opportunities that exist
with large corporations the sad part is
I wouldn't feel the necessity to
continue to do sponsorships like this if
it wasn't for the fact that I actually
see the numbers of how many views I get
and how much I get paid based on the
views and how many of those views were
monetizable and I think people don't
realize that that ad blocking continues
to grow which means mass as the channels
continue to grow the revenue continues
to fall yeah it's like dental is bigger
than ever and yet the revenue is lower
than it's been like a lot of people
wonder why the little tech channels and
stuff are like starting to fail and go
under well like the big you know huge
ones are there and it's because they are
they will take the sponsorships they
will do the things that they need to do
to keep the lights on they will continue
to grow whereas the other guys are like
you know oh no I'm not gonna be a
sellout and then they're like channels
just dead like that but the thing is
look at the first line in your video
description this video is sponsored by
Seagate Intel to learn more about into
opt-in content like that you're not
hiding shit no I have to I mean FCC
regulation I have to put it all right
but I'm saying but I'm saying that alone
right there the fact that you're saying
straight up that it's sponsored that
sponsor yeah it's a commercial people
need to treat it as such they have to
salute it absolutely is a sponsored
piece of content I don't know if I'd
call it as much a commercial as it was
like for me it was more or less claimed
verifying but there's no you're not
gonna find this being a review I did not
say this is a great product you should
go buy it what I said was if you want to
learn more about this product go to the
links below one guy was like this is
stupid it was just a 90 minute
commercial it's like I said in the first
30 seconds that it's a sponsored piece
of content I said at the end of this
video thank you for sponsoring today's
video at once again I even said in the
content and above the fold this is a
sponsored piece of content that just
shows how narrow view people have they
don't pay attention to the reason said
they don't pay attention to what's on
the screen I mean I have to happen to me
you've even seen that before happen to
me where people say oh this just looks
like a commercial and it's something I
completely bought out of pocket it did
myself like which one was that
the phantom3 see the faith number three
or in phantom4 video one of the things
did everything this was like a 90 minute
commercial cuz that bull air edit it and
they made it like really cool cinematic
effects and everything but it's like
that entire video is on my own time okay
that was not paid for by anybody and
everybody was like oh it was just a
commercial and I kind of felt bad about
it cuz I was like you guy is like no
this isn't a commercial it's actually a
product I like but nobody believes it
cuz the editing is too good I'm gonna
see if I can go in and fix the audio for
you because it's like way I just think
now I don't understand that only happens
when we're live-streaming right I mean
if I just talk to you on skype that
doesn't happen but it's happening so I
got to go into the main mixer needs me
well while you're fixing me I'll read
some of my awesome contents from my
cooking food for the blow dryer tissue
box and Bible in the hotel room let's
see here large purses okay this is
awesome Isaac said large person smacking
their mouth while eating resembles a
four-legged animal with a snout and
usually thought of as pink if it weren't
for the glasses I think I'd confuse the
two good grief that is actually a well
thought out troll you know I'm gonna go
ahead and thumbs up that one that was
awesome let's see here Alex said this is
the content we need no that's a good
comment
hold on here David said you should try
not eating that shit and go on a fucking
diet okay all thumbs up that one oh this
is a good one what the fuck was this
video show more hits like button oh my
God where were you when I was a starving
college Stephen okay that's not bad
let's see here come on Jerry we can do
this at home where we gonna find a hotel
room tissue box of the Bible okay we ran
this part though I just added a 100 I
decided a 100 millisecond offset to your
video so everyone give it some time but
we'll see if that fixes or not does this
look better now
all right listen Cinco I'm saying Jay
move sorry you look you look totally
frozen there is what I would I love I
know I'm still reading some of the
comments on octane and I really should
stop because I just make me mad it just
makes me frustrated that people don't
that people can't think like one guy was
calling out like your explanations
complete and utter bullshit until
watched it and approved it until watched
an approved until watching an approved
mics
dumb down version of what octane does
and they came back and they were like
yes this this this is fine and yet this
guy said you know this is utter bullshit
the cup well usually the results River
bullshit or come out of bad testing
methodology explanation and it goes into
like a really nerdy like I have no life
and I'm smart you should listen to me
type of explanation ya know that's you
get a lot of know-it-all so you
definitely in the funny thing is you
always click on the shit that's like
they never made a video before it's like
come on if you you much go make a damn
video yourself yeah and we all make
mistakes that's other things just
because you have we actually you and I
talked about this on the phone the other
day is that people expect because you
have a studio and great camera lighting
equipment all the stuff cuz that's your
craft you love doing and like a lot of
people don't realize you don't do that
cuz you have to you do I've known Jay
long enough to know that they're easily
does color correction he's method a
methodical with his lighting and stuff
is because you enjoy that that's an art
form to you ya see that it but when
people see that what's the first
conclusion that they draw is that you're
an expert and infallible because
everything looks so good and it's so
perfect they assume you got like this
team of fact-checking people and you're
a genius luck you know it's like hmm I
think that's an expectation that I don't
see as much but I even I see you and my
shitty set and garbage on the floor and
Kleenex wadded up on my desk but anyways
that's that's what I'm saying is people
look at that and they're like this guy's
perfect same thing with with Linus they
look a Linus's video any time you make
some mistake the terrible part I want to
I want to respond to a comment in Chad
right here it says J your average member
of society is a complete moron so you
should probably just ignore most
commenters here's the thing what's the
most common thing we get Jerri ignore
the haters right yeah what don't respond
to the hate don't feed they only respond
to the support but you know what you
can't find the support of comments
without reading through the hate
comments - yeah so which one's hit you I
know and it's a big cop-out to be like
you know the hate comments hit you
harder it doesn't I mean it affects me
my Newt lis very small like it might it
might cause a slight hiccup in my mood
but then I move on pretty quickly I'm so
I have so much more experience in
handling this than any commenter right
but is it the frustrating part is like
you you're trying to make a channel
that's here to educate entertain and
then people just want to shit all over
it because you did something they didn't
like or whatever and and it's said that
every even-even a lot of the supporters
this this is true for them too though a
lot of people think like you need to
take their comment their comment to
heart and you need to make changes based
on their comment
here's the sad part and guys this is
true for me as well for the channels I
watch and I support no one's a single
comment means anything
no one's single comment not mine not
yours not Jerry's no one comment means
anything to the big picture in any of
this not one hater
not one supporter not one guy that's
gonna sit there and write the book
telling you why you're wrong none of
those mean anything in a singular form
it's when the entire mass moves as a
herd based on the the changing landscape
you make a change in your channel over
three five ten weeks you noticed a
decline in growth a decline in views you
know as a whole you made the wrong
decision but you can't listen to that
one person or that one small group of
people telling you know this sucks don't
do that I hate this stop polishing your
videos you know because you you it's
impossible to derive any sort of
conclusion out of a singular comment
regardless of how well do well together
that put together is I don't know who's
always gonna be the one comment those
don't affect us when you see the one
comment where it's like a bunch of
possum there's something I kill yourself
fatty or whatever it's like that doesn't
that doesn't bother me what bothers me
is when I look at it you see everybody
else attaching to it and you see that
herd mentality where it's like more
people than you think yeah should are
starting to support that you're like
well that's kind of a weird that doesn't
make any sense to me and that's that's
when it gets you thinking too much about
it when you shouldn't be one rate says 1
million followers hard to please
everyone guys it's hard to do that with
a hundred followers it's hard to do that
especially hard to deal with a thousand
and once you get above those types of
numbers there are a thousand five
thousand ten thousand it's impossible
and then in it and it's look I mean this
is this is the same for myself this is
why I don't comment on videos so I don't
get feedback because I personally vote
with my like or dislike button or my
subscribe that's how I vote when I like
a channel or don't like a channel and
it's sad but the truth is no one comment
or no one person's opinion means
anything in this now not one ounce of
weight to it it has to be a collective
and the problem is the collective the
collective comments the collective
comments themselves don't even give you
much weight it's the collective like
dislike envy ratio that's what it is
you know and
when it comes down to the professional
aspect like the succeed or fail of it
but but my problem is I still let some
of the comments get to me and that's
that's where I'm going wrong that's
where you've always been but you've
always been way better at handling that
stuff than I am because the part you see
you know it's funny as people swore when
I was a smaller channel like June you're
such an asshole to your audience you're
never gonna go anywhere I'm not an
asshole to my audience I just don't take
the bullshit
I don't I've never been a I don't take
the bullshit I never have and so people
get mad that when someone tries to like
be extremely disrespectful or whatever
that I that I take the opportunity to
slap them across their face digitally
and let everyone know that that person
was just smacked I need to go sit in the
corner and sit down I take advantage of
that because that makes me feel better
about the situation and it sounds really
bully esque right but it's not the guy
comes in Jay you're a big fat ass and
it's like yeah well you know you just
got to fucking your sister so why who
you're gonna judge me you know it's
hurts
it's one of those things where it's like
that makes me feel better honestly and
and if that bothers people's they swore
that my channel would never go anywhere
and you know a lot of people been
replaced with people who love that about
me so what should what should I do
right yeah I'm no I'm reading that now
it's coming so dance up from Jerry
because he takes key takes constructive
criticism as people being haters he's
alright on here but J with J but he's
painful to watch on his own days even if
he makes a video but the funny thing is
I've seen you be way harsher some people
I mean maybe not today maybe not done
eighth I don't think he's probably out
of maybe had a bad experience with me in
the comments I'm guessing that's
probably where it stems from but it's
why those things maybe he just had a bad
experience with me and he didn't have it
with you but no it's actually love
constructive criticism when it's
actually constructive and given in a
polite and respectful format and I
always think it's the people they give
it
Lamine away from the computer for a
second to prove a point
I agree back do it alright he's gonna go
there so Nate I'm sorry if I disagreed
with what you considered constructive
feedback I apologize I apologize for
that you should come back at 70 bro
and see me cook food on a Bible let's
see here Lexie Miller subscribed to
Jake's likes likes your videos if I was
silly enough to presume you should make
your own videos how I want they wouldn't
be your videos anymore that is a
fantastic point Lexie okay I'm back
alright I'm gonna play some points
the webcam so down here is my studio I
don't know if you guys can make it out
but on the table is chof no I'm trying
to show that we have not torn down set
for a video we did that video that
budget build video and people got really
mad and then I didn't use particular
parts I would have been better suited so
i spent another 160 bucks of my own
money to get the parts to redo that
video because enough people in the
audience through adult ways of
communication we're able to convince me
that that video need to be redone so I
kept the set together didn't tear it
down spent another hundred and sixty
bucks on a video I've already spent over
a thousand dollars to make and I'm doing
it again because the audience convinced
me to do that now the audience would
love to say I don't take criticism and
I'm just like no I'm right you're wrong
whatever if that were true I wouldn't
been that now is that because you were
getting so much feedback is it that like
you were saying the herd mentality like
except now that people said it the yeah
this or there's something here you
recognized enough people said it in a
manner at which it got my attention to
listen to them not you know you you
fucking idiot you did this wrong with
the fuck's wrong with you like that I'll
never listen to that that guy can go can
go bury himself in a hole I'll never
care right but the next people were like
Jay this video was really well done but
I feel like it could've been better if
he used these parts because this is a
better budget which allows this and this
and enough people said that to where I
went out and that same day the video
went live I had to order it on Amazon
for the parts I needed to redo it
gotcha well I've all you know me I've
always owned my mistakes I leave them
all in I've intentionally even during
editing videos left mistakes in just
because it made sense to the story and
hopefully somebody learned but just like
you I mean you drilled holes your fuckin
motherboard is how much shit did you
catch for that I got a lot of people a
lot of times a great video by the way I
got a lot of people that try to accuse
me that I always try to put my best foot
forward I try to make myself look like
I'm better than I am but yet I put that
shit in videos all the time someone says
Jerry typing in chat without using was
Hansel's like I use my penis Jerry you
lost weight way to go no I didn't do but
thanks I'll take the way to go so it's
something else to that there's the
coolant that I showed off which is back
and your penis looks really weird all
your
ya know so uh yeah Knicks computer back
there which has the green coolant in it
enough people convinced me that it looks
like boogers that I changed the color
scheme on my own system that I was gonna
use it in so I actually have it so it's
in your best interest right to change if
enough people call it out right but you
have an audience your audience wants a
certain thing that makes sense as a
business my only point smart my only
point is that one guy let's just let's
just say let's just say Peter Peter
Peter sitting in the corner typing on
his MacBook no one would be mad with
Matt typing on his laptop all the
reasons why I need to do what he says I
need to do means nothing you know Peter
Peter is in a singular form means
nothing but 5,000 Peters have strengths
know that does makes it that absolutely
said that's why it's important that
people constructively present their
criticism
allow me to find another so what you're
saying is if I get a comment that says
hey fat-ass kill yourself I want to look
and see if as 750 likes and if it does
then I should probably consider it you
know you know here's here's another
complaint to have about YouTube is they
used to show the number of dislikes on a
comments as well that may have had 500
likes but it might have had 5,000
dislikes yeah why do they even have a
thumbs down button on comments when it
doesn't count anymore it used to count
you know what used to happen like a
negative cow right like they do on like
reddit right well what used to happen
was it weighed them so if it got if it
got 20 likes but 30 dislikes it would
show negative 10 right and that makes
sense and they even unlike reddit it
disappears right one point like I think
I feels like negative eight or something
it's not even in there yes what used to
happen to on YouTube is enough people
downloaded a comment it got immediately
moved into the spam filter like it would
be removed and listed as spam that
doesn't happen anymore YouTube allows
all of the stupid comments to continue
which is why I like first is still a
things enough people with download first
first but no longer well dude I think
YouTube honestly thrives on heat I think
YouTube has figured out that the people
that engage the most the people that
produce the most SEO are people that are
verbal and people that are vocal the
best way to get somebody vocals either
make them really happy or really pissed
off right and that's why I feel YouTube
doesn't really do a lot of things like
I've reported comments before like I've
actually reported a comment forward a
guy literally said kill yourself yeah
and they were like oh this is within the
guidelines of YouTube or whatever blah
blah while we didn't remove the comment
I'm like are you shitting me
yeah so I honestly think that like goo
it's like I want to fault them for it
but at the same time it's like I do
understand that their business model is
driven on traffic right they sell ads
the company's based on how many people
are presumably gonna watch them and
interact with them and all that waiting
all it all comes down to people having
to interact in the best way do P get
people to interact is to piss them off
the drama channels they had to reweighed
the entire system because every single
one of the top channels on YouTube is a
drama channel but what I love is if you
look if you look at those drama channels
though you look at their growth they've
completely stalled and stagnate oh
they're dying yeah yeah YouTube changed
the whole algorithm it's fucking them
all like right now I'm trying to find an
example of a oh one more thing though
but why is it that that's happening now
and that's because the advertisers found
out their content was running on those
videos oh they didn't like it they
pulled out they hit him in their wallet
that's it they hit him in the wall
that's the only time that YouTube's like
oh we didn't know this shit was going on
of course they knew it was going on that
was part of the entire plan to sell
those ads and get those videos yeah ah
you're saying I'm trying to find an
example of like a constructive comment
versus a comment that may had actually
been correct or true but worded in such
a way that nobody's gonna take it
serious I'm trying but that's probably
not gonna be in here because I have a
pretty good filter on my YouTube
comments where a lot of the stuff that's
a super derogatory and least is not even
shown yeah yeah a lot of people are
agreeing they're seeing drama channels
make money they do they absolutely do
and then the funny thing is once the
once the money dries up for those drama
channels they usually either one go away
or two they start doing like the
sponsorships and everything like
everybody else yeah and there's not a
lot of companies that want to do
sponsorship whether like geek geek fuel
or whatever's the only one I know that
will do sponsorships like hit we feel
they would sponsor Hitler they sponsor
likeness I'm just saying they sponsor
alliances to win show so it's like they
just they just go where the views are
anybody anybody we don't care who the
view is they just want to be they they
are they're of the mindset and this is
probably a little bit I think this is
probably a decent mindset to have though
is that eyeballs or eyeballs they are
yeah well yeah if you look at it from
marketing perspective it's all a numbers
game right so they don't you know they
don't care if it's a serial killer or a
fourteen-year-old person that's bad as
mom living in the basement trying to
yell
people over the internet it's a muse of
you yeah I guess I'm actually not
finding to me I think there's not a lot
of hate comments on this video the
opt-in video a lot of people click this
like on it but they're not just I think
very few of those dislikes are people
disliking like my video they're just
disliking yeah the product you know and
I kind of hate that like the like and
dislike button shouldn't be about
whether I like or dislike this product
but I guess it would be a good way to
like I guess may way that um man this is
a throwback here your vlog for you
whatever you very first came to my house
tons of comments on my video though
didn't appreciate you using the Bible
why'd you have to use the Bible Cheney
is the Bible this is disrespectful to
the Bible okay oh this is good one I
don't give a shit if it's disrespect
most funny SL Wow okay
see that single comment had weight your
diet is going great I see like I told
every I've been on diet like six months
but everybody still comes in and
comments and you always click on them
and they're always something like you
know massive workout fitness lift five
thousand-pound channel come watch now
bra wow I I pinned I pinned of my own
comment why pay my own comic most of the
time now I used to pin like like the
cleverest comment but then it's a bunch
of people begging for pins so I just
stop pinning people but I depend comment
on my video was it's me pinning myself
in the comment was I pinned this comment
to make myself feel better
that's three point three three point
three thousand likes nice no nice G man
says you're sweating profusely while
eating junk food just wow and I just
reply back and I said yeah and you're
watching it you're gay that made me feel
better
that made me feel better oh oh here we
go
the how not to unbox the Red River
people got so mad at me because they
because I dropped it but I dropped it
because AMD did a very poor job at
letting you know which order to take the
Box apart in I wasn't the only one to
drop it either other people drop it it's
funny I drop it apparently I'm being
disrespectful of the hardware that
people can't afford to eat in Africa now
people people are just like appreciate
to bitch about I guess I guess that's
the biggest takeaway from this whole
thing is just I mean people want
attention and they want to complain
right and if they can't get attention
one way they try to get attention
another way
so I get people to come into your live
stream and they're like yeah kick penis
dig dig dig penis there like somebody
please acknowledge me I'm coming here
there are 12 other accounts they didn't
get acknowledged with nice comments so
I'm just gonna use the bad ones bad ones
what's up Louise
I see so someone said I don't get it
he's mad at Thermaltake but when intel
bribed a whole market off not a single
boycott kind of having two standards to
standards in it and what about nvidia
doing codes in games to her AMD
performance with tessellation first of
all that's not true again something with
two standards so you see if you're going
to be a guy boycotting bad behavior then
please don't don't cherry-pick as it
will make you look silly and biased but
you know what those dude your commenters
are like like scholars what's her like
like 3 page like dissertations they'll
send a comment they all sniff their own
farts yeah my guys are like fuck you
kill yourself fatty that's it one
sentence nice and clean maybe operators
but because you're overweight it's a
very easy attack to go to so that's the
go-to for everybody yeah and I just go
eat a cheeseburger and it makes me feel
better
anyway Oh chat was like flying had to
catch up so I haven't mentioned this I
haven't mentioned as publicly but I
wanna I want to mention something
publicly you ready I don't know should
you maybe and I remember maybe I already
did I don't know you don't ever talk
online anymore you just you just hit

me of trying to like oversell the bad
boxing experience no ask my wife asked
Nick I can't open I can't open up a
fucking frozen burrito okay
I'm telling I can't open the package for
a frozen burrito to save my life Nick

though like as a boss you're just like
no no he knows so here's the thing Nick
insisted on taking over and I was like
no and he was like you needed to do
learn how to do this I said Nick snow
here's the thing when you're when you're
good at a lot of things all right I'm
and I'm good at a lot of things that
most people are good at things but I'm
good at a lot of things I'm good at
building computers I'm good at usually
playing games I'm good at I'm decent at
driving people who are good at a lot of
things have to have something simple
that they simply suck at and you know
where I embrace the fact that I cannot
open a damn package to save my life you
should see the way open cereal there's
cereal boxes I can't open it without
ripping the lid no I have seen that you
are rather rather Hulk ish when opening
things yeah I like a bear try to get
into the food box there is nothing

I just said apparently oh okay yeah yeah
so this I'm gonna learn man I'm gonna
learn how to do this that's funny that's
funny so yeah matter Chad man why do I
have a problem sir Merle take everyone
ask who I have a problem with
thermaltake well it goes back like
almost four years now like three years
over three be fair that they do make
amazing replicas of other people's
products it comes down to something very
very simple okay I'm gonna tell the
story again we actually did this on a
Tech Talk like a long time ago we talked
to dad well it's been like ages ago
well people forgot or maybe they've just
never they weren't around um okay so
there were two cases that Thermaltake
blatantly stole design cues from first
of that being the defined r5 thermaltake
made a case that came it was called that
was a literal copy of the define r5 they
even like copied the 3d video that for
that fractal design made and their ever
in their advertising like campaign they
they copied that shit even the video the
Attic was the same exact video type
right yeah and so Thermaltake basically
was like they put it on an official
statement like hey we don't comment on
stuff like this but you know we're
flattered right they just left it at
that
that's a thermal tech Thermaltake
fractal design thermal design put out a
comment saying hey we're flattered you
know whatever then they make a space
labs did the same thing too but they
were a little bit more pissed about no
hold on okay case labs so they copied
cases that looked just like case labs
and they were showing these cases off at
Computex in 2014 and they copied like
now I'm not going I'm just gonna I'm
gonna say fuck if these employees aren't
even there anymore I had two employees
contact me inside Thermaltake when
Thermaltake was saying like oh we didn't
copy we didn't copy that the thermal
take employees actually told me that
they bought the cases from case labs and
case labs was actually able to produce
the invoices showing yes there will take
by our members in our cases and then
they sat around in a conference room
with these cases and then talked about
which features of which case they wanted
to copy right so this went down like
they intended to copy these cases so
fine that's fine I get it this takes
place in the workspace that alone would
not have made me boycott somebody
because let's face it people take design
cues from each other all the time a lot
of people defend it Thermaltake like
well you know what if I can get a case
it's like juice lemons cheaper I win as
a consumer fine I get that the problem
here was when one of the one of the
owners of case labs got very upset and
wrote a angry post on Facebook right
claiming claiming the the theft
Thermaltake basically sucked sucked
sicked sect or whatever they they put
their lawyers on case labs and force
them to publicly apologize basically
forcing them through through legal case
labs could not have won a legal case
against Thermaltake Thermaltake has
massive massive money case Labs is like
a small like 10 man operation out of
California that's family-owned they
don't have the money to fight a legal
battle like and building their stuff
small yeah yeah they use hand brakes
they use press brakes by hand to do
their stuff it's crazy so where I where
I drew the line on where I no longer
would support Thermaltake was the fact
that people so when I did my unboxing of
thread Ripper what are you doing I'm
just fucking with somebody is being a
dumb shit okay listen when I want
everyone be able to hear this in your
keyboard is fucking log sorry okay so
where people came back to me and my
third of her video we're like no
whatever you got the story wrong case
labs actually put out a like a apology
letter explaining they were wrong no
what they don't understand is the
thermaltake lawyers force case labs to
put out the letter Thermaltake wrote
that they had this that then case labs
had to sign otherwise be forced into
legal action that they can't afford so
their hands were tied forced by
Thermaltake to then publicly apologize
to Thermaltake for claiming they stole
their designs
now we're case labs was kind of in the
wrong and they've moved forward from
this is case labs did not have patents
it boils down to that case labs did not
have patents on their design so it left
it wide open for a company like
Thermaltake to take now thermaltake is
now has started copying another case and
I'm curious to see how this one goes
down they're basically copying now the
570 X crystal from court from Corsair
and Corsair has the money to fight them
oh of course Erica kick them yeah square
square in the nuts yeah so that I will
so that is why I boycott thermaltake not
because they copy designs but because
they forced a company like case labs to
publicly apologize to the company that
stole their designs because they can't
afford to win a legal battle that is
where I drew the line if they had never
forced them to do that yeah and what's
funny is thermaltake basically has come
to me many times like wanting to work
with me and my answer is and my answer
to them has always been the same and
this is long after Shannon and what-not
left right yeah this is it and I feel
bad for the guy who hit me up probably
within the last six months asking hey we
I'm with Thermaltake we'd love to send
you some more water cooling stuff and
maybe like my reply my her ply was
basically along the lines of hi I'm
gonna assume your newest thermal take it
otherwise you'd know the current
situation at which you're in I'm never
gonna work with thermal take until
Thermaltake publicly apologizes for
stealing other people's designs and put
it in writing and until I see
Thermaltake make a public apology I will
continue to boycott your products every
chance I get I'm in fries I'm at Fry's
Electronics seeing a guy looking at
thermaltake case I literally told him
you don't want that I'm serious I was
like you don't want thermal take their
garbage it no no and the thing that was
it went a little deeper than that to
remember because once the case lapse
thing went really public and it kind of
blew up and
everybody's eyes on Thermaltake people
started doing a deeper dive and they
started finding out that like every
product they made was some ripoff of
another lesser-known product right
like everything their fan controllers
their reservoir like everything they
made there was a link to another product
that was the exact same product they
were basically just relabeling other
stuff right and selling it out so so
thermal takes basically just the
conglomerate that just takes other
people's ideas and shit yes pretty much
de scoop you Lowe's Christie says money
doesn't matter if there was no patent no
law was broke lol yeah no shit dumbass I
just said that but you know what doesn't
make it right if you guys look a patch
tag thermal fake that's what that's what
that was what that was about
it went on right a lot of people
boycotted Thermaltake of course people
forget the consumer is basically like I
need something and I don't have a lot of
money a thermal take really does exist
in the bottom end low end it's gonna
blow up your shit
you guys want to buy thermal take and
risk blow up your computer go ahead but
people got mad because with the with the
thread Ripper press kit they included a
thermal take water cooler and they got
mad because I threw it on the ground
like the viewer the viewers got mad
because I threw it on the ground they
said I was being disrespectful yeah
there I'm being disrespectful by
throwing the brand that copied other
things and then threatened to sue the
brand's they copied am i throwing their
stuff on the ground you know I throw
that shit off the second floor the
second floor of this building
Jeremy Nick Nick Nick Nick actually had
the suggestion we'd have enough time
that day he actually had the suggestion
we should've gone to the parking garage
to the fourth floor and then dropped it
off and had the fs5 down the bottom on
slo-mo if I just have it tethered behind
your car like a hundred feet of like
paracord it's like driving down the
corner oops
Jake show us your servers they're not
built yet I have 15 10 terabyte iron
wolf drives for my server so I have a
hundred 50 terabyte server going
together whoa yeah that's a little bit
bigger than what I got going on over
here my little Synology yeah what are
you using what do you put them in there
you put them in any kind of light arene
as are you doing like an actual
rackmount server no it's actually being
done in a hybrid workstation so it's so
it's actually an ass so it's actually
gonna be an as-built into a VM being
handled through GPU pastor that's
awesome it's a project I'm actually
doing with Linus
Dodge's so you're basically gonna be
using it like
a workstation but access to all those
resources so you can render and
everything using the power of it in the
storage of it yes but then every other
all the other systems in my in my studio
would be able to access that as a NOS
through my 40 gigabit fiber I'm having
blade here inside the unit tube that's
awesome yeah so okay I want to comment
to this I'm curious as to I want to know
what your response is to this because
this is the other most common thing 0j
boycotts Thermaltake but not Intel
Thermaltake don't pay his bills go away
no intelligent payment and Intel
technically doesn't pay my bills either
I mean there was parts Ponce ership on
this last video but but here's the thing
I made plenty of videos shitting on
Intel I made plenty of videos explaining
why you shouldn't buy Intel Wow how else
can I do it if I need to take those
videos down so yeah I mean so so so how
do you respond to that right cuz Intel
does some pretty shady things I've
called him out on it Lyons has called
him out on it the Paul and Kyle have
called him out on it
everyone's called them out on it and
what do you expect me to do they at
least they didn't at least go and copy
other people's designs and then threaten
lawyers so how do you respond to that
because that's the most common thing
well you're not boycotting Intel you're
not boycotting then I should also
boycott AMD because they fuck up all of
it all over the place I should boycott
them because it bacon well guess what I
said big it was a bad line problem is
right the only answer is boycott
everything and if you boycott everything
you don't have a channel like so that
that does make any sense yeah exactly
and like you said it's always the weight
of the people that I get pissed off like
I haven't seen like three people in chat
now got mad because we were using Indian
cuss words basically and that was
offensive to they're like what if we use
the n-word I was like you don't
understand we're using the words towards
scammers these are scum they rip off old
ladies you know the fact that you're
trying to apply that to a larger context
means you're just being dumb fuck like
at this point look I people act like to
do with you at that point people act
like I'm willing to turn a blind eye to
what goes on in the industry like I
don't understand what's happening
industry of course I understand what's
happening with the industry it happens
in every single industry when I worked
in development do you know how many of
the competitor software that we bought
in licensed and then just reverse
engineered
Microsoft know every we do so it sprite
fair every single developer I guarantee
you research is the the competition and
then just looks at the source code or
any piece of the code they can get
access to you know what the rule was at
Microsoft you couldn't look at a
competing product source code that was
the only row but you were more than
welcome to look at it and look at its
features and Ralphie Aversa yeah
yeah well they they they had to cuz they
got busted for shit before with the FTC
so they were like I can't do that
yeah so but no we were allowed to look
at the products that was that was what I
thought was really weird is it's like oh
no it's okay for you to go download like
mirc and look at the IRC client see how
the IRC client looks and how it works
and I'm gonna be you can't look at the
source code yeah feels like that's
that's kind of a weird rule because
you're still at that point still
encouraging the reverse engineering
about something like well we're just
checking out our competitors to see like
what features is tough they have so
everybody to some degree is kind of
reverse engineering things but it's like
if you produce a product that looks
exactly the same it's the one that you
looked at then you added nothing to it
you just made the same thing for cheaper
presumably I'm gonna put a commenter on
blast this was always the best part
about Tech Talk that's just the part of
looking forward to every tech talk to
icon DSS Nvidia is good question mark
hahahahaha okay listen fanboy first of
all listen up listen up Nvidia has done
more for the industry than just about
any brand out there NVIDIA has furthered
AI and what it was happening now with
deep learning in terms of cancer
research and other health related things
because they've found a way to leverage
the GPU powered other industries that
have nothing to gain have nothing to
with computers smart driving cars and
whatnot and as much as you may hate the
fucking company as much as you may hate
Jen's son for his leather jacket or
whatever reason you hate Nvidia has done
more for the industry than anyone else
can claim more than Intel more than AMD
more than fucking arm more than any of
that shit and if you if you don't like
the company that's perfectly fine but to
say that they're that they make shit
product or say they're not good that is
a flat-out fucking lie I will agree
Nvidia itself in the way it handles its
business what it handles its marketing
in the way it handles it's like overall
persona it's very Apple they think they
know best they think they know more than
everybody else they think they know the
consumer more than the consumer knows
itself and that's shit that's why the
consumer needs to vote with its wallet
but as long as the company has
80 percent market share in GPU and
they're continuing to further the entire
fucking world through research that they
can afford to do take your fanboy ISM
and get the fuck out because we need
more companies like Intel doing that
kind of research as far as I'm concerned
that's my spiel on Nvidia and AMD is for
poor people that's one ami just needs to
get Andy needs to get afloat again so
that they can start doing stuff like
this
the problem is AMD is making really good
shit now but their hype machine and
everything is just like I don't know
they're they're over hyping the shit out
of everything I wish they would just
come out and just like treat it like it
is yeah yeah well like you call that one
of the biggest things was the
cryptocurrency thing right that was
really weird that they're like oh we're
not trying to enable cryptocurrency
people by here's a new firmware that
makes it really fast you know it's like
come on guys I call them out on that
what if they say do you get a response
so I'm gonna I'm gonna say this cuz
we're kind of beyond the Vega thing now
yeah my sources were from AMD my source
was AMD my source was Radeon AMD White
Collar ok my sources were solid my
information is as accurate as it can
fucking get and people continue to claim
that I'm just talking out of bias the
information I put out there came from
AMD them selves I specifically and
here's the thing both times it was a
Sunday night because they were launching
on Monday right it was a Sunday night at
11 p.m. I'm getting phone calls from AMD
Radeon personnel wanting to basically
have a conversation with me so that I
understood the situation which I then
put out a video that was as delicate as
I could without tipping off who the
sources were through the whole a source
not qualify not authorized to talk about
the matter which is stupid fucking
mainstream way news works right now so
the moment you're like from an anonymous
source it's like oh well then you can't
even validate right so I hated doing
that video anyway but the people that
called me out my source was fucking AMD
themselves and you know what they are
the ones who also told me when I brought
up to them I was like ok they kept
saying the gamer of the gamer the gamer
in the gamer and it was like 11:45 at
night on a Sunday and I basically said
so what's the deal with this
cryptocurrency mining BIOS if you I said
I keep hearing gamer in this
conversation why do you have a
cryptocurrency BIOS
that's talking out of both sides of your
mouth you know what do you answer Wes
well we're not gonna cut off that
customer base why would we do that
basically it was why would we do that
these are the these are kind of wish I
recorded this call but these were the
exact words I got we're not gonna cut
off that custom through that customer
base why would we do that why would we
why would we do that they make so much
money from cryptocurrency the thing is
the fact that they would even allude
publicly to oh were worried about the
gamers we're not about the cryptic I
know they're about whoever's gonna pay
the most money for the cards and buy the
most cards what I love is on Twitter
when I had my rant about about the whole
back-end rebate thing and that was why
they that's why they reached out to me
like in a panic right wanting to explain
to me what the whole back-end rebate
thing was people were trying to tell me
on Twitter like no one gives a fuck what
you think J AMD doesn't give a fuck what
a youtuber thinks yeah then that wasn't
why they calling me at 11 o'clock on a
Sunday night right if they didn't care
about what a guy like me thinks why
would they fucking call me so anyway so
there's a lot of cloak-and-dagger shit
going on turn my compression up it's all
over the place you think I have a
compressor I don't have a nice mr. J
only cares about video you don't care
about odd I think it's okay I think OBS
is doing this house like that does like
that you love how you you live
audio/video everything this craft is
nerves that Vega thing was probably the
most frustrating thing having all of the
pieces and all of the information in
that video still on the scratch the
surface of what's really happening
behind the scenes but I can't I mean I
respect the relationship enough to be
like guys Jay this is off the record and
the problem is the details that I have
if I had mentioned the details would
have led directly to who I was speaking
to and that was not you know but then
again it's a risk they take when they
talk to the media right so what do you
do
yeah but the same time you don't want to
be the guy burning your sources right I
mean Burnett that that's gonna come back
and get you to like if somebody tells
you something from AMD that's like
privileged information or something's
not supposed to be public and then you
make it public yeah that company's not
gonna deal with you and I know that like
you got mad that one day and you're like
you know fucking Indy I'm just gonna buy
everything I'm not gonna do anything
with AMD and you were really pissed
about that I still buy it I was like I
buy most of my stuff now no no no and
that's fantastic but I'm just saying
from a perspective of I mean if you did
that like every single company that's
doing any kind of shady
shit instead of like trying to fix it
through another eye you'd be fucked like
you and nobody in the industry Olivia
I've called out AMD I've called out
Intel I've called out Nvidia I have
culture you've called out more people
than any other color checker all three
of the main players and they continue to
send product but every single time I
call them out my attitude is the same
should they decide that no longer are
gonna include me in any of their press
briefings or in the press seating that's
perfectly fine I am perfectly fine and
I'm perfectly prepared to have suddenly
none of these brands want to send me
anything anymore because you know what
that was never the goal this channel was
never intended to get free shit to sit
on a shelf out here that I can't even do
anything with because it's more than I
can handle but I don't sell it because I
don't need the money and I give away
more of it probably than anybody else I
don't I'm perfectly fine
with sustaining this channel on my own
and I do the budget the budget builds
but I built two budget computers to
compete with each other just because I
wanted to I spent eleven hundred bucks
on that video and I just spent like I
said another hundred and sixty dollars
to further it now that video is not
gonna make its money back for a while
and so it's one of those it's like but
the I wish the audience appreciated that
a little more
I really wish they did but when I'm sick
and tired of is every time I talk say
something about AMD AMD fanboys get all
pissed that I'm like putting down their
savior the Intel guys they get mad when
I praise the MDE
right everybody's got an angry player in
the fight though doesn't matter if you
do software if you're doing like you
know you know Adobe versus the Vinci or
you're doing you're over in gaming
minecraft versus you know whatever
destiny I don't know what the fucking
compare minecraft to anyways there's
always some fanboy there roblox it's
gonna just want to stir shit there you
go there just wants to stir shit up
right and and the thing is it's like
with you in tech I would I would argue
that aside from gaming I would say
gaming is the single most toxic thing
there is online like all the gaming
streaming as far as like just really
look into comments and looking people
scandals and everything it's always the
gamers but you know who's a close second
event of the tech the tech reviewers
want you guys to do computer shit want
to hear something funny I'm given away
like an eighteen hundred ninety dollar
computer hardly anyone is signed up for
that good way I don't know what wrong
with that giveaway but that was my
flight to five your video remember I'm
giving away that computer
yep hardly anyone is like registered for
that
I say her why I seems like that would be
one thing really people jump on I say
hardly anyone I mean I'll look at the
exact number right now but compared to
like I mean I'm used to seeing like I
mean if nothing else just to get a J's
to sense build I mean that's why I
wouldn't sign up for it
yeah fifty thousand eight hundred and
forty nine there's eighty seven thousand
two hundred ninety six total entries and
we put it this way the last GPU I gave
away had like almost five hundred
thousand entries weird I'm giving away
what do you think why do you think that
is giving away in our AMD rise in
seventeen hundred X 16 gigabytes GC
field try density memory and dual
channel and as rock Taichi X 370
motherboard a fractal design in Celsius
s 36 and asus strix gtx ten seventy four
terabytes Seagate Barracuda 240 gigabyte
SSD an EVGA 750 g3 supernova PSU in a
fractal design case of the winners
choice in you've got 50,000 entries or
80,000 7,000 why do you think that is
there's two ways to enter be subscribed
to the channel and then as a bonus entry
for following on Twitter so that means
roughly 40,000 people signed up on a 1.2
million channel well what do you have
any like have you done any looking into
it to figure out like why this is
because it seems like that would be
going on all these people coming out
because it's us only guess what guys the
u.s. is the bulk of my viewers so you
guys really think the rest of the world
makes up the bulk they don't know we're
were us followed by what Canada then
followed by UK Canada go back and forth
but here's the thing the US will make up
48 right now makes up 48 percent of my
total viewers one country makes up 48
percent of my worldwide views the second
place goes down to like 12 percent and
then the rest go down into the
single-digit numbers that does not make
up the bulk true how did you are
watching right now tell them they'll go
sign up and get that damn I don't even
have the view counter it I don't know I
always need to go enter and win that's
down you know what though and then
people get here's the other thing people
who got really mad that it's not
worldwide can we talk about that gtx
1080i gave away a couple months ago
let's do it
the winner was in the UK first of all
everyone claims what i rigged it so i
not to ship internationally fuck off i
ship that GPU to UK at two hundred and
ten dollars shipping a
it cost me two hundred and ten dollars
to ship it to the UK it cost him
something like 65 the code right sixty
five US dollars converted for him to her
back about thirty percent right right
for him to receive it and then he had to
play custom pay customs on it to bring
it so that plus customs to receive it
that total cost of everything was three
hundred dollars to ship a five hundred
dollar GPU that he won for free I paid I
paid the shipping but still so do you
know how much it would have cost me to
ship this PC to someplace like
Bangladesh a lot probably more than the
computers were exactly yeah and then and
then and then it's always the same we'll
just make the buyer pay it well then
what did they win a bill where it's like
Australia you know you ship anything to
Australia it's gonna cost more than the
if it's a gold bar it'll cost more to
deliver it than the weight of it haha
how you overpaid shipping maybe a little
bit because I could have shipped I could
have shipped it like USPS United States
Postal Service and it would have cost
like a hundred and forty dollars I got
that I I got the quotes guys it was 140
bucks but guess what once it crosses the
border then I don't have I don't have
tracking anymore until they until
whatever the British post office is that
sends like that that letter via pigeon
carrier back to the u.s. saying we
delivered your package he told me it
could have taken two months before I got
verification I was delivered but once it
crosses the border was no tracking and
no insurance on it so I shipped at UPS
that's I'm not gonna I'm not gonna have
the person be like the card never
arrived and I would have no way of
verifying you know I mean yeah no
actually that that happened to me and
then one of the one of the giveaways
that I did luckily it was the company
that was shipping the product but yeah
when they did these claim they never
received it even though they had like
the shipping confirmation that said it
was delivered they're like well what do
we do yeah so I mean it was pretty all
right so I mean the fact that people
even have the nerve to get mad that a
giveaway is not being done in a matter
of which they liked you know people just
let the fucking pitch they do they do
there's no way for you to win nothing's
changed nothing's changed I keep
thinking the audience one day will just
become like a happy place there's almost
three thousand people watching I keep
wishing that the audience would become a
happy place someday but the problem is
you've got to step on the landmines to
get across right
you can't read that across the field
somehow right you're gonna take some
damage no matter what J you only notice
the only didn't notice negative comment
but I got to read all the comments to
find the comments worth mentioning or
responding to and then I have no choice
but to read the negative one yeah anyway
happy time let's talk about having
boobies I like boobies boobies are
awesome you know I love about boobs they
come in all shapes and sizes Sam they
usually come in pairs except for that
one time or there's three don't even ask
[Laughter]
crap dude it's ten twenty nine already
oh my god you gotta go flying well I got
a I got a wake up to do morning coffee
at 8:30 a.m. PST overrun barnacles more
than it's morning in Europe right now
yeah no I gotta I gotta wake up do that
and I'm shooting code Yasim tomorrow but
it's like I can stay on for a while
alright okay let's go I just wanna make
sure you can actually get home let's go
for a few more drink you're in your
studio unless you gotta sleep there
tonight have you slept in the studio
yeah nope I've never spent the night
never spent big enough trouble yet yes
that's the new couch like sleep on the
couch in this place this is a bachelor
pad man yeah I got a mini-fridge is that
TV back there just isn't even plugged in
you know I've already decided that yeah
the TV's plugged in I just know there's
a new TV going in there one the new LG
nano sell TVs sponsored content and
plenty of opportunity you guys I want to
do sponsored contacts so I brought my my
guests here today that are visiting from
out of town showed them the studio and
basically made the comment that this
place is perfect the few tube fails that
just turn it into a porn dungeon
hey were those the dignitaries from
Intel they came they came over no no
they come on Monday like good friends
red town man they were from there from
rival company AMD yeah whoever pays more
no we're all with Jay that's the one
thing in this business man we're always
gonna be sellouts no matter what we're
always gonna be sellouts we're always
gonna be terrible people I'm always
gonna be fat you're always gonna be fat
too even though you're skinny now and in
shape you're still somebody out there is
gonna still think you're fat how did it
go buy something really nice with the
money I made off a top ten video seemed
to do and you said like a gold chain
that says this says op tight op team
bought this so so my wife is gonna get a
chain made for me like so when we went
to the thing in the Hollywood at a place
with a guy I was wearing a nice
button-up shirt and I wasn't wearing an
undershirt so of course I had like the
seventies like hair like cuz I have
chest hair right and it was kind of
shaking a little bit and I had the
sleeve drown out had the sleeves rolled
up and I was wearing jeans and and
basically I was like oh I'm missing the
gold chain and then my wife was like I'm
gonna get a gold chain made for you and
says j2c but then the Seas gonna be like
a scent sign like this totally wear that
on video gaudy as possible with as many
like like with sworsky crystals or
whatever all like glistening exactly
dude a little Arduino light that tracks
it on the ceiling so that it's always
gleaming no matter where you're standing
hell yeah people that signed up for this
or you listen for it there was somebody
breaking in the studio they're gonna Rob
this ceiling okay so because the ceiling
is metal and it's an old converted
building when it gets hot in here during
the day it starts to popping and then at
night when it cools down it starts
creaking so how is this hearing it right
now go quicker so I was like looking
enough to make sure that I met the
fallen man at all oh you been having any
problems with the noise isolation in
there and the studio cuz I know when you
first moved in there there was like a
lot of noise from outside there's
there's still a lot of noise it's just
we spent a lot of money on equipment to
do the best we can to isolate that as
much as we can
got it got it I need to I need to learn
how to do all that shit that's that's
the one thing I haven't really gotten
any better at is like you know working
on audio audio processing color
correction because I mean I do more than
I used to but I still don't got it down
yeah like I look at your stuff with the
lighting you know the excess lighting
you do with like the purple in the
background that you did in the video
your last video and that looks really
cool it makes you like look really sharp
when you have that like light source
behind you like that the contrast well
it's not just that I have two key lights
behind me as well but they're they're
kind of up and and they've been they've
been softboxes up to this point but we
have a lot of lights here we have a lot
of lights all sent over courtesy a
precision camera and video in Austin
Texas you guys in the Greater Austin
Texas there's make sure you guys go and
check out precision - camera dot-com I'm
not
sad to say that i have a camera sponsor
okay
precision desk camera combination jigme
anyway so another ff7 shows up in a box
two seconds after you say that precision
- camera comm idiocracy the guys like
Carl's jr. ride you by Carl's jr. hey
how's it going brought to you by Carl's
girls whoa dude your camera just like
blew out like massively what happened
it's a knockdown it's them you see
you're watching it on the Microsoft
camera do I need to say any more
no you know okay everybody say what fuck
are you talking about I see J on a
different camera than you guys you guys
can see it in the corner his little feet
down there is a little me see it's like
a ten year hello bad say like opposite
[Laughter]
kids in Africa good in the two dollars
yes I have something I am I'm proud to
be able to say is that I am one of the
very few youtubers that do not do camera
/ how to make video / videography
content that has managed to pick up a
camera store sponsor that is like do you
know how much that takes off my back to
be able to actually put the money into
the content rather than the equipment I
need to make the content that is pretty
baller that is HUGE that is why I was
able to spend money on making these
videos that's why I'm spit I have so
much money to be spent on making these
frederick royval builds and stuff that
is massively and also don't wanna
comment here I'll boo chill one says J
you have no reason to feel guilty I
don't feel guilty if I said I feel
guilty then I misrepresented I don't
feel guilty about this at all I just
feel guilty just a little bit just a
little you cam shit just a little J what
do you say I know that Jason Lindquist
says you can shit where I don't get it's
like not even sweet the two words he's
like you can shimmer he's using Intel
and not rise in the rise and systems
back there that's Nick's system this
system is still my 7900 no this is not
this is 69 hundred K in here with the
two 1080 T is the threader prevail'd is
still being assembled and
of course the i9 stuff that's coming out
I will be reviewing it and let's talk
about that real quick the ex $2.99
platform is a stupid pet platform that
shouldn't exist most people agree with
that
there was no everything that's on next
$2.99 could have been it could have been
introduced on x99 okay everyone's mad
about x2 nighty-night
I did a video talking about why you
should consider Rison and thread Ripper
over X 299 but now people seem to think
that that means that I'm not going to do
videos on X 299 now here's you have to
well here's my mind my mind set on this
my job is to create and present the
information for the audience to
determine for themselves if they want to
buy this product okay I'm not going to
just present the information that I like
in a way that I want to present it
because then that's called a bias
wouldn't you agree if I'm only gonna
show the content that for the products
that I specifically like and only those
products didn't then this is js2 she'll
wear okay that's exactly what that would
be because that's what is the definition
of shilling can you look that up for me
yeah sure
so the Internet can actually be educated
for once on how to use the word properly
hold on ISIL will do a search for shield
definition okay chill let's see here and
a compliance with a hawker gambler
swindler who acts as an enthusiastic
customer to entice or encourage others
or to act as work as it shields the verb
so basically somebody who like up
corporate look up court actually or
something like a corporate corporate
shill because I've heard it referred to
as a corporate show as well
ah let's see here okay now that's just
chill and let me do a corporate shill in
quotes here we go corporate shill is uh
urban dictionary pops up is the first
thing this is a person engaged in covert
advertising the shell attempts to spread
buzz by personally endorsing the product
and public forums with the pretense of
sincerity when in fact he's being paid
for this service so there you go there
you go there you go first of all I've
never received a dime from AMD or Nvidia
and I all reason I can even say Intel is
ever sponsored anything is because of
the obtained video they just went live
today right that's not even CPU
related so people seem to think that
because I was like yeah the x2 now I
know it's dumb it shouldn't exist that
means I'm not gonna do any videos on x2
now and if I do then suddenly I'm
shilling for Intel or I'm biased or
whatever right or I'm or I'm a hypocrite
but isn't it fair to say that my job as
a tech reviewer is to put the
information out there for everyone else
to make up their own decisions in their
own mind absolutely you you would be
hard-pressed to find any video where I
was like you should go buy this product
now I've never done an endorsement I've
never been paid to endorse anything I'd
be stupid if I did a free endorsement
right endorsements are all about being
paid to endorse something and I've never
think it's the endorsements I do are
always for things that I don't get paid
for because you know me I like to review
things I like things that I use my
$17,000 kid know I had to buy that
fucking bed that was $10,000 I want to
throw it through their goddamn window
and get it back everyone thought that
you were you were paid to make that room
they did they thought yeah they thought
I was paid for everything I said about
that yeah any time you say something
nice about something soon it's paid yeah
what's hot that's how it goes I think we
should clarify you guys that Tech Talk
is not this is not Tech Talk back knock
but I see protect I see no reason why we
couldn't do this like every now and then
sure I really don't I mean it's hard but
I would have to have I need to get like
a Yeti mic in a webcam for home so I
could do it there it'd be easier but the
the afternoons and the evening's are
spent quite a bit with family
obligations and stuff so daytime strings
are hard streams are hard because I'm
working right yeah but and that I
understand all too well I really do and
then evenings time streams is family
time now I specifically said when we
ended Tech Talk that it opened up my
Thursday night to be able to do stuff
with my daughter and every Thursday
night I'm doing the same thing with my
daughter taking her to her back to
Taekwondo classes I'm visiting time with
the family there has been very few
Thursdays that have not been spent doing
exactly with so that I was opening that
night at 4:00 but I mean a daytime
stream here and there I don't see that
being a problem since since I moved into
the studio let me look at my my channel
real quick how do I use YouTube it's
been a long time Lizzy might have you
push the buttons I usually just push the
buttons and things happen when I go to
my past live streams there were 146
episodes of Tech Talk
up to six months ago in the last six
months
I have streamed one two three four five
times five so the whole concept that I
ended tech-talk just so that I'd have to
do streams with you so I could do
streams with Nick or someone else that
was obviously false all right true I've
done one I've done an average of one a
month since then and let's see what were
they were the first one testing game
playing streaming with AMD risin the
second one BS live come chat and hang
out
the third one streaming 34 40 by 1440
with EVGA 1080 TI the fourth one we suck
at streaming that was Nick and I and
then the second one we were trolling you
morning J with coffee dirt I saw that
it's funny everybody came over and said
that deal would go to get believe these
do morning they took you dead serious on
that by the way how can you put derp in
the title have people take it serious
because they just want to create drama I
mean the unfortunate thing is I'm for it
when you deal with the PC audience you
have quite a few people that are not
quite as fast as the slowest processor
out there anything so just kid I know I
know how to put I know how to put my
foot in my mouth that's what I'm really
good at these days just put my foot in
my mouth see phone in there see the
thing is I think the audience knows by
now that I am which what you see with me
is what you get I'm a no holds barred
say what's on my mind it pisses people
off but it doesn't bother me type of
person and what I do love Ximena people
had told me that I would never get
anywhere because the audience hates that
know one side of the audience hates that
but do many people that follow me
because of that no no that's the funny
thing is I noticed I literally noticed
the less fucks you gave the more people
followed especially in this way litical
time that we live in right now because
there's so many people that are just
like so fed up with the snowflakes and
stuff but they follow me because this
guy talking about politics so I can just
impose my apology talking about the tech
politics technology yeah totally why
aren't why are all of my followers
suddenly Matthew McConaughey I don't
know that's just how it works my am said
is how works you know but anyway yeah
guys the whole point of the stream was
this was this was a throwback because
why not because everybody basically
thought that you hated my guts and I
guess I got to do one of these with
Chris Pirillo now everything everything
does have an industry
crisper elevate that I hate every why do
something I do you know the guy just
have you seen him seriously yeah I just
kind of have a face you just want to
punch he does you just want to just rack
him right in the nuts
I'm gonna tell her I'm gonna tell a
funny story about AMD's together I have
to tell the story anyway if any of the
other youtubers that were with me during
this conversation they know exactly
where this is going this is hilarious
Linus if you're about to watch this ever
you know I feel about you man we hung
out in the Canada moving like a preface
that that's beautiful moving forward
here bro things are about to be said all
right we were at the after party thing
where there was open bar and food and
stuff and there was this root guy from
Romania a guide tech tech reviewer guy
right was asleep in there that's his
name tech reviewer yeah okay for the for
this purpose tech reviewer guy he's he's
very he's very liberal with the open bar
in terms of getting drinks for people
right so the remember this was the day
my dad died okay so I was like you know
what fuck this shit I'm getting drunk I
okay I'm getting drunk so it's Paul it's
Kyle it's me it's some guys from tweak
town you know it's Eber from hardware
canucks is with us is the usual suspects
okay sure
and this guy something comes over and
he's like dude you mind if I sit do the
seat with you
sit down okay birthday dude bring my
friends drinks yeah a good tequila every
two two tequila's I'm like oh god this
is gonna suck so we're pounding tequila
right and I'm just like whoa and Kyle
was like damn dude you didn't even line
it cuz I wasn't dude I hate lying so I
wasn't chasing with lime or anything
right yeah I got he's bring he's he's
giving us beers and and like I had like
four beers and like six shots of tequila
right just know I had one shot tequila
but he was trying to give me six right
so had all kinds of tequila sin for me
and the guy goes you know III took I
turned my partner here he says the
youtubers they got it easy it's easy for
them they make a video they get the
million views they make it the money you
know we we're old school we have to work
hard and I said you know know these guys
they were
they work for what they do and no he's
not Armenian do I sound Armenian I I do
a terrible Romanian accent okay I was
waiting for you to say matter chode
somewhere in there so he's an American
so so so he goes I started to review the
reviewers I look I see your channel it
does well you have you know five hundred
thousand I was like actually no I have
one point two million zyk no no no no at
the time you have five hundred dollars
to correct right Paul Kyle and then and
then I find this guy
I find this Linnaeus this Linnaeus tech
tips he's got two million and you know
what I like he says you know what I like
about your channel and and he's like I
tell you what I like about your channel
in this industry nice guy and I was in
Kyle's like leaning in right because
we're like oh we're about to hear some
like really cool compliment he goes I
love that you don't have a face I just
want to punch like you don't look like a
dried clitoris because he looks like a
60 year old clitoris right now I'm
laughing and basically face palming like
you are and I looked at him when I went
I'm happy I don't have a clitoris face
you want to punch it kyles are racking
up and literally it was just like I have
never received such a backhanded
compliment I think ever this guy I'm
telling you right now I have never met
anyone that kept it more real than this
guy and we kept talking with him for a
while right and he goes you know when I
come to America I get to I see a bad guy
I want to touch him and I'm like what he
goes there's like 50 now Nick is with us
right so that's why this conversation is
taking place he goes in Romania there's
like 50 black guys and it's not uncommon
to touch him and I'm like uh-uh he goes
here you touch a black guy do you want
to hurt you and I like yeah he is
I don't feel safe in America he's like
some day you you say you go to Taiwan
for Computex and me yeah he goes next
time you go Taiwan you come with me I
show you the real Taiwan the Taiwan that
starts after after midnight and I'm like
I'm married he's like so y-yeah you know
what I won I'm like no I think I'm cool
he's like no Taiwan is safe your talent
fuck you come to Romania you die you
know you'll die
I'm fine you'll die but Taiwan I'll show
you this I'm just like this guy I it was
probably the best conversation I've ever
had with anyone in the industry ever it
was so funny so the moral of the story
is I don't have a clitoris face that he
wants to punch like Linus Courtney and
and apparently touching black guys is
awesome but get your ass King to the
United States yeah yeah I know he told
me one time he tried that he went to the
liquor store and he was just like
looking at the black guy and a black guy
as I go what the fuck and he was like
I'm just looking at you and he's like
what the fuck you look he's like you
like almost got beat up right they just
want attention bro yeah pretty much
so I know you gotta go but the funny
thing was he was like hey we're gonna go
over to the yard house now if you want
to keep this going it's like I'm
jet-lagged I gotta get like completely
shit-faced wasted or I can't sleep
and we're like nah nope we're good the
next morning at breakfast he was wearing
the same thing lat that night so I don't
think he went to bed which was great I
love this guy I can't wait to meet him
again is one of those guys tour is like
he after drinking like his bodyweight
liquor he showed up the next morning
business as usual like hey how's it
going guys oh yeah pretty much had a
good night oh my god I don't know how
people do that I really don't
oh no on Clint face js2 sense I love it
I mean that's the story you can't make
up and I have what Linus has already
heard I'm sure like 40 people have
already tweeted this oh my god I'm gonna
to explain it but yeah I know it's a it
was like it's just so funny I think the
best part was it was like a punch line
and a joke that you really got hooked on
yeah because both Kyle and I were
leaning in like we're about to hear the
best compliment ever about Linus and it
was like so the opposite direction you
the way he looks at me and he does this
right you could still see me right yeah
that's right he's like you don't have a
face I want to punch it's like okay yeah
I'm never gonna see porn of the same
happiness Linus oh yeah
you guys hear that granny tab oh uh I
don't know I'm so tired right now all I
want to say is guys don't worry Jay and
I are cool
just Jay is more cool than I am now
that's just that's the difference and
I'm still gonna catch this motherfucker
he's gonna trip up once I trip up all
the time today was a trip up okay he's
got a trip up 47 times in a row
consecutively and then I'm gonna I'm
gonna just bridge the gap slightly no
but anyways all I want to say is
everything's cool everything's cool I'm
still coming down to see your ass at
some point I love the track you down cuz
you run around like a Jack Russell
terrier but I will see you I'm coming

everything's good guys if you're up at
8:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time come on

and if you guys want to help me not cry
myself to sleep on the toilet go and hit
like on today's video yeah please please
go offset like this like the ratio no I

yeah I think sometimes I misjudge the
audience's ability to like be
constructive I guess yeah and feel free
to go over to my cooking food with a
blow dryer video and hit the dislike
button cuz I I feel like 50/50 is what
I'm shooting for like just like ratio on
