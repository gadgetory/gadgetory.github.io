of these in a while and we've got a lot
of stuff to do and that's why I like
doing vlogs cuz we can do work and video
creation at the same time it's my excuse
anyway uh so studio has been growing we
you guys are probably noticed the last
few videos that we have definitely
changed the look of the studio we turn
it into a workshop and that is something
that I've wanted for a long time and I'm
glad I got back to my roots on that
because a lot of you have noticed the
video feels different it looks better
and it feels like a PC nerd workshop but
let us not forget I'll turn slowly so
you guys stop bitching and complaining
that I'm making y'all sick let's not
forget that this is a studio first and
foremost it's a place that I work but
it's also a place that I create and
because of that we have really expanded
the amount of stuff we'll just say stuff
to where I already feel like I need a
bigger studio but the expansion of the
studio wouldn't have been made possible
without the help of my new partner in
crime in this that is precision camera
and video in Austin Texas you guys
should definitely go and check them out
I will leave a link down below so that
you guys can go and see what they've got
imma turn right here so that you can see
some of the key lighting here is
actually hitting me yeah so anyway check
them out guys precision camera and video
Austin Texas you'll be hearing more
about them on this channel they have
made a lot of what you're about to see
possible but there's some things we need
to need to tackle here you guys have
seen me complain about the overhead
lighting like the sky lights so we
tackled that a little bit it's super
ghetto and I think we're gonna redo it I
mean this literally if there was ever a
jerry-rigged this would be it I think I
think we're gonna redo it today
part of it is we have to go and we have
to rent a 14-foot ladder to even start
to reach it and I'm afraid of heights
nick has seen me cling on to the
six-foot ladder when I'm what two rungs
up and I'm just like oh my god and the
way we even reached what you're about to
see was I put the six-foot ladder on top
of our table OSHA I hope you're not
watching liability insurance you better
not be watching yeah so I put a letter
on top of the table a six-foot ladder
and then I used rebar to like poke
anyway just take a look so yeah we we
got installation foam pieces you
the same stuff we made our bounce boards
out of it by the way it's a spinner and
we just laid it across obviously we
still have more to do now let me tell
you what's funny about that is when I
talked about needing to do something
with the skylight a lot of you guys were
like just lay stuff across just make
like a false ceiling and I was like yeah
I don't want to do that because this is
the beautiful rustic ceiling and I want
to see it in my videos the problem is I
can't have a beautiful rustic ceiling
without that big-ass skylight right
there so anyway yeah more power to you
guys the ones who were telling me to do
that and I was fighting back saying no
obviously but I'm not happy with the way
it kind of turned out so far we need
more panels obviously because we had two
more but we ended up using them upstairs
because part of my problem here too was
the upstairs was stupid bright because
the window was do you see that right
there do you see how bright that is
that's one of the reasons why we have to
block it out it changes the color and
everything of the studio we don't want
that in terms of recording look how much
darker it is up here though because
we're going to block out most of the
light by doing the same thing so now
when we do livingroom stuff and by the
way I do have a new lg tv a nano cell
tech they were doing a review on so this
set will finally be getting used so we
also have a lot of new lights and stuff
these are aperture 120 DS I believe they
are spotlights and we've got some more
aperture LED panels and we got some more
aperture LED panels up there and we've
also got the ice light the ice lights
pretty cool Nick once you take that out
so we can show them our lightsaber and
then we've also got the two hives right
there the wasp 100 - these those are
awesome that's this guy right here this
is how we've been getting a lot of the
color that you guys have seen in the
background that you guys have really
liked and you guys are like wow the
video looks so good like this is kind of
how we're doing that we've also got well
this isn't a new stance where my old
stands but the this is one of the
aperture lights right here that we've
been using and got some butcher paper on
there basically right now to diffuse it
a little bit
anyway the control box for that this is
how our new like creme de la creme right
here this is the sony fs7 mark tear and
it is ridiculously stupid and yeah so we
handle this with kid gloves because you
can't afford to replace it
he's where we are it's also got an
aperture professional field monitor on
there and if you guys want a size
comparison of this this is a
professional camera this is not a
prosumer camera this is a professional
moviemaking camera no it's not a red but
still it's very capable this is my ex s5
this is what you guys have been seeing
me shooting on for quite a while it's my
Sigma 18 to 35 lens but check this out
if we put these lights side-by-side
yeah I guess you can definitely see a
size difference there let me zoom in on
that holy crap man look at that so
anyway yeah this is what you've been
seeing me make videos on now for the
past year actually I got this in October
of last year and this is what we're
moving forward to so this camera right
here is not very shoulder friendly you
know you can see it's also we've also
got the control leg back here this thing
is not very shoulder friend I mean you
could shoulder this right it's actually
not that big and heavy compared to what
a fully rigged out cinema camera would
be it's way lighter than a red that's
for sure he has a pad but you'd still
want something nicer than that but I
love this field monitor this field
monitor this is bad ash okay look you
can see me tell me on the ax 33 by Sony
and we're not sony fanboys are we no not
at all think of that the other thing
that's really cool about this field
monitor is check this out it also has
all its got parade it's got histogram
based on RGB histogram it's also got
color meter that is freakin cool now we
have no excuse for our videos to suck
and this right here is the Atmos Shogun
inferno this is our 4k raw 12 bit
recorder field recorder and it's just
sitting on high right now we haven't
actually hooked it up yet but this is
what's gonna allow us to match footage
now of the FS 5 - the FS 7 because this
does this does 10 bit internal 4k you
can also get a backpack for it which
will unlock raw but it's under this
cover and the backpack hangs back here
and has additional stuff and this will
allow us to match this footage and we
had to do the five hundred and forty
nine dollar firmware upgrade just to
unlock the features on this but now
we'll have two cameras that can match
and yeah we're looking forward to that
and apparently the battery is dead for
this actually wait wait try this one and
this the same size yeah yeah that looks
like a lightsaber on camera make it long
long sound Wow Wow
now you look like Finn for sure okay
here we go it's so short it's like Yoda
lightsaber because it's like a light
dagger and so blaney it's it's cool
because it's got you know the the amber
side so it warms it out right or you can
do it like half way and sort of mix it
oh okay yeah that's cool so these are
our new pupil grips c-stands we've got a
few of those as you can see we have
these connected here to these quacker
clamps which have basically like I said
it's it's the same panels we have up
there just much thicker really thick and
this is how we bounce our light so we
can control light we have two of these
now again because we just got the extra
sand and stuff so Nick is gonna
demonstrate now how we bounce the light
to get a more soft diffused four over
here on set and you can also see we
started doing some sound treatment
trying to make this room sound better
we'll be experimenting with that and see
what works best yeah
tilt it forward a little bit more
because the higher you go with this the
more tilted you'd want it so we're
trying to get some overhead lighting
here there we go that'll work doesn't he
look so majestic now like that or the
shadows and stuff
make it make a face wait I'm blending
myself you're fine
so this is without the light and if we
turn the light on you can see that's
obviously like really bright and it's
great creating some harsh shadows so we
can control that that's why we've got
all these lights and then we can move
things around but these are the bounce
lights that I'm stepping on things
there's Nick's two cents as you guys
have been bugging before okay
so this is what it kind of looks like
when we're shooting video right it sort
of looks like this except risk waist
well yeah
and then when you move in set this is
what you get so because we have the
light on this side right we wouldn't
want the camera to be over here cuz then
it's really direct light it doesn't look
as good so we would move the camera this
way you know you can see we get some
nice lighting back there I don't like
that that light's kind of in view we
don't really have a choice at the moment
we can raise it up a little bit yeah in
the liners so this is what kind of looks
like when I do my videos we've also
decided we need to add some more shelves
to our AV cabinet it's growing
obviously when you drop this shelf down
this is battery charger station we can
drop the Shelf down and then put another
shelf in here this is our a7s2 how do
you guys are like why'd you get the a 7s
and not the a7 are actually being H did
a really good video about the
differences in why you would want one
versus the other
this is Nick alright actually and I've
got some I've got some cool stuff to
show you guys here so let's go do that
you guys might recall this guy here the
cougar conquer case got a lot of work to
do we're gonna do some casemod stuff to
it but yeah some of the components are
in there and so we got some more pieces
for this and I'm concerned now that one
of the pieces that I got is gonna be too
big this is the defy boat on 270 it's a
d5 pump with the XS PC reservoir all
built in and it has a lighting cathode
or LED or whatever that goes right
through the middle so we can illuminate
this guy the problem is now that I look
at it I think I think there's a problem
oh boy this that is the biggest penis
pump I have ever seen yep I'm pretty
sure this guy is too big
dammit oh well man
this I thought this was a lot smaller oh
yeah it's not gonna work because I need
it to also make sure I can clear my rat
up here and I was gonna try and go
push-pull on that but I don't think
that's gonna happen
oh that's glass those plastic that's
glass
you hear that right yes man so I got
this different performance pcs the
performance - pcs comm I really thought
that was a much smaller reservoir -
that's why when I saw the box I was like
oh rap anyway this has just been hot let
me tell you why this is buggy it's not
only is that gonna be too big I also
ordered this happen
eh-eh founders edition block which
actually works in more than one card it
works in the 10 60 70 80 80 TI Titan X
and Titan XP graphics cards but I only
got one this is what happens when you
write emails while you're like in the
middle of doing other things anyway what
else do I got here we got some cathode
lights because we're doing black
lighting cables that some things that we
need Oh check this out something I've
never actually incorporated one of my
builds we're gonna be incorporating at
this time are you ready
coolant temp sensor dude and it's got
green backlight so yeah coolant temp
sensor and then this is where it gets
its sensor from it's basically a
pass-through fitting now I got a write
performance pcs if you like hey guys
guess what I'm stupid again I already
wrote them an email today I was like hey
guess what I forgot to get my second
block now I got to write them and be
like well before we leave there's one
more project I want to show you guys
I'll have Nick unbox it you guys have
noticed right this guy right here on the
floor my cooler master cosmos - 25th
anniversary edition that's
for a project here and Nick is going to
go ahead and unbox this box right here
we also have two one terabyte Kingston
drives because there's something I've
been severely lacking in all of this
YouTube career and you guys have kind of
noticed and that has been lacking a
proper server and what we have here are
15 one five one terabyte drives hey guys
editing J here what I meant to say was
it's actually 15 10 terabyte drives
that's 150 terabytes of storage oh it's
gonna be a hell of it give me a hell of
an array so yeah actually Linus is
helping me with this project so he and I
will be collaborating on this and we're
doing an unrated thing but we're doing
it different we're not building in Nazz
and I'm gonna leave that I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave the details until the
project is ready that's coming soon
because I am out of storage I am out of
storage and that's a problem
15 10 terabyte drives holy Sh what you
haven't noticed is we've done what two
trips now we were I said we were gonna
go there and try and do something with
the light now we have a 10-foot ladder
because we got the 14-foot ladder and
couldn't even get like in the building
cuz the hallway and yeah math is hard we
also got this blackout film several
rolls of it we're gonna black out the
windows because I'm the windows are cool
and all but I'd rather have control of
the light so we're gonna black out the
windows or green-screen whatever you
guys keep going in the green screen and
it's UV protection that's me yeah so
that's a big fat no here's what we ended
up so the latter as you can see goes way
high up there which it's also on a table
and yeah dad does they happen we
couldn't get the 15 or the 14 foot
ladder in the door so we made a 14 foot
ladder by putting on top a 10 foot on
top of a 4 foot table
oh yeah there's just not enough room for
the feet right I know that this is how
sometimes some contractors have to do it
they build a platform like across
stairwells and put ladders but there's
just not enough room here to where I
trusted it not to kill me so I guess the
ceiling
for now stays as getaway as it is it's
not bad so we're gonna do it we're gonna
go ahead and just black out the windows
now we'll see how that looks I should
take care of enough light
I guess we'll come back and see if that
looks like place the light only cost me
21 bucks to rent so that's what it looks
like now with the temporary blinds down
we're blocking out as you can see most
of the light there's still some slight
right there like edging that you can see
but we can block that out now and
actually shoot some cool color against
that with our hive lights and whatnot
and I think we'll make things look a
whole lot better and then when we want
it up you know we can let the background
the moving tree and all that do its
thing but I like that a lot better
that's already so much more control over
light in this space hey guys it's time
to go it's like 6:30 or six what time is
it 5:30 9:00 okay I was way off whatever
we'll probably hang out here a little
while longer then just to kind of maybe
let traffic die down just a little bit
 traffic I agree anyway guys we're
gonna go thanks for hanging out with us
behind the scenes allowing us to get
some more stuff done and again remember
