click the link in the description to
find out more alright so here we are
guys part two of new cables for skunk
works I want to clarify it clarify we're
going to clarify this these are done by
Sanctum sleeving now a lot of you guys
especially on instagram last night we're
like why'd you ditch Lutra what the heck
I thought you were all up in loot rose
grille sanctums leaving is actually an
offshoot or branch off of loot row one
of their main sleepers actually started
his own company with the blessing of
loot row customs and Mike who owns loot
row customs who's now something else
they kind of had a split a friendly
split so anyway sink them sleeping is
the one who did this for me
we're still good with loot row trust me
there's no issues there so what this
leaving is actually different than the
sleeping that's currently in the system
now what's in here now if you can kind
of tell is a plastic sort of a nylon
sleeve it's very very stiff as you can
see it holds its shape which can be good
and bad at the same time but but these
guys here these are paracord so these
are actually a fabric which are very
similar to like what you would find on
keyboard and mice that are sleeved so
it's much more malleable much more soft
but the downside is as you can see they
don't hold their shape as well as
plastic so when it comes to trying to
route them it's going to be a little bit
more challenging more zip ties may be
needed but I do appreciate the much more
flexible nature of the paracord so
anyway Sanctus leaving comm link is in
the description their web site may not
be up at the time that you guys are
watching this but they're working on
that and they do everything from
extensions custom full custom kits like
they did here for the 1600 watt p2 from
EVGA they can sleeve anything guys so
definitely go and check them out if you
want that custom look but I've got all
the cables redone here all the PCI
Express the eight pin EPS power the SATA
cables and as you can see they even gave
me custom link SATA cables for this
thing so I don't have like this
funkiness
right here so anyway let's go and get
all these cables out of here and let's
get these things installed
and
you
all right so I've got all of these
sanctums leaving cables put in it's
funny too because a yellow so bright it
kind of looks like we went from one
cluster fudge of cables to another
cluster fudge of cables but there's
actually a lot more airflow down here as
you can see because my concern was
airflow for the bottom compartment and
the GPU rads be able to get the air out
everything pretty much lined up exactly
as I wanted and I'm pretty happy with it
overall the only thing I'm not a huge
fan of and you'll be able to see
probably in some b-roll here is how the
GPU cables are not laying exactly as I
want them to and the reason for that
being is the paracord is is not doesn't
hold shape like the plastic or nylon
sleeving does so because it doesn't hold
its shape I can straighten it all out
and put it how I want and then it kind
of slowly starts to turn back how it
wants to go on its own but I guess I can
just live with it being a little anal
retentive but then I'm going to have to
look at it and if it annoys me then I'll
probably sit there and continue to fight
with it but I do like how they come
through right here and they plug in
directly on the PSU as they're supposed
to I have not fired it up yet for all I
know I could turn it on and it could
blow up and get smoke and fire
everywhere that I'd probably make a
really good video right so maybe we'll
do that real quick we'll go ahead and
move it over plug it in and fire it up
and see if we get the magic smoke
transition
now I'm trying to undo my lazy eyes this
one's always like hmm okay so we're
hooked up I've already turned on the
power supply we have lights on the
motherboard so that's a good sign let's
just hope we don't get magic smoke all
fans are on pumps are going motherboard
is posting do we get beeps need to beeps
the creeps in the sweeps oh hold on
we're start going to be 64 we have a
piss green here this is actually normal
for the EVGA boards yeah I know every
now and then it sticks on a 64 and then
it will be like beep all by itself watch
watch and go go
Jacob fix this there we go all
rightie up now we're gonna do a reboot
wait for it they're part of the issues
with x99 man telling you now we should
get a dude to dude it it's 64 yeah
anyway we got power and stuff and it
works so I just got to find the USB
device now that's giving it a hard time
we got new cables in though what do you
guys think tell me in the comments
anyway sanctum sleeping calm thanks for
doing that guys these are way more work
than I have the patience to do I can
tell you that much alright guys see you
the next one they're closed windows yay
look show the windows show that it works
show that it works there routes
yay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
