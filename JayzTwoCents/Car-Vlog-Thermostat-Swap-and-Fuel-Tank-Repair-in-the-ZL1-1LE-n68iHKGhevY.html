garage just way too early for this I'm
tired we did some work today on the zl1
we've got a lazy thermostat we need to
change taking over to my buddy bowtie
britches house and we're gonna change
guys actually the master mechanic who
built the engine in this car when I had
the engine ripped out at like five
thousand miles and completely overhauled
and so we're gonna drive over there
today hang out with him and see another
friend and do some car stuff today so a
little bit different change of pace and
if you aim for that sort of thing then
what you going to hop in with me and go
along for the ride so when I leave early
in the morning I hate waking up the
family so one of the nice things about
this car is even though I have my
straight through exhaust I use on track
I leave the stock muffler on when I'm on
the street so all the 800 plus
horsepower that's in this thing doesn't
wake up the whole freakin neighborhood
when I start it so you just go to engine
management put it in stealth mode the
valves turn on which block off a whole
different diverter and the muffler and
super quiet
I don't know how quiet that actually
sounds on the mic it's actually pretty
damn quiet person versus what it was but
the stainless works the whole
neighborhood would have woken up right
now
a few moments later alright here we are
this is Mike bowtie britches you guys
have seen me tag him on Instagram we are
working on the zl1 I mentioned before we
before I drove out here today that the
thermostat is is sticking mostly in the
closed position we're assuming the car
runs about 20 degrees maybe 30 degrees
harder than it should so we're gonna
actually do the boil test with this - I
brought my fluke thermometer so that we
can boil it and see where it's actually
opening if it's opening at all I think
we're gonna maybe go old-school - and
well this this thermostat we have
already had the hole in it right so we
don't have to drill a hole okay so it's
already got the little bleeder hole in
it which is it's nice it lets a little
bit of coolant through it'll take a
little bit longer to warm up but it also
more importantly lets air through so
that we don't get air pockets of steam
buildup in the engine
I have checked the levels in this
coolant a million times since this
problem started I'm pretty sure there's
no air in the system but we're gonna
find out today so we're gonna drain in
at least enough coolant out to get it
below the thermostat
which is right there you can see it nice
shiny thermostat housing it's actually
the ls3 style billet housing so we
upgraded that as well and to be honest I
don't think I ever told you guys what I
did to this car so maybe at some point
today we'll go over the parts list the
invoice was like two pages long so I
don't even think I remember all the
parts we put in here but uh yeah Mike
built it though so he knows it's kind of
a cookie cutter sheet of parts that go
into these stage three builds this black
steel one he's got right here though
this is a customer car that well
according to Mike the guy just basically
pointed at the catalog and said I want
everything so I guess his goal is like
1200 horsepower in this black one so
that's how you properly void a warranty
in a 20-18 zl1 you take the heads off to
supercharger off you send it all out for
porting and stuff not even two thousand
miles on this car and might look like
that though huh when you when you built
it yeah that's just weight reduction
just get rid of the heads they're not
necessary the thing with most of the
mods in my engine here is most of its
not visible so we've got a we've got
obviously a cam in there it's equivalent
to a bike a stage two cam we've got
eighty five flex fuel all the ARP studs
titanium valve springs the whole valve
train was kind of improved to deal with
the cam and you know the obviously the a
little bit higher rpms that we got out
of it this is our catch can right here
with the vented catch can I've got this
shield to protect it from water because
unfortunately the drip tray which is off
right now drips right onto this when I
wash the car so this is to protect it
from fluid obviously we've got our gates
belt 10-percent overdrive ATI pulley
down there roto fab intake Tony ma'am
imported throttle body it's not a larger
throttle body it's just smoothing out
the inlet there's a terrible step in
there when you first go in the air
enters so that step has been smoothed
out we got American Racing long tube
headers on there one in seven eights
going down into a three inch all the way
back to right now which is a stock
muffler but I have a V band on that so
that I can easily remove it but my
stainless works on which is way too loud
for the street in my opinion what else
we have DSX
fuel system so it does have an added
fuel pump on the bottom of the tank
we'll be working on that today to
putting a different fitting in there but
that's obviously got its own fuel
controller for that you kind of see the
LED under there somewhere or maybe not
but anyway that's two
with the e85 in the extra fuel that's
needed which as if this car needed more
fuel being pumped in the engine when I
got a 85 going and I'm cruising I'm at
approximately the 11 or 12 miles per
gallon when I'm on track
I'm probably gonna be reaching about
four if that on the front of the car
we've done extremely upgraded eight or
cooler for the supercharger obviously
it'll air to water intercooler the core
on this is actually a CNR core which is
one of the best brands that you can get
in terms of reliability and racing
applications and then I also have a CNR
racing radiator in there as well you can
kind of see it obviously right there so
cooling is a big aspect to this build
and what you can't see behind the fender
here is actually a one and a half gallon
tank for a reservoir so yes you guys are
always telling me go custom Lupo huh go
custom water loop with that that joke
everyone thinks is original we actually
did a custom water loop in here this you
can't really see it because it's all
hidden and looks very factory for the
most part and then that's the thermostat
housing I was telling you about right
there that shiny piece so the stock
thermostat housing is a was a plastic
piece with a fairly restrictive
thermostat smaller thermostat that's a
160 or in right now it's more like a 200
because it's not really opening and then
I've got my arrow force gauges right
there which hook directly into the
computer port and then I can set the
gauges to anything that I want so yeah
the car is definitely not stocked by any
means we were hitting 700 wheel
horsepower on a Mustang guy know when
the intakes were overheating because we
had a issue where the supercharger
cooling bricks inside the supercharger
were one of them was clogged at least
Mike had a fun time tracing that didn't
you
it was kind of funny on the OnStar
system seeing the car like constantly
driving because you were trying to
figure out that issue but I did 700
wheel horsepower on a Mustang with the
intakes reaching 180 degrees which is
pulling what you said about three
degrees of timing at least and that's a
lot of horsepower so we're probably
sitting closer to maybe 727 30 wheel
without the intakes overheating but
unfortunately when we tried to read I
know
we were just spinning on the dyno so we
have no idea what it's exactly making
but I haven't lost a race yet and that's
because of that guy alright so as you
can see that thermostat is completely
closed we have the probe right there at
the thermostat so we can measure the
temperature it's currently at 125
Fahrenheit we'll be measuring Fahrenheit
obviously cuz it's a 160 thermostat so
we want to see compared to when this
crosses 160 what is this doing as it
approaches 160 it just start to slowly
crack open but once it passes 160 it
should open pretty much all the way so
that's we're gonna be checking for 154
so right now is where it would start
cracking just barely but theoretically
at 160 is where it should you should see
that spring women well I guess we'll
just let it keep heating up and see
where it starts to move but so far we've
passed 160 and it has not it's not
opened even a little bit 176 and the
thermostat still has not moved so you
know what that says a lot for the
cooling in this car Mike if the only
flow we were getting was through that
weep hole and it kept me from
overheating I mean we were overheating
where we should be but we never even
went to factory temp of 210 that's 208
so as the hottest I saw in the freeway
so we're at 180 now so Mike's doing the
old-school method of drilling out the
thermostat so we do have just a small
constant amount of flow it helps with
air and well because racecar yeah
alright so route 196 it still hasn't
opened Mike's gonna drop a another 160
thermostat in there to see if it opens
and take some time to dissolve a he
oh yeah you see it opening now take some
time for it to kind of absorb that heat
we see how it's opening now on the
bottom you see light coming through
right there do that see the one above
not opening at all we're at just under
200 degrees Fahrenheit so that's how a
thermostat works and comparatively how
one doesn't work the question is what
causes it not to open any more fucking
science that's why massive meats Mike
likes the massive meat I mean you know I
end my M&amp;amp;M so everything I've done in
this car is this man's fault he's not a
dish this fault
nothing at all it's mr. lethal garage
lethal Camaro whatever lethal he is
today I think lethal conquest know what
we say know the lethal crusade crusade
because we're getting crusader Crusaders
shocks from fight all because of his 800
plus wheel horsepower drag car we're on
a crusade the hell you guys eight
hundred you spent way more than $800 804
spire worth of dollars man you're doing
it wrong Mike is determined to get the
thermostat to open by you snow
pain and it opened oh you hear snap open
- it was like stuff huh
yeah it snapped open violently yeah and
now it's permanently stuck open
oh it's closing sort of yeah thermostats
just completely food board it was like
look at that look how crooked the spring
is yeah oh yeah that's a death for me
alright and that's how they used to
lower cars so we use the infrared
thermometer on it it was what 400
degrees on the element it finally opened
but now it doesn't close right so it
won't be reusing that one obviously so
the reason why we've taken the fuel tank
out of the zl1 as you can see right here
is because we actually have an
aftermarket fuel line right there as you
can see that was threaded into the tank
that's for the DSX low side fuel system
and unfortunately mine was starting to
leak on me this discoloration is there
because I actually used a fuel tank
repair putty to keep it from dripping on
me but Mike now has this bulkhead
fitting which were putting in there so
it's kind of like a pass-through fitting
like I use the computers when I do my
water cooling stuff and it will sandwich
in there and that will give us a much
better fitting to kind of clamp on to
and there a n lines right in fittings
yeah but to do that he has to take the
fuel tank out and obviously the fuel
pumps we can reach in there and to do
that the entire drive line out of the
car
pretty easy install this is what it's
like to be six foot seven
all right we're done the car is ready to
go as you can see right there ticking on
a test drive temperatures are well
within check max I saw was 181 degrees
Fahrenheit after doing like for
back-to-back pulls through
top a second middle of third if I had
tried to do that on the way here I would
have guaranteed overheated the car
because as you saw the thermostat does
stop texting me the thermostat did not
open whatsoever so now at least until we
hit it with a 400 degrees worth of heat
off of a butane torch so that you know
always he was gonna work so it also
changed that fitting inside the gas tank
as you guys saw so no more leaking there
so I think we're gonna be knock on wood
ready for the track day on the 18th
otherwise Mike's gonna get another fury
if I hate this car this is a stupid car
why did I buy this car actually no Mike
I'm more tactful with Matt the one I'm
like fuck you forever telling me to
build this car alright guys thanks for
watching this little vlog I don't know
what else to say so yeah we'll see you
guys in this room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
