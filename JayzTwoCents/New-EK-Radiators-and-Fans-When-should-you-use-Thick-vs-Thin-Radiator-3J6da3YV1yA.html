we're going to go ahead and continue
these hot months with a little bit more
water cooling stuff especially since we
have ek sent over a couple of new
products here and technically they're
not really like new products or more or
less like upgrades to existing product
lines and I figured rather than do a
standalone review on this which would be
kind of redundant I would kind of turn
this into a twofer which one this into a
twofer well normally it's two for
Tuesday but it's this is going up on
Monday so we'll turn this into a twofer
Monday I doesn't really work very well
does it did what it's so mom you really
think so
what is the wife thing well she says it
gets the job done - ugh that's mom a
fractal design node - OH - it's not
about how big it is but all about how
you use it
so EJ's got a couple of new things that
we're launching here and we're going to
take the opportunity with this product
to kind of talk about radiator thickness
whether or not thickness really matters
first up is the EK bar to our fans and
we took a look at this months ago and i
said that these were one of the best
performing and quietest fans i think i
had ever heard at least at the 1450 RPM
range of any radiator fan these things
are amazing static pressure but they're
also great at airflow they're low at
power consumption they're only 0.18 amps
for the 2200 rpm fan I'm holding right
here so performance of them was stellar
it was amazing the problem I had was the
fact that they only came in black with
gray blade or black shroud with grey
blades unless you got like the 3000 rpm
fans which were all black a lot of
people kind of cus went give us all
black fans we want black fans that way
we can put them in any color build and
not worry about the way they look well
ek stepped up and not only gave you all
black fans here in varying rpm ranges
but also a white fan and the cool thing
about this is they also give you a
matching black braided cable pwm cable
as well as a white braided cable
the white fan so now you have some
options here now we're not going to do
another performance test on these fans
I'm just going to go ahead and direct
you to the previous video that I already
did with the paper test and the radiator
to flow test and all that sort of stuff
so if you guys want to see more about
the performance of the Vardar fans in
the original black and gray color then
go ahead and click the link in the
description or annotate it or however I
ended up pointing you guys there maybe
it'll be a little slight out card I
don't know now the other thing we're
going to take a look at here are a
couple of new radiators added to their
cool stream line of radiators now either
running the cool stream triple radiator
in the test bench here ever since I did
my cryo venom reviewed last year the r9
290 cryo venom from visiontek and I've
been running that radiator ever since in
the test bed and having fantastic
results with that now that was an
overall about a 45 millimeter thick
radiator and they've added to their line
now they're ultra slim as you can see
right here this is a triple radiator
very very slim could fit this just about
any case as well as their X II which is
their extreme this thing is actually
really heavy but this is their extreme
radiator you can see this thing is just
that's a massive girth to it if you know
what I'm saying
now those radiators are pretty much the
same when it comes to finding city and
layout build quality the construction
with the exception obviously of the
thickness so that got me thinking maybe
we should talk a little bit more in this
video about how radiator thickness
really compare this hope I can do this
but knock in these over am I good so how
these two radiators compare to each
other and where you should install thick
radiators versus thin radiators or
whether or not you should even go with
more fan options on a radiator like
triple or quadruple or a double versus a
thicker smaller radiator if that makes
sense so hopefully I explained that well
what we're going to try and do today was
go ahead and get started
now thin radiators are nice because you
can pretty much fit them in most cases I
mean most cases today anyways are built
with water cooling options in mind where
you're going to have plenty of space
between the top of the motherboard and
the top of the case so that you could
fit at least a 30 millimeter thick
radiator like this
one here with the 25 millimeter
thickness of a fan so you've got 55
millimeters of total clearance needed in
most cases to fit a slim red and that's
going to be pretty much acceptable for
most people now if you're going to be
installing just a CPU for the most part
you could get away with just a 240
millimeter read at 30 mil thickness like
this it's going to give you about the
same cooling as your all-in-one water
cooling options the difference is if
you're doing a custom loop like this and
you're going to get better quality
components a better radiator better
tubing better pump better block so you
would get a better quality loop doing a
custom loop over an all-in-one even
though it may be a 240 so here's a
common question that I get in my inbox
an awful lot is something along the
lines of je my case can fit 3 120 s in
the top should I get a triple radiator
or should I get a double or should I get
a 120 thick radiator or a 240 thick
radiator I just don't know what to put
on there well here's the general rule of
thumb my personal recommendation is
always going to be get a radiator that
matches the amount of fans that you can
exhaust air from your case so what that
means is if you were putting this let's
say the top of you know a Corsair case
or a fractal design case and you have
room for three 120 s as long as you can
fit this in the top of your case with no
obstructions below it then I would
always recommend going with a radiator
that matches the amount of fans that you
have so if you have a triple go to the
triple if you have a quadruple go with a
quadruple the difference in cost between
larger radiators in terms of surface
area by length is usually only a five or
ten dollars between radius sometimes
more depending on the radiator but
you're going to find that you're going
to have a lot more surface area and a
lot more cooling Headroom so if you
decide later on you want to add a CPU
block art not a CP block hopefully
that's already in your loop but a GPU
block or maybe motherboard block or
something you're going to have
additional Headroom because as you add
more watts of cooling needed you need
larger radiators to account for that now
with that said a lot of folks will have
a case something like you know the fan
text in through primo going I've got a
ton of room I've got I can put massive
radiators in there so should I go with a
thin Raider radiator or should I go with
a thick radiator well the general rule
of thumb here is going to be you will
get more
bullying dissipation by adding a longer
radiator that's thinner then going with
a shorter radiator that's thicker does
that I hope that makes sense you're
going to get better efficiency and
cooling by going with a longer read with
more spread out surface area then say
going with a smaller radiator that's
thicker if you can fit the longer read
so something like this is going to offer
you good cooling but this is not going
to equal the same ad even though this is
this is twice as thick as this guy here
it's twice as thick this is not going to
offer twice the cooling dissipation as
this it doesn't really work that way now
one of the downsides with going with
thick radiators like this is they're a
little bit more difficult to bleed or
get all the air out of because there's a
lot more room for the air to get trapped
in here
the top of the radiators that are thick
like this almost act like a reservoir in
their own sense where there's a lot of
place and a lot of room for air to get
trapped in the top half of the radiator
so you end up having all these rows
going across the red where only the
bottom ones would be filled with fluid
and the top ones could be filled with
air for quite some time so you would
actually notice that your coolant
reservoir would continue to drop for
weeks after getting the system you know
at least what you thought bled would
continue to drop for quite a while now
that's not to say that these are bad I'm
not saying these are bad whatsoever
there are times when radiators like this
are necessary because you can't fit the
longer Reds in there you can't maybe you
can't fit a quad but you can fit a thick
360 then something like this is
definitely going to offer you the extra
cooling dissipation and cooling capacity
needed to add things like your CPU and
GPU or even multiple GPUs depending on
you know how much Headroom you need on
cooling and how much Watts dissipated so
that is where a thick radiator would
definitely come in handy and the other
thing you have to keep in mind with this
guy though obviously is you've got let's
say this is 80 millimetres I don't think
this is 80 maybe it's 80 but you've got
at least let's say 60 millimetres and
then a 25 millimeter fan you've got to
make sure your case has 85 millimeters
of clearance plus the length of the
fittings coming off so you might need a
hundred millimetres of clearance to run
this bad boy
but lots of cases nowadays are actually
offering that sort of clearance so you
might opt to go with something like this
the cool thing about the thick rad that
the thin rads don't have as you can see
there are no fittings on the backside
there's there's ports on the front but
not on the back the thick guy here
actually offers you some ports on the
back as well so you can have a come in
one side and out the other you can just
get kind of get creative with that so I
hope that's helped answer some questions
there we'll just kind of recap this
again I would always recommend going
with as much length surface area as you
possibly can and I know guys this some
of the gestures and stuff we're doing
here I'm sure are going to end up with
some some pretty questionable memes so
always go with length over thickness if
you have the option if you don't have
the option then you're going to want to
go with the thickest rad that you can
fit in the space that you're going to
put it and still have room for your fans
and your fittings you'll find that
you'll actually get better cooling out
of a 360 30 mil rad usually then say a
45 mil to 40 or even a 60 mil to 40 it
just really depends then on a lot of
other factors like your fan speed your
fan pressure the amount of intake you've
got coming into the case the placement
of the radiator and it has a lot of
factors so anyway that's my
recommendations guys hope today's videos
actually helped you learn something when
it comes to water cooling and if it
didn't well then I'll try harder next
time but then again I am your instructor
and well there's only so much I'm
capable of especially when sometimes I'm
surprised I can actually dress myself in
the morning
bag with my kid and my wife dresses me
alright guys I'm going to get the heck
on outta here thanks for watching
today's video
and we will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
