you've probably heard the buzz
surrounding before the wind graphics
cards here with their a CX 3.0 coolers
where there is actually an issue with
the power delivery and in some extreme
cases actually burning up components and
failure of cards so we're gonna talk
about that today but more importantly
I'm gonna tell you how to fix it and the
most important what EVGA plans to do
about it now the power delivery system
here on the for the wind card
unfortunately is not being actively
cooled there is no thermal pad that was
installed between the power delivery and
the baseplate allowing the HDX cooler to
blow down on the base plate giving more
effective cooling to the power delivery
so what's happening here is the
temperatures are getting much hotter
than EVGA is comfortable with because
it's putting the parts barely within
tolerance in some extreme cases parts
and boards are failing so that's why
you're hearing about this now because
there is a plan in place to correct the
issue here for all AC X 3.0 owners now
this is only affecting the AC X 3.0
cards not the AC X 2.0 and older so
that's like the 980ti and below if you
guys have one of those it's not
affecting it's also not affecting Hybrid
owners of the 10 series or anyone with a
blower style card just the AC X 3.0 but
if you want to learn more about this
issue head on over to gamers Nexus
Stephen Burke over there did a really
good article about this and he's also
gonna be doing in-depth testing moving
forward so that he can also show you
guys the problem the fix and how
effective it really is but not only that
he has a majestic man mane of hair when
he steps outside the sunshine always
seems to be having a ray of sunshine
right on his head it's glistening and
it's majestic
and I and whatever I see Steven he's
always moving in slow-mo because of hair
is just so damn fine that wasn't that
awkward was it and when issues like this
arises when a company either sinks or
swims because problems happen all the
time if you've ever looked up technical
service bulletins you know that pretty
much everything that's ever been
manufactured has some sort of a flaw or
defect that has to be addressed so the
fact that something came up is really
not that alarming but what really makes
a difference is how a company handles it
now EVGA has this is all comes from the
top from the CEO himself that they stand
by their product and they want to make
sure that everyone is happy and
satisfied so they put an action plan
into place and I'm really happy to see
this because we've seen
issues before and a lot of companies try
and sweep them under the rug because
there is guaranteed to be financial hit
when stuff like this happens now the
first thing you should do is go and
download the new BIOS for your 1084 to
win cards now the new BIOS is gonna bump
up your fan speed just a little bit but
if you've ever taken a look or listen if
you're for the win card it's dead silent
anyway and although the GPU is running
very very cool the fans are also
responsible for keeping power delivery
cool as well so the first and simplest
fix that the sacrifice of a little bit
of noise we're only talking about 400
rpm a fan speed here which is not much
for the the ACX cooler whatsoever it's
going to bring your temperatures down
quite a bit on the VRMs before we even
apply the second fix we're gonna talk
about here in fact I even got a chance
to head out to EVGA because they invited
me over to show me what the problem was
I took a card without their fix and we
were taking a look with thermal camera
and thermal imaging what the
temperatures were like and the VRMs were
getting to a hundred and ten C which is
actually very very hot but they also
showed me what the fix applied how much
cooler it was and how much the
temperatures were kept in check by
simply adding a thermal pad and trust me
guys they're learning a lesson here
because what took a few cents per card
to apply at the time of assembly being
an oversight because I asked them why
didn't you guys put this on there it's
on every single one of your cards in the
past why did you fail to do this they
admitted it was a mistake and it was an
oversight and they learned a lot from
this so that step number one would be
download the new bios the second fix is
the application here of thermal pads for
the power delivery system now the
thermal pads are not only going to work
on the front of the card touching the
base plate and the ACX cooler it's also
going to be utilizing the back plate as
well making it a functional backplate to
help dissipate that dissipate that heat
and I'm gonna show you today actually
how to install that if you are not
comfortable taking it apart there's two
things to mention here one they do offer
a cross ship RMA for registered owners
of for the wind card so make sure you're
registered guys it's important register
your cards you should always do that
that's how you get your warranties and
stuff but they are offering a cross ship
where they will send you a card what the
fix already applied and you send them
yours to minimizing downtime so you have
to wait to send it and have it apply it
and sent back but also to if you try
this yourself and I asked
I asked the CEO himself I said what if
someone tries to apply this and God
forbid they accidentally damaged their
card then what are they screwed he said
no they will still stand by the product
so that's huge but anyway if you're
brave enough to try this yourself that's
we're gonna talk about today so let's go
ahead and do it so to do this there's a
few things you're gonna need obviously
you need your graphics card here if you
don't have a graphics card e you're not
doing this or at least you're not doing
it right
you need your kit that comes from EVGA I
don't know the packaging is gonna be
like this is the one they gave me when I
was down there but in here you have your
thermal pads it's gonna be for both the
base plate and the back plate you have
instructions and then of course you have
thermal compound because you are going
to need to be able to put thermal
compound back on the GPU now in terms of
tools I'm just using a small Phillips
head screwdriver to remove the screws
it's a magnetic tip so I'm not going to
lose those we need some isopropyl
alcohol cuz we have to clean off the old
thermal compound and then of course some
paper towels this is a pretty lint-free
paper towel but you guys can use coffee
can filters or coffee filters whatever
something that's lint-free that way
you're not gonna get lint all over there
now something else to mention here too
is this fix also is being applied to the
SD cards not just the for the win and
the process is the same for all of those
so even though we're showing it for the
win model here if you have a 1080 or
1070 superclocked they're gonna be
exactly the same process so the first
thing we have to do is take this thing
apart and this is the part that tends to
freak out a lot of people we're gonna
take out the four screws that are
surrounding the GPU first here these are
these spring-loaded screws and do
yourself a favor get a white sheet of
paper or do this on a light surface
anti-static surface would be preferred
but this would table is perfectly fine
but as you can see the screws you're
ruling all around we don't want to lose
any of these we want to put this all
back together as it's supposed to be so
make sure you get something to put these
screws in a little bowl a little cup
something so you don't lose them because
these screws are pretty during tiny
those four screws believe it or not are
the only screws that are actually
holding on the main cooler these other
smaller screws here are just holding on
the back plate and the base plate
together like a sandwich like an amazing
sandwich of cooling C so yeah I just
came apart with only those four screws
removed now don't go yanking this apart
because there are two wires
to disconnect in here there's gonna be
one right here that's kind of coiled up
and then there's gonna be another one on
the backside right here which is for the
LEDs and fans and such don't pull by the
wires get either a flat head screwdriver
and kind of pry it out or get your
fingernails in there on the side like I
am pry it out gently kind of wiggle back
and forth side to side and then they
will come out but you cannot pull on the
wires the wires are very delicate and
you will end up damaging them and then
yeah you don't want to do that but as
you can see that's what it looks like
when it comes apart so for now we're
gonna set this guy aside we don't need
him again for a little bit we are gonna
go ahead and clean off the GPU core
right here so this is where you need to
take your isopropyl alcohol or your
cleaning swabs whichever you use on some
brands make thermal compound cleaning
swabs so once you get that all nice and
clean you're gonna flip this over face
down and then we're gonna take out the
remaining screws holding these two
plates together because if you haven't
realized already there is a front plate
right here that goes under the cooler
this is the part that's supposed to be
dissipating the heat that is on the
power delivery system which is right
under here and then once you get the
last screw out the back plate will
simply come off like this as you can see
there is a couple thermal pads on there
already making contact with the
surrounding of the GPU socket right
there so there is some active cooling
that's already taking place on here
we're gonna be adding a little bit more
so once your back plate is off where we
focusing here on the front plate you
don't need to take the front plate off
there's three screws here that hold that
in leave those three in there and we are
going to be applying the smaller or the
thinner pad to the front of the base
plate here so what you want to do here
is take your pad take off the plastic
and we're gonna go ahead and without
making this stretch sometimes they
stretch when you pull them so if you
kind of pull it little by little like
this and just sort of roll it off of
there then it won't stretch out too much
and it won't hang off the sides we are
going to go ahead and apply this right
to the center of the components there
that are visible and again you don't
want it to extend beyond the length of
the card if it does you're going to have
to cut it and again these things do like
to stretch so keep that in mind
thank you no I'm just gonna ply it like
that once you do that you're gonna set
that aside and we're gonna go ahead and
grab the back plate here so now we're
going to take off the wide pad here and
just like before we're going to take off
the hard plastic part and we are going
to apply this right here in between
these four screws basically we're
covering the e and the V of EVGA and
this is already cut to length so just
find the spot where it doesn't overhang
past the backplate kind of like I have
it right there kind of firmly push it
down in place and then you can take off
the this plastic piece here just like so
serious give me a little bit of a bulge
right there that's quite all right don't
worry about it
okay before we put it back together we
obviously have to put thermal paste on
our GPU right there otherwise we're
gonna have some serious temperature
problems more so won't where are you
dealing with so one thing to note is
even though I am using a swift Tec
thermal compound here they're going to
be sending a squeeze tube compound of
the exact same stuff that they use in
the factory which you can see right
there so yours is probably gonna look
different than mine so we're just gonna
put a small drop of this right in the
center just like that and I like to put
just slightly more than I think I'm
gonna need I did a whole video on this
you guys can go back and watch that
remember I played a whole tube on there
to show you what was what could happen
and what won't happen so you guys can
refer to that if you think that's too
much anyway we do have to clean this one
off as well so take your isopropyl
alcohol and your rag or paper towel
microfiber cloth whatever you use and
then just kind of scrape that off and
make sure you get all the leftover
residue off of there so once the
compound is on there we are going to go
ahead and before we set this down we're
gonna go ahead and plug in the two
little wires that we unplugged in the
beginning because if you don't plug
these in then your fans aren't gonna
work and again temperature issues will
arise different kinds of issues worse
worse or issues than what we're dealing
with right now it's not a lot of slack
on these wires so be mindful of that
before you go just cram and down
seriously now let's hip here when you go
put this together there's a little
plastic nub right there that's got to
fit in that very top hole the innuendos
are strong with this one guys just deal
with it so anyway make sure that that's
put in there and then you will be able
to get everything to line up properly
and then you're just gonna put together
this and pretty much the reverse order
of how we took it apart we've already
got our thermal pads applied to both the
base plate as well as the back plate so
now we have active cooling all around
and you have just basically done this
fix yourself so as you can see right
here though the thermal pad on the back
plate is now going to be touching all of
the back of the power delivery there's
always a lot of discussion out there
right our back plates do back plates
really do anything a lot of them are
purely cosmetic
but in instances like this it is going
to be purely functional so there you go
guys that's how easy it is to apply the
fix to the GTX 1084 the wind but as I
mentioned this applies to all of the AC
X 3.0 coolers 1060 1070 1080 for the win
as see all of those so head over to EVGA
calm down load the new bios that's going
to be an immediate fix you can apply now
it's going to bump up the RPMs just a
little bit on your fan it's gonna do it
automatically if you have a custom fan
curve already it probably isn't going to
make a huge difference to you but the
temperatures do significantly decrease
on the back of the PWM circuit just by
bumping up the fan speed about 400 rpm
and EVGA was demonstrating this to me
they had a setup going where it was
running fur mark on two identical setups
to 1080 for the wins one with the thick
supplied with the backplate on and one
with the back plate off and the fix not
applied and without the backplate on
there was actually giving a little bit
better thermal dissipation there because
there was no no insulation happening
with the backplate there was a massive
Delta and difference in temperature
between both of the cards a simple fix
like this is unfortunately caused EVGA a
huge headache but they're handling it
the right way and like I said this comes
from the CEO they are devoted to the
customer and this is completely
independent this is this is not a PR
message that they've asked me to tell
you guys in fact I reached out to EVGA
first and was like what is going on give
me the details I want to know what's
happening here so that's when I decided
to go down
there and see it firsthand and I I am
thoroughly happy with the way that they
are handling this it's a little bit of a
headache if you have to send in your
card and get a cross ship or the fact
that you even you know would have to do
this but again they're doing this all
out of devotion to the community because
EVGA was founded on gaming and they know
that gamers are very passionate about
this and they want to make sure that
everybody is happy
so anyway even though there are
instructions that come with the kit
sometimes people learn easier by
watching someone do it so that's why I
decided to do this video where I showed
you applying the new thermal pads and
you guys were pounding my Inbox
literally every single day our on our
asking me why I wasn't talking about
this well I like to wait until I get all
the details and I'm glad I waited
because EVGA has made a statement and
kudos to them for at least admitting
they made a mistake and they're
correcting it anyway guys what do you
guys think about all of this do you
think EVGA is handling it the right way
I think they are but again what you guys
think as customers are ultimately would
make the most difference in all of this
not what I think but what do you guys
all think as a collective so sound off
in the comments or on Twitter and let me
know what you guys think anyway guys
thanks for watching it as always I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
