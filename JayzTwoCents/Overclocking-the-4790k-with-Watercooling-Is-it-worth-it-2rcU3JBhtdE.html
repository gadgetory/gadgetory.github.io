pretty damn excited not because we're
going to talk about overclocking 4970 k
cpu 7 80s 3-way monitors and all that
crap on this channel but that's because
this channel is about to cross 100,000
subscribers 100,000 pc latest like me
who think that pc gaming and pc
tinkering and overclocking is just a
whole lot of fun so with that i want to
go ahead and start this video by saying
thank you each and every one of you for
making this channel what it is today
because without you guys this channel
would be absolutely nothing but a very
dark cobweb filled cricket chirping room
which it it actually is anyway but you
guys make it all that much better
well guys I have spent the last three
days putting together an overclocking
review for you guys here regarding me
4790k now before we get started we need
to go ahead and address the elephant in
the room and no I'm not talking about
barn achlys he already went home to
Seattle now I'm just kidding guys Jerry
is actually a very good friend of mine
but if you want to poke a little fun go
ahead and head over to Twitter and say
hey Jerry Jay said you're an elephant
and let's just see what he says and how
long it takes him to figure it out that
should be fun there's a benchmark for
you alright alright all go ahead get
back on topic here the elephant in the
room for me is actually why did I
upgrade from a 3770k to a 4790k I mean
really the upgrade was going to be
minimal and marginal at best and to many
it might seem like a downright waste of
money and with that said I think a lot
of you might be a hundred percent
accurate when you say that but remember
guys I do this because I want to bring
you a first-hand experience review I
don't want to just talk about things
I've read on the internet or other
first-hand experiences I want to
experience it myself so I can give you
what my two cents are you see see what I
did there deep DC reddit I want to give
you my two cents on how I feel about
this processor so that I can speak with
first hand unbiased experience now the
setup I'm using for this obviously
project skunk works right here is a
pretty big deal if you guys want to
learn more about that system go ahead
and click right here and it will take
you over to the bill
vlogs that I did actually have more than
an hour worth of vlog footage of me
putting that together you might find it
interesting but if you don't care about
any of that and you just want to get to
the meet into the numbers well then go
ahead and stick around and listen what I
have to say the 4790k does bring some
improvements over the 4770k but remember
guys the architecture and the platform
of the die in the chip itself is exactly
the same as the 4770k so the very first
disappointing statement I need to tell
you guys is that it's not a whole lot
better in terms of overclocking and
stability when it comes to the 4770k
where Intel made its improvements is in
the thermal capabilities of the chip by
improving the Tim or the thermal
interface material between the
integrated heat spreader and the die and
they also beefed up the capacitors in
the transistors on the chip itself to
give a more stable power delivery now
remember guys codename Haswell is a
brand new architecture for Intel they've
never done anything like this and they
move the memory controller off the
motherboard and on to the chip so there
is a whole lot going on inside of there
which is why the 4790k was a refresh
that I think Intel really needed to
bring to market
now the 4790k is a pretty decent
overclocker in fact I was able to
achieve over 4.9 gigahertz stable when
it comes to a 264 running for an hour
but the problem was I wasn't able to get
there but overclocking strictly on the
multiplier fact the only way I was able
to get 24.9 stable is by using a
multiplier of 47 and adjusting the B
clock frequency to get me up over that
4.9 gigahertz threshold now eight is
sixty-four benchmarks were very very
stable in fact they were able to run for
an hour with absolutely no problems
whatsoever but I backed it off a little
bit to 4.8 because I started noticing
that I was getting some slight memory
controller issues with the overclock so
I backed it off again to a 47 multiplier
and a 100 and 2.5 B clock ratio now why
do I keep adjusting the B clock well the
base clock or the 100 megahertz base
clock that everything is calculated on
when it comes to the overclocking or the
speed of the CPU even stock speeds are
based off of that my chip would not
overclock using a 48 multiplier
whatsoever my chip just completely crap
so 47 multiplier was the best that I
could do now the problem you often
encounter when you start overclocking
using the base clock is that you
overclock more than just the CPU the CPU
multiplier only affects the effective
speed or frequency of the CPU but the
base clock affects everything the CPU
the memory controller even the PCI
Express Lanes so once you start doing
that you start messing with the way PCI
Express graphics cards work and you
start to mess up those over clocks if
those are overclocked as well now even
though I had a very stable 4.9 and even
back that base clock down to four point
eight one six gigahertz to see if I
could gain more stability my PCI Express
Lanes I started to encounter very very
finicky wonky just downright gremlin
type behavior from my SLI set up here
with my seven 80s my overclocks went
completely unstable overclock said my
graphics cards have been stable for over
six months just went completely trashed
they just didn't work anymore so base
clock overclocking just became no longer
an option for me now when it comes to
max temperatures on the cores I did have
a max temp during a to 64 maximum
stressed and heat test of an 80 83 84
and 81 on the cores now before you guys
say hold this system and behind me
is running in the 80s on the cores you
guys have to remember what a to 64 is
designed to do is designed to take
floating-point units CPU calculations
and the cash and just stress them as
high as they possibly can during the
stress test in fact it's designed to
pump as much heat into your CPU as
possible so it's full load and full heat
testing in fact when it came to the test
it was actually floating around in the
low 70s high 60s and when you take the
FPU out of it it actually was running
the high 40s in the low 50s so
temperatures on this were fantastic
while gaming and doing all of my gaming
benchmarking on this system things never
left the 40s when it came to the CPU
temperature so that is actually very
impressive considering it was running at
one point three volts one point three
volts on a 4770k with water was still
getting pretty damn hot for many people
CPUs now one of the things I did to see
if I was getting any real-world
performance increase when it came to
3770k versus 4790k
a is I went ahead and rendered that part
for of project skunkworks which was
nearly 30 minutes of video on vlog of
mp4 and/or MOV to mp4 and overlays and
sounded transitions and my 3770k took
about 55 minutes to render that at 1080
pH point 2 6 for encoder now when I did
the exact same video render with the
4790k it did it in 36 minutes memory
speeds were actually exactly the same
I'm running them at 2000 megahertz on
the RAM so I would say that there was
definitely an improvement there
in fact that's going to save me a hell
of a lot of time bringing to you guys
videos over the course of owning this
CPU now when it comes to gaming can you
guys expect any sort of improvement
likelihood the chances are no in fact my
valley benchmark scores were made pretty
much exactly the same but when it came
to 3d mark 11 I actually got a little
bit of an improvement in fact my score
is a twenty-two thousand seventy nine
compared to twenty-one thousand and some
change of the 3770k now one of the
reasons for that is the way 3d mark 11
works its CPU calculations in its cpu
speed is it puts all of the physics
rendering onto the CPU so my score rose
directly because of the physics
rendering on the CPU of the 4790k versus
the 3770 now if you guys take anything
from this video whatsoever take it as
this if you guys are gamers and you're
on a 2600 K a 2700 K 30 77047 70 this is
not worth an upgrade for you it's not
it's still going to run you over $300 in
most places and even if you live near a
Micro Center it's still going to cost
you 300 with tax you're really not going
to see much improvement in fact I don't
recommend putting 4790k in a z87 board
because my experience is with that where
a lot of the z87 bios are not really up
to par with this some companies maybe
better than others right now but my
situation with that was really really
poor in fact I was not happy with it
whatsoever I was very upset with the
performance in fact I scrapped an entire
video that I was trying to do to see if
it was even worth it fact MIT will
probably have made a good rage video but
I digress now another thing I'm asked
quite often is J I have an i-5
bla bla and the reason why I say both I
don't even care what the numbers are
after that is you're now comparing an
i-5 to an i7 the 4790k is going to blow
away any i-5 that you throw at it so if
you have a motherboard that is capable
of running a Devil's Canyon 4790k CPU
then by all means go for it now I can't
tell you guys whether or not it's going
to be worth it to wait another year for
the Broadwell CPU we know nothing about
it or at least I know nothing about it
and for all we know the z97 motherboard
may not even be fully compatible with a
lot of the features that Broadwell may
bring to the table so if you buy a z97
motherboard now it may be similar to
those who bought a z87
last year going with is Devil's Canyon
CPU now is actually giving some z87
owners a lot of headache so who knows
what the future is going to bring my
idea on this is it's never really worth
it to wait unless you're right on the
edge of when we know things tend to
release and that tends to be in June for
CPU stuff because of Computex that's
when Intel likes to debut their stuff
and usually either the spring or the
holiday season for GPUs that's pretty
much the way I look at things so guys
this has been my take on the 4790k
underwater it's a fantastic CPU that's
actually going to serve me very well and
considering I have an L 3 revision which
a lot of people have said don't
overclock nearly as well as the newer L
4 I'm actually pretty excited with this
I may try and get my hands on an elf or
just to see if it actually makes any
difference and plop it into the z97
mPower setup over there I have right
over there I'm now being texted because
I'm popular know the hookers and blow
can wait until tomorrow
send
crap this thing was on you guys have
some questions about 4790k I advise you
to take it over to Twitter the comments
section of YouTube is just so I don't
it hurts my head so if you guys want to
ask me a question bring it to Twitter
I'll do the best I can to answer you you
can also email me or head on over to
Facebook I'm reachable on all of those
platforms and I do the best I can to get
to you guys I get hundreds of messages a
week and I'm just one guy one guy with
multiple personalities but I'm still
just one guy
no I'm saying alright guys it's time to
get out of here things are getting a
little bit weird of course see you guys
