know I'm talking about new electronics
and they've to get warm they're like
what's up everyone Jay's two cents here
and I've been asked an awful lot lately
about ultra wide panels and whether or
not they're worth it and how much
graphics card you actually need to power
a thirty four forty by fourteen forty
four point nine million pixel behemoths
like this this is actually the vast
monitor if the mass drop right now you
guys can find the link to the drop down
below we will be doing a standalone
review of this monitor after we spend
some time with it but one of the things
I want to do to kind of get you know
acquainted with it is we're gonna see
exactly how much graphics power you
really need to run nearly five million
pixels today's video sponsor is dashlane
and you should definitely take your
online security serious especially in
2018 everyone is out to get you now
usually you would just make a very
complex password but then trying to
remember it or write it down somewhere
and lose it is that's not ideal either
so - Lane is a perfect solution to keep
yourself secure and keep your passwords
complex - Allah has a built-in password
Auditor that will also tell you if
you're using any duplicate passwords
because using duplicates is also just
asking for trouble now you can keep very
long complex passwords with their
password generator and I keep everything
secure by using my fingerprint here on
my mobile device but it will sync
between all your mobile devices iOS
Android and your internet web browsers
giving you one login on any device to be
able to access all of your passwords but
- Lee isn't just about passwords it's
about keeping any sensitive information
safe and at your fingertips you can
grant access to family members you can
even keep payment informations and bank
information in here making it easy to
manage all of your accounts when on the
go so what you guys waiting for start
taking your online security serious by
getting dashlane for free using the link
in the description below but if you also
start your free account today you get a
free month of - Lane premium no it's no
joke that graphics card prices still
suck and they're gonna suck for a while
unfortunately but you know what pricing
has improved on panels you can actually
get a panel like this now a 35 inch 34
40 by 1440p panel 100 Hertz for 599
bucks but we'll do a standalone video on
this like I mentioned
later on so stay tuned for that but you
want to learn more about it link is in
the description below but I'm kind of
curious I get a lot of messages from
people asking me if ultra-right it.white
is worth it it's hard to say all all
twelve wide
it's like Elmer Fudd but is it worth it
how much graphics power do you really
need I mean after all this has over
twenty five point five percent more
pixels than a standard 16 by 9 aspect
ratio when you stretch it out to 21 by 9
but you know there are some gaming
advantages to this you get more real
estate in terms of view more view angle
when it comes to game shooters have not
been the same for me since going to
ultra why they it is amazing to have
that extra peripheral periphery old
views I can't say that word
per if a real peripheral you can see
more so I got me thinking I've never
actually tested an ultra wide panel with
lower end entry level GPUs simply
because you usually with this much pixel
power or this many pixels you need more
power so we're gonna do today we're
gonna start at like the lowly 1050 and
we'll see at like high settings we'll go
with high not the highest not the low so
we'll high like right in the middle and
we'll see exactly where the sweet spot
is where do you actually get the 60 FPS
average so the benchmark I'm gonna be
using for this is Metro last light I
think it's a very well rounded title
it's still somewhat demanding and I
think it represents pretty well the
middle ground and all the benchmarks
have ever done I leave last light in
there simply because it seems to be
tough to run but realistic where you get
these benchmarks built into games and
the benchmark looks great then you get
into the game and it's trash I found
that Redax or Metro last light is pretty
middle ground on a very consistent
benchmark when it comes to realistic
performance so we're just gonna we're
gonna go through all these tests put
together some charts and we're gonna
find out exactly where the sweet spot is
okay so we ran ten different graphics
cards on the Metro last light benchmark
like I said now before you guys start
yelling at me that I should have done
more tests but we're kind of expecting
as we do other games it's gonna slide up
and down just like this so what I'm more
or less interested in is what the gap is
between cards when running a resolution
like this rather than what's the actual
number you're getting when running a
specific game with this resolution with
specific settings because then there's
an endless amount of combos that we
could do to try and mix and match those
results so that's why we're running the
high preset not the very high preset no
super sampling because this resolution
doesn't necessarily need super sampling
although MSA 2x or MSA a 2x would give
you a little bit sharper image once you
go high resolutions like this MSA is a
little bit less of a factor but it
doesn't hit you as hard when you can get
away with turning it off so that's why
we didn't run it in this and then of
course motion blur and tessellation at
normal just because we want to add some
load to the cards to see what happens
now the sweet spot right around 60fps
kind of surprised at 1066 G was an
average of 64 0.98 fps so 65 fps our 970
superclocked are super super clocked
from EVGA gave us an average of sixty
point seven two and then on the AMD side
it looks like right around an rx 580 at
59 FPS average is kind of where the
sweet spot is no no surprise something
older but still a beast like a 980 TI
was able to give us a you know nearly 90
FPS obviously 1080 TI 142 FPS it should
smash a benchmark like this but the
results were were pretty linear I mean
as the card scaled up you saw a pretty
significant jump in performance and
that's pretty much what was expected
now you could obviously based on various
titles if you if you run another title
that's more demanding like maybe rise of
the Tomb Raider is still somewhat
demanding and optimization is
questionable but you can obviously play
with your settings to try and see you
know how much more FPS you can get out
of it I mean obviously that 60 FPS
number is what we strive for as gamers
but the nice thing about this resolution
is it obviously gives you a massive
viewing angle in your game shooters you
have more of a peripheral like I said
actually said it right that time
but even MOBAs and games like World of
Warcraft you have so much viewable play
area so it's obviously gonna be a
subjective thing though whether or not
you want that extra width or if you just
want more of a hyper focused you know
regular-sized screen because I will
admit as you go up to like the thirty
four thirty five inch ultra whites what
I kind of noticed happening in
especially games like World of Warcraft
is things that are off to the side of
the monitor you kind of have to turn
your head a bit to see it and it takes
some getting used to and you might find
yourself when you switch to like an FPS
finding yourself getting killed from the
sides more than you did before simply
because you're distracted by sort of
what's going on so you kind of focus off
to the right side of the screen the left
side goes way out of focus and suddenly
you're missing enemies there we're on a
standard sixteen by nine or even a
smaller like 24 or 27 inch panel you are
have you have a more you know focus
tunnel vision on the entire screen so
that's why ultra wide czar still one of
those things it's kind of like I love it
or hate it obviously if you're using
professional workflow or editing
timelines like we are or lots of
documents and and professional workspace
then having the extra screen real estate
is amazing that's why I run to ultra
wide on my editing rig but anyway guys
that's kind of a quick video i-i've been
asked this all the time about what is
the resolution like in ultra wide how
much power does it really take to run a
screen like that or drive a screen like
that and this was just kind of a
scratching the surface of what's
possible with this but I think you guys
can see you don't need necessarily a
super high-end card to run it the higher
the better obviously but you can get
away with some pretty frugal cards on a
screen like this if you drop some of the
settings
anyway I'm willing to revisit this test
with more titles if you guys give me
some suggestions the problem is that a
lot of titles I don't have built-in
benchmarks are hard to get consistent
tests with but then again built-in
benchmarks are oftentimes a little
misleading because they're less
demanding than the actual game itself
like the Assassin's Creed benchmark is
not as hard to run as the actual game
it's unfortunate so I'm reaching out to
you guys on titles that you think would
be relevant on testing stuff like this
made me moving forward like fortnight or
something like that but I'm gonna go
thanks for watching and as always guys I
will see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
