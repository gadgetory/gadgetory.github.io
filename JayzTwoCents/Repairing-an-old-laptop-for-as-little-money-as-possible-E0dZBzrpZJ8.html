you how to kind of get a laptop that
wouldn't boot to work and we did an SSD
upgrade in my brother-in-law's laptop
you guys really like that video has tons
of views unfortunately we couldn't
recover that data off of there but this
is a very similar type video but it's
different so it's the same but it's not
well guys it's 2019 time to make some
new year's resolutions that probably
won't make it to the very first week of
February if you're anything like me
anyway but that's besides the point
because why not learn something new in
2019 and if you're enjoying what you're
learning chances are you're gonna stick
with it
that's why we've teamed up with today's
sponsor Skillshare now Skillshare has
more than 25,000 online classes and
workshops making it easy for you to find
something that is gonna interest you
making it much more likely that you're
gonna stick with it now I'm a huge fan
of the graphics design and excel classes
because I I used to excel at my old job
quite a bit but I was never very good at
it but you can learn things like pivot
tables and graph design we do graphs
around here all the time making them
look better and easy-to-understand now
usually a Skillshare membership will set
you back about 10 bucks a month but
right now for the first 250 people that
sign up using my link in the description
below you will get two months absolutely
free so what are you guys waiting for
click the link in the description below
to use 2019 as an opportunity to not
only learn something new but to better
yourself so this is my nieces laptop
it's a Dell Inspiron 15 5100 it's it's
definitely a notic ami laptop by any
stretch it's got an intel celeron in
there dual core dual thread no hyper
threading so this is basically for her
to use in school and she asked me she
said uncle Jay my computer is running
super slow can you help me out I think
yeah sure why the heck not so we're
gonna be doing some things today that I
think really kind of speaks to the
average user out there who doesn't have
a lot of money that has an old computer
they've got to make work they've got to
stretch it they can't go out and buy a
new computer they might have a couple of
bucks to spend on some upgrade parts so
we're gonna be playing around this today
to see if we can get this running
decently you'll see once we get into the
OS this thing is running so poorly that
the hard drive might as well be bad
because we can't get anything to work
and that's my bad because the way I was
able to actually get everything to back
up was I just turned
the computer here in the studio without
wireless and everything worked fine the
moment I connected it to wireless it
said ah windows update and ever since
it's been trying to update it has just
been a hundred percent pegged on CPU 100
percent pegged on the drive speed and
utilization and a hundred percent on the
memory effectively making this computer
like an update virus at this point yeah
this this just goes to show how Windows
updates when allowed to do their own
thing will just completely wreck your
user experience because this was not
terrible
this wasn't terrible but I have a
feeling the reason why she was saying it
was unusable at home and then I got it
here and I was like oh I was able to
boot it and root around windows and
backup things and had no problems was
because like I said we weren't connected
to the Internet but at home I'm pretty
sure she is connected to the Internet
this is one of those deals were the best
upgrade to this system
it's just dunking in a bucket of water
and buy a new one the point of this
video was not everyone can do that
now Phil wants to go into safe mode and
he wants to disable a lot of the said
services and stuff so that we can
actually get it to work and run
Geekbench but I kind of feel like that's
counterproductive in the sense that you
won't get a true sense of how bad it
really is because of the fact that if we
go in there and start deleting things
then that's that's gonna be
counterproductive but we will include
that process we can kind of show you how
to get it working again because not
everyone is gonna be able to do a hard
drive upgrade like we're about to do or
an SSD upgrade so there are ways to
actually get it to sort of respond now
it may look like we're at the desktop
but we still have tray missing here but
if I click the start button yeah see
nothing happens you hear the hard drive
clicking away that's because it is
completely like if I hit ctrl oh that so
how long ago did I click that that one
finally came back came up it's gotten
norton mcafee and have asked all running
so that's like kind of the first thing
we would want to do is go in there and
get that crap out of there because then
it's not trying to run an update while
also doing onedrive Oh
it's got windows onedrive installed
that's trying to sign in and sync plus
the the constant scanning of drives with
antivirus software that's probably
seeing the other antivirus software as
viruses and trying to conflict with each
other
so we are going to be starting safe mode
with networking so that we can go in
there and set things like Windows
updates to a metered connection so it
won't automatically download you just
want to trick windows into not
automatically downloading and applying
updates the other thing we're gonna do
in Safe Mode is we're gonna uninstall
those virus scanners okay so go to the
Start menu type Wi-Fi and you cannot
you're going to do this for your
Ethernet settings to so if you're doing
this through a wired connection it'll be
the same process that you're seeing here
only you're gonna also do it for
Ethernet connections not just Wi-Fi
change Wi-Fi settings hopefully when we
get a runtime error which we've been
getting suddenly click on manage known
networks click on your network go to
properties and the right here it says
set as metered connection your going to
set that to on now that's basically
doing is telling windows hey I pay for
my data at the rate we use it we only
get so much data per month or whatever
your setup may be so that will stop it
from automatically downloading updates
you'll have to manually fetch the
updates rather than having them pushed
to you so now we're just going to go in
here and go to programs add/remove
programs and then just work our way down
the list to delete a lot of this
bloatware not like i said i'm going
straight for the antivirus stuff i'm
gonna go for onedrive so you can see we
got avast free here we're gonna stall
that dell digital delivery there's so
much crap on here we're gonna be doing a
fresh windows install but like I said
what I'm trying to do right now is I'm
trying to get the main system to
actually be responsive that way you can
backup all the stuff you want to backup
now you can also backup in safe mode
like we just showed you so that's number
one but maybe you don't want to back up
and do a restart maybe you just are
trying to clean up the system a little
bit and that is what we're we're doing
here we are now going to move on to a
hardware solution because what we just
showed you can at least get your system
back working again but we've got and
this was basically bottom dollar my goal
with this was to say if you've got very
little budget some money to spend very
little budget
I've said it a million times I'm always
gonna say it an SSD is where you should
be spending your money for your first
upgrade on a computer that has a hard
drive this right here is going to
alleviate the input output of the drive
bottleneck which this computer is
significantly dealing with the other
problem with Dell machines
it's just how big of a pain in the ass
they are to service they are not
designed to be user serviced so yeah
we're gonna do what we can all right so
you just saw how much teardown was
required to actually get into this so
this is probably one of those I've had
to give a scale rating per skill rating
for someone who's never done me at this
I'd probably call it maybe a six out of
ten but a fear factor probably more like
an 8 out of 10 for somebody who's not
comfortable with this because you are
tearing things apart you're Dillon
ribbon cables and little flip-up
connectors you might have also noticed
we didn't throw in the memory because as
soon as we open it up we realize this
thing is so budget that it only has one
sodimm slot so at that point taking out
that stick and putting in one of these
is a downgrade because this is slower as
we mentioned so I'm gonna get my money
back for that but yeah look things
actually happen now when we click on
edge which whenever clicks on the
browser actually opens it's not the
snappiest thing it's still only a
dual-core 1.6 gigahertz Celeron
processor but stuff happens so that's
kind of neat to see Windows Defender is
still running that's not been turned off
you've heard me preach it a million
times an SSD even on the basic builds
people are always like no it's okay I
don't mind waiting for my hard drive I
could save a couple bucks with how cheap
SSDs are now spend the 25 bucks or
whatever it is for a 128 gig and just
put your OS on there because as long as
your operating system is not having to
share the spinning drive or the platter
with other programs are being accessed
while it's also got all the processes
running in the operating system it will
be snappy even if every program you
install is on a hard drive if the OS is
on an SSD the overall speed of the
computer will improve and that's why I
will always preach this and it's only
getting cheaper as time goes on is m dot
2 m vm e's and all those become like the
more mainstream stuff
the SATA drives are kind of becoming the
new hard drives if you will in terms of
pricing we don't have a computer that at
the start of this video was completely
and utterly inoperable because of how
hard locked it was with the bottlenecks
between love token giving her 8
gigabytes of RAM they will update that
in the future
fortunately the Terra computer although
that come hard to do it because we just
assumed it had dual slots and it doesn't
but whatever but by just by just
removing the bottleneck of a hard drive
you can see this is now usable once
again so I hope this video has that shed
some light and made you guys kind of
think about your systems that are
running slow and some things to consider
what programs are running what programs
could be conflicting multiple antivirus
in this case plus the Windows Update and
the fact that your if you have a
spinning drive especially 5400 rpm it's
more than likely this guy that's making
your computer fill extremely dated so
thanks for watching this video guys
hopefully you guys have learned
something and ten what you guys thought
down in the comments below I still have
this idea of starting a video series
where we find the most troublesome
junkyard type pcs and make them usable
not like scrapyard Wars where it's about
competing but seeing what kind of a
crazy deal can you get in terms of
something that maybe someone that was
broken or obsolete and then actually
making it usable if you guys want to see
that make sure you comment down below
and like this video thanks for watching
guys and as always almost finding her
drive around know his guys already
backed it up it's fine thanks for
watching we'll see you in the next one
so I'm actually really proud of this you
can you can really gauge how healthy a
system is a system a system is about how
fast it shuts down check this out here
he actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
