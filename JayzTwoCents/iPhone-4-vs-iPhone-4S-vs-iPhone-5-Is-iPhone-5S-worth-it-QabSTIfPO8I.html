and as I promised I'm bringing you my
iPhone 5 review I'd kind of hoped to do
an iPhone 5 versus the galaxy s3 but I
got a share a little bit of news with
you here at work on Friday I went to
pick up my galaxy and the screen
wouldn't turn on and I pulled the
battery out and stuck it back in and did
the normal Android thing and it wouldn't
turn on so thinking that the battery was
dead I plugged it in and I didn't get a
little red light saying that it was that
it was charging so turns out the phone
died it's not even a month old and I
honestly don't have anything against
Android I used Android for two years
before I ever had an iPhone but it you
know these are the kind of things I just
always turned me off about it so and
I've already kind of commented on the
iPhone 5 in Friday's tech addiction it
was a little mini review and I said that
going from the 4s to the 5 was a minimal
upgrade and I didn't feel that it was a
worthwhile upgrade for many people
however I started getting a lot of
messages from people saying that they
have a 4 so is it worth it to go from
the 4 to the 5 so that got me thinking
instead of just doing a 4s versus a 5
why don't we just go ahead and do all
three when it comes to dimensions here
the 4 and the 4s they're identical
they're exactly the same you know they
use the exact same body and so when it
comes to hardware there's the a4 chip
inside of the 4 there's the a5 chip
inside of the 4s which is a dual core
and there's the a6 inside of the iPhone
5 now the iPhone 5 they redesigned the
back here you know as you can see on
these these are you have this solid
glass on the back and a lot of people
were having breakage issues by dropping
their phones and such so what they did
was they came out with this aluminum
backing here and it's aluminum on the
side it's all unibody so the back
besides the top and the frame are all
aluminum and they have this glass on the
top and the bottom
and the reason why they have that glass
there is the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth
antenna are at the top and the bottom
and Apple claims that they needed the
glass there to get a better signal going
out of the phone otherwise aluminum
could have you know reducing signal
strength on that the iPhone 4s here has
a VGA front-facing camera same thing
with the iPhone will get mixed up here
same thing with the iPhone 4 it's got a
VGA front-facing camera the iPhone 4 in
the back has a 720p or five megapixel
camera where the 4s they bumped it up to
an 8 megapixel 1080p however on the
iPhone 5 it is still a 1080p camera but
they've made a couple of improvements to
it where now it can go much lower on an
f-stop which means it's got much better
low-light capabilities and they went
with the sapphire crystal cover compared
to the glass on the iPhone 4s and the
iPhone 4 so they claimed to get much
better image quality with that and I
have to agree with that I think the
images have been very clear on the front
though however they bumped it up to a
720p front-facing camera and yep but
forgive me I don't know the actual
megapixel I'd forgot I think it's a 5
megapixel if I'm wrong put it down in
the comments please but aesthetically
since it's aluminum versus the steel of
the iPhone 4s here it is much much
lighter and it took me a couple of days
to get used to the new weight because I
felt that it was very uh it felt brittle
to me but after getting used to it it
you know it feels nice and solid here I
don't feel like I'm gonna drop it in
it's gonna shatter into a million pieces
and one other thing that they changed
here on the bottom as you can see they
have put the new lightning connector and
they moved the headphone jack to the
bottom and this speaker is much louder
I think the volume of it is much louder
much clearer so but you know one of the
things that people were complaining
about what the iPhone 5 from the factory
is you know factories scratching and one
of the reasons why I went with the white
because I didn't want to have you know
if you haven't anodized black here you
scratch that you're going to have the
bear color aluminum showing through the
bottom or through the scratch and so
it's going to stand out a lot more so I
went with white and you know there was
complaints that the iPhone was coming
from the factory scratched so I figured
if I went with the white and the bear
that it wouldn't show up so bad
and maybe I would have gotten factory
scratching however I've got some
scratches along the top here where the
glass and the aluminum meet I've got
some in the bottom right here on the
right which are kind of difficult to see
in the video but I will put up some
high-quality pictures and on the bottom
right here right there by my thumb you
see that nick in the polished portion
right there may not show up too good
here on YouTube but high quality photos
and links to the photos will be down in
the description there that's the way
this came from the factory so you know
that's a couple of that's a gripe I have
regarding the iPhone 5 is you know the
thing comes pretty scratched which is
very annoying but when it comes to
performance now that's what we really
care about you know as you know
aesthetics are nice but how does it
perform so what we're going to do here
is we're gonna go ahead and do a boot
test on the phones I'm going to put the
4 and the 4s together because it's kind
of hard to hit three power buttons at
the same time I'm going to do this as
best as I can so when I count to three
here one two three holding down the
buttons Apple logos and let's see how
these do on the boot times here I think
it's pretty obvious that the iPhone
fours are going to lose by the say
iPhone 5 compared to the iPhone 4s
Apple's claiming that there's two times
performance of the iPhone 5 versus the
iPhone 4s with the a6 processor so let's
see if that holds up to be true or not
and there you go the iPhone 5 is up the
iPhone 4s is up and the iPhone 4 is
still looking for directions I think I
think got lost along the way but let's
see just how much difference we've got
there and if you've got an iPhone 4 as
you can see an iPhone 4 end there we go
okay guys so we're going to go ahead and
do a speed test here I'm loaded speed
test on all three of these these are
connected to the same Wi-Fi right now so
I want to what I want to compare is the
modem and the 4 to the 4s to the 5 and I
think you'll be surprised to see that
there's going to probably be some very
in speed between these three so just to
show there's no other apps running I'll
bring up the task manager on both all
are empty here away iPhone 4 thing all
right
serious fetus loading on the fourth
guess fail Wow ah and through the magic
of editing we now have speed test
installed on the 4s so let's go ahead
and run individual test now and see how
those do we'll do the four first all
right so we just ran all three
individually the iPhone 4 got 31 paying
twenty point five six down five point
one seven up four s23 paying twenty five
even down five point one four up so it's
five megabits so it's five megabits
faster than the four but the upload was
identical
interestingly enough the iPhone 5 loses
ten point five five down four point nine
six up so I'm going to restart this test
one more time so there you go the five
on Wi-Fi is significantly slower
I mean it's less than half the speed of
a 4s on Wi-Fi so go figure on that one
it's awfully disappointing okay so the
download test on Wi-Fi had me perplexed
and that was really bothering me so I
went and found out what was going on
with my phone here it turns out that I
had an iCloud sync running at the exact
same time so it was had limited
bandwidth available to the phone to run
this test so as you can see right here I
ran it again I got a twenty point five
seven so we'll go ahead and run this one
more time now just to see if the results
are yeah as you can see right there and
now we're hidden yeah twenty seven point
seven two and just under five up so okay
that's much better cuz how it's really
worried there for a second so there you
go if you're having some slow download
speeds on your iPhone maybe check iCloud
make sure it's not constantly backing up
a lot of people have complained that
iCloud has been eating up a lot of their
data so definitely check that out okay
so now we're going to go ahead and run a
cellular network test all right so now
all three I found a server we'll go
ahead and start all three of these and
let these go off to the racers obviously
3G connection in this area is pretty
poor
then again Verizon's never been known
for having very quick internet here so
the five is done so we'll take a look at
that we've got 36 pinging eight point
six two thousand three point four five
up it's a little bit below average I
typically see more than ten the 3gm
Verizon here ninety-one ping 0.08 down
0.18 up and the iPhone 412 ping zero
point zero seven down 0.2 to up that's
disappointing no matter how you cut it
so see if we can improve this iPhone 5
score at all okay so we just reran the
iPhone 5 we got a little bit more on the
down but the up went down so but anyway
14 but anyway 4G is really awesome I
really liked before G which was one of
the main reasons why I wanted to upgrade
this device because I I'm always on the
internet I wanted the speed all right so
I've got all three these devices back on
Wi-Fi here as you can see in the task
manager we have no applications
currently running and what I want to do
now is I want to do an application
launch test to see who could open up the
applications faster and I'm expecting
the iPhone 5 to win this one here
because it does have the fastest
processor see if I can do this here all
synchronize because it's not easy one
two three the iPhone 4 as a brighter
screen as want to point out because it
does have the brightness turned up
iPhone 5 is loaded iPhone 4s right
behind within use a quarter second hit
that and the iPhone 4 still thinking and
we're loaded so as you can see here
these two are very close although they
are both dual-core and they're only
within a couple hundred megahertz of
each other so this isn't
two different alright guys so there you
have I did a couple of tests there so
you can see how the four compares to the
4s versus the five and there's not much
of a difference between the 4s and the
five there's a huge difference between
the 4 and the 4s and a little bit more
between the 4 and the 5 then these two
but the question is if you own one of
these is this bad boy worth it that's a
hard one to answer it really is because
4G is the major improvement between the
4s and the 5 and I am always on the
Internet I love the 4G but it's not
available everywhere fortunately I live
in an area where 4G is pretty much all
around I mean I am in the LA area for
geez you know was rolled out here first
and in the suburbs where I am it became
you know pretty popular
I'm very rarely without 4G as you could
see though on Verizon anyway the 3G
speeds are very lackluster you know
applications open faster on the 5 barely
faster than you know than the 4s if you
have a 4 though I would probably
recommend that if you're not interested
in 4G or you're on a limited data plan I
would maybe save the money and go with
the 4s because the bigger screen is nice
some people don't like the aesthetics
though of the aluminium back with the
you know white at the top or the slate
with the black but with the 4s you're
getting you know 95% of the features
that were you know rolled out nioh s6
are available in the 4s you know you've
got the new maps app which is kind of a
joke in itself but it will get better
you know you've got Siri here you don't
have Siri here you don't have the new
maps here a lot of the functions of iOS
6 are locked on the iPhone 4 if you have
a 3GS it's no brainer obviously you
might as well just go straight for the 5
because it's a huge jump but you know
you really got to ask yourself if the
features that come in the 5 are worth it
if you don't care about 4G you don't
care about bigger screen I would
recommend saving some money and getting
a 4s or maybe getting a bigger capacity
than you would have with the 5 you know
you can get a 32 gig 4s now for $199 my
wife is really torn on whether or not
she wants to get a 5 because she doesn't
like the look of the
she doesn't like the feel woman the
aluminum bugs her she likes a solid
color back so I mean she could get a
case that would cover all that and she
probably will but you know that's a
demon in her she's got to deal with on
whether or not she wants to upgrade and
you know if you've got an iPhone 4 I say
go with the 4s honestly the 5 is a solid
phone I am fairly happy with it but it's
just interesting for them to claim that
it's the biggest thing to happen
iPhone since iPhone you know that's
their ad it really the contrast between
these two is not very great all right
guys that's been my two cents regarding
the iPhone 5 versus the 4s versus the
four I hope you found it informative I
hope you guys are checking out tech
addiction it's a series I put up every
single Friday where I talk about cool
and bizarre things in the world of
technology as well as some of the stupid
people who you find in the world of
technology and as always be sure to
