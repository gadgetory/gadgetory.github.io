talk hypotheticals for a second let's
just say you got your brand new
fandangled graphics card AMD or Nvidia
doesn't really matter this one's not new
but you kind of get the idea
right it's visual aid any been pretty
content with it and you decide you want
more performance but there's a there's a
catch you're not willing to over volt or
overclock because that's just scary and
even though I've shown you it's easy and
it's very safe and almost nothing can go
wrong you're still not willing to change
any of the core clock speeds on this
thing but you want more performance can
it be done yes it can and that's what
we're going to talk about today how to
get more performance out of your
graphics card without actually having
overclocked today's video is brought to
you by mass drop and right now they have
a drop going on the minivan custom
mechanical keyboard kit featuring
customizable key layouts tons of key cap
choices extremely sturdy metal
construction and all at only 40% of the
size of a standard keyboard over 500
units have already sold so don't wait if
you want to take advantage of this
exclusive mass drop pricing now what I'm
going to show you today actually applies
to both AMD and NVIDIA well about 80% of
it how's it going to apply to AMD well
I'll explain why it's at 80% a second
but I don't want any of the beginners or
the newbies here to get left behind so
if this sounds a bit redundant I
apologize but you've got to understand
some basics before you can actually
understand what it is we're doing so you
know how it works if you know how it
works then you can actually play around
and get some better results now Nvidia
uses what's called GPU boost to allow
the graphics card to self overclock as
far as it can that's was considered
reasonable and safe so the nice thing is
you are usually going to get higher than
advertised speeds within video graphics
cards it's cicely GPU boost works now
AMD also has a boost clock but it
doesn't have a perimeter in there that
allows it to go farther than what the
predetermined boost clock is so whereas
an Nvidia graphics card may say it has a
seventeen hundred and sixty mega Hertz
boost clock you might actually see
eighteen hundred or higher on that
because it realizes that hey we've got
some Headroom here
let's go farther so you can actually get
higher than the advertised boost beats
but AMD will go up to its boost clock
and stay there it won't actually push
itself any farther so that's why I say
80% of what you're going to see here
actually applies to AMD because we're
not going to be getting better than
boost clock performance on AMD but
NVIDIA you can see a benefit to that
extra Headroom available to it with what
we're going to do today now both AMD and
NVIDIA use two key factors to control
the clocks in their graphics cards and
those being both temperature target
which says don't let the graphics card
exceed a certain temperature that we
consider safe and the other being power
limit or how much power this graphics
card is allowed to draw at maximum now
either of those two things can cause the
graphics card to slow down if they start
to approach that threshold both
temperature and TDP independently now
the nice thing about AMD and NVIDIA is
both of them allow us to adjust the
temperature target and the power target
giving us more Headroom now why we want
more Headroom even if we're not already
hitting those limits well because as the
temperature and the TDP start to
approach those limits they will start to
slow down that way it doesn't just
suddenly bang its head against the roof
of those limits so we'll start to kind
of slow down that way we don't hit that
limit really hard and abrupt because if
it hits it really hard and it has to
suddenly pull back power and frequency
to keep from going over that's going to
be noticed in a very jarring gaming
experience of a sudden decrease in fps
and that would be very very intrusive to
your gaming experience so that's why
things will kind of slowly start to kind
of equalize as they get towards those
limits fortunately we can adjust those
and that's what we're going to do here
today and one last thing I want to
explain before we actually get into the
demo here is the reason why you would
actually want to increase the TDP and
the temperature limit if you're not even
already hitting those limits is because
how the clock adjusts itself is not only
dependent on how close it is to the
actual limit but how much farther it can
go before it hits that limit so if it
sees there's a bigger gap between where
it is and the limit it won't adjust
itself nearly as much because it goes
Wow we've got a long way to go so if
we're at 16 we can go to 90 it goes well
we've got 30 see here before we could
have to start messing with ourselves so
we can go a little farther
so let's go ahead and turn here let's
get into some testing and show you guys
exactly what kind of tangible
differences there are by adjusting just
those two things now this is EBG a
precision I'm using it because I have an
Nvidia graphics card we're doing this
with a 1080 founders edition right now
if you have an AMD graphics card
installed you can do what you're going
to be seeing here with global wot
manager inside of the Radeon settings
application so you would go into games
and go into global then go into the top
tab and go to global wot manager I don't
know if MSI Afterburner works with aim
the new AMD with our X 480 stuff but you
can also use msi afterburner on the
older AMD graphics cards so this is what
everything looks like by default and you
can see the top two we have right here
is power target at 100% and temp target
at 83 see this little arrow here points
to the prioritization
this says base your your dynamic control
on either power target or temperature
now right now we're just going to leave
it as is it's completely defaulted
there's no change whatsoever and so we
want to do is kind of get some baseline
tests here so that we can see just how
much gain we're going to get after all
this video is not about necessarily the
starting point or the particular
graphics card or the cooler type it's
about seeing how much gains you can get
by adjusting these different settings
right here so I'm going to be using
Metro last light I'm running it in 1440p
because I want to put a decent load on
the graphics card we want to see you
know we don't want to be too easy 1080p
is a little bit too easy for this card
4k is still not really the norm for more
most people so we'll be doing 1440p I'm
going to run the test three times and
we're going to because that's plenty of
time to let the graphics card get hot
and then we'll come back and we'll talk
about the results see what kind of
drop-off there is because of temperature
limits and power targets adjust those
settings and then see how much tangible
gain there really was
this Metro last light benchmark is
extremely violent I don't condone this
level of behavior although fun and in
semi glorious it's very violent Wow who
the hell my kidding I approve all right
so here's the test right here and when
this is all said and done put up graphs
that way you guys can eat more easily
see kind of the tangible differences
here so our first run member we did
three runs in 1440p ninety-nine point Oh
frames per second average and then we
came down to a ninety seven point nine
frames per second average so one FPS
drop and then a ninety seven point eight
FPS average again I want like a point
two FPS drop so our average across all
three was 98 so we want to see if we can
get this number right here the average
across all three up now let's take a
look what what's actually happening here
on the chart I know that this is going
to be like impossible for you guys to
see but I'm just gonna have to kind of
relate to
we started off 1898 megahertz but we
came all the way down to 1600 and seven
which is actually the base clock for
this graphics card because we hit 83 C
which is the maximum that's allowed I
know you guys can't read I apologize
this right here 83 C even though we hit
the maximum temperature that was allowed
we also hit the maximum TDP so because
of those two things the graphics card at
this point was pretty much reducing its
clocks because we reached the max of
both TDP and temperature which is kind
of the official definition of thermal
throttling so yeah we lost all of the
benefits of GPU boost so in long gaming
sessions uh playing games you know for
an hour - obviously it's going to put
more of a load on this graphics card
over time than just these three bench
these three tests back to back which
takes about ten minutes to complete yeah
so obviously we want to see if there's
any sort of benefit here so there was
those tests right there I'm going to
clear this history and here's what we're
going to do now we're going to come back
over here to our precision or in your
case global watt manager if you're using
AMD we are going to prioritize
temperature we are going to keep the
power target in the temperature target
linked and we're going to put the power
target as high as it would go all of
your graphics cards going to be slightly
different the 1080 happens to have a
default of
and we're going to leave it at 92 C for
our prioritization on temperature so
we're telling it don't start to really
do anything until we get up to 92 C and
then we're going to leave again the GPU
clock off set at zero memory offset at
zero we're not doing any sort of
overclocking here but what we also want
to do is we want to keep the
temperatures under control and at the
sacrifice of a little bit of noise we
are going to come over here and take a
look at the fan curve because the
factory fan curve is actually very very
very conservative on the nvidia side
they don't let the GPU go any faster
than 50% fan speed which if you're
willing to let the card get a little bit
noisier then you can actually get much
better thermals so i'm not even going to
make a custom fan curve i'm just going
to select the aggressive curve here from
the drop down there's a drop down here
if you click on will do this again here
i did it kind of quickly if you click
the curve button inside of precision X
you can go to the fan tab come down here
click aggressive click OK it's now
applied apply it you can see the fan
speed jumped up already so here's what
we're going to do we're going to do
those three tests again and we're going
to see if that average 98 FPS came up or
not now obviously with the aggressive
fan curve it's kind of noisy as you'll
probably hear on the mic but one thing
to keep in mind too is the blower style
colors on AMD and NVIDIA are very very
noisy so if you're running some sort of
a custom cooler card like AC X or
something then it's not going to be
nearly as loud well the reason why I
came on here right now is I want to
point out that we are running at
eighteen hundred and twenty three
megahertz pretty much constant right now
with the temperature sitting right
around 70 to 73 C is sitting right
around that range so as long as things
stay constant then the frequency won't
bounce around nearly as much either
which is going to give you a higher FPS
average and a better gaming experience
so anyway I'm gonna let the benchmark
continue here and then we'll see what
happened alright so the three tests are
done now this is the original test we
did our baseline if you guys want to
talk about tangible improvements
remember weighted ninety-nine point oh
eight a ninety seven point nine oh and
then a ninety seven point eight five if
you look here for a ninety eight
average now if we look at all we did all
we did if we look here again is we
changed power target to the max and temp
target to the max and a more aggressive
fan curve two teeth to keep the
temperatures under control because we
don't want to hit 90 to see that's
terrible so if we look at the
differences here
we now have an average of 104 point six
eight 104.3 four and 104 point four five
so you see there was no change
whatsoever for an average of 104 point
three three so when I say no change
whatsoever I mean between these three
tests you didn't see a steady decrease
in speeds because as it was getting
hotter it was slowing down so we
actually gained what what is that six
point three FPS on the average just by
changing temperature limit power limit
and the fan curve we didn't overclock we
didn't add any extra core but we gained
extra performance that's pretty damn
awesome if you ask me so here's how the
hairs how it worked out in chart forms
you can kind of see the temperature
differences there the power limit
average differences and then the actual
FPS differences
now I think something I get asked quite
often is well what if I have a custom
card like this with multiple fans a big
heat sink and it doesn't get anywhere
near 83 see it only sits around 75 or 74
out of the box well here's the nice
thing about these custom cards almost
all of them have an increased power
limit some of them will go as high as a
hundred and thirty percent and because
of that that means there's gonna be more
voltage available to it and that means
there's going to be more overclocking
Headroom available to it so even though
you still might not touch the actual
core clocks on those cards any
additional Headroom that you actually
give to those perimeters are going to
allow again for a higher boost clock an
automatic boost clock and it's going to
keep them from dynamically adjusting the
frequency nearly as much as I said by
keeping a huge margin of distance
between current temperature and maximum
the more distance you can get between
those two numbers the better and more
consistent your clocks are going to be
with GPU boost and on the AMD side
you're going to see nearly as much
fluctuation to actually go to the boost
clock and just stay there it won't
change whatsoever but yeah you
definitely want to take advantage of the
additional cooling on these cards
because again these custom cards still
come with a pretty conservative fan
curve and you can actually get much
better cooling out of these guys and
still not be anywhere near as loud as
you know the 747 on the test bench
behind me and you're still going to
benefit just as much you'll see better
and faster boost clocks than you would
with something like that and the reason
why you want to increase the power
target as well is because believe it or
not even though you keep the
temperatures in check you might still
see the same erratic frequency behavior
because of the power limit now if you up
the limit past 100 it means you're
telling the graphics card and the BIOS
it's okay to pool more power draw than
the rated 180 watts and you're not going
to hurt anything by that
immediate actually sets that at a limit
that's considered safe as long as you
have adequate cooling so if you're going
to increase the power target you have to
increase the fan curve with it because
it's going to give a little more voltage
which is going to give you more of the
automatic overclocking Headroom that GPU
boost is going to take advantage of so
if you were to increase the temperature
limit to the 92 C and increase the fan
curve you would see lower temperatures
but not necessarily better clocks
because it won't be able to go any far
there with the amount of voltage in the
amount of power limit that's available
to it so that's why you kind of want to
do all three of those things in
conjunction with each other and have
them work very harmoniously is like a
triangular Trinity of amazing GPU voodoo
magic so yeah
power target temperature target and fan
curve have to work together anyway guys
thanks for watching hope you've enjoyed
today's video share it with someone you
think that it will help the cool thing
is like I said this isn't brand specific
it's not graphics card specific it
applies to all graphics cards new and
old so give it a shot guys download your
favorite tweaking software they're all
pretty much free and start playing
around and see what kind of results you
get if you get some good results put
them down in the comments let everyone
else see how amazing your overclocks are
and achieve that baller status well that
said it's time to go guys thanks for
watching have some fun go out there and
make someone's day a little bit better
with that said time to go I'll see you
