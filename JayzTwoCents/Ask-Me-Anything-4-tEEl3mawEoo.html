desperately what's up everybody J's
$0.02 here and I'm gonna do something
that I haven't done in quite a while and
that is I'm going to do an ask me video
and a couple days ago I put out on
Twitter and Facebook hey ask me your
questions they don't have to be tech
related they can just be pretty much
anything I want to have some fun with
this it's literally been over a year
since I've done one of these so let's
have some fun today
built with primo components and
cutting-edge technology the asrock
extreme series motherboards make content
creation easy with support for NVIDIA
Quadro and AMD FirePro workstation cards
triple m dot 232 gigabit per second
sockets and support for ddr4 ECC memory
mean you can create your content with
confidence learn more about as rocks
line of extreme motherboards by clicking
the link down in the description one of
the things I like most about AskMe
videos is the fact that you don't know
where the videos gonna go and heck even
I don't know where the video is gonna go
I've sampled some of these questions but
I'm gonna kind of read them and answer
them on the fly right here no prepared
answers I'm just gonna be like I'm just
gonna whatever Harry Potter spell would
be to pull it out of my brain and throw
it in your face but anyway make sure you
watch to the very end because I do have
some information about things that are
coming up here on the channel especially
the end of this week so I want you guys
kind of be informed to know what's going
on regarding Tech Talk this week and all
that stuff so watch until the end of the
video alright so starting off on
Facebook
Nicoll Lodge nikka Lodge and Nikol Lodge
Christiansen hope I'm not mutilating
your name he says what blowed your Imai
most about be getting this big on
YouTube I've said it before and I think
I said it in the video I put up about me
quitting my job a year ago was I had
zero expectations for this to ever go
anywhere let alone six hundred and one
thousand subscribers as of making this
video that is an absolutely mind-blowing
number that enough people out you want
to watch an ugly guy like me talk about
computer stuff this one's a pretty good
one by the way Eric Huber I think it's
Huber says how is balancing family life
with social media I see a lot of people
tend to post everything about their
personal lives to their audiences
definitely not saying that you
and I wonder sometimes how what their
families think about it he says he
naturally assumes that there's a general
understanding but sometimes I wonder
what family members of YouTube
celebrities think about the lifestyle
well ultimately at the end of the day
we're all human at least most of us and
the general reaction the friends and
family tends to be very similar of that
of the viewers of is that a real job
it's YouTube really a real job
and then they see the potential income
and they're like whoa how do how do I do
that
but ultimately I don't put anything on
camera and any my vlogs on the vlog
channel or on the tech channel that
anyone around me wouldn't want aired so
if Little J doesn't want to be on camera
or she doesn't want anything shown that
day or the wife or whatever I don't show
it I respect everyone's privacy as much
as I want people to expect respect my
privacy I respect everyone's around me I
don't go
shoving cameras in people's faces which
is kind of the nice thing about not
being a like a daily vlogger or a
lifestyle vlogger I just do the tech
stuff and most of the time I'm just shut
up in my you know my mom's basement here
like you would kind of expect right no I
don't really live with my mom in her in
her basement it's California we don't
even have basements
you know cause earthquakes they'll fall
in on you I'm starting to think that all
of my facebook followers are foreign
because this one comes from sandara's
gook cows Kaz how much this skunk works
pull from the wall while gaming that's a
good question in fact I already have my
kilowatt out and I plan on doing a video
about the amount of power that computers
pull from the walls including this big
behemoth behind me which by the way that
is orange fluid not red it's just the
way the camera looks you know whatever
Brian Schaeffer says any tips for
followers that want to start their own
channel or make tech videos the only
advice I have quite honestly is do it
for fun and expect nothing do not expect
to become a famous do not expect to
become rich do not expect to get things
for free just do it because you love it
that's how I started anyone that starts
with any of the three intentions I just
said to get famous to get rich or get
free stuff are doing it for the wrong
reasons and you will fail your audience
is going to see right through anything
that's fake and they're gonna call you
out on it regularly in fact they're
gonna call you out on things that aren't
even there but I digress the fact that
if you are trying to do this for
personal gain other than the enjoyment
of making videos and sharing a passion
for
don't bother no one will watch Nathan
Worland says what got you interested in
the Z platform I think it's one of those
things that ever since I was a kid
seeing like the Datsun 280z I just
thought the car was really really neat
looking it really came down to the way
it looked and then as I got older I
cared more about performance and I kind
of forgot about the Z platform for a
long time and then once I got back into
cars I tried out the 350z and you guys
all know how that went got rid of the
350 got the 370 in the rest is history
there's a lot of cars I would ultimately
love to try out because I'm a car
enthusiast but the Z platform and when
it comes to imports is by far my
favorite platform here's a good one
Alex Goulet Galit Goulet Goulet maybe
it's French he says how much do you
actually spend on parts versus what
manufacturers give you to review it's
actually a good question it's kind of
three different things that take place
here there are a number of parts that I
purchased simply because I don't just
write emails and be like hey I need this
send it to me so if I need something
that I don't have
I'll just buy it for the most part
sometimes I'll ask a sponsor to get
involved like from memory or something
like that but if I need hard drives that
I don't have I I don't even have a hard
drive supplier I have some SSD suppliers
but I will just order it from Amazon or
I'll go out to Fry's or Micro Center or
something like that processors though
and all the time I've been doing this
channel I've only received one processor
for free a technically - one AMD 8350
which was in the in AMD giveaway build
and then the z170 the 6700 K the 59 60 X
- 59 30 K the 5820k all that stuff I
bought I bought a whole debt that's out
of pocket Carlo London LAN pata young
tata says of all the things people ask
you to give them for free
was there an odd request that surprised
you
yeah someone wanted like a used pair of
my bike shorts I mean it Gerry I'm not
giving you my bike shorts stop asking
Nathan Bingman s what was the most
off-the-wall weirdest thing you were
asked to review I put this on Twitter
actually and I think it went to Facebook
as well I was actually asked to review
condoms I thought it was an April Fool's
joke
it happened on April's April 1st but the
company was lid
gently asking me to take their condoms
which apparently are made from some
synthetic material that's supposed to be
super plentiful or whatever and and
talked about safe sex and STDs and stuff
to my audience and be creative with
visuals about a condom yeah they were
they were serious about that how to use
a condom
Benjamin Harlow says what do you think
about use PC parts I think if you trust
where they're coming from there's some
sort of a measurable history of what the
card has gone through or the CPU or
motherboard or whatever it may be I
think use parts are definitely a good
way to save some money and get something
better especially if the seller is like
on a forum like hard forms or
overclocked botnet and they have good
buyer feedback and seller feedback then
I would definitely recommend doing that
you can save some money and get better
hardware I've done it in the past lots
of my builds had used hardware that kept
going and going for years
I see nothing wrong with it as long as
you trust the seller and they have good
feedback kärpät sultan epic name man
is it true that jerry AKA barnak Lee's
worked at Microsoft
alright I'm gonna blow your minds here
no no so hope you're sitting down all of
you Jerry aka Barclays did in fact work
at the Microsoft food court that's to
borrow for 15 years it is it is
absolutely true confirmed today
Klaus Bello says if he could change
things you did in the past what would
you do you know I am of the mindset that
changing our past can dramatically alter
our future and we don't know if that's
gonna be for the better say for instance
I didn't finish college if I'd gone back
to college what I've gotten a different
job and it would have put me necessarily
on a different path to where I never
would have ended up where I am today so
I tend to take all of the mistakes that
I've made in the past try and learn from
them and make a better future out of our
failures if we always succeeded and went
back and changed the things that we
failed at I don't believe we'd ever
succeed so I wouldn't change a damn
thing quite honestly Daniel Hernandez
says how do you balance it all what's
your driving force and why YouTube
videos I have covered this in the past
I'm not going to go into this story
again in fact I recently talked about it
in my one-year self-employed video
it all started on a dare and my driving
force is you guys you guys there I feel
like quitting all the time I'm humans
naturally become complacent no no like
yeah this is boring I don't do this
anymore
and you start to kind of want to give up
but every time I read your guys's
comments I say you're doing an awesome
job I love what you're doing I love your
videos I can't wait for your next upload
that drives me to keep going and make
great uploads for you guys and on the
flip side the haters out there going
you're ugly you're fat you're terrible
at this kill yourself why do you keep
doing this I keep doing this - because
it pisses them the off and pissing
off haters is probably one of my
favorite pastimes and if that's you
right now and I just triggered you good
spikey Mikey on Twitter says when I get
my Mustang finished do you want to run
them lol you mean run them over like the
crowds and oh so here's one from at
Michael G Powell and this kind of goes
with a little bit like the one we talked
about earlier on Facebook
it says prior to YouTube going full-time
how did you find fitting and tech and
gaming into a schedule with a job family
time chores etc I'll be honest I have
less time to gain now than I did when I
was working full time well working full
time without YouTube I should say
you know you go to work you get off at a
certain time you come home you sit down
you relax you kick off your shoes you
kids jump up in your lap if you have
kids anyway you spend some time with
that I mean do dinner they go to bed
maybe get in some games for a few hours
go to bed 10 11 12 at night get up in
the morning you get six seven hours of
sleep and then do it all over again
however now being self-employed you know
there are or maybe you don't know there
are no regular hours in this it's all
hours of the day you're dealing with
working and evening work in the daytime
and as much as you try and set yourself
a set schedule you have to work until
the work is done you can't just be like
oh it's four o'clock I'm done I'm out
and clocking out gone it doesn't work
that way so I have less time now at the
end of the day because I'm an editor I
am a on screen personality I have to do
the research I have to do my bookkeeping
my billing I'm gonna do my invoices what
I can own this video I've got to write
some invoices I'm gonna prepare for a
trip that I'm leaving on tomorrow at the
end of all this video I haven't even
started packing or preparing for that
yet
I've got to make sure that every single
cog in this gear system is smooth
greased and
running and it's when you're doing this
by yourself unfortunately gaming takes a
huge backseat and I just don't get to
game anymore like I would want to so I
find balancing my time now is harder
than it ever was before
at res no says how did you meet coconut
monkey we actually played on the same
semi-pro paintball team we played air
ball over at ASG in Southern California
and we were friends ever since
basically he looks at me kind of like a
mentor I think I'm 10 years older than
the guy every time he comes over I feel
a little creeped out by the age
difference at go to tech reviews on
Twitter says will you be sub updating to
Bridewell eat out of the gate he's thin
he says even though I think I know the
answer I don't know the answer so I
don't know how you know the answer but I
don't know if I want to update
immediately 10 cores 20 threads that
sounds freaking amazing it's a lot of
work to get to the CPU in here and again
like I said earlier I don't get supplied
CPUs I mean I do have a somewhat of a
working relationship with Intel I don't
know if I'm gonna get one
they haven't approached me about
anything so I have no idea and if it's
you know $1,000 or more that's a lot of
money to drop for two cores and four
threads on something that's already
exceeding what I need my computer to do
so I really don't know the enthusiasts
in me wants it the practical guy inside
of me basically just says you know at 68
Hemi dart says what are your future
goals for your channel and just life
I'll be honest with you I feel like I'm
lacking some long-term goals right now
and I'm trying to figure all of that out
I do think expanding this into a little
bit more of some sort of an empire more
than just myself would be amazing but
I'm a micromanager I don't think people
like working with me because I'm a
micromanager I tend to be a little bit
of a hard-ass when it comes to work
ethic and I don't I think I would have
to be very very selective over who could
work with me not to mention the person
who works with me has to be able to deal
with me because I'm not necessarily the
easiest guy to work with
when it comes to actual work ethic yeah
hanging out with me having fun making
videos that's one thing but when it
comes to business I'm a bit of a
hard-ass it was one of the reasons why
at my old company I tend to work my way
up through the ranks pretty quick I
wouldn't say pretty quickly but pretty
steadily because I was known as the kind
of guy that was like
 kick-ass don't take names and
just get done and that's my ethic
and sometimes people don't mix very well
with that I think that that leads to
like a bigger problem in the world right
now when it comes to people wanting
things and having to work for it I tend
to be the opposite
Myron's fear Moran's fear sir I know I'm
wrecking your name I apologize buddy he
says have you ever been tired of YouTube
to a point you thought of quitting yes
just like I said earlier to the other
question that sometimes you know you
guys are the drive that keeps me going
sometimes the audience is what makes me
want to quit to know that to tell you
the truth and yeah I think we've all
reached a point to where we've
considered quitting YouTube but I'm not
I try not to be a quitter I've quit many
things in life YouTube has been one of
the most successful things I've ever
done and I just don't I don't want this
to end I want to enjoy it I want to
adapt with it I want to evolve the
ever-changing landscape of being a
youtuber because that keeps things
pretty exciting I just hope that I can
prepare for my future enough to where if
I everything just falls out at the
bottom of the floor to where I can just
change gears and do something different
but I think I've created a name for
myself now to where I can I can
experiment outside of you to move
YouTube a bit you just kind of see what
happens at my own rule says why EVGA
over a soos well I've used EVGA for
years and years and I've used Asus
products in the past as well but when it
comes to sponsored bills and things I
would like to sample other brands than
just EVGA they are arguably one of my
favorite to be honest Asus will not send
me anything
Asus will not even respond to emails
anymore I've had some conversations with
them in the past asus basically just
will not send anything it goes a little
bit deeper than that but yeah if you
guys are wondering why I don't do Asus
on this channel because they refuse to
work with me pretty much what that said
guys it is time to get out of here
thanks for participating in this ask me
maybe I'll do one of these a month or
something I don't know anytime I've ever
said I'll do something once a month I
never do but it's time to go I have to
prepare for a trip I'm heading to an
Nvidia event tomorrow from the time you
guys are seeing this tomorrow morning
I'm getting on a plane and I'm gonna be
gone till Sunday so I'll be doing some
vlogs there hopefully you guys will
enjoy that there's gonna be some other
tech youtubers there so it should be
interesting but yeah that's why I'm
doing this kind of a quick
easy video because quite honestly I've
got a lot to get done so I hope you guys
bear with me but anyway yes that also
means because I'm going to be gone
tomorrow it's very unlikely that I'm
gonna be doing Tech Talk
I have no idea what the hotel Wi-Fi is
gonna be like so I I don't think Tech
Talk is gonna be happening this week I
am sorry for that I know we do that a
lot we miss Tech Talk quite often but
remember Tech Talk for us is about kind
of just hanging out the end of the week
it's not a revenue generator or anything
for us so it's unfortunately sometimes
when time runs out Tech Talk has to take
a backseat anyway I am gonna go guys
thanks for watching hope you guys
enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A keep asking your
questions and maybe I'll make it into
the next episode with that I'm gonna
reach always bored here because again I
still have absolutely no camera man see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
