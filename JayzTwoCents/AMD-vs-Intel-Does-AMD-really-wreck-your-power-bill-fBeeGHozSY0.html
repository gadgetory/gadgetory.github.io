Jays two cents bringing you a video
about these two guys once again as if
this horse hasn't been beaten to
absolute death we're gonna go ahead and
we're just gonna beat it a little bit
more oops it doesn't matter whether or
not you're an old school builder like me
or a new school builder looking at
building your first computer we all are
just constantly up in arms about whether
or not you should go with AMD or Intel
the industry is constantly changing and
it doesn't help but you have fanboys on
both sides trying to lure you in to
their side to strengthen their numbers
or whatever the reason may be don't
understand fanboys to be honest with you
so today we're going to talk about how
much it really does cost you to go with
AMD versus Intel in terms of power
consumption and just how long it'll take
for you to make your money back if you
choose to go with the more power
efficient Intel so that's why for
today's video we're going to go ahead
and talk about the energy consumption
and we're going to turn it into energy
dollars on your energy bill and find out
just how much you really do or don't
save when it comes to going with Intel /
AMD now I'm going to try and make
today's video as easy to understand as
possible we are going to be talking
about numbers and equations and values
so it might go a little quickly for some
people but I'm seriously gonna do my
best to make it as understandable as
possible now we've got two arguments
kind of going on here
one AMD is more power inefficient than
Intel and that is absolutely true AMD
does use more watts than Intel and when
you overclock both CPUs the difference
becomes even greater AMD takes more
energy to overclock
so that's why for the sake of today's
tests we are going to talk about stock
clocks vs. / clocks and we're going to
compare those in two separate scenarios
to try and determine how much money
you're really going to spend extra on
your energy bill by going with AMD the
system wattages we're talking about full
system wattage from the wall and these
are just the cpu loads we're not talking
about GPU that's a whole
ball game it's a whole nother layer to
this whole equation about which is more
efficient and once again you have
different options there as well so for
the sake of today's video you're talking
about cpu load only now because wattage
is one of those things that is just is
it's a hardest variable to control
because everyone systems are different
everyone has a different number of fans
different power supply different
motherboards different drives installed
it could vary all over the place so what
I did was I went to the most common tech
forms like bit tech hard OCP overclock
dotnet Tom's hardware and I took their
benchmarks and their charts and I just
averaged them out to give me an average
system wattage to use for the sake of my
test
now for the 4770k wattage from the wall
at stock speeds it was 176 watts from
the wall at stock speeds and when you
overclock it it's about 251 watts from
the wall so that is our 4770k system for
today's educational piece now the AMD
side the 8350 at stock was pooling 213
watts from the wall and overclocked was
pulling 328 watts from the wall remember
these are averages so that's we're going
to be using for today now for the
kilowatt rating because remember guys we
are talking about your power bill and
again that's another variable that I
have no control over some people pay as
little as seven cents per kilowatt hour
some people pay as high as 28 cents
maybe even more per kilowatt hour
depending on your region here in
Southern California our averages are
actually much higher than what I'm using
for this test but the national average
is about fourteen cents per kilowatt
hour so that's what we're going to go
with here now remember guys these
wattages are full load wattages we don't
care about idle because quite honestly
idle is so low it would take years and
years in using news and years for it to
even come into play when it comes to
cost difference of these CPUs so we are
going to be using a 14 cents per
kilowatt hour at 4 hours per day load
100% load at 365 days per year gives us
a nice baseline kind of a high baseline
but it gives us kind of a worst case
scenario of what energy costs could be
for this so that's 4 hours per day 365
days a year
14 cents per kilowatt hour now in Intel
at
176 watts at stock speed we have an
average energy usage of 35 dollars and
97 cents per year I put that up here
somewhere
I don't fail and post-edit because you
know like I kind of leave notes to
myself here like number J when you dump
the video you have to go buy milk kitty
litter and summa mentionable now for the
AMD for the same system at stock speeds
we are looking at forty three dollars
and fifty four cents per year so that
gives us a cost difference between AMD
and Intel of 7.50 seven cents per year
now when you overclock it we already
know that the gap gets bigger between
the energy usage of the two CPUs so
overclocked to four point eight
gigahertz on both of those systems we
had an Intel usage fifty one dollars and
thirty cents per year and AMD was sixty
seven dollars and four cents per year
for a cost difference of fifteen dollars
and seventy four cents per year Energy
Bill effect AMD versus inta so right
about now you should be able to start
seeing that that Intel fanboy ISM
argument of I don't go with AMD don't do
it it uses so much more energy it is
gonna cost you a billion dollars more
the end of the year you don't want to do
that it'll give you tumor big huge tumor
we're fighting two choppers
I sincerely apologize for that now that
was just stock speeds if you overclock
it you make the gap a little bit bigger
the numbers get a little bit better but
you're still talking eight point nine
years to make your money back that you
spent on going with Intel over AMD if
you use the argument of power
consumption it's not a valid argument
people I don't care who you are I do not
care if the Pope himself or Barack Obama
says go at Intel because it saves energy
you're gonna spend more money
out-of-pocket and you're going to
upgrade long before you ever saw any of
those returns on your energy costs now
remember that's four hours per day 100%
full load I don't think anyone does that
not even me as a YouTube producer and
I'm constantly rendering something on my
machines doesn't even come close to that
and if you have a lower like that tense
per kilowatt-hour average it's going to
take even longer more than 20 years to
get your money back by spending a
hundred and forty dollars more on Intel
if the sole purpose was to save energy
on your energy bill it just doesn't make
sense people now if you're one of those
few fortunate people like myself who
happen to live near a Micro Center the
numbers are a little bit better but
still staggering for instance if you
paid two hundred and sixty-nine dollars
for your 4770k from Micro Center versus
the hundred and seventy nine dollars you
could have gotten to 83 54 it's going to
take eleven point nine years to make
your money back by going Intel or if you
overclock at five point seven two years
over the AMD if your overclocked now the
five point seven two years some of you
watching this video may have actually
owned your computer that long many of us
have not I tend to do an upgrade
annually so I would never use the energy
consumption argument when it comes to
why you would choose Intel over AMD now
that's not to say that Intel doesn't
have its benefits over AMD and vice
versa there are a ton of arguments on
both sides of the fence many of them
very very valid but with the amount of
people that ask me on a daily basis and
we're talking probably a dozen messages
a day from people asking me you know I
heard on the forums that they study that
if I go with a and B I'm gonna spend
about 50 dollars more per year running
that AMD versus if I went with the
equivalent Intel guys that's what it
sounds like to me when people are saying
that because you're repeating what you
hear on forums and in different videos
by people who just may not be nearly as
coherent when it comes to the actual
energy argument when it comes to these
CPUs I listen here if you want to buy
something for energy consumption and
save money then you're going to be
looking at something like an APU because
you're not going to even have a graphics
card in there which is going to save you
a ton of energy less tumors and you
could a cure cancer at the same time
think about it it's huge
okay guys I hope this has helped you at
least take one invalid argument and just
ignore it when you hear it if you see
someone using the argument of well AMD
uses so much more energy than Intel
you're going to pay for it on your
energy bill link them to this video and
hole
fully it will open their eyes if they're
not then just take it for the fanboy
that they are so guys has been Jayce two
cents really hoping to piss off those
people who truly think that the energy
bill is a valid argument to be an Intel
fanboy so there it is see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
