aka barnacle EES actually that is not
the right intro welcome to my unboxing
and first look video of the nope That's
not me either
hey Gul is Tony Tom Logan hip nope
that's not deaf definitely that's not me
what's up guys you're watching Jays two
cents and that sounds a little bit more
familiar hey what's up guys Jays two
cents here just kind of had a little bit
of fun with some of my favorite
youtubers here on on YouTube but today
we're going to take a look at a product
that's very unique and interesting and
that is the Phoenix at or mechanical
keyboard they classify themselves as a
boutique brand so let's go ahead and
find out exactly what that means and
give this thing the old js2 sense okay
so when I first took this thing out of
the box I was a little bit shocked it's
a lot more silver and metallicky than I
expected it to be I thought it was going
to be a much darker color until I read
the press release and realized okay I
understand why they went with this kind
of style
apparently the designer is a very big
fan of Kubrick's 2001 a Space Odyssey
because they basically used the monolith
from that movie as the inspiration for
the design of this keyboard they state
that it has a metallic coating on here
or an aluminum coating it doesn't mean
it's made of solid aluminum in fact it
just looks like it has a very metallic
sparkly paint job to it which I'm
assuming is what they're referring to as
the aluminum coating it is Cherry MX
brown switch only which unfortunately is
going to probably piss some of you guys
off and it is very high quality now a
couple of things that's interesting when
it comes to the physical aspects of this
keyboard are the key caps themselves
they are they advertise that they're
very lightweight and I can attest that
they are very lightweight which means
it's very good for precision typists and
elite gamers as they basically say now
one thing that it does lack is any sort
of backlighting whatsoever so if you are
not fluent in QWERTY QWERTY it's always
fun to say
QWERTY then you're probably not going to
like using this thing in the dark or at
night if you're like me and you have all
the keys memorized it's not really a
problem in fact most of us can get our
fingers on WASD without even having look
so the only lights are anywhere on this
keyboard are up here in the top right
corner and it's num lock scroll lock and
caps lock we all know how important caps
lock is it's very important to have caps
lock it's the only way we have to
express our raw emotion here on the
internet including a whole bunch of
exclamation points at the end of you mad
bra now I mentioned earlier that this is
a boutique brand and that's not gonna
make some of you happy and in fact I'm
one of those people that typically say
is far away from boutique brands because
that tends to mean high price for the
sake of a name kind of like coach purses
or Gucci or any of that crap it's
someone's name on it but it's not
necessarily that much better now where I
can best guess that they've come up with
the pricing for this is not so much the
fact that it's a boutique brand but I
can attest to the fact that the build
quality of this keyboard it's probably
one of the best that I have ever felt
almost every keyboard I've ever played
with at some point has had a key kind of
get stuck or kind of just not respond
very well even with the cherry switches
because that has to do with the quality
of the key cap on how well the key moves
on but down well they use high quality
key caps on this which are very
lightweight and so the key caps
themselves and the keys when I push them
they all feel identical now I get it
guys it's a Cherry MX brown they should
all feel the same but I felt some
keyboards where you know all of the
different keys kind of had a different
feel to them because of the backplate in
the way it was put together I'm speaking
a backplate this thing does have a a
metal reinforcement in there it's a gold
metal reinforcement in fact I can't take
the key off necessarily yet to show you
guys because for some odd reason mine
didn't include a key cap puller I don't
know if they meant to give me one but it
didn't come with one so anyway I'll just
have to kind of show you guys that and
some glorious fabulous looking b-roll
now when it comes to connectivity with
your computer it does have a detachable
USB right here on the back and I have
that cable right here which is a sleeved
cable with gold plating to give you an
ultimate nice clean connection
when it comes to length of the cable it
is one Jay's arms band which I have
absolutely no idea how long that is I'm
going to say probably six feet which in
my professional and gamer opinion is not
long enough because it's not long enough
on my desk to go around behind my
monitors down under the desk and up to
my case my not hundred D so it's not
long enough which is not good my opinion
also not only does it have the USB
interface it also comes with the ps2
interface which gives you you know full
and key rollover as well as an ultra
fast response for gaming because we all
know ps2 connections are much much
faster than USB interface so it's good
that they include that so we've been
nice if they gave me a key cap holder
when it comes to the bottom of the
keyboard look at that that is
minimalistic as I've ever seen it the
thing that disappoints me is it lacks
the pop-up feet that get this thing at
the you know the adjustable typing angle
now they've already it advertised that
they feel that they've already kind of
created the angle on there see that
angle they up the optimal angle but some
of us like a flat keyboard some of us
like an angled keyboard so be nice if
for the price which happens to be 163
dollars for this keyboard they gave you
the option we all like to type at
different angles and stuff so just give
us the option make it flat and then let
us pop it up like I know it might
cheapen the keyboard looks and feel a
little bit but choice is also a very
powerful marketing strategy as well now
when it comes to the typing of the
keyboard I do honestly feel that the
quality of this is there now there's one
other a physical aspect to this that
makes it a little bit different than
other keyboards and that is that it does
have a double polymer coating or double
polymer layer inside under the key caps
and the back plate that make this thing
pretty much accidental spill proof and
whatnot it has very good protection
against spills and you know we all like
to eat and drink at our desks more
gaming and watching Jays do scents and
stuff every accidents happen we have
kids and stuff so it does have very good
splash and spill protection I wouldn't
go trying to use this underwater or just
go I'm going to test that and pour a
whole can of soda in there trust me
you're not going to be happy okay so one
last thing to cover about this keyboard
which I almost forgot is the fact that
when you buy this keyboard you're
assigned your own personal assistant
basically your own
a representative of the company for this
keyboard so if you ever have any issues
where you need to have an RMA or
anything like that you get a little
letter here explaining who they are and
their name their direct phone number
their direct email and all that stuff so
that instead of sending off a problem to
some generally inbox or RMA inbox and
waiting for a reply you get somebody
that you can physically speak to now as
long as that person is always with the
company as long as you have the keyboard
I don't see that being a problem I would
hope that if there were some you know
some staffing changes at the company
that they would hand that stuff off to
someone else and that they would you
know kind of reach out to you and say
hey I'm your new manager blah blah blah
so you got a human interaction anytime
that you can contact for some sort of
support with the product and there's
really no other company that offers that
level of support so it is what it is so
guys that is he at or mechanical
keyboard from Phoenix tell me what you
guys think I think it's a pretty awesome
product I'm gonna give it to my wife to
use on her desktop I finally got her to
agree to let me build her her own gaming
desktop now if I get her to actually
play some games on it and not turn it
into a really expensive Facebook machine
but I like the fact that it has the
water resistant properties to it because
as much as I love my wife she has a
little bit of a klutz and please don't
tell her on Facebook that I said that or
Twitter or whatever cuz then she'll get
really mad at me and she's the boss
anyway guys tell me what you think about
this keyboard I'm gonna get on out of
here got some really fun stuff coming up
on the channel here very very soon
another fun announcement in a
collaboration with some other youtubers
at you guys hopefully we're going to
enjoy hit me up on Twitter if you want
to talk tech Facebook and the website
J's to CENTCOM and as always see you
guys in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
