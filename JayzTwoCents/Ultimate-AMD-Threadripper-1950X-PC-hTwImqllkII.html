comm
whether it is project symbiote is done I
think this project took longer than any
build I've ever done from conception to
finish because I knew when thread Ripper
was coming out but I was gonna do a
custom build I told them I was gonna do
a custom build at the SIGGRAPH event but
before that I had already gotten this
case and I was really kind of confused
like how am I gonna use this case they
didn't ask me if I would do a build in
this case I requested this case because
it was so different and so unique which
really meant I had a clean slate and a
canvas to start on typically you build
in a case in a custom build it's just a
big rectangle and if you put a bunch of
stuff in there you try and come up with
a theme usually it's just a color theme
unless you're a modder then you do some
really cool and fancy shit to the case
but I was really kind of like how do I
take a case with all these crazy angles
and do a theme with it well we sat down
we thought about it and symbiotes became
sort of the theme because of the fluid
that we're using a lot of people have
misidentified this fluid on social media
and you guys should be following on
Twitter and Instagram and all that
because pictures of the progress of the
build of this and some sneak peeks were
up there so definitely worth checking
out but I'll let people have
misidentified this fluid as Mayhem's
arora and it's not it's not a copy of
Mayhem's arora it's not even the same
chemical makeup as aurora this is this
is a very cool stuff right here
and it's not out yet though this is the
primo chill view and it should be out
soon and one of the testers for this and
we've been testing it three machines now
checking for fallout checking for clogs
checking for temperature changes and so
far it's holding strong Nick your system
still running the green one right
everything's still good with that one
it's been about a month well over a
month to be running that so far the
color hasn't changed and it hasn't
fallen out or dropped whatsoever because
there's nothing to fall out this stuff
is not has no weight to it when you stop
the build or you stop the pump from
running it all just stops where it is
and it doesn't flow backwards it doesn't
fall there's no weight to it it's the
trickiest thing you've ever seen so
definitely keep your ears to the ground
for when that fluids gonna come out so
huge thank you to primo chill for
sending that and letting us test it but
obviously the star of this build is the
loop right so performance - PC sponsored
the loop they set me all the fittings
and stuff that you see they sent me the
blocks they also sent me the pump
reservoir combo from excess PC and then
primo chill sent me their new radiators
which they custom power
they are the Eskimo right xmo eczema
radiators and their custom powder coated
for this bill the same thing with the
fittings the revolver fittings the tops
Rob custom powder coated to match the
gunmetal on the motherboard and the
gunmetal that I painted on the case and
so we've got all tied in nicely so huge
shout out for those guys sending that
and then the other stuff I already had
like a and B sent the CPU and then
already had the 90 or the 1080 TS keep
saying nice guys we keep going back like
a year and a half I do that why do I do
that Nick eighties or you go back to
voodoo ethics voodoo voodoo three go
back to a voodoo three graphics card 16
megabytes but as I said the loop is the
star of the show it looks very blue on
camera trust me it's not blue it's
silver and they're white LEDs it's just
white LEDs always look blue on camera
which makes the fluid look blue but it's
not your eyes definitely see this
differently that looks on camera I'm
gonna probably changing out the LED
strip I actually got this LED strip from
autozone from like the automotive
lighting section basically it's like the
ricer aisle I got it out of there as
lighting to hold me by it needs a warmer
light though so we'll be playing around
with that the loop was something I was
really torn with and here's why because
I started to bend all the tubes with a
very traditional 45s and 90s and matched
all the angles of the case the problem
was it didn't complement it Nick and I
were sitting there looking at it and I
went you know what I've got this crazy
idea because I had most of the loop
already bent and done so what if I heat
the tube the whole tube and I start
twisting it and compressing it and
stretching it and putting kinks in it
and bulb and bulges and it started to
look like like veins like like it's a
biomechanical thing and so we started to
play around with it and I started put
some stuff up on Instagram and Twitter
and immediately it was like getting shot
down but I was like 50/50 it was like a
love-hate and and that's fair because
Nick and I both were looking at this
going I don't know
I don't know it's just we're trying to
envision the final product based on only
a couple of pieces that were contrasting
the very the very abstract and very
sharp like meticulous case that this is
right all the angles are there for a
reason they're placed for a very
specific look we were going against that
look we were going against the grain
by coming up with these crazy bins and
some people and so she made it got mad
they're like that looks like crap and it
looks like a bunch of failed bins which
believe not those were harder to bend
than any standard Bend for me I burned
the hell out of my fingers too he's had
to bend the whole tube the entire tube
from end n had to be heated and I even
had gloves and I'm still burning my
hands because I was twisting and pushing
and stretching and yanking and I was
doing a lot of really well looks like
suggestive stuff with it but that's what
we ended up with and looks like a vein
system right symbiote its infecting the
computer and that's what we wanted so we
went extremely against the case
aesthetic with a very biomechanical
looking interior where the inside almost
looks like it's alive right you've got
the conduit here
what Nick calls a condo I call it split
loom but whatever we've got a very
almost matrix E looking to band stuff in
there to where the inside of the case is
just completely contrasted by the
exterior and that tied it all in so we
were having to just go okay we have to
trust our vision we have to trust that
it's gonna look the way we hope it's
gonna look when it's done and once we
filled it we were just like this was the
right move this was you can see all of
the fluid going through the tubes and
all of the bends and kinks and bumps and
and twists in there cause that fluid to
make sudden jerky changes in direction
which hurts flow a little bit but it
makes the fluid really stand out in
terms of that crazy effect that it has
so I think it turned out really really
good now obviously this is a thread
Ripper based build so it's got a 1950 X
overclocked to 4 gigahertz and the
memory is running 3,000 megahertz
couldn't get to go any faster
unfortunately but I haven't done a lot
of tweaking with it so there's maybe a
whole nother follow up video about
performance on this thing because I just
haven't had a chance to do enough with
it yet it's like 10 o'clock at night I
still do all the b-roll for this video I
still have to edit it and it's gonna be
a long night but I think it turned out
really well
details all the way down to the sli
bridge where we painted it gunmetal to
match and then took out the guts and
took out the green insert to make it
glow white just a lot of little things I
mean we even left the red on the
motherboard because we think that almost
looks like like the heart so there it is
guys I'm not sure I would have done it
any differently obviously there's a
glass side panel that goes
this and a huge thank you to cougar for
sending me a special glass that I
requested that was not etched with the
giant cougar logo because I felt like
that just would have taken away from
this build so huge thank you for them
being willing to take their logo off of
the case for me so thank you guys for
that but I think I think it turned out
perfect in a very imperfect way right
the insides just don't match the
outsides and that's kind of like how we
are as people right
our guts don't look like our exterior
unless you want to I don't know unless
you've got an exoskeleton or some shit
I'm tired I make no sense now do I
so anyway I'm gonna be benchmarking this
and doing a performance video on this so
please sound off in the comments below
and let me know what stuff you think I
should be benchmarking with this
obviously it's not a gaming chip we'll
be doing gaming but it's not a gaming
chip so I wouldn't be expecting this to
like outperform an 8700 K or a 7700 K
because it's not a gaming chip in fact
you put on gaming mode you lose half
your cores anyway but that's a like I
said conversation for another video so
I'm going to go again a huge thank you
to the sponsors AMD Corsair Nvidia
performance - pcs primo chill EK i mean
cougar obviously we've cut a lot of
people involved in this build and it
turned out fantastic thanks for watching
guys and as always I'll see you in the
next one oh and buy my shirts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
