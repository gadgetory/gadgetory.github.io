you're watching J is two cents and today
I'm bringing you a special unboxing of
the Corsair Vengeance k70 keyboard this
thing is supposed to be badass let's go
ahead and take a look
okay now that we've gotten a good look
at the box let's go ahead and dive
inside and see exactly what comes inside
the package okay so inside the package
it comes in a plastic sleeve it's inside
of a cardboard you know kind of a fitted
panel I guess you could say you lift
this up and you can see you've got your
replaceable red keys which you know I'm
going to be putting these on just
because the contrast looks really really
nice a little key removal tool it looks
like of course you got your Quick Start
Guide warranty information against
defects and your warranty guide let's
come with a two-year standard defect
warranty and the braiding on this is
super thick holy cow this is some thick
wire right here it comes a 2 USBS this
is to power the keyboard as well as a
pass through this is a pass through USB
right here so you don't have to have
this one plugged in to make the keyboard
work but it's definitely recommended but
you know if it's already there so why
not the keyboard is pretty heavy we'll
get back to that I want to take a look
at what else in the package here nothing
else in the box just a lot of cardboard
cut-out
and this is your soft padded wrist guard
for all those long nights of gaming or
whatever else you do with your computer
late at night so it is nice and soft
it's kind of a leathery feeling it's it
does seem like it would actually this is
really nice I really like this huh I
like that a lot okay and inside the
plastic here let's go ahead and break
this seal off
you have got your black mechanical
keyboard it does have an aluminum
construction to it so it's very sturdy
it's it's pretty heavy it's not gonna
slide around on you as you can see right
here it's not I'm pushing that it's not
gonna slide on you because the feet the
rubber feet on here are very very soft
but once you can even see that that's
because the rubber feet on here are very
very soft but once you flip up the feet
these are plastic they the feet are not
rubber on the bottom the popups so
you're you might have it slide a little
bit on you once you pop those up the
bottom of the keyboard is plastic but
the top is brushed aluminum on the top
of the keyboard here you do have a
program launch button you have
brightness control you have a keyboard
lock this is a Windows lock you know
that windows button right here sometimes
you accidentally bump that when you're
gaming and you bring up the Start menu
on Windows it's extremely frustrating
it's extremely annoying and you want to
rage if you push that button it'll lock
it so that you don't bump this over here
you have your standard caps lock our
number lock caps lock and scroll lock
you have your mute switch right here and
then this is a scroll wheel here for
volume up and volume down
you have stop rewind play fast-forward
or play pause and fast-forward so you do
have some multimedia control and this is
featuring the cherry red switches so if
you've heard my razor my Razer
BlackWidow Ultimate which is right here
that I'm currently using it's very loud
you listen to this the switches on these
are very loud however these are cherry
blue switches the cherry red switches
not nearly as loud cherry red cherry
blue
so you see it's very noisy so what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna go ahead and
throw on these red keys this does have a
red backlight and it also has
customizable backlighting on to this so
you can turn on and off certain backlit
keys so we're gonna go ahead and set
that up we'll come back and we'll
continue the video from that point okay
so as you can see here I've already
switched the WASD keys and the one
through six with the red keys they do
have a slightly different contour to
them they're kind of bold so that the a
s and the D kind of make a gradual slope
and the W kind of swoops forward a
little bit it's gonna be kind of hard to
pick up on the camera but that's the way
that they're angled just those keys
which kind of gives you more of a a
gamer feel of where your hands are on
the keyboard without really looking on
the same thing with the one through six
and all together all those keys make a
nice little dish so that you can kind of
tell where you're touching just by the
feel and actually I really like that
that feels very very nice I just want to
show you real quick before we plug this
in the tool and how easy it is to switch
and remove these keys including removing
any keys that you need to clean because
all of these keys are very easily
removable so you if you spill something
down on the keyboard you want to clean
it well you're very anal and you want to
remove all of these keys on the keyboard
clean it you can just take this tool
push it down on the key it snaps in or
pull it up and out comes the key it's
just that simple so let's go ahead and
plug this in and see exactly how the
backlighting looks I can't wait to get
rid of this blue this is a nice keyboard
but it's just time for a change I've had
this one for a year now so let's go
ahead and plug this thing in and see
exactly how it looks okay and we're back
and we've got the keyboard installed
I've got my mouse plugged into the back
here because well I'm just demonstrating
the pass-through actually works and
that's how I'm controlling my mouse
you're gonna see some weird flickering
stuff going on here with the LEDs but
just rest assured that is the camera
because I'm being lazy and using my
webcam for this review so the refresh
rate of the camera and the LEDs is just
creating a weird effect so just ignore
the blinking because it's not actually
blinking so when it comes to the LED
control you've got two different buttons
right here you've got the brightness
button which you can see right here
you've got off
medium-high off and then you've got this
little button right here that changes
which LEDs will light up so if I make
this a little bit darker here it's kind
of hard to see if I push this button
once
just the red keys light up if I push it
again
all of them light up so it just switches
between which keys will light up so if
you're a hardcore gamer at night and you
only want the arrow keys and the WASD
and one through six keys to light up you
can do that or you can push that button
to get them all off with the brightness
or you can turn the brightness all the
way up and then have all the keys on or
just those red keys on the back right
here it's kind of hard to see on the
camera there is a toggle switch right
here one through four I had to do a
little research on that and what that
was it says BIOS and what it is is it
has to do with BIOS compatibility with
some motherboards and gaming keyboards
when it comes to the refresh rate you
know the gaming keyboards and mechanical
keyboards tend to send signals much
faster due to the type of switches and
their accelerated they are hardware
accelerated inside so some older
motherboards have a hard time being
compatible with that so the Corsair form
is recommended that if you have a modern
a modern motherboard to leave it on
setting 1 which is a 100 Hertz or a 1000
Hertz or 1 megahertz refresh rate so
it's a 1 mega her tree fresh rate from
when you push a button to when the
motherboard registers that signal other
than that this is a very awesome
keyboard I'm very happy with the way it
feels with the pad on here and how
comfortable it is to type on I like to
have the feet up otherwise this is a
little too flat for my hands but that
the mute switch works perfectly
everything works perfectly and I guess
there's only one thing left to do to
make it official that this is my new
keyboard and that is to remove the
plastic covering the Corsair logo there
we go we're installed Jace $0.02 is now
rocking the Corsair Vengeance k70 oh my
god I almost forgot what I got the k7
the keyboard and now I guess the only
thing left to do is to get rid of this
old mx518 which has served me for so
long and done such a good job at
elevating my game
which is why I also picked up a Logitech
G 700 s it is a gaming wireless keyboard
a mouse it is a gaming wireless mouse
and I decided I'm gonna give it a shot
I've been against wireless mice because
of the delay but I did a lot of research
on this mice its mice this Mouse before
buying it because I didn't want there to
be any input lag I'm gonna do a review
of the G 700 s Logitech wireless
rechargeable gaming mouse right here on
Jays $0.02 as always do that normal
stuff subscribe like favorite follow me
