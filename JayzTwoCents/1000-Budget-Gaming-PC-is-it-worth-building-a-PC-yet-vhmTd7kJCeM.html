at Micro Center today to see what we can
get but I'll have a lot of time to get
there because I got Tech Talk today so
obviously we brought the Camaro
[Laughter]
the new coolermaster h 500 p mesh white
provides maximum airflow sleek design
and elegant tempered glass giving you
the ultimate platform to show off your
next build learn more about the new h
500 p by heading to Coolermaster calm
okay so we made it the micro Center in
like record-breaking time not really too
sure why so here's the plan today things
are starting to improve a little bit
with the pricing of graphics cards but I
thought what happens if I take a
thousand dollars today right now in May
of 2018 head to a micro Center
fortunately I live near one so that kind
of helps and what kind of system can we
build for that price it was a price that
you guys said on Twitter was the fair
one a thousand dollars is what a lot of
people tend to have to build for their
gaming rigs so we're gonna see what kind
of tower we can build for that price
okay so here's our haul guys we are at
the Tustin micro Center and we are going
with a risin platform kind of like on
the most recent video I did and you guys
can ignore all the sticker prices these
are all bogus remember the video I just
put up about AMD versus Intel at this
price point it's really really hard to
build an Intel system that can compete
with what we can guess we got a risin 7
1700 naan X because we know that these
can overclock pretty decent we are going
to be using the stock wraith cool that
comes with it though we did that to save
a little bit of money we obviously
needed a platform for that so we did the
bundle deal with the msi tomahawk could
be 350 we didn't spend any extra money
going with like an X 370 because there's
no reason to the be 350 gives us all the
features we need to run the CPU and even
do a little bit of overclocking if we
want to this is the part where it's
still kind of tough because memory
prices are still really expensive
fortunately like I said they're being
investigated for price fixing so
hopefully they're gonna have to pay a
huge fine which will help the prices
come down I don't know but anyway we got
this forever thing was 89 bucks it is a
8 gigabyte kit 2 x 4 gigabyte Stix 2400
memory watt to overclock this a little
bit because remember rise in first gen
rise then definitely likes memory speeds
we're gonna keep that in mind couldn't
afford anything faster
we couldn't afford anything faster
that's why we're hoping we can overclock
to at least 20 666 now this build
includes an SSD this is like it was like
64 dollars and we'll go over the receipt
at the end I know I'm saying like the
exact prices will be on the receipt this
is a 240 gigabyte SSD because I still
think at this price point for a thousand
bucks I think you need an SSD but
obviously 240 isn't enough to hold
everything so we do have a 2 terabyte
Barracuda 7200 rpm it's just a storage
drive for a lot of your games your files
your music and whatever else and 2
terabytes is definitely going to be
enough for your games and stuff but with
how big games are getting like doom
being like over 50 gigs I don't remember
how big grand theft auto 5 is but it's
also massive so that's something you
can't get away with just a tiny SSD like
that anymore now the graphics card
that's obviously the part where it gets
tough we were able to get a GTX 1060
this is the dual from a suits it's a
white card and it's a six gigabyte card
because we could have gotten a three gig
but that's not enough even for 1080p in
my opinion we managed to get this four
it says 419 that's ridiculous we paid
329 for this and it has a rebate on top
of that it's still about 30% more
expensive than what they launched at so
prices are improving but you are still
paying a premium for graphics cards but
the fact that we were able to walk in
and get it is a plus because just a few
months ago that was not an option you
we're not gonna we'll just walk into a
retail store and pick up a graphics card
like that and then our power supply here
it's a CX 550 M it's a modular 80 plus
bronze power supply from Corsair I have
used a ton of these in the past they are
great for budget builds I've never had
one fail on me so it definitely gets the
job done and then for a chassis it's
kind of here in the trunk you guys can
see it it's an s3 40 from NZXT it's a
white one could it probably save 10 or
15 bucks by going with a cheaper case
but since it has a window and we've got
some pretty parts in here I figured we
would want to make sure that we could
see our parts but of course when you're
doing your budgets you could save a
little bit of money by going with a
cheaper case the grand total $1,001 in
99 cents including these $72 tax on that
so yeah i'm one
in 99 cent over budget I'm sure you guys
can find two bucks somewhere but check
this out there are so many rebates on
this so we got a $20 rebate on it looks
like the graphics are the motherboard
we've got another $20 rebate here on the
graphics card we've got a 30 dollar
rebate here on the rise ins what are we
up to now 30 plus 20 20s so there's 70
dollars in rebates here these are
mail-in so of course they're counting on
you not mailing them in but that makes
up for your OS or most of it you might
notice there was no OS in this build
that's because a lot of people can find
creative ways to get one I'm not going
to tell you how but we got to go build
it now so let's go
so this is my masterpiece and the fact
that it seems like it's color balanced
and like a theme well that was actually
intentional I chose this graphics card
the 1060 dual from a salut specifically
because it was white what to go with the
white s340 chassis from NZXT but what I
didn't expect was the color theme with
the LEDs let's see what the boot time is
like on this thing
yeah the Wraiths cooler with its red
ring the white logo and the red
backlighting on the motherboard okay
that wasn't intentional but it turned
out pretty damn sick if you ask me all
right you know game II it's kind of a
cheesy little so that is our boot time
here with the SSD and that is why I will
always rationale using an SSD at any
price point that will allow it to happen
now obviously at $1000 we made some
choices here that you might want to
differ with you could have gone down to
like a 1050 TI and saved a little bit on
the GPU but I feel like the 1066
gigabyte card at 1080p gaming is going
to give us a lot of future compatibility
more so than the 1050 Ti and the more V
Ram is obviously going to be useful in
many titles so we're going to a couple
of tests here I did overclock the CPU to
3.9 actually it is running at 3.9 it's
fluctuating because I do have a lot of
the power saving features turned on and
the 1060 is overclocked to like 2060 or
something like that there was room for
overclocking and this plenty of power
and plenty of cooling so I wanted to
take advantage of those because after
all absolutely free performance so let's
go and start with Cinebench now my goal
here with Cinebench was to see how close
we could get to a 2700 X which is the
new top tier flagship from AMD we do
have the RAM also overclocked to 2800
that is 400 megahertz overclocked from
the 2400 XMP profile so we are getting
more out of our RAM than we actually
paid for beyond the XMP which is again
using the factory voltage without
putting any more voltage into our
memories so check that out that is
running extremely fast on our 1700 and
now score is a 7
23 so as you can see we are bumping
right up against the out-of-the-box
settings on a 2700 X and if I remember
correctly that 1769 was with us running
the much faster memory than we have with
this
what about gaming well if we look at
something like heaven and one of the
reasons why I like to use heaven is you
guys can download this right now so if
you want to see how your system compares
to this one that I built for 1001 dollar
if you $1,001 nines up so we call it one
thousand two dollars we'll call one
thousand two you can download heaven
benchmark and compare it so in terms of
our settings we've got anti-aliasing set
at x4 tessellations at normal quality is
at high and then our resolution is set
to 1080p SS system with us a system
resolution and these settings get us a
pretty good amount of FPS so here's the
ten sixty in heaven like I mentioned
with a 75 FPS 74 fps 100 FPS depending
on the scene 2000 88 megahertz 51 C
it'll cap out at about 63 60 to see I do
have the fan curve set a little bit more
aggressive again free horse power we got
to cool it down but we are getting
amazing performance now in games let's
go and look at like Metro last light red
X because that is a title that will
bring a lot of GPUs to its knees and a
member our goal here is 1080p 60fps and
it's not that hard to hit Metro last
light settings 1080p very high quality
SSA I leave that off that's not
something you really get to take huge
advantage of unless you're talking
high-end GPUs because this is a major
hit to performance AF for X normal
motion blur normal tessellation and what
you'll find here is that even with all
these settings turned up at 1080p at a
1060 though that's FPS we start out like
a hundred and eleven 125 it's like all
over the place but as you can see the
temperatures are really in check twenty
one hundred to one megahertz stupid
smooth mostly because this is a hundred
and forty-four hertz panel so it's
actually able to take advantage but the
fact that we are able to get in this
market with this price of ram and this
price of GPUs this wall of a gaming
experience if we try to do this three
months ago this would have been an
entirely different experience at $1,000
versus what we can get right now and
May of 2018 our average frame rate
though one hundred and six point three
nine FPS our max frame rate 230 but what
about something like I don't know
counter-strike go that seems to be when
people are always telling me to test now
obviously we're only in spectator mode
here but as you can see in csgo with all
settings Max and I think this is a game
a lot of people don't like to max out
the settings but we're maxed anyway and
we're getting 200 FPS 220 FPS so now
we're in dirt rally another title that I
really like to play in terms of it just
looks pretty it's got a lot of fast
motions so be able to keep up with the
movement without you know stutters and
stuff is a big deal and as you can see
we are getting a lot of FPS this isn't
the most demanding title we were able to
play this with the APU and still
maintain like 70 FPS but we also weren't
able to do it with it on ultra settings
either we are an ultra right now but as
you can see we are getting over 100 FPS
consistently okay so let's talk about
this build for a second because
obviously it can play games that's no
surprise it's $1000 computer it better
be able to play games at a good
framerate at thousand dollars the
problem is a thousand dollars is like
the old-school $700 build because of the
price increase of GPUs and memory
fortunately the prices have improved and
they started coming down we're still
seeing about a 30% cost increase of
graphics graphics cards but that is way
better than the hundred percent cost
increased before we paid $329 for our
1066 gig which we could have gotten for
about 289 to 290 in the past so it's not
that bad the problem is the price of
memory obviously on top of that as well
100 almost 100 bucks for only 8
gigabytes of memory now some things on
here people might have chosen to change
some people might want to admit the SSD
entirely I personally wouldn't do that
because I want the load speeds like we
showed you on the boot test some people
might want to go Intel the problem was
it was harder to get a more rounded
build with Intel at this price point
because of the multi-core multi-threaded
performance and if you want to do things
like light live streaming 720p live
streaming while gaming multitasking if
you want to start trying to create
videos this CPU is going to churn out
videos no problem I mean I know it
sounds fanboy ish but it really is hard
to argue with the value but if you want
to go
an Intel build for the same price you
were able to get a 7600 and like a b250
motherboard some people might have even
thought maybe you could go with a
smaller GPU of something like a 1400 or
a 1500 and take the money and put it
into more memory technically you could
but I don't think it's a fair trade-off
to get rid of those cores for more
memory unless you're doing memory
intensive tests and it wasn't enough to
get to a 1070 because those were almost
500 dollars those still have a pretty
pretty high priced premium on them so I
personally find this to be about the
most rounded build that I was able to do
and still maintains a theme so there is
that tell me what you think about this
build would you have done anything
different and I'm gonna go ahead and put
it out there right now that I'm gonna
give this build away I have no need for
this build so when I decided I was gonna
do this I wanted to go ahead and give it
away to one of you guys because I mean
you guys watch it why not why not give
it away unfortunately though this is
only gonna be for North America and yes
I can hear you guys getting mad and
moaning the problem is it costs a lot of
money to ship a computer internationally
but you'll find a link in the
description below to the giveaway
details someone's gonna win this machine
and I think it's a I think it's a hell
of a prize for just having to put up
with me for you know ten minutes or so
anyway guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching if you would change something
with this build let me know down in the
comments below as always guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one you know you want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
