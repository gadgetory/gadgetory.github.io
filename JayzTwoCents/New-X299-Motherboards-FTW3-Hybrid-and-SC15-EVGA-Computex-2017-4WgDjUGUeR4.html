continuing my coverage of Computex 2017
now we're at the EVGA suite and
yesterday I put out a video talking
about the kingpin edition gtx 980ti
that's not all they have to show now
here is the new for the win 3 hybrid so
as you can see right here it's basically
the exact same PCB you'd find on a for
the win 3 card only it is water-cooled
with an all-in-one water cooling loop
it's actually based on an ASA tech
design and then this is a cooling plate
underneath here that touches things like
BRM and memory is cooled by an active
fan but if you're in a custom water
cooling like I am that might not be
enough for you
well in that case they've got the 41 3
hydro copper this is a full cover water
block it is nickel plated it's got some
LEDs on the front LEDs on the back as
well as multiple ports and this is
shipping obviously pre-installed now you
can buy it separate if you want to to
put it on a for the win 3 card but if
you want to buy it preassembled you can
do that as well but if you really want
that high-end gaming experience then you
definitely need to check out the GTX
1030 now unless you've been living
underneath the rock you probably heard
by now that intel has launched its new X
299 platform as well as its new CPUs and
with that brings some new motherboards
now what I'm holding in my hand right
here is a kind of an early sample here
of the new flagship motherboard from
EVGA the X 299 dark it's kind of it's
sort of like a throwback motherboard if
you will it's got a lot of design cues
not only from its popular classified
series but also from the x79 dark which
was a very popular motherboard in that
era so we've got a fan here on the front
and that's not only responsible for
cooling the chipset it also cools to m2
sockets that are underneath this heat
shield and then we have an exhaust port
right here on the IO side something else
you might have noticed too is we have a
built-in IO shield so no longer just to
deal with a little metal piece of the
click into your case it's integrated on
the back right here so that's kind of
nice we also have four dimm slots
instead of eight and the reason for that
is this motherboard actually has
overclocking first and foremost in its
design philosophy so usually when you
have less memory dims you can actually
get better over clocks so they've made a
sacrifice here down to four dims to
appease to it being a more overclocking
designed motherboard
something else you might have noticed
here and you've heard me complain about
this in the past is this isn't a ATX
motherboard so it obviously means it's
wider than a standard ATX but the
problem is they usually would have 24
pin and USB 3.0 right angle connectors
so they've recessed these critical
components here like the 24 pin the USB
3.0 and the Supplemental PCIe 6 pin
right here so that you can have a
greater likelihood of compatibility with
different cases we've still got surface
mounted controls here which is very
common but we also have as you can see
now to read out codes right here because
this can now switch between two
different things it can show you your
temperature which you already see now
your socket temperature but it can also
show you real-time voltage on what's
happening with your CPU making this a
perfect motherboard for overclocking and
bench testing now at the X 299 dark
doesn't appease to you we've got the new
for the wind K right here and as you can
see we've actually got for the first
time in EVGA motherboard history RGB
lighting built-in so we've got some
right here on the top of the i/o we've
got some here where kind of audio traces
are our chipset as well as our vrm now
obviously takes a lot of design cue from
the new 1080i cooler shrouds something
new the EVGA showing off this year are
two new sfx form-factor power supplies
we've got a 650 and a 750 g3 s now sfx
power supplies aren't new but it's very
hard to find a high power output s FX
power supply so if you were trying to do
like a high-end graphics card and an
ultra small form-factor power or build
finding a power supply to give you
enough power we've been difficult so now
we've got two new options here on the
market from EVGA all right something
else I want to show you here is the new
SC 15 laptop from EVGA now we've taken a
look at the SC 17 I did an unboxing of
that I'll be doing a full review of that
as well but we looked at CES this year a
15-inch model what here it is right here
this is pretty much ready to make come
to market I'll have a release date yet
that will be updated as we move forward
but it's got a GTX 1060 in it which is
perfect for the 1080p 120 Hertz g-sync
panel we've got an i7 7700 HQ CPU with a
256 gigabyte nvme SSD as well as a one
terabyte storage so it's pretty beefy
given the fact that it's only a 15-inch
laptop it seems like a lot of companies
are really concerned with 17-inch so
it's nice to see an option there now
something else we've also got on here
the
for the first time in EVGA laptops
history which admittedly is in a very
long history but it's got a RGB keyboard
on there with four different zones where
you can actually change the colors of
the backlighting on the keyboard
something that the SC 17 its flagship
model doesn't have obviously that's not
everything that have on display here at
Computex we've already taken a look at
the for the 1-3 the SP 2 is very similar
but that's just some of the new stuff
they have to show so once again huge
thank you to EVGA for sponsoring our
trip our coverage this year of Computex
2017 head to ebj com to check out
everything they've got to offer and stay
tuned for what's new this year is my
first time in Computex
and yeah I plan on getting lost and all
of that tech goodness don't go anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
