Seattle and I'm waiting to find Jerry
and I managed to cut my finger on a
zipper imagine that I don't
actually know how to get out to the curb
okay why not I've flown here before I
remember exactly what's going on camera
she saw the camera and she was like hey
so she was giving me like praise the
Lord sign or something I'm not really
sure I could so I just have to find a
filthy STI somewhere
the hell I managed to cut my finger am i
reaching them for the camera see we can
see it
Carolee see it right under there oh yeah
there you go
somehow like the zipper like under my
fingernail and just like filleted it
does not feel too good
Wow zoom on this camera is pretty insane
I should be able to see him coming from
a mile away we see a filthy STI
you know I see a god-awful yellow cross
over or crossfire
boring vlogs incoming
would be funny if he just like left me
here you're on your own brother I
wouldn't actually put it past you to do
that either
he would totally ditch me here at
sea-tac and be like hey you're on your
own
it's funny when you're vlogging and
stuff the way people look at you like
what the are you doing why are you
holding a camera pointing at yourself
and then I'm like hey you know what why
are you pointing a camera at yourself oh
this is New Age
is there any point he was trying to
record with this exhaust yes it's it's
you can't filter it out either New York
exception alright this is how loud my
seat was I changed the exhaustive
wouldn't be this loud I know I like loud
exhaust though if I don't like drum in
the seat droned really bad Oh dinner
rally you did that residence at normal
speed yeah the freeway was just that
resonating point
all right well some time here I guess
I'll turn off this camera what are they
saying right here let's zoom in on the
comment dude in this car with this image
stabilization I can fully zoom in on the
comments and read them while we're
driving while we're driving with the
balance wow I love this camera your show
up yet no it should be here today hold
phone hello the comments are going too
fast actually read it but this can't do
it
all right I'm gonna turn this one off
okay wait Oh God conserve your nine
hours of battery all right yeah I'm not
looking at the road this is unsafe how
about I point the camera at the road and
usually the camera
they've been on that the Maryland that's
all for just holding the cell phone yeah
uh needles and yeah a little camera-shy
Jackie you point that over there J I
have a boner cameras pretty sweet and
it's pretty stable man oh it look it
it's like put boxes around our faces
like it's like please knows who we are
yeah it's like put a box around the
losers I like how Sony figured out like
all their focusing problems like one
generation after I go buy a thousand
dollar camera and like doesn't work and
this thing is also a photo camera with
the 20 megapixel sensor in it so you
just select copy to switch it to the
camera mode and push the button to take
pictures no reason like I don't know I'm
certain that the DSLR stuff is really
good like for when you have to do really
high-end cinematic stuff but it seems
like they capabilities and these things
are like just stomping on it this is an
F 1.8 lens so you can Carl Zeiss lens
right in the same ants with it DSLRs are
officially for poor people if you wanted
to buy that lens that's in that camera
for a DSLR like an equivalent lens you'd
probably have to spend more than that
camera cost
then granted it's it's 1.8 through 3.8
but still through 3.8 MX zoom we're on
like a DSLR lens I was on the lesser
expensive side I like 5.6 yeah so Haley
world's most boring clogged ceiling
coming well you know anything that's all
- I didn't I didn't vlog a damn thing on
the airplane because nothing happened
like literally nothing happened I got
there and I went through security olla
babe a bomb checks might keep my
computer though they swapped it and
stuck it in a machine and everything so
I put my stuff on the security I go
through the guy is a total so I love
saying I put all my stuff on this on the
belt I go through the little body scan
and I go through the other end and all
my stuff comes out it's it from my
computer and I'm like um nobody says a
word to me or anything I'm like uh I'm
thinking the worst like someone just
like scooped it up yeah I'm like my
computer and the guy was like oh yeah I
think I know they're going to check it
like why they need to check my computer
then they take that stupid wand and they
start out wanting the exhaust and they
start wanting all around and they put it
in a stupid machine that like scanned it
again and then they took the swab and
did a test on that and then they gave it
back you know ten minutes later when I
asked him I was like what was that all
about
apparently the size of my computer yes
earning them like you could hide
something in it yeah look what you do
this x-rated anyway apparently x-rays
don't go in too bad then they then they
went into that wall stir it's a TSA
randomize I'm I got all right
no table
I mean this is megawatt was like it's
like the Titanic yeah where these
pellets and drinks like an earthquake up
in here we need some shoes so Jerry came
up was a very ingenuitive ingenuity a
very smart way of leveling the table

cray-cray the word right pray for the
craic that weird easy deep on the ground
feels like you mosey into work well you
to bevel feels I know I can become a
table repairman
Tavian leveler team yer you got a tool

exact camcorder I got no Big Joe in
touch tips Jerry mmm
Jerry bought something on my
recommendation and that weird I did I
didn't even do any research or nothing I
