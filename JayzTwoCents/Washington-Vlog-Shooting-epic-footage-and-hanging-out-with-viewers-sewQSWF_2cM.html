another episode of DIY gaza the episode
where I try to do something to better my
house not knowing anything about the
project and it may or may not work out
well guys today has been awesome I got
to hang out with my brother from another
mother Jays two cents and we got to go
see all of the awesome fans that showed
up at the fan meet and honestly it blew
my mind then like over 20 people showed
up it was probably closer to 30 at one
point and I thought that was pretty
mind-blowing I've never seen any kind of
local support like that when I've had to
meet up in the past so it's it's been a
pretty incredible day and we got to
shoot DIY gasm and jay help me shoot
with this fs5 like camera you're
watching me on right now and it actually
was really nice to have somebody help me
shoot a video for a change because it
gave me a little bit of a different
perspective on things but all in all I'm
really happy that Jay decided to come up
and see me to kind of help pull me out
of the funk that I've been in that I've
really really needed and it was also fun
doing doing some 4-wheel burnouts with
STI that was pretty cool too except for
the one that I totally screwed up going
out of machs that made me look like an
idiot to everybody that showed up today
that was that was pretty that's pretty
god-awful terrible not wish I could take
that back but anyways guys if you
enjoyed watching this this video that J
edited together without any input for me
that probably makes everything look
really embarrassing in me like an idiot
please let us know down in the comments
we would love to know and of course come
over to follow us on twitter at JS two
cents and out barnacle ease respectively
and that's also what we go by and pretty
much every platform so guys I hope you
