especially with the skunkworks vlogs
then I decided that it's time to go
ahead and revisit this discussion but
this time throwing in a little bit of a
visual aid to make things a little bit
easier to understand and that question
being how to balance the airflow inside
of your case and what really makes
people confused is the fact that I have
five exhaust fans on skunkworks and only
three intakes yet I claim I'm making
positive pressure so how in the hell is
that possible well today we're going to
talk about how I achieve that and by the
end of this video if I did my job
correctly you guys will also be able to
balance the air flow inside of your case
with its specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance-free plug-and-play
operation the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
I have talked about this in the past and
if you want to kind of get the complete
story that makes you guys check out the
previous video right here before moving
forward with this one but if you've
already seen that video or you're just
morbidly curious about how I am
achieving this airflow with three
intakes and five exhausts and getting
positive pressure then continue watching
you might actually learn something and
maybe I'll actually teach something it's
kind of the point here so there are
three different types of air flow there
is positive pressure that is where there
is more air going into the envelope now
I was going to refer to this as an
envelope and not just a case because
remember this applies to all things
homes anything that has movement of air
is going to be pretty much based on the
envelope or the container if you will
now positive pressure is where you have
more air going into the space then you
have being exhausted now exhausting
doesn't mean just this the assistance of
air being moved out of the case through
an exhaust fan it could just be vents
vents are also exhausts and they're
being the air is being pushed out of the
vent by the air coming in but because
you have more air entering then exiting
you end up with a slight amount of
pressure in there which pushes air out
of any cracks and crevices and vents
that it can find now of course you're
going to want to promote healthy air
flow where all of that work is not being
placed on the intake fans in
side of your case or your envelope or
your space your container or your room
or your office or whatever I mean this
all applies to air conditioning as well
HVAC technically not necessarily air
conditioning but you want to promote
where the air goes across the case
because you want air moving across
things like your heat sinks on your vram
your heat sinks on your motherboard you
want air in making its way into your
graphics card air across your hard
drives that's a lot of that that's a lot
to ask on your intake fans to handle all
of that movement of air so you want to
promote healthy air flow across the case
by having some exhaust fans now if you
have too much exhaust fan airflow then
you'll have the fans trying to pull more
air out that is being supplied by the
fans bringing air in that's called
negative air pressure and what's going
to happen here is that you're going to
be asking the rear fans to do more work
than the front fans and in order to
achieve their job they've got to pull
that air from somewhere I mean you can't
have the fan blades moving and air not
moving across it that's just not the way
physics work so it's going to pull that
volume from anywhere it can now that's
going to be your different vents and
cracks and crevices inside of your case
not just from your intake vents so air
is going to come around the side of the
intake fans it's going to come from the
bottom it's going to come in from
in-between the door panels and all cases
pretty much have different types of
louvers and vents that are not
necessarily filtered and/or have fans on
them so you're going to start pulling
air in from places that you don't want
which is going to be promoting
additional dust accumulation inside of
your case so positive air pressure
because we're pushing air out of those
vents means that you're going to be
promoting less dust making its way into
your case as long as you have air
filters on your front fans but you're
not going to at least I'm gonna be
pulling dust in through the different
vents and stuff now the third type on
here which is probably the hardest to
achieve because there's a lot to account
for is going to be a neutral pressure or
a balanced pressure and that's where you
have equal airflow of air in vs. air out
now I say it's the hardest to achieve
simply because of the fact that there is
a lot to account for you if you're using
water cooling like I am you have to
consider the fact that the radiators are
going to be introducing a bit of
resistance to that airflow and in a case
like skunkworks here in the case of and
in a case of get it
and in the case like skunkworks my front
fans are non-filtered and pretty much
non-obstructive so they're getting like
full open space airflow in there now
that brings me to the next point of
today's video which is how I'm able to
achieve positive airflow in a case like
this where I have three intakes and five
exhaust fans now I've got four exhaust
fans on the upper 480 red on the top of
skunkworks pushing air at the top we
want the air to go out the top if we can
because that is the natural air flow as
heat rises it's going to want to move
its way up so we don't want to work
against the natural radiation the heated
convection things like that and I've got
one exhaust fan on the back pretty much
I don't even need that but I have it
there simply because of the fact that I
am already running a very positive
pressure in the case and I just don't
like the way it looks sitting there bare
and open but the way positive pressure
is able to be achieved when you have
less intakes than exhaust is very very
simple don't over complicate this a lot
of folks forget the simple fact that the
number of fans has nothing to do with
the pressure whatsoever I know that
sounds like a really bold statement but
listen follow me on this the number of
fans either on intake or exhaust has
nothing to do whatsoever with the way
the case flow is balanced positive or
negative it has to do with volume and
rpm so I've got the three fans running
right now at about 60% speed because I'm
using the 7 volt adapters on there and
they are the corsair airflow quiet
Edition fans which are already only what
1200 rpm fans so they're running very
very low about 900 rpms and then I've
got the motherboard controlling the fans
for the radiator and the exhaust so the
way that I'm able to balance this
airflow and get positive pressure which
is what I want is by having more rpm and
volume entering the front of the case
than what the fans are actually
exhausting now if I was to ramp those
five exhaust fans up and put those to
full speed then I'm going to instantly
achieve negative pressure and in fact we
can talk about that there's a lot of
ways that you can actually check the
balance of your airflow and rather than
spending a ton of money on things like
flow meters that are just not going to
be important to you unless you're doing
a lot of case reviews or fan reviews
then I would say go the simple
out of simply getting yourself a dollar
pack of incense you can get them at
craft stores a lot of grocery stores
sell these and the nice thing about them
is one they're going to make the room
smell really nice and two they give off
a decent amount of smoke that you can
actually visibly see what is happening
with the airflow I like to actually put
a couple of these together when I'm
burning them that way I have more smoke
especially when I'm dealing with the
amount of airflow that I am here on
skunk works but it's really really cheap
all you got to do is light them and then
once the it end turns red it will start
to give off a plume of smoke and then
you can just start to wave it around
different parts of your case put it in
front of your fans make sure that it's
pulling the air in on the intake fans
you can get a very good visual
representation of how much air is making
it into your case but obviously putting
in front of the fans means that you're
going to see movement of the smoke but
if you really want to know what's
happening with your case putting in
front of the fans
doesn't really tell you anything you
want to put this around the different
creeks of creeks the different cracks
and vents in your case because that's
going to tell you what's happening with
your case flow so in the case of skunk
works here if I hold it around the
slotted vents on the front of the case
nothing is happening no air is making
its way into there with just telling me
that right now at least in the top
portion of the case where you're not
dealing with negative pressure
whatsoever and the moment I start to put
this towards the back of the case where
I've got a much larger honeycomb / you
know type of vent in there you can see
we've got a lot of airflow being pushed
out of there now it's pretty obvious
I've achieved a positive pressure on the
bottom of the case because I've got four
140 millimeter intake fans and only two
280 millimeter exhaust fans but one of
the things I did to make sure that I can
promote as much exhausting as I can of
the bottom because the bottom part of
the case gets really hot with the three
overclocked Titan X's in there is I have
those two 280 fans running a hundred
percent at all times so when the system
is not actually under load and those
bottom fans are not starting to speed up
with the PWM control then I'm actually
dealing with a little bit of negative
pressure in there which is fine a little
bit of dust is going to make its way in
there but again they're not filtered
anyway but once the CPU starts to ramp
up and the GPUs ramped up then those
fans speed up and we achieve positive
pressure where we're getting as much air
flow through there
as we positively can't possibly possibly
now my recommendation is always to go
with positive pressure simply because
it's clean and it's going to promote the
best cooling but whether or not you're
dealing with water cooling or air
cooling it is still very very relevant
to keep the airflow in mind your
radiators are going to need air also
obviously so you want to make sure that
you've got plenty of air supply making
its way into your case obviously the
easiest way to do that as I said is to
get yourself a very simple fan
controller with a dial and then you can
start to dial up the fan slowly and play
with the smoke and then get it balanced
just right and then if you don't like it
you can play around with it and test the
temperatures and see what happened
anyway guys I hope today's videos helped
you a little bit more regarding positive
pressure negative pressure with the
visual representation of what's actually
happening and tell me what you guys are
doing are you guys conscious about the
types of fans that you're running in the
airflow situation inside of your cases
or do you just fill up all the fan slots
and let them go and let nature and
physics sort it out sound off down in
the comments and as always guys thanks
for watching this today's video if you
guys are Amazons shoppers and you can
help support the channel by looking down
the description I've got a few amazon
affiliate links in there I'm working on
other countries I've had some complaints
from people saying Jay why don't you
have a German one why don't you have an
Italian one why don't you have the etc
excited there's I have to fill out
separate application for all of those
and it's a lot of work so I'm working on
it guys but anyway thanks for watching
today's video as always I hope you
learned something that's most important
to me I want you to take the knowledge
out of my head and give it to you if I
could just plug into your brain and give
it to you like the matrix I would do
that but then again we won't have as
much fun would we trust me I don't want
you guys seeing what else is in my head
man you want to talk about a scary place
to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
