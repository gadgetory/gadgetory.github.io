you didn't see our last video I highly
recommend you go and check that out
before watching this one and that's
where we took a 16 dollar box fan and a
bunch of 480 rads from ek water blocks
and made an ambient temperature cooling
monster we thought you know we need to
upgrade it a little bit so this is what
we've done so far we've added a little
bit of patriotism
and a pinwheel is a flow indicator right
if you guys have any questions about
whether or not the air is actually
flowing there you go but we got the
thinking how can we get this sub ambient
and we noticed whenever the AC vent up
there kicked on and blew down on to the
radiator it would start to cool down a
little bit more so we thought well 5500
BTUs might do the trick with its
adjustable pmw 3367 16,000 dpi optical
sensor for RGB zones 9 customizable
buttons and offering both wired and
wireless operation are only a few
reasons why the corsair dark court RGB
should be on your shortlist for your
next mouse purchase check out its full
list of features by clicking the link in
the description below alright so
hopefully I have to assemble too much
remote control now my first concern was
like whoa wait a minute we don't have a
way to separate the intake air from the
exhaust air on this cuz typically this
is designed to go into a window it's got
this little thing and it's designed to
separate to air coming in versus the air
being conditioned but the space in here
is big enough where I think if we just
run this under the table or something
it's not gonna be interfering with
itself but we'll still get the effect
we're looking for I'm a condom very
effective ladies thank you for your
purchase at this Hisense product we have
made everybody one thing to point out
it's 21.9 see right now without the fan
running on the fluid temp I did turn the
air conditioner down in here to 68 today
because it supposed to be a warm day so
so I'm literally just gonna be kind of
so just like the way I made my kids I'm
just gonna
so we finally got the it it's reversed
threw at us for xxx the wrong way but if
I bother to actually RTFM I legit think
though that just winning at it it's
gonna be plenty you know I mean okay so
we're gonna start heaven benchmark here
and some people were concerned that
heaven is a put enough heat into the
graphics card it got to the same
temperature as what superposition did
and we are running all this Max 8x msaa
extreme tessellation ultra quality so I
think there's plenty of heat on that
also too I wanted to talk about there
were some comments concerns about
whether or not the d5 pump was enough to
push all of this believe it or not
there's not that much resistance in this
loop radiators especially ones this big
like 120 and 140 is obviously the leader
or not don't put a lot of restriction or
resistance in the flow because if you
add up the diameter of all the tubes
number half of these tubes are going one
direction and the other half is going
the other direction and then given the
size of the end tanks the tubes overall
surface area is about the same as the
internal surface area of a 3/8 inch tube
so these are just like as if we had
tubes running so there's actually not
that much restriction it's the water
blocks and the super thin passages they
have to go through that put restriction
into the loop so the D 5 is plenty for
this in fact the point of bubble moves
it flies through this loop so the flow
rate and the pump is not being exceeded
I just wanted to talk about that so this
is what we're set to in the studio 69
Fahrenheit which works out to and we'll
show trigger fills 20 point five five
six degrees Celsius so that is our
ambient mark that's where we need the
fluid to be be low to see if this is
going to work and drop our ambient temps
but as you can see the fluid is again at
ambient temperature and we proved that
in the last video that's why I've seen
the first video was important we have
built a big enough radiator system here
with a big enough amount of fluid to
where the we can keep the system itself
at
ambient temperature but as you can see
our GPU is about three C or three and a
half C above ambient this is about to
see less than it was when we had it set
to 71 so it also proves another thing
that people like too often you know kind
of challenge is the coolant temperature
and the components temperature and your
ambient temperature are one-to-one so if
we rise one C in this in the room we
will go up one see with our components
if we go up 10 C it'll go up 10 C so
that's why with water cooling if you're
gaming in a closed room and it gets
hotter you'll notice your components
getting hotter so proper ventilation
stuff is obviously important but this
has been running now I had a stopwatch
going it has been going that long I mean
it does not heat up that's the thing
it'll be running 10 minutes and 37
seconds so what we're gonna do right now
is we are gonna point the AC at this and
see what happens and how long it takes
it to do it
61 Fahrenheit is the lowest it seems we
can get it to go all right so we're just
gonna let this go
and then we'll see what happens
all right so we ran it for seven and a
half minutes before we decided we hit
equilibrium and went down as low as
sixteen point eight and they came back
up to seventeen point one seventeen
point O we did get the GPU to drop down
to 21 C though but we're still
technically at ambience twenty point
five is ambient so we can't see our
fractions there
I do feel an awful lot of air coming off
to the side over here though where it's
not being forced through the radiator so
I'm going to try two things one this
exhaust I'm concerned about the warmth
coming out of here which is pretty warm
it's I mean it's a heat exchanger we
expect pulling the heat out of the air
and this is the worm we're concerned
that this is counter balancing the
effect we're looking for here where we
might be raising the temperature in this
area too much that's why this gets
rounded outside through a window or a
hole in the wall I'm going to take this
and I'm going to make a ramp and I'm
gonna point this up so it goes up there
into the ceiling way up high out of the
way I also want to try ducting off the
air on the side of the radiator to see
if I can't keep it from splashing off
the side very similar to how I did my
oil cooler in my 370z
if air hits that and it can't go through
because of resistance and it's just
going to splash off the side so I feel
like a lot of the cold air is being
bypassed and not making it through the
systems so yeah that's gonna work now
that's just getting harder to move
around recycling maybe reduce reuse
recycle
so water temp is fourteen point nine
degrees because I have ducted the
out of it I'll probably use twenty
dollars in gaff tape in this one project
alone I'm actually surprised I thought
the fan would have had enough pressure
to pull the air through like like you
saw with the vape how it just kind of
forced it but no this this fan is
actually pushing enough air towards it
to where it was splashing off which is
why now we are seeing all of this
improvement now by just reducing the
amount of air that can escape around the
unit so it's only been about one minute
since I closed off the heat leaks right
here and look 18 C already on that water
temp 1406 will let this go for a little
while we'll see where we balance out and
then we will call this probably the most
ridiculous Frankenstein thing I've ever
done but if we were to flip this monitor
around the other way and sit right in
front of that fan not only are you
cooling the crap out of your PC you are
cooling the crap out of yourself as well
so kind of like how Linus's recent video
where he showed how much a computer can
heat a room I guess we're kind of
showing how cool your room can be while
gaming if you have a stupid amount of
money with terrible ROI throw it so on
this side of things obviously you can
see the airflow I feel like I just
walked into one of those walk-in
refrigerators it is so cold in here this
side of the room is like really colder
it's like as cold as we were doing the
ln2 overclocking with kington
so we just found something right now
where when the compressor kicks on if we
had the fan on the box fan running a
hundred percent we feel like the air
isn't spinning enough time in the
radiators to chill it as much as it can
so we just put the fan on low with the
compressor on and we came down to
thirteen point six I've seen this go as
low as thirteen point two when playing
around right now but we actually had
this drop now to seventeen see
momentarily and come back up so I'm
gonna turn the fan off entirely but the
first time I did this by turning the fan
off it really chilled the radiators but
what also happens love that cold air
splashed back at the intake side of the
cooler which then triggers the
compressor to turn off because it
reached its lowest temperature where it
will want to run the moment the
compressor kick clicked off the
temperatures rose really quickly here
back to ambient like 220c in a matter of
a minute but look I just turned the fan
off and now we're dropping down thirteen
three our GPU is at 17 c13 two and we
probably won't see this hit 16c unless
we can get this down into the 12s I
don't think that's gonna happen because
the compressor isn't gonna run long
enough so again and there's thirteen one
we might be able to do it if we can just
time this right we might be able to
actually hit sixteen see on the on the
GPU so it's kind of funny when we had
the fan running a hundred percent with
the compressor on Oh compressor just
turned off now watch what's gonna happen
to this okay it's twelve nine of course
we didn't hit 16 C but we did hit a
steady seventeen do you see that it
stayed at 17 so if there's thirty no
31:13 two
13 3 13 4 and now here's the thing at 13
6 see it's starting to skip if I turn
the fan on 100% it will go even faster
up to ambient because we're running
ambient air through something that's now
below ambient temperature so we're
actually running warm air through it
when it comes to the relative
temperature of these parts so now that
the fan is at 100%
watch this 14 7 14 8 see how it's
speeding up now simply because the
relative temperature right the metal was
chilled down into the 50s the air
blowing through there right now is
almost 70 degrees so we are talking
nearly 20 degrees of Fahrenheit
difference and now we're at 15 to 15 3
15 4 and this will go all the way up to
about 20 C which is envía like we've
already determined what was the point of
this video nothing absolutely nothing I
mean we want to see if we can get sub
ambient on the GPU we achieved that you
can see now we're back above ambient
because our coolant is no longer going
to be below ambient
so we've always seen about a three to
four degrees difference between the
coolant temperature and the component
temp so a little bit of science behind
this an extremely crude unscientific way
but this was more like a what happens if
typeof video so if you guys have any
suggestions of what happens if you did
they sound ridiculous put them in the
comments below I mean after all we did
this right we're willing to do this
we're willing to really sell ourselves
to do anything for the sake of views so
that's it guys subscribe if you're new
around here like this video if you
enjoyed it we hope to see your
suggestions so there is an oppressor
just tick back on whatever we're gonna
let this go guys thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one it only
cost 500 bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
