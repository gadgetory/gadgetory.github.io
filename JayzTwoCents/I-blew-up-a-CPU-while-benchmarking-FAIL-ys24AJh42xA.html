talking like Chatsworth raw if you know
what I'm saying I just tweeted out that
I blew up a processor and we're going to
talk about that two things happened here
but it was kind of like I was in the
middle of doing a different video and
now I'm making this video obviously as
you guys wanted me to do this video
about how it blew up maybe you guys can
learn something and yeah we're doing
this this is this has to be done I air
all my mistakes this as you might
recognize is the budget gaming system I
built out of my own money to kind of do
a series here where I upgraded over time
and see what kind of decisions I make
when I'm putting my own money on the
line it was some pretty interesting
choices here and it ended up in a form
not final form it's still not in final
form but within 8320 from AMD and and GA
990 fxaa ud3 motherboard allowing for
overclocking and such ever since I did
the KB like shoot out video a few days
back I could not stop this nagging
feeling that there was better gaming
performance to be had even from like
five-year-old processor technology here
almost six years old at this point when
the 8300 series launched then there was
on any hyper-threading case queue
overclocking i3 available on the market
today I thought you know what this needs
to be done I need to test this I took
the SSD and the 1080 out of the KB leg
rig behind me there and I put them in
this rig here and decided to put it
through the exact same tested it with
the i3 i5 and i7 to see how it really
compared and guess what we were seeing
some pretty damn impressive numbers from
the 8320 overclock to 4.4 gigahertz
compared to the i3 at 4.7 it was beating
it and Cinebench it was beating it in
time spy and I get to do the rest of my
tests and we're going to talk about why
so I started getting greedy and I went
you know what I bet this CPU has at
least four point six and even if I could
get four point seven out of it that'd be
awesome because then we have another
direct four point seven gigahertz
comparison yes I know the architectures
are different yes I know AMD and Intel
direct frequency speed is not comparable
across platforms I know that it just
would have been neat being like hey all
of these were at four point seven kudos
well the ud3 was being kind of weird
where even though I was telling it to do
one point four five
volts which is very safe even with a
cooler like this one here which is this
isn't a hyper 212 a Cambridge one it is
it's a step below the 212 a sub plenty
of cooling effect we were only seeing 60
C on the package at the one point four
or five volts at four point four so I
was happy with that I figured we got
more room than that so I put in 1.5
volts and that's safe I believe in is
still safe for AMD it sits on the edge
of air cooling you know you really got
to keep an eye on things I noticed that
when I was doing Cinebench that the
voltage was dropping down to one point
three one to five ish like one point
three one to five one point three three
between there and then the cores were
slowing down to four point three even
though I had them set to four point six
so that donned on me oh yeah I didn't
change the line load calibration
settings in the motherboard see what
happens when you put these CPUs graphics
cards are the same as well about to
explain here when you put them under
load there becomes a bit of a voltage
drop across the board where even though
you're telling you its end at one point
four it might only get one point three
or whatever because as the CPU is
fluctuating and doing its different
tasks it starts to pull voltage you get
what's called a V group and where the
voltage won't be steady across the board
so what you have to do is go into
overclocking settings and most good
motherboards are designed for
overclocking here and have good line
load calibration settings in there where
you can basically tell it to take
whatever the baseline is and add a
percentage of voltage to it so that you
can say okay you want to account for the
drop so under load or line load
calibration let's go ahead and go to
either normal or extreme profiles as
different settings on there basically
like I said the percentage increase of
voltage across the board to allow for
that droop so I put the multiplier to a
4.6 gigahertz setting went into Windows
no problems whatsoever went in two times
by beat the i3 no problems whatsoever b2
CPU score beat it on GPU score and it
beat it just on combine everything with
this like I think this is awesome I'm
going to be able to show people there's
no point in buying the 70 350 K so then
I went it to Cinebench and I had
hardware monitor going so I could keep
track of things like the voltages to
temperatures all of that stuff I'm
monitoring everything and I'd noticed
something interesting that it's going
1.5 1.5 v 1.59 1 point 6 volts on air
I'm going wow that's interesting it's
it's going up quite a bit on voltage but
it passed the test and I saw that max
temperatures were only sitting at about
67 C on the package and I thought well
it's actually not that bad but you know
what that's not safe that's not safe at
all so I should probably shut down the
system go back into BIOS and then see
you know pull the voltage back down a
little bit to account for the line load
calibrations can add a little bit more
so I tell the system to restart and this
motherboard has something interesting in
it where when you tell us to restart it
will power down completely and then turn
back on whereas a lot of motherboards
will stay powered on as a the constant
voltage supply and then just restart
itself well this one because like I said
it turns off when I hit restart the
system turned off and then it powers
back on and immediately powers right
back off and doesn't come back and I'm
seeing the telltale sign here of
uh-oh because every time I push power I
would get just an immediate flick of
power the fans would all kind of fudge
for a second and then stop that's
usually a sign of something is wrong
with CPU power delivery yeah I was like
oh that's not good so I cleared CMOS no
it no repair whatsoever took out the
graphics card took out the memory took
out everything except for the CPU on
there same result unplug the power
delivery to the CPU the eight pin EPS
power the system turns on now it's very
it's very unlikely that the motherboard
is bad on this I have a fact I have
another CPU that I'll find some time
later to drop in here so I can old 6300
drop it in here if it powers on I know
the motherboard is good I'll buy a new
CPU we'll be back up and running and
then that series can continue but I want
to explain why this happened and what I
should have done differently
so the first understand why the CPU died
you have to understand how motherboards
work and how they turn on now certain
parts of your motherboard are always
under constant power and twelve volt
supply if that wasn't the case and when
you push power nothing would happen
right because that's plugged into your
motherboard so there's always parts of
your motherboard that are powered on
waiting for a momentary switch like your
power button to tell it to turn on well
the way it turns on is it basically
slaps your system across the face with
voltage and says hey turn on when you do
that usually those voltages when they
first turn on are spikes there's they're
much higher than the initial voltages
are going to run out so it's kind of
like a quick peak of power high voltage
and then it comes down really fast to
say
hey you know this is what we're supposed
to run at because as it does its post
and it starts loading up the BIOS that's
when it goes here's what the voltage is
need to be it looks an awful lot like
because the voltages were set so high
and with line load calibration and
because it basically took a base of 1.5
and then slapped it with voltage who
knows what it hit it with but the moment
it tried to turn it on and it slaps it
across his face like Ronda Rousey's
recent fight it died that's when it died
here's what I should have done
differently when I realized the voltages
were so high especially after I already
knew that this freakin motherboard turns
itself off to restart I should have just
powered it down cleared the CMOS and
then I wouldn't have had this issue had
I done that the system would be alive
today I'd be able to do all the
benchmarks and show you guys more
definitive proof that it is absolutely
unnecessary to buy the 73 50k yes I know
a m3 has no upgrade path yes I know blah
blah blah blah blah insert all day and
be hate here but it still was beating
the i3 73 50k hands-down and it's a hell
of a lot cheaper to be able to achieve
that because with the 73 50k you have to
buy an expensive z2 70 board to be able
to take advantage of all those
overclocking features so when you put
those two together you spending at least
$300 upwards of 350 400 depending on
what you want and yes there is no pre
pads you can upgrade the CPU later but
there's no point in spending one hundred
and eighty-nine dollars on a CPU just
upgrade it later just save more up front
and buy a better CPU to start 73 50k
shouldn't exist as far as I'm concerned
at the price that it does so there's my
opinion on that but anyway that's just
that's it I wanted to kind of tell you
guys that hey we were beating it we were
beating the 73 50k what's the 8320 I was
proud of that and this is one of them
highly unedited videos but that's okay
because allow me to share this with you
guys so if you think your voltages might
be too high or you think if something is
wrong dear self a favor clear your CMOS
before restarting your system especially
if the voltages are really high like
mine was I'm an idiot I was impatient I
wanted to get the video done and guess
what now I don't get to do the video at
all and I've got spend more money out of
my pocket to get another AMD processor
because of the fact that I blew it up
and no I'm not going to allow someone to
send me one and I'm not going to ask for
one for sponsorship because the whole
point of this build was
be out-of-pocket what I just experienced
was a mistake of mine does cost me money
out-of-pocket so the best I can do is at
least feel the pain of spending another
150 dollars on an 83 20 E and get it up
and running from there or just decide
what I'm going to upgrade it to in the
future
there you go guys a first processor I've
killed in over to over Kenya it's
probably more like 15 years at this
point maybe even more the last processor
I've I killed was a pentium d so you do
the math I killed a pentium d alright
guys time to go I'm depressed I don't
like killing hardware I don't care if
it's expensive hardware and I don't care
if it's cheap hardware I don't like
killing hardware and this is this is up
there with me on how I felt after
drilling holes in the motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
