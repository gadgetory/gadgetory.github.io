footprint together with the all-new
Corsair 1 available with up to an Intel
ninth gen 9900 K processor and an RT X
20 atti
this small PC is capable of big things
convection assisted cooling with
separate loops for the CPU GPU means the
corsair one sucks in the best way
possible
to see our review of the new corsair 1i
160 click the link in a description
below so exactly one year in one day ago
probably one year and two days ago by
the time you guys see this we did a
video about us retesting the 2400 g from
AMD because reasons and stuff so here we
are retesting it again one year later
because you know one of the most common
things i've seen people say with the
launch of Radeon 7 and with the
increasing prices of nvidia and whatever
however you guys want to look at that
I'm just not gonna buy a graphics card
and then they do like the Superman pose
because they're standing on
righteousness and so I thought well what
kind of performance will you get today
with the latest games more games have
launched since this card did card it's
inside the Vega inside they're little
little bitty guy so I thought what kind
of performance where you get with
today's titles in 2019 by running the
2400 G now being the J that I am I don't
condone running your stuff at stock I
always recommend overclocking if you're
brave enough and you have the cooling
Headroom so that's why we're running our
2,400 G overclocked I'm running four
gigs on it so a multiplier of 40 we're
in our memory at 29 33 admittedly I
would love that to be higher
unfortunately I can't get it higher it
keeps crashing the memory we're running
though is 16 gigabytes of G skills flair
X technically there are 3600 dims I
believe but we can't get anywhere near
that any more tweaking as needed later
but I digress we are also running our
graphics clock frequency at 1600 I want
to say something like 1200 is factory so
our graphics graphics clock is
overclocked we can't really get that too
much higher right now any bit higher
even like 20 megahertz we get black
screens when we try to load into windows
rather than that not too much it's
change we're actually running manual
one point four on the cpu we're running
our graphics core voltage at one point
two to five and we are running our DMM
voltage at one point three five and this
is where this is where we land it so we
didn't just timings or any of that stuff
I didn't adjust the fan curve none of
that
nothing has changed other than those
settings I just showed you
oh it's ready good it's running at four
point two nine million megahertz that's
good
okay so we're gonna do dirt rally here
and it's kind of funny the second dirt
rally's getting ready to come out but
this is a game that we've kind of tested
in the past with like AP use and laptops
and stuff sighs kind of want to sort of
give me something somewhat consistent
for me to sort of test with so as you
can see right now we've got everything
showing here CPU usage this is our core
frequency right here so we're getting 62
FPS though I mean remember guys we have
no graphics card installed right now
this is impressive more so than my
driving obviously whoo meant to do that
so the FPS is pretty solid though
winchell wipers why maybe we'll go ahead
and pull it back slightly on the
overclocked alright so we moved on to
battlefield 5 he's clearly dirt rally
wasn't exactly my speed but I want to
see right now what happens when we play
battlefield 5 on let's go for this try
for medium or low 1080p yeah we're gonna
go ahead and just adjust this ourself -
let's go ahead and start with medium
how's that all right so it's probably
hard to see because you guys are
watching a 30fps video but you can see
the counter on the left there it's 40 41
motion blur is on we're gonna obviously
have to tweak this a little bit cuz 60
FPS is clearly that number that we're
going for especially in a shooter you
could probably get away with lower fps
and like mmo's or games where it's just
story based like Resident Evil and stuff
like that this would clearly put us at a
disadvantage it's not a very smooth
experience so far anyway so 20 FPS
because everything's on ultra now so
let's just go low
hello Logan you go so with everything at
lo we're getting 52 FPS right now 53
yeah I don't think this is gonna work
did my settings somehow know I guess
it's time for us to make me play with
the resolution scale now okay well we're
getting 70 FPS in 720p
while we were protecting there anyway
it's just friendly I'm on fire I'm on
fire
oh the tank saw me you know
oh they got stuck to the Train all right
so if you want to drop the resolution
down to 720p and low settings you can
get pretty close to 60 fps in
battlefield 5 with no graphics card okay
so our settings right now on in terms of
video 1080p custom with a mixture of
medium medium often Sun shadows on any
of occlusion I think that should be off
honestly depth of field level of detail
I'm gonna go to medium on that as well
tessellation off screen space
reflections nothing really reflecting on
the screen now and think motion blur off
vignette blur off pure hair of course
off and they're 30 40 fps I mean we are
looking off quite into the distance
right oh she's going to a rave we're
gonna rave see this we're gonna rave I
mean it's pretty consistent now about 40
fps 39 40 so can we get that number
higher we're still sitting in the 30s so
I don't know if I would necessarily call
that an amazing gameplay experience but
this is the kind of game that I was
saying that you could you could
technically play at this fps I think and
not feel too gimped because you're
playing a single-player game I mean I
don't feel like I couldn't play this if
I wanted to play the story if I had a
choice between playing a game or not
this still seems like the right way to
go about it so let's see if we drop it
now to 720 just like we did last time so
I mean the FPS increases real
okay so 74 I mean the FPS is very good
okay you could play apparently as the
ninja known as Laura Croft or Lara Croft
whatever Angelina Jolie whatever you
wanna call her 720p is obviously looking
like it's our sweet spot right now for
this so I'm out of here okay so we
switched over to doom because you've
heard me say this before and I'm gonna
say it again
doom in my opinion is the pinnacle of
allowing low-end hardware to give you an
amazing experience but in terms of
settings real quick we'll just go ahead
and show you we are running of course
Vulcan because Vulcan is important we're
running FXAA to take some of that vram
stress off motion blur is off all this
stuff is off that's not needed advanced
we're running a mixture of medium
settings here actually pretty much
medium preset is what we're running ok
so 50 fps now this is the kind of game
where you would definitely want high FPS
because it's a twitch here right light
you like fast turns and shooting and
shooting of things and I mean it does
look like it drops down to the 30s here
obviously in some of like this dynamic
lighting like as you can see coming up
through here you're not gonna need that
arm so what if we go ahead and drop this
to low now where's low look like I mean
it's not the prettiest thing obviously
because we've got it at low but it's
funny cuz that's if you look at the game
quality on a lot of consoles now even
Xbox one s's and the PlayStation 4 Pro
and all that stuff if you compare it to
PC it's still equivalent to either we're
either between medium and low on PC so
I'm going to put us at 720p like you
were previously on some of the other
titles and see what we got there I'm
expecting a pretty good result 65 to 70
FPS like I said this is again no
graphics card it's always it always
blows my mind that that's where we are
now when APU can actually give you 720p
gaming performance 82 fps now this is
this is perfect for the person that
wants to build a system now doesn't have
a lot of money for a graphics card but
it's a good enough CPU to where if you
add a graphics card to it it's not like
you've got a cheap Athlon or something
like that that you know you can easily
bottleneck the cpu by going with a
and GPU later you could even add a high
end like 1080 or 1080i to this CPU and
not really bottleneck it I mean you
would have some sort of performance
impact but it's not gonna be like a huge
diminishing return where if you got
something like a dual-core like an old a
Pentium Anniversary Edition or something
like that you can easily add a graphics
card to this and not necessarily
bottleneck it in fact to give you an
idea of just how fast the CPU actually
is when it's overclocked to four gigs
well go ahead and compare it to we'll go
ahead and Cinebench right now so you can
see how that sort of stacks up so
Cinebench r15 it's going to remember we
are overclocked so I'm looking to see
how it compares here to around this
4770k range that's a four core eight
thread Intel CPU with hyper-threading
yeah it's quite a few years old but
remember that CPU also cost over $300
whereas this one comes in at less than
half of that including an IGP you can
actually game on if you tried to do the
same test with any sort of Intel CPU
right now that has a GPU inside of it
like a 1900 K even even with the iris
pro graphics or whatever you're not
gonna get anywhere near this level of
performance in fact do me a favor
comment down below if you'd like to see
us do a comparative head-to-head on the
latest Intel iris graphics with these
AMD raisa and ap use and here we are
we're finishing our tests right here
remember we are overclocked to 4
gigahertz and an 846 so that's a little
bit lower than that 866 we actually got
in our previous tests but it's important
to remember that this is not the same
system it's not the same motherboard
it's not even the exact same memory we
can't get this memory as high as we were
able to in the past don't know why it's
not the same operating system installs
there's a lot of variables in there that
you need to keep in mind but what you
can learn here is that you can actually
build a gaming system in 2019 that
utilizes the 2400 G and still play
modern titles if you're willing to drop
the resolution down to 720 that's design
for someone that's trying to get by
somebody wants to play games can't
afford a GPU yet but wants to sort of
future-proof themselves or make
themselves more future ready to put in a
GPU in there we could take something
like the 16 60 TI and stick it in here
or something like the rx 590 it have no
problems whatsoever yet amazing
performance as we've already shown and
then your CPU is still going to be an
amazing
eight core well eight logical core is a
fork or eight thread with SMT or a
simultaneous multi-threading on AMD
giving you a great CPU at an affordable
value so we've talked about this in the
past it's like our third or fourth video
talking about this over time and as you
can see it still maintains relativity
here in 2019 and with the new risin to
3000 series coming out later this year I
expect to sweet see good stuff coming
with next-gen hopefully some next-gen
Vegas stuff may be coming out with APU
all right guys I'm gonna go if you want
to see us do more tests with this let us
know what you'd like to see us do with
it and we will go from there thanks for
watching guys and as always we will see
you in the next one ah
are you think power power all right guys
we're gonna go if you want to see us to
do this all right guys we're brother
brother if you wanna see us to do the
