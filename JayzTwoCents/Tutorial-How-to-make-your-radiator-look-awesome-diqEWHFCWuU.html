one of those tutorial videos that i used
to do a lot of and i haven't done and
like well way way longer they'd like to
admit but that's okay because we're here
today and we are gonna do a video today
about how to refresh a beat up scratched
up radiator and make it go from fab to
flab wait that's that's not right damn
it
if you thought skunkworks was cool then
head on over to mod Coolermaster calm
and watch the biggest names in case
modding compete for over twenty thousand
dollars in cash and prizes so if you've
ever taken a radiator out of one case
and installed it into another you've
probably noticed right away that it
starts to look pretty bad pretty quickly
you get lots of dirt that gets stuck in
the fins you get some scratches that
appear on the screw holes and it just
becomes very unsightly and maybe you've
even been tempted to toss it out but you
don't want to do that
today we're going to go ahead and
refresh this bad boy of course to get
the job done right you're going to need
a few items first you're going to need
some cardboard some 400 grit sandpaper
canned air can of paint maybe another
can of paint a utility knife a sandwich
and of course the radiator start off by
taking your canned air and cleaning off
as much of the dust from the fins as you
possibly can
don't worry some of the dust is going to
get stuck to the fins and will not come
off you might have to resort to running
your radiator underneath some water but
if you do that you want to make sure
it's completely dry before moving on to
any of the painting steps now the paint
I'm using for this is the rust-oleum
universal satin which is a paint and
primer in one you would think it's a
good thing because it'll stick to
anything but really I'm just too cheap
to buy separate primer so I thought it
works for me now that your radiator is
all nice and clean go ahead and move out
to a well-ventilated area because this
after all is not paid a huffy material
this is a how to paint your radiator
tutorial in case you got a little bit
confused now go ahead and take your 400
grit sandpaper and and by the way never
mind the hieroglyphics on the ground
that's secret super secret project can't
can't tell you about it alright not to
kill you so don't even ask
you've been warned now go ahead and take
your sandpaper here and you're going to
make some some smooth back and forth
motions back and forth back and forth
you know just like you were rubbing leg
wax on your car and you're going to want
to pay special attention to the area
where the paint or the powder coating in
this case is starting to chip off and
you're going to want to make that as
smooth as possible but the idea here is
that you're roughing up the texture of
the surface and you're getting off any
sort of dirt or grime that may have been
stuck to it and so you can give the
paint and primer something to adhere to
because if you don't then of course
you're not going to get anything to
stick and then this will turn into how
to make your radiator look like crap
tutorial and then that's not what we're
doing here not today anyway
that's next week now standing on your
radiator is going to make a lot of
lovely dust but unfortunately that
doesn't work very well for painting so
you're going to want to take a wet paper
towel or washcloth and you're going to
want to rinse away as much of that dust
as possible use your canned air use a
wet rag ignore the devil dog back there
these ferocious vicious creature who
will bite your gonads off if you even
try to break into the house so I don't
suggest it he's very he's very fearsome
now that the radiators been completely
prepped and ready to go go ahead and
prep your paint can by shaking it up
real good and never mind why seems to be
such a natural motion I don't even you
don't even stop you're stupid stop you
don't know me but this is a brand new
can of spray paint you don't want to
spray directly on to the radiator right
away you want to do some tests phrase
you want to see if it's going to shoot
out nice and even or if it's going to
spray or if it's going to be this
tutorial is starting to sound like a
terrible idea now that I think about
this but we're committed now so you want
to make sure it's spraying nice and even
you don't want that globs of paint being
thrown on to the fins so once it's
spraying nice and even you just want to
do some nice even coats back and forth
maybe twelve inches away from the
radiator fins so we're just gonna do a
light coat on here to make it nice and
smooth that's that's it that's it no
more than that if you do more than that
you've you've done you've done too much
and you went ahead and you didn't watch
and you didn't pay attention and now
you've ruined it you've ruined it now if
you're repainting your radiator all
black then you can pretty much just go
ahead and skip these next couple of
steps but if you
want to change the outside color of your
radiator to something cool like white or
yellow or plaid then what you're going
to want to go ahead and do here is cover
up the radiator fins so you don't get
overspray on them now those two methods
that I use here to do this the first
thing you're watching me do here is take
some cardboard remember we mentioned the
cardboard and we're going to cut out a
template so that we can slide the
cardboard in underneath the fan screw
down points so that we can protect the
fins now normally you could just tape
this off which is the other method which
I'm showing here but the cardboard
actually provides some protection for
the fins whereas the tape doesn't so if
you bang it or something gets hit
against it you're not going to be able
to keep from smashing the fins the
cardboard method that you can but the
bottom line here is you want to protect
the fins from getting overspray and
damage and you want it to be a snug up
against the sheathing or the shielding
of the radiator as you can so that you
don't get overspray down inside now the
last thing you want to do to prepare
your radiator for painting and in the
pending awesomeness that is going to
come of it is to prepare your fitting
ports so that you don't get paint down
in them paint inside your radiator is a
bad thing so go ahead and take a piece
of paper towel or something non fibrous
it's not going to make a ton of fibers
like toilet paper would be bad go ahead
and roll it up like some sort of a nerdy
you know but that that's big enough so
that you can fit it down inside the tube
and the fitting port there and have it
be snug so that paints not going to get
in there if you happen to have any sort
of fittings that you don't care if they
get painted or any sort of plugs then it
is just G quarter threaded and you could
just thread in anything you wanted to
protect the holes as well so use
whatever is best for you so last but not
least before we get to the fun part of
spray-painting stuff make sure you take
a screw or something that matches your
radiator threading and screw it in so
you have something to hang it by so now
comes the part you've all been waiting
for
the end of the video oh no wait we're
not quite there yet almost there
sorry to disappoint anyway now is the
part where we get to spray paint the
radiator so you want to suspend the
radiator you don't want to handle it you
don't want to touch it
anything you do at this point handling
it would be terrible and you're going to
want to make nice even spray motions on
it but first thing you're going to want
to do is
do a test spray to see which way the
wind is blowing so you can stand upwind
of the wind you don't want the spray
paint coming back into your face trust
me that's a terrible thing so anyway now
that you know which way the air is
actually blowing go ahead and just start
doing even coats and do multiple coats
if necessary the worst thing you could
do at this point is put on too much
paint and have it start running because
then you have to run and try and catch
it nerds are typically out of shape and
you glass thing you want to do is have
to run now that you've given ample time
for your paint to dry according to the
paint specifications found on your can
you're going to want to go ahead and
start peeling up the tape slowly and
just take your time you don't want to
scratch the thing but you want to make
sure you give plenty of time for it to
dry I know you're going to be really
eager to see how the thing is going to
look but the worst thing you can do is
start messing around with it before the
paint is feel fully cured which it many
times could take more than a day or 24
to 48 hours you're going to want to go
ahead just give it plenty of time to sit
out in the Sun or just completely bake
and dry so if you follow these
instructions very carefully because I
know they were extremely complicated and
you could have never done this without
my video a /sarcasm then you would have
a radiator now that looks very very
happy and proud versus the sad and
pitiful radiator it was when you started
so anyway there you go guys that is how
you take a radiator that has been a
little bit loved and is a bit tired and
make it look like new well there you go
as you can see it's pretty damn simple
to paint and refresh your radiator I've
had a bunch of dents and things in there
there's not a whole lot you could have
done about that but if it's just minor
scratches especially around the screw
area or dirty fins you can certainly
make it look really really good very
minimal effort and only a couple of
bucks I'm not going to lie I almost
threw this radiator out but this extreme
radiator here from Swift Tech is a very
good radiator and I didn't want to lose
it so I figured this would be a perfect
opportunity to kind of give you guys a
little lesson here on how to do
something a simple cheap and effective
hope you guys have enjoyed today's video
it's a little bit of a how-to from Jay
which we haven't done in quite a while
so if you liked it you know what to do
hit the thumbs up button if you hated it
and you thought white radiators are
stupid
I think you're stupid but feel free to
hit the dislike button that's why that
one's there as well feel free to comment
head on over to the forums social media
and all that fun stuff
as always guys above all thanks for
watching I think I think it looks pretty
damn good now what the heck am I going
to put it in hey what's up YouTube Jays
two cents here and I think new buyers
who are looking at building their first
computer or even building another
computer but haven't done so in a while
are getting really caught up and
confused on how to choose the right
motherboard and I don't blame you guys
there's a lot of crap on motherboards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
