watching J's two cents and today we are
going to take a look at the question
that you've been asking over and over
and over again how to system RAM speed
affect gaming performance and this is a
little bita tech now right off the bat
you're going to notice some really funky
RAM speeds here showing in my BIOS and
the reason for that is in order to get
the max printed Ram speed on your module
you actually have to overclock your
processor you see I have 1866 megahertz
REM here installed on my computer
however the memory controller in the
chip only can handle 1333 mega Hertz at
stock speeds in order to get the higher
profile speeds on the RAM you have to
overclock the CPU and the bus speeds on
my processor right now just happen to be
making for some really unconventional
Ram speeds but this video is going to
give you an idea of what to expect now
rather than use a live game like
Battlefield 3 or Crysis 3 or something
along those lines for benchmarking I
opted to use Unigine Valley benchmark
for consistent frame rates and
comparisons just to see exactly how
system RAM affects gaming performance
and the results just may shock you now
it's important to note that I have my
GTX 680 currently running at 1350 to
beggar Hertz and I have my AMD FX 8350
running at 4.8 gigahertz and the reason
why you want to overclock your graphics
card and your CPU when doing stress
testing and RAM testing is because you
want to have the most amount of load on
the CPU as possible this way if Ram
turns out to be any sort of a bottleneck
it's going to show and in this case and
the benchmarks there is absolutely no
frames per second difference between
1200 and 79 megahertz and nineteen
hundred and twenty megahertz
if the benchmark doesn't see it this
means you're not going to perceive any
sort of frame per second changes while
gaming regardless of the RAM speed which
brings me back to the whole reason for
making this video is do you need fast
Ram speed when building a computer the
answer is no but J what if I want to do
videos what if I want to make YouTube
what if I want a live stream then do I
need faster Ram well I'm glad you asked
let's go ahead and take a look at the
effects on how Ram speed affected
render time in Sony Vegas I rendered
this one-minute sample clip on all three
RAM speeds and as you can see at twelve
hundred and seventy nine megahertz it
took a 1 minute and 12 seconds that very
same clip took exactly one minute and
eight seconds when rendered at 1600
megahertz and once again at 1920
megahertz we dropped it down to one
minute and six seconds so that's six
seconds faster rendering speed on a
one-minute video by simply raising the
clock speed from 1279 to 1920 on the RAM
so how exactly does that kind of
performance difference equate to a
benchmarking number well I'm glad you
asked because I put this processor at
the three different Ram speeds through
the wringer with Cinebench 11.5 and as
you can see we got an eight point three
and nineteen twenty and eight point two
seven and sixteen hundred and an eight
point two six at twelve seventy nine so
the difference is definitely very
minimal so Ram speed is definitely not
as important as overall CPU and power so
how does it compare when it's run at
stock speeds it fell on its face at a
six point nine zero Cinebench score so
as you can see processor speed and
overall power is much more important
than Ram speed when it comes to the
general-purpose usage of your computer
doesn't matter if you're rendering
gaming streaming youtubing pornography
it doesn't matter Ram speed is okay but
your processor definitely comes in at
number one and if you miss the video
where I talked about how much vram your
video cards really using click the video
on the left you'll be taken to that
video and if you're a new subscriber I
want to sincerely thank you for joining
my channel and joining this beautiful
experience at YouTube is turning out to
be and if you just happen to stumble
across this video where you just found
my channel for the first time hit that
subscribe button you're gonna like what
you have to see I've got all sorts of
videos talking about PC gaming and
general technology and I'm bringing back
my my original technology news show
called tech addiction on May 24th I'll
see you then and as always I will see
you when I see you in my next video
