going to talk to you about the RX 580
that just launched from AMD
earlier this week I feel like there's a
lot of loss and translation on this card
I feel like a lot of people have lost
focus about this and what this launch
actually means so we're going to talk
about that today and we're going to talk
about the specific card that I was sent
the RX 580 Nitro+ limited edition from
sapphire we'll talk about makes this
card so limited edition
we'll do some benchmarks but then we're
going to talk most importantly about
this card's existence and whether or not
you should buy it it's not necessary is
this card like the next cover like the
580 as a whole you know cooler masters
master key Pro series of keyboards offer
sixteen point seven million color RGB
genuine cherry switches a variety of
sizes as well as surface mounted
controls allowing full customization
without the need for stand-alone
software learn more by following the
link down below last summer the RX 4 80
made a huge splash at the sub $300 price
point usually right around 200 to 250
depending on the variants you got either
4 gig or 8 gig
well that's no different this time
around the RX 580 launches just under a
year about 10 months later than the RX 4
80 did but here's what you got to
understand I think a lot of folks were
very disappointed that this is just a
Polaris 10 improvement it's not a
rebranded to refresh you guys have heard
this before with AMD but this is a good
thing when you can take an existing
architecture and you can actually
improve upon it and give you this better
performance for the same price point
then it's a good thing now I know that
sounds very hypocritical compared to
what I said about the NVIDIA Titan XP
that's a whole different rant that's a
premium rant when it comes to the 1% and
yeah I understand that it sounds like
I'm talking out of both sides of my
mouth but this is about something that a
consumer can afford it's at a fairly low
price point that more people can afford
so when you get more people out there
with more horsepower able to enjoy their
games at the same cost that's a good
thing now this is the rx 580 Nitro+
limited edition card from sapphire and
what makes it a limited edition is it
actually has no fans no I'm just kidding
obviously it has fans it has removable
fans which is admittedly not the first
time we've seen this that fire knows
that but you can change out the fans
it's got two sets
when one comes installed which has no
LEDs that's the black fans here and then
you have blue fans which you can install
and I'll show you that in a second but I
took the fans out because I wanted you
to be able to see the massive spin
around there she added more fins to the
580 than they had on the 480 now
sapphire admits that the 480 was a bit
louder and hotter than they wanted it to
be so they made some very aggressive
improvements to the 580 cooler bringing
the premium back to the brand
now the limited edition is also a Binda
card which means it has the best GPUs of
the bunch in here and it has a second
BIOS that goes up to fourteen hundred
and fifty megahertz out of the buck if
you guys remember that's what I was able
to overclock the 480 to and that was all
the Headroom we had depending on the
flavor of the car this of course Silicon
lottery is involved here but the nice
thing about the limited edition cards is
they are Bend now we're gonna see if we
can overclock this at all today it's my
understanding though that's not a lot of
overclocking Headroom but anyway that's
always worth taking a look at here but
like I said it is a multi BIOS card it
is a 8 pin and 6 pin power requirements
on here 500 watt power supply is
recommended for this card and as you can
see we've got obviously a backplate it
does face the right way so when it's
installed you can see your logos I feel
like the backplate goes a little bit
edgy when it comes to the graphics I
would like to either have been a solid
silver or a solid black not a fan of
this design but that's completely
personalized and subjective when it
comes to power delivery - though it is
also being actively cooled the heatsink
array in the in the back does actually
touch the VRMs and it has heat pads on
there I think the EVGA Fiasco has
created us to always take a look at that
now to see if that is there but anyway
just like before it comes in two flavors
for gigabyte and a gigabyte variants
same with the 570 so anyway we're going
to do now is I'm going to go ahead and
show you guys kind of how the fans
attach to this so that you guys can just
sort of see their contact base right
there you've got this little edge that
you stick in there just like so slide it
in there and then it's got one Phillips
head screw
that you screw down to attach the fan to
the heatsink where you can just drop the
little screw down there like I keep
doing because I suck the nice thing is
if you drop it down this tends to fall
all the way through and start all over
but anyway yeah I'm not very good at
screwing things my kids were a miracle
he snickered teased a grid away but
anyway once you get lined up there it is
right there so now that that's done
let's go ahead and pinch market okay now
they've had some time to play with the
rx 580 I want to say that it is exactly
what you would expect it is a slightly
faster RX 4 80
when it comes to core speed but it's
exact same specs across the board an 8
gigabyte model it's got a 4 gigabyte
model all your brands that you expect to
be making it are making it so that's why
I kind of changed my focus when I was
doing my benchmarks and I didn't even
run all the gambit of benchmarks because
pretty much could look at the RX 480 and
see exactly what was going to stack up
because it's about 10% faster and we're
between like 8 to 10% faster depending
on the title but getting better
performance for the same amount of money
especially at this price point as
good thing so let's talk about
overclocking because I heard some
reviewers actually say don't even bother
don't even try to overclock it all the
Headroom has already been squeezed out
of it there's no point in even trying
which makes you wonder then why these
Bend cards even exist and the Nitro+
limited edition that I have was actually
able to achieve fifteen hundred and
thirty five megahertz on the core not as
stable as I would have liked it didn't
make it through all of my testing which
is why I didn't call it 1535 stable I
actually calling it 1500 stable
depending on the test but 1500 is a big
deal because with the exception of the
card I put on water I couldn't get
anywhere near 1500 on the RX 480 and
even that was hit or miss depending on
the type or the title I was trying to
play or benchmark it may crash every now
and then with a random crash but this is
doing it on air not on water so that's a
big deal
now something I want to point out with
the cooler here in actually Nick pointed
this out was these fins are actually
running the length of the card and not
the height of the card whether I mean it
sometimes from the graphics card type
fins that go up and down rather than
long ways now having it long weighs
definitely have the benefit because you
can see this giant opening cut out or
open cut out on the back which is
allowing a more efficient flow of air to
exit both the rear of the card and the
card that's sitting the side of the
chassis so you're getting better airflow
but not only that you're not heating up
the components on the motherboard things
like MDOT two drives or neighboring
components VRMs chipsets whatever
because the air is not being forced down
through the card onto the motherboard
which unfortunately a lot of
manufacturers actually do so that was a
definite plus and I think that is aiding
in the temperatures that we saw while
testing never seeing higher hotter than
75 C on factory settings and when you
bumped the fan up to about 37% and just
leave it there which I want to point out
is completely inaudible when it comes to
the open air test bench it's no louder
than the fans that are already on here
at the water cooling temperatures stayed
right around 60 to 62 C while
overclocked
at that 1500 megahertz so they've
definitely done a great job at taking
care of the acoustics issue that wood
was complained about with the 400 series
power delivery as well as overall
temperatures so I'm very happy to see
that the 5
eighty guys it is what it is it isn't
improved our X 480 for the same price
that I mean if they had improved it and
then charge more for it that would have
been kind of a crappy thing but they
improved it for the same price and yeah
I know my Titan rent was very similar to
what I'm saying right now
that's a 1% price point that is nobody
should be buying a $1200 card anyway
that that price shouldn't even exist but
getting more performance for the same
amount of money at $200 a $250 price
point is a big deal now this card does
have a bit of a premium it costs $279 US
dollars as it says right now but if you
don't care about you know the removable
fans and you don't care about the bin
GPU then you can actually get this card
in the Nitro+ Edition the non limited
edition for 249 and save 30 bucks if you
want to say it even more you could get a
4 gigabyte model for 229 trust me when I
say the extra 220 bucks is worth the a
gigabyte you don't want your vram to
become your limitation as titles
progress and start having bigger
textures even at 1080p having more
memory bandwidth available to you is
definitely going to be a positive anyway
you guys tell me what you think I've
seen some pretty mixed reviews in the
community regarding the expectations of
this card and I think it aligns exactly
where it needs to I don't I don't know
why people would complain about getting
more performance for the same amount of
money anyways that's it I'm gonna get on
out of here you guys tell me what you
think about this and what other cards
you think I should check out there's not
going to be a whole lot of variance
between these cards with the exception
of maybe two overclocking ability so
with that guys I'm going to go thanks
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the next one let me go downstairs
I read that Nick
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
