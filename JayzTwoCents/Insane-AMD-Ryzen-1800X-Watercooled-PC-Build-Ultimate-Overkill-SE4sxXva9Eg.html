youtube career we actually have
something new and exciting to talk about
from camp AMD and that being obviously
the new zen architecture or rise in CPUs
that I would assume you've all heard
about by now now of course we've seen
some launches in the past which are
slight upgrades and tweaks to the
existing bulldozer architecture but this
is a new x86 architecture built from the
ground up so it is entirely new which is
kind of the best part about that so
obviously I have to do a build and yeah
I haven't done an AMD like custom build
any very long time so this should be
good but anyway let's take a look here
at what AMD actually sent over you can
kind of see what we're going to be doing
here now you guys have seen this before
already I'm sure Paul did a very good
unboxing video on that here we have an
1800 X kind of need that we've got some
lpx memory here from Corsair this is
vengeance 16 gigabyte or 2 times 8
gigabyte sticks of 3,000 megahertz ddr4
and of course we have the asu's
crosshair 6 here oh this is kind of near
and dear to me because I started my
channel on a crosshair live formula from
AMD with my 8320 CPU so I kind of feel
like we've gone full circle now to keep
things cool they have sent over B not to
at Nhu 12s II am for cooler and what's
cool about this is it actually has
blacks fans I mean who's got who
would've thought black planet fans
actually existed from Noctua
chips it up there they are actually an
all black fan request so it BJ's 2 cents
if I did air cooling so as much as I
appreciate the gesture
AMD I'm just going to kind of move that
over there because I've got some plans
for this so without further ado let's
take a look at what I come up with
if I look really tired my eyes are
really red and I'm squinting and stuff
guys I spent four days Billy I should
only sit 2 days building this but I
spent two more days troubleshooting some
of the issues that unfortunately arise
with new platforms anyway it's going to
talk about what I built here this is of
course the fantex
end to evolve with the tempered glass
editions we've got glass on this thing
it looks fantastic now seeing it in
these pictures and/or those videos
because they're just too reflective but
I took two of my GTX Titan X Maxwell
cards the ones that came out of skunk
works I put those in here is in SLI and
I didn't want to do that at first
because I want to be able to easily swap
out the cards on this but I have a
feeling this system is going to stay
together because it turned out really
frickin good now of course we've got the
1800 X from AMD in there I've got 16
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance lpx low
profile memory and a very custom water
loop in here now before people start
saying you can't run your list that way
it's not going to work because it's just
going to pass by no it works perfectly
fine guys the flow splits itself between
the blocks and the CPU all the
temperatures are perfectly within check
well with the exception of the CPU I
can't monitor temps on that I think it
turned out great it really really did of
course I've got the Vardar fans on there
with the ek rads I got 240 in the front
45 ml 240 on the front and a 30 mil 360
millimeter radiator on top now for power
supplied got the Corsair RM 850 X some
people thought that maybe the 850 might
be a little bit low when I showed
pictures of this on Instagram but trust
me when I say it's plenty especially
with the quite aggressive power
efficiency are quite aggressive and you
got with their power efficiency
especially with the 1800 X which is at
95 watt so we've got more than enough
power now one of the reasons why this
video took so long as being the J that I
am I decided I wanted to play around
with overclocking where I then somehow
proceeded to brick one of my crosshair 6
hero motherboards still not entirely
sure how that happened
it simply boot loops like crazy
and switching out the motherboard we're
fine CPU works fine something went weird
and wonky with the BIOS in one of these
boards I've definitely been in
communication with Asus about this they
are going to be taking the board back
and fully diagnosing it to see what went
wrong because that's of course how you
make better BIOS and stuff you find out
will be wrong and you fix it so I just
happen to have a second board though by
chance and here we are now back up and
running with it so that meant I spent
all night Thursday night tearing this
apart putting it back together
reinstalling the operating system
reinstalling games and all of that which
is why this video is so late so I
apologize for that but anyway here we
are now with all the build stuff out of
the way let's go ahead and talk about
the performance of these CPUs now I did
not do a direct comparison between any
Intel chips I wanted to see what these
things were capable of pretty much just
on their own because I I am I don't care
that AMD was comparing it to the 69
hundred K I I really take all that with
a grain of salt because even if the 69
hundred K beats it the argument is
usually well it should it's more than
twice the price but we are at least
getting very very comparable performance
level of the 69 hundred K at half the
price for highly multi-threaded
applications things like Cinebench and
blender and handbrake things that go
well we've got all these cores let's
leverage it the problem is when you
start talking about gaming it's not
quite so cut and dry fair warning moving
forward regarding games though is I did
not do a very in-depth dive in gaming
because I spent a very long time and
many hours just trying to be with BIOS
and stability issues so unfortunately a
lot of my time that I had allocated to
spend gaming the crap out of the system
was spent just getting it to work but I
did use some of the titles I use when I
do my GPU benchmarking like Metro last
light doom in Vulcan dirt rally which is
very good at usually stressing a CPU and
of course synthetics like fire strike
and heaven now they did very well they
did do very well the problem is if you
look at any other reviewer on the market
pretty much pick anyone who actually
decided to compare these to something
like a 7700 K the Intel offering at
around 3
fifty dollars is still VIP cking which
is giving you better performance in
1080p gaming then these CPUs are in fact
there's even online evidence of AMD
getting their nose extremely at a joint
with reviewers who decided to do 1080p
testing and II believe that these CPUs
are directly aimed at 1440p and 4k
gamers now I'm going to go ahead and
call that out right now as a load of
crap because the more resolution you put
into your game the more you're
offloading the load onto the GPU and the
CPU becomes less of a factor 1080p
gaming is a very relevant test to CPU
overhead because your CPU is tasked with
trying to keep up with the massive
amount of frames being drawn by your
graphics cards in fact if you go look at
the Steam Hardware analytics you will
find that 1080p gaming is still
extremely dominant so that's why we do
1080p gaming it is talking directly to
the majority but then again it's also
very fair to call me out and say J most
people attain a DP panel wouldn't be
running dual titannics maxwell cards and
with that i would say you're absolutely
right but this was a good way to see
just how far we could push the FPS
before the cpu really starts to become a
factor now 1080p gaming on the 1800 x
was pretty freakishly smooth I have to
admit even though I'm throwing a crap
ton of frames at it it seemed to keep up
pretty well in fact if I didn't have an
FPS counter up in the corner I would
have absolutely no idea what the frames
running at because it was very very high
but frame pacing I also seems to be
improved a little bit over like some of
the testing I've done on i-5 and i7 7700
KF region recently with the KB Lake
launch I would have no problems
recommending this CPU to someone running
1080p gaming in fact the only weird
anomaly anomaly
the only anomaly I really experienced
though while gaming was while running
Doom with the Vulcan API at 4k on Ultra
settings where I experienced an extreme
amount of input lag in fact enough where
I even engaged slow-mo on my camera to
kind of try and see just how bad it was
you guys can see here it was pretty
unplayable but yeah that was I can't
really explain that one when I would
bring it down to 1080p or 1440p it was
perfectly fine with no lag whatsoever
now that kind of brings me to the
recommendation side of this video
jay-j do you recommend AMV Raisa
I'm going to tell you this this is by
far though the most compelling argument
that we've seen from AMD regarding CPUs
in a very long time my problem regarding
recommending it right now has nothing to
do with the actual architecture of the
chip itself
it has to do with these guys right here
AMD didn't get a lot of lead time for
the many manufacturers of motherboards
to be able to refine and optimize the
BIOS there's also some optimization that
needs to take place inside the operating
system and God knows there's some level
of optimization that needs to take place
in terms of the game developers perfect
example is the heaven benchmark we're
running it on Rison CPU one was usually
pegged at 100% usage guaranteed to be
above 90 but like I said sometimes
hitting 100 now I thought that was kind
of strange because I've recently done
some heaven benchmarks where I noticed
that it was the hyper-threaded cores
that were kind of sitting idle but the
rest of the cores were actually
splitting the load between them so that
kind of prompted me to fire up my Intel
system which is going right behind me
right here and do the exact same test
and again like I expected the
utilization was being spread out across
the cores themselves again with
hyper-threading kind of not doing
anything but we saw a much more balanced
load so that obviously means we need to
wait for some optimizations to happen
now I did play around with the affinity
it made no difference whatsoever with
the rise in CPU it still pegged out
number one and then the load just fell
off hardcore as it went down the course
deck so my recommendation to the people
asking me should you buy Rison or wait
is this if you are going to buy Rison
you are also buying into cutting edge
bleeding edge technology which
unfortunately is usually pretty painful
as you're waiting for optimizations and
updates to come about you would also be
buying into probably some level of
headaches and if you're buying it
specifically hoping to get amazing
overclocking performance I've got bad
news for you
overclocking on these things is very
very very disappointing it's average
about 300 megahertz overclock I ran all
of these tests at 3.9 gigahertz and some
folks are hitting four gigs and it's
like the top 1% or hitting 4.1 now
silicon manufacturing quality can't
improve over
time which might help some of the
overclocks but again time is going to
tell but if you are someone that wants
to buy it and have 100% stability
upfront then you might want to hold off
this a little bit and I'm not saying
hold off by not buying it and going with
Intel I'm saying hold off and wait until
we see some maturity on the software
side of things with BIOS and operating
system and game optimizations this is
brand new architecture guys this has
never been seen before including by the
developers and even by some of the
manufacturers of the motherboard anyway
there's my video regarding Rison I can't
get forward it is I don't feel like it
was deep enough but I didn't get to
spend a lot of time doing the testing I
wanted to spend a lot of time trying to
get the damn thing to work which is why
my recommendation regarding waiting for
maturity on the software side of things
it's probably going to be my stance on
this for a while of course I will be
doing 1700 X and 1700 s testing as well
the 1700's is by far I think the real
interesting one in all of this because
it's so much cheaper but I'm more
interested in seeing what 3 &amp;amp; 5 have to
bring anyway guys tell me about is video
like if you like it guys I put I put so
much ridiculous time into this video
this crazy build was simply because I
felt you guys deserve seeing a crazy
AMD build I think it turned out pretty
damn well anyway follow me over on
Twitter if you want to tell me J you
suck you should never review another CPU
again I'd probably take that statement
and run with it because it's just
sometimes such a headache anyway I'm
going to sleep down guys thanks for
watching this video as always I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
