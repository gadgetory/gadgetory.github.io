you know I've always lived by it's
better to be late than never and
considering every other tech youtubers
already done their sky like video I
figure it's time to go ahead and do mine
Mastrov is excited to announce three new
communities RC cars photography and
Corvettes
be the first snow in these communities
officially hit the site by subscribing
using the links below okay so I'm gonna
have a small series coming up here about
sky Lake where I'm going to be doing the
build here which is going to be kind of
a build overview I'm showing you the
parts telling you the parts I've chosen
for this sky like build and then I'm
going to tell you what I have planned in
the future for giving you as much sky
light content as I can to be relevant to
your builds I'm getting a lot of
questions about should I go with sky
lake or should I go with 4790k is it
worth going to dr4 will kind of do some
comparisons here now here are the parts
that we have chosen for sky Lake now
obviously I've gone with the core i7
6700 K because that's what Intel sent
now what's interesting about this box I
want you guys to realize that this is a
retail sample not one of those
handwritten classified samples which
always leave us wondering a little bit
you know whether or not Intel kind of
hand-picked that and sent it over this
is actually off a retail shelf and it's
in retail packaging and it's probably a
little bit closer to being more
realistic as to what you guys would get
if you wanted to say Fry's or Micro
Center bought one from Newegg so I
prefer to do retail samples when it
comes to CPUs which I've always done in
the past rather than doing the you know
classified hand-picked is style CPU
which is sent over by engineering anyway
for the motherboard I went with the EVGA
z170 for the win and you guys know why I
chose this motherboard if you're
following on Twitter and if you're not
following on Twitter you should be
because you would already know the
answer to why I'm using this motherboard
and it's not just because I'm a little
bit of a horror for when it comes to
EVGA with that being one of my favorite
brands
honestly it comes down to the fact that
it's pretty much all black there's a
little bit of accent color in there but
I am personally sick and tired of all
the flashy gaudy ugly colors that a lot
of the brands are doing out there I'm
not a fan believe it or not of yellow
and black motherboards or white
motherboards or just it's almost like
Asus asrock gig
by MSI they're all in this race for who
can make the biggest ugliest flashiest
motherboard and that's not what I like
so the EVGA Z for the z170 for the win
really fit the bill in terms of features
and the fact that it's a standard ATX
board because we are using the s340 NZXT
razor Edition case now for cooling I'm
using the corsair h 100 i honestly
because it's just available and I have
it I've got some other needs for my
predator and then because I'm going to
be orienting it on the front and not on
the top of the case because this case
only has 120 millimeter single fan
exhaust on the top that's why I'm not
using the h2 20x or anything like that
because I don't want to orient that all
sideways so this can be front mounted on
the front of this case for graphics
cards here I'm using my GTX 970 s these
are EVGA SSC edition to get a little bit
of blue accenting right here but when
they're in the case like this there's
silver right here on the front so the
Blues not going to show I went with two
of them simply because I have two of
them so why not
but some of my future plans once this
system is all together is to kind of
swap out the graphics cards with things
like the Titan X or some massively
overclocked cards and start to see if we
can get any bottlenecking when it comes
to the 6700 K I highly doubt it when it
comes to gaming but it's something we'll
check for in the future for RAM I'm
running 16 gigabytes for 4 gigabyte
sticks of HyperX predator now it's not
ideal to be using 4 sticks or gonna be
doing overclocking I'd prefer two sticks
8 gigabyte but I don't have to six of
eight gigabytes I have 4 4 gigabytes so
that's what we'll be doing there and
then when it comes to storage I've just
got my 4 terabyte Western Digital black
and then for main drive I'll be using
500 gigabyte SSD Evo other than that
we're going to go and put it all
together and then we'll come back and
we'll just take a look kind of a tour of
the system and it will run down what we
doing in the future with some future
videos regarding skylake transition
all right obviously it's the next day
because I spent a lot of time working on
this build yesterday came across a few
snags and I want to talk about right now
I just realized I look awfully preppy
don't die like I think it's a nice shirt
it's in it it's a nice shade of blue
okay so building in the NZXT s340 I mean
that's really what this is it's got a
few razer logos on there and some under
glow under the case and a glowing logo
on the front but in all intents and
purposes it is in NZXT s340 now building
in this case was actually not that bad
considering it - mid tower it it's a it
fits a full ATX board in there or micro
ATX if you want a little bit more room
you can fit a 240 radiator on the front
as we did here with the H 100 I and I'll
be honest the only real reason I went
with the H 100 is because I can change
the pump LED to green I mean I really
kind of wanted this to be a very green
themed build especially since I'm gonna
be moving skunkworks over to a green
build I thought well it's kind of get a
dry run here of how green would look and
I really like it obviously we changed
out the graphics card and I didn't put
my tight necks in there simply because I
wanted to put in a tight necks it turns
out that the two 970 s on this
motherboard gave me a little bit of an
issue and here's as to why the EVGA z170
for the wind does not have any plx chip
on there whatsoever which means we are
limited to only the native PCI Express
Lanes now the problem with that is I
went ahead and added into this mix-up
here I didn't I didn't feel like
reinstalling all of the OS and starting
all over so what I did was I took the m2
SSD out of my simulator build my
computer I built simply for my racing
sim and it already had the OS and
everything installed on it so I just
took that out put it on this motherboard
as you can see down there underneath the
graphics card and the problem is MDOT -
also utilizes PCI Express Lanes now
there's more than enough lanes to be
able to use the SSD on there are the m2
SSD and still go with SLI the problem is
EVGA has it set up so that you have to
use the top two PC
Express slots for SLI and not one and
three so one in two puts the graphics
card sandwiched together now considering
the grab the nine 70s that I have are
not blower style cards they are
recirculating cards means that the top
card was going to be completely starved
of air not only that it looked terrible
the other issue I came across when doing
this build is the fact that for whatever
reason don't ask me why but for whatever
reason EVGA decided to omit every single
USB 2.0 header on the motherboard there
are no USB 2.0 headers now the reason
why that bothers me and that's a big
deal is one using corsair link with the
h 100 i uses a USB 2.0 header we plug
the header on to the motherboard and
then you control the pump that's not
that huge of a deal with the h 100 i
considering you can plug in a standard
USB you know mini USB plug plug it into
the you know back of the motherboard
into one of those USB ports and
everything will work fine you could set
it up and then unplug it not worry about
it again the other problem was i wanted
to try out NZXT new hue plus lighting
system which they sent over and i
thought that this would be the perfect
build where i could balance out the
lighting and play around with the RGB
effects unfortunately that also uses a
USB 2.0 header now yes i put that out on
twitter and everyone's like just get a
USB 3.0 adapter a 2.0 3.0 adapter then i
can't use the USB 3.0 plug for the front
of the case which means that the USB
plugs on the ports on the front of the
case or technically at the top what have
been rendered useless now what I'm
getting at here was my need of an
all-black motherboard led to some
compromises that I'm not too happy about
especially getting rid of the USB 2.0
headers in my opinion it would make more
sense to ditch the front side audio than
it would be to ditch the USB 2.0 because
there's lots of cases that still have
USB 2.0 headers on the front of the case
fractal design being one of them they've
typically will put two USB 3.0 and two
USB 2.0 on there I feel like there's a
lot of compromises on this motherboard
that don't make sense and had I known
all that going into it I might have just
gotten a different motherboard and then
it to be black that's why the tight
necks is in there although it does match
aesthetically now I still could
technically do my 9 70s in SLI and not
you have to worry about BM - if I was to
simply clone the m2 partition on to my
samsung SSD then I would be able to take
the m-dot - off the motherboard free up
those lanes and then be able to use the
proper separation for the nine 70s like
I would need to do SLI but then once
again I'm making a compromise of going
with a slower drive as we all know m2 on
the motherboard is way faster than going
through like you know SATA 6 gigabits
per second port and an SSD I would much
rather use the m2 as my operating system
partition and drive because it's just
natively so much faster than SATA 6
gigabits so far dealing with skylake is
been pretty simple I don't know if I got
a really good overclocking chip I
started playing around some of the
overclocking we'll do another video
about skylake overclocking because right
now I just did a down-and-dirty
overclock on this thing I just bumped up
the multiplier
I put the RAM at XMP profile 1 so the
ram is running at 20 800 megahertz right
now and my CPU is actually running at
4.9 gigahertz right now and I didn't
even try and tune the thing it probably
is pumping more voltage into it then it
really needs although the temperatures
have been sitting under load right
around the mid-80s and then at idle it
tends to sit somewhere closer around to
the low 30s and then at stock speeds is
like mid 20s so the H 100 I is doing a
fantastic job in here but anyway I don't
even have a name for this build I
honestly don't even know if this build
is going to stay together but I had to
put something together to test out
skylight for you guys and I thought well
NZXT sent this case over a while ago I
might as well at least try it out see
how it looks I'm happy with the s340
it's a very well-thought-out case for
the size I mean I love the fact that
you've got separation of the power
supply unit so none of that heat is
making its way into the main compartment
of the case I like where the SSDs mount
because SSDs look really cool these days
and so a lot of people definitely like
to show off their SSDs especially if
they match in some way but oh no I'm
pretty impressed with the NZXT s340 it's
got a lot of thought put into
this mid-tower case you can fit a 240
rad on the front a 30 millimeter rad
including the you know thickness of the
fans so you've got about 55 millimeters
of clearance there You've if you remove
the bracket that you can install the
pump on if you don't need that then you
could go with a thicker radiator no
problem all the way up to like a 60
millimeter not have any problems in
their full ATX size motherboard no top
mounted radiators though those aren't
going to fit in there not enough
clearance between the fan and the
motherboard but you could also
technically go with a rear mounted
radiator on there if you wanted for like
a single 120 AIO
separation the power supplies you're not
getting any contamination of heat into
the main compartment you can show off
your SSDs and that even includes a
bracket to mount your reservoir to which
is usually the more difficult part when
it comes to new water coolers because
they don't want to drill into their case
so they've already got a spot there for
you I am using the BitFenix a alchemy
lighting in there which is actually a
magnetic lighting strip so that's what's
giving me the green right there as you
can see here I actually can't get off
there we go
if things just magnetic on there so that
makes it nice and easy if you're not
using an aluminum case then it will
stick to it no problems but anyway we've
got a few videos coming up that I'm
going to do we're gonna do a skylight
overclocking tutorial and guide we are
going to also use this case because I
saw an awful lot of comments of people
who claim to be in the know saying oh my
god you can't put a front mounted
radiator on that case you're gonna heat
up your components and everything gonna
explode in the world's gonna completely
be destroyed as far as we know it that's
not you actually will support that with
some numbers where temperatures can be
affected a little bit but trust me
they're not gonna be affected nearly as
much as you think they're going to me
anyway we're gonna get out of here help
me think of a name for this project give
head on over to twitter at JS two cents
and tell me what you think i should call
it or if you don't use twitter then just
put it down in the comments and whatever
name we choose if i choose your name
though maybe I'll give you a shout out
but anyway guys thanks for looking at
this little build here all in all I'm
actually pretty happy with the way it
turned out I even went with my k70 RGB
and made it greens that we can be all
like metrosexual and match
and stuff anyway time to get out of here
guys as always thanks for watching and I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
