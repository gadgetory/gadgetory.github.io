head on over to mod coolermaster calm
and watched the biggest names in case
modding compete for over $20,000 in cash
and prizes hey what's going on guys Jays
$0.02 here and today we're gonna look at
something that is actually quite rare in
North America I know right everything
seems to be like centered in North
America we're gonna be taking a look at
the galaxy TX 980 Hall of Fame
now one of the first things you'll
notice about the Hall of Fame card is
that it is absolutely monstrous the
thing is huge it's got seven heat pipes
on this thing ensuring that everything
stays nice and cool you can actually see
six in the back here but one loops
towards the front but what actually
makes this cooler very unique as well is
that very few brands are actually
incorporating the vrm into the massive
heatsink design and a lot of times
they'll have a smaller heatsink that the
air blows over but these this massive
cooler actually touches the VRMs which
is important because when you have a
custom built card like this where
everything from the ground up is built
from scratch then they can do things
like that and it works out very very
well it's in requires two 8-pin PCI
Express and it does have two eighty
millimeter fans and 190 millimeter fan
on the front now unlike most graphics
card manufacturers where they put a
little toggle switch on the top of the
card here for going between the
different bios they actually put a
button on the back and this is nice
because it means you don't have to open
up your case to switch the BIOS on this
thing if you want to kind of play around
with it you can simply push it on the
back now pushing this thing in does ramp
up the fan speed on this thing it does
also increase the power that goes to the
GPU theoretically giving it better
overclocking but of course overclocking
is always going to come down to the luck
of the draw when it comes to the Silicon
Lottery inside of the die itself and one
of the other things that makes Galax
cards extremely sought-after it's the
fact that they have all white PCBs now
in the back here as you can see we do
have a bare anodized aluminum backplate
or aluminium people always get on to me
for saying aluminum it's how we say it
here sorry to America but you have the
white PCB you have the white ends gray
cooler on there it's all moment the
black fan in the middle and then you do
have the aluminium backplate on there
which just looks absolutely fantastic
you do have three display ports an HDMI
and a DVI which is pretty standard and
you know what there's not a whole lot
else to say about this thing other than
it's got all the standard 980 specs
built from the ground up I say we put
this thing on the test bench and
actually let it put its money where
Malthus let's face it when it comes to
the cost of this card it does carry
quite a premium here in the United
States especially considering you can't
actually get them in the United States
very easily at all
I bet everyone else in the rest of the
world is like finally the United States
knows exactly what we're going through
well not me I've got one well I think
the first thing I want to point out is
that what that button pushed in the fan
is going or the fans are going
absolutely balls to the wall and there's
no control over it
it's idling at 29 degrees Celsius 30
degrees Celsius but as you can see here
the RPM is 3,200 rpm and there is
nothing that you can do to control that
I mean whether it's on auto or manual no
matter what you've got no control over
the fan it just goes balls-to-the-wall
so the second you push that button and
turn it off then the fans no longer ramp
up but they claim you get more power
controls so let's go ahead and see if we
can overclock this thing you know that's
what they say you can do so anyway
okay now I've gone ahead and done a plus
100 megahertz over whatever the boost is
gonna be
we've put 90 degrees Celsius as our
priority target for GPU temp that's fine
it's not going to hit 90 we just don't
want it to use power target as our
limiter it does allow us to go 16% on
the power target over where a factory is
and we added 300 to our memory even
though the GTX Maxwell series has it's
like power balancing function where it's
supposed to add more power to the memory
when it's not being used
I found that I still get very good
results about overclocking the memory
then letting it do it by itself because
half the time it doesn't change it
anyway so anyway let's go ahead and go
into some valley here and just do some
stability testing and let's see if this
overclocked well validates that's that's
where I start my testing as Valley
benchmark because it's pretty and I like
it all right so I've been a little bit
less than thrilled with the overclocking
of this card and of course it comes down
to the lottery and I've also been less
than thrilled with precision
honestly everything has been kind of
like go
like crap today huh
let's go ahead and relaunch precision so
I haven't been able to get this Hall of
Fame card anywhere near neither the 980
classified from EVGA or the 980 hybrid
water-cooled one from EVGA which is a
reference PCB which is crazy so that
just kind of goes to show that no matter
what the silicon lottery is gonna play a
factor no matter how custom we make the
board no matter how amazing you make the
vrm is no matter how high the inductors
quality inductors you use or it being
ten phases eight plus two for the RAM or
you know it doesn't matter if the
silicon quality isn't there to get you
the amazing results then no matter what
you put on it it's not gonna do it so I
ended up turning off that stupid switch
in the back too because I couldn't
tolerate the noise anymore I'm not I'm
not a fan of them forcing a hundred
percent fan speed out of you but I guess
it makes sense if they're pushing more
power to the GPU but one of the reasons
why I also backed off that button and
that fan speed was the extra fan speed
and the extra cooling wasn't giving me
any additional performance whatsoever at
least on this particular samples so
anyway it looks like the we load up
valley again here real quick it looks
like we're gonna be settling on right
around 1,500 maybe fifteen ten on the
core and I did a lot of much stability
testing here outside of you know the
camera off because it ended up taking a
lot longer there's no way I could have
actually done any of this with on camera
because you guys would have gone
completely insane so yeah so 15 15 is
where it's pretty much going and it's
not terrible but it's not I know if it's
really it's not top of the list on nine
80s anyway one another thing I want to
point out too is no matter how much
additional voltage control I give it
here you know it only gives you a plus
37 millivolt on this thing because it's
already got high quality VRMs in there
which are doing over voltage already so
this didn't make any sort of difference
whatsoever
kay boost all that stuff it didn't
really seem nummy nothing mattered
anyway I'm using precision on this and
caboose is more of a forcing high
voltage constant voltage so anyway it
didn't make any sort of difference in
terms of overclocking so we're just
gonna leave it here and we'll go and
check out some Far Cry 4 after we update
steam there's something I want to point
out listen to this inductor noise so
yeah I grant it we were in the menu and
it was or the loading screen and it was
high FPS I just want to point out that
these adductors are very very audible
even right now 256 frames per second in
this loading screen I can hear the
inductors over there so that's not a
good thing of course I've got vsync off
but of course we won't be sync and gsync
off of one to test max FPS and see what
the cards capable of pushing so it's one
other thing that I noticed here while
looking around in a few games with this
card specifically that does not happen
on any other card that I own is 1440
will not show up as an option it jumps
directly from 1920 by 1080 to 3840 by
2160 so goes from 1080 to 4k there's no
1440p option so I don't know what's up
with that but this this card is getting
a little bit funkier and funkier the
more I yeah say even on auto aspect
ratio 1920 straight up to 38 40 he just
quadruples all of a sudden it won't it
won't give me 1440 options so I don't
know what's up with that I don't want to
test this card at 1080p but I want to
test it at 4k there because I know this
one card is not capable of 480 or 4k at
a decent framerate so I guess we'll go
forward with 1080 as you guys can see
I'm kind of blocked on this one here
whatever okay one thing I just want to
point out right now is the inductors are
going I mean the inductors are very very
noisy even at 95 fps right now in the
game the inductors are going very very
haywire
I mean the FPS is definitely not
disappointing but then again we are in
1080p so yeah I don't know why it won't
get me 1440p option though all the other
entities that I have every other
graphics card I have will give me the
option of you know any resolution at any
aspect ratio up to a certain point
anyway we'll get into a gunfight here
we'll see how the FPS does hello I'm at
bullets I am dead yeah I mean the FPS is
good but it's 1080p so it should be good
alright so I decided for the last test
instead of doing battlefield or whatever
we'll go ahead and do some watchdogs we
don't know done watchdogs in a while I'm
not very far into the game but I do have
all the settings completely maxed out
right now including the MSA right 1920
by 1080 again the next resolution that
gives me up is 2048 by 1536 that's kind
of a weird resolution I don't know why
it's doing that as you can see it's a
little bit squished so I don't know why
it's doing that
so I guess we're gonna go to 1920 by
1080 MSA is at 4x and we do have vsync
off and GPU max buffered frames 5 I bump
it up to 5 so it's trying to render out
ahead as much as possible but as you can
see I mean we're getting FPS in the 80s
here it's very smooth there's gonna be
some tearing though this is a 60 Hertz
panel so I should think this is the way
we were going right
but I do want to point out once again
the inductor noise is pretty loud
the sad part is having lost all of my
progress in this game I do love the way
this guy could just kind of like pick up
anything and like MacGyver it into you
know whatever you want it's kind of
funny yeah I could just be like oh let's
craft a hacking device out of an item I
just picked up off the counter it's okay
because I'm a gamer throw a distraction
over there lure him over there and there
he goes
the cops like huh what happy
yeah
yeah I don't know wait no wait over
there yeah that cop is dumb it's fine a
guy we can hack there we go he now has
two hundred twenty dollars in the bank
he had a lot more than that beforehand I
love that this guy makes three million a
year and she makes fifty four thousand a
year working with him or whatever that's
funny
labor and employment attorney only makes
62,000 that's kind of crazy so yeah I
mean FPS you can see sitting right about
60 but inductor noise again making all
kinds of noise so yeah I guess we'll go
ahead and jump into the conclusion here
well there you go guys the Galax gtx 980
hall of fame I'm still torn on whether
or not I want to keep doing these live
benchmarks I feel like you guys get a
little bit less information overall but
you guys get a little bit more raw info
on how it's performing as it's happening
so again I'm gonna pull you guys down
the description there's gonna be a straw
poll you guys use that link to tell me
do more live benchmarks or just start
giving you guys more graphs and things
with maybe some live benchmarks I don't
know just answer the question down there
and you guys tell me what you want to
see I kind of overall feel like you get
list info but I know maybe you guys like
seeing the way things are going like for
instance the inductor noise you guys
could hear that it was it was pretty bad
which is funny because Galax advertises
that they use high quality inductors so
that you don't get that noise but
clearly I was getting the noise at
standard FPS now when you start getting
massive SP FPS like 3000 fps in the
loading screen you're gonna get some
inductor and always no matter what but I
do find that at anywhere between 60 to
90 fps getting inductor noise that's
audible over the fans that's not good I
also didn't do a lot of tests on this
card because it started to become pretty
apparent to me right off the bat that I
wasn't entirely impressed with this card
I mean it looks pretty it's one of the
coolest cards on the market in fact the
max temperatures on this thing I forgot
to even bring that up for you guys
looks like we maxed out at 77
degrees that was probably during farcry
it was pretty warm when I got my hand
near it during farcry not as warm
Dearing watchdog's but I'm a little
disappointed by the inductor noise I
would say I'm disappointed by the
overclocking and the fact that we only
reached 1500 megahertz but that's still
a good overclock overclocking is not
guaranteed on these cards this card does
boost up on its own up into the
mid-1400s again Silicon Lottery there's
no control over the manufacturer on that
I mean unless they're gonna be doing a
lot of pinning you know it is what it is
so the card is pretty it's gonna have
its aesthetics that it fits in in many
builds like white builds and especially
if you're doing like the new Asus Tough
Series limited edition motherboards it's
gonna look really nice in those types of
builds this may have just been a sample
thing I mean there's our retail samples
or not you know tested before they're
sent to us otherwise they would be
completely biased reviews and we would
never trust the manufacturers because we
would always assume they're sending us
their best
I want retail samples when I do my
reviews and that's what I got here so
you never know you guys may see other
hall-of-fame reviews too where they're
getting higher overclocks and better
scores but that's you know luck of the
draw once again so I think the Galax GTX
980 Hall of Fame definitely has its
demographic that it's gonna appeal to
it's got all the standard features that
you would expect with Maxwell neo voxel
and the efficiency that comes with
Maxwell but personally I'm a little bit
disappointed in the overall quality of
the inductors and the noise that those
were making I could I could live with
the FPS and stuff but the fact that I
could hear the inductors over the fans
was kind of a real disappointment so you
guys tell me are you using a Hall of
Fame card 980 or even a 780 older Hall
of Fame how's it performing for you guys
what do you look for in graphics cards
what do you think of the white I do wish
there were more white options but right
now the Hall of Fame from Galax
definitely has the white PCB thing like
nailed down that's definitely there's so
anyway guys thanks for watching today's
video hope you guys have enjoyed I am
enjoy making it for you this is like
definitely a pretty much a dream job
where I get to play with all this cool
hardware until you guys how I feel about
it and I do like to hear from you guys
on how you feel about it so check out
all the social medias
you guys are interested in connecting
and as always guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
