if you live anywhere on the west coast
or I guess Southern California area
Arizona Nevada you guys know it's
starting to get warm already and it's
only March so instead of waiting all the
way till June like I normally do to
start bringing the water cooling videos
I'm gonna keep this train going I
already showed you guys how I setup the
water cooling pump for the parvum veer
1.0 build and that thing is coming along
nicely that's it's right there pretty
epic but I digress we're gonna go ahead
move into today's topic which is all
about hard tubes for your computer
through the computer tubes dirty mind
out of the gutter come on don't tell me
you weren't thinking it hard to just
giggity-giggity when you hear that the
new EVGA silent series power supplies
offer excellent silence and efficiency
through their new EVGA Eco mode
technology and also features a seven
year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more now heart tubing is actually
nothing new in fact it was around years
ago when it came to water cooling and
stuff and it just didn't take off
because it didn't have enough
aftermarket support in fact most people
were going with things like copper pipe
and stuff which is readily available at
like Home Depot you can get hard copper
stock and you can cut it down and bend
it pretty easily with a mandrel bender
and have some pretty sick looking builds
it just didn't have enough aftermarket
support when it came to things like
fittings and you were stuck using those
really ugly compression prescient
pressin fittings you find again in the
plumbing section of Home Depot now
unless you were doing some sort of a
really cool steampunk build all those
brass fittings and stuff just didn't
look very good and it's face steampunk
is cool but if that's your only option
then it really wasn't readily and
considered amongst most mainstream
builders or people just looking to do
some sort of a cool rigid tubing build
in their system so today we're going to
talking about a couple of different
products here from alpha cool now we're
going to be taking a look today at their
rigid fittings we're going to take a
look at some of the rigid tubing and
we're going to show you guys a couple of
different options now that may
be actually considerable for your next
build
now rigid fittings are a pretty big deal
because unlike soft tubing where you
have the tubing being clamped down on a
barb and it has actually teeth to grab
on to rigid tubing is something that's
always been a little bit scary to people
because the only thing holding it in is
an o-ring and that oring if you guys
think about that is not a very high
friction piece and so things like
jostling or shipping it or moving it
around always freak people out because
it could just pop right out well now if
we fast forward several years as hard
line fittings start to become more
popular again in the last couple of
years now just about everybody has some
sort of a compression fitting and that's
exactly what we're looking at here today
now unlike soft tubing where you can
find measurements both for Europe and
the millimeters in the United States you
can find them you know 3/8 half-inch
three-quarter inch outer diameter all
hard line fittings are pretty much
measured in millimeters and I'm sure
that makes a lot of the people out there
in Europe very very happy it kind of
made things hard for me to get used to
because I don't do the millimeters
unless it's photography then I
understand millimeters pretty well but
this fitting right here is actually
they're 10 by 13 millimeters so that
means that for instance I have a 10 by
13 millimeter piece of PE TG tubing
right here so as I'm dropping it all
over the place
I didn't play wide receiver in football
folks I played lineman it's really a
thankless job if your lineman you know
what I'm talking about but no so those
measurements are the measurements of the
internal opening as well as the overall
width so in this case it is 10
millimeters in the opening of the center
of the tube and 13 millimeters on the
outside now when it comes to the
fittings it's the outside measurement or
that 13 millimeter which makes a big
difference for instance if you're
talking about things like bits power
crystal link it's a 12 millimeter
outside diameter and that one millimeter
makes a huge huge difference it's not
going to work you can't put a 12 in a 13
and you can't gram a 13 into a 12 like
the jokes the jokes are real but now
that we understand how the sizing works
now you'll understand what it is you're
actually looking at if you take a look
at these two tubes you can see one is
clearly much bigger than
the other because a lot of people liked
1/2 inch inner diameter 3/4 inch outer
diameter soft tubing because it was
large made the system look more full and
you can get a higher flow flow rate with
a higher internal diameter companies
that started coming out now with the 1/2
inch inner diameter which you can see
now this tubing practically fits inside
that tubing I'm going to shove it in
there like again the struggle is real to
keep this video clean but just to give
you an example of the bigger tube here
the inner diameter is 12 and the outer
diameter is 16 and now you have multiple
options with fittings to use a larger
tube like this which makes things look
even cooler in a big system like behind
me with skunkworks this has been
available at the time I would have
probably considered using this over this
now there compression fittings are
actually really really simple to use
you have a flat disc washer here as well
as an internal oring that slides over
the tubing gets pressed against that
flat washer as well as an o-ring inside
of the fitting itself before I
demonstrate how it works one thing
that's also nice to see is in the actual
threaded part of the fitting it is a hex
head so one of the things that kind of
sucks is sometimes when you clamp down
on a compression fitting with an o-ring
really tight and you go to loosen it you
actually end up loosening the hole
fitting out of the radiator or the pump
or whatever it's connected to and you
have a problem getting these two halves
apart well now because of the way that
they've done this you could stick an
Allen wrench inside the fitting and get
a nice good leverage to get the two
halves apart okay so now for an example
here I've got my alpha cool radiator but
you guys can't tell who sponsored
today's video we're going to go ahead
and thread this in one thing I forgot to
mention too is it also has an o-ring as
most fittings do now also on the G
quarter thread side of the fittings so
that you get a nice seal against the
item that you are putting your fitting
into whether it be radiator GP block CP
cpu block pump or reservoir and you can
also use that allen key to tighten that
up on there you don't want to over
tighten or you'll strip the threads
remember they are just brass on both
ends they are fairly soft material but
once you have the fitting in there then
basically you're going to take your flat
disc your o-ring as well as your
impression and you're going to put the
compression housing over first then
you're going to put the flat disk washer
on or drop it on the floor you're going
to take the flat washer end and put that
against the cap and they're going to
take the o-ring and just slide it over
over the tip the tip of the tube think
I'll just let you guys think whatever
you want to think I'm just going to stop
now what you going to do is you're going
to take the tube and gently insert it
inside the opening this is hard guys is
no matter what I say I'm in the wrong
today I'm just gonna keep this in the
video because this is actually kind of
fun even though I'm the only one in this
room laughing yeah my own innuendoes not
kidding guys the struggle is real okay
gently take your tube slightly twist it
as you put it in there
move the o-ring down against the opening
take your flat washer make sure it's
against the opening or the o-ring and
then you're going to just tighten them
the compression until it's as tight as
you can get it now I wouldn't take a
wrench and wrench down on this because
then you'll you can end up crushing or
cracking the tube and that will be just
as bad you know you don't want to bend
or crack your tube that's a bad day
there you go so now you've taken your
radiator and turn it into a male but as
you can see it holds in there pretty
good it's not as sturdy as some of the
other fittings I have used it's a little
bit of a concern of mine so I wouldn't
go you know I wouldn't put any dangling
parts off of this like letting it
support anything you once you have the
two ends secured it's not going to go
anywhere and it holds tight but one
thing to point out though is that you
can actually twist and pull it right out
with the compression still on now it
fits really really tight in fact if it's
tight enough to where I when I twisted
it it actually put some marks in the
acrylic but I can't get it back in
remember the only thing holding this
thing together is an o-ring so you can
only get so much of a connection with
just rubber but let's say acrylics not
your thing maybe you are one of those
guys like I mentioned earlier you'd
consider doing metal piping and you
think
metal piping would be a high level of
badassery well alpha cool also has
something else that they have developed
here metal tubing yeah now this is
actually their black chrome they have
regular chrome and they're black chrome
I thought this looked pretty freakin
awesome you can't bend this
I wouldn't recommend bending it if you
do the coated the plating will probably
crack but you can hacksaw it and then
Dremel or sand edges and then you can
put it all together the same way that I
showed you with the acrylic you just
take your cap put it over the tip okay
here we go again guys assemble it all
together like I mentioned before you
have to be as gentle on this one because
you've got a black oh this one
whatever guys I'm just going with it
screw it down and then as you see you
now could have metal piping in fact the
metal pipe seems to be a little bit
sturdier in there but it's heavier as
well this is a pretty heavy pipe because
it is pretty much brass the plating is
very good on these in fact that the
chrome plating or nickel plating on
these is very very uniform yet thin
because tolerances are important so they
can't put thick nickel plating on there
it is a knurled fitting so that you can
get a good grip on there with your
fingers and everything about this
fitting is I have no problems using this
in fact I'm going to be putting these in
a build in the future but yeah with so
many companies on the market
ALPA cool is really stepped up and has
made a good effort at coming up with
some rigid hard line stuff you can get
these fittings as well in the 13 by 10
or the 12 by 16 as I mentioned the metal
fittings I think this is this is really
really good line of product the only
downside is the links that you see right
here the 40 centimeters long that's as
long as they make so you're likely not
gonna be able to do things like you see
with skunkworks behind me with long
tubes because you can buy those tubes by
up to like four feet even eight feet
long with some manufacturers which you
can then cut it and do single long bends
and stuff you're going to be stuck doing
shorter runs with this and probably
haven't used fitting elbows or in a
small case like the part of them that's
what
perfect size as well so there you go
guys Jason's looking at alpha cools new
hardline stuff this video was struggle
to get through today with you guys know
my sense of humor and well it just sort
of wrote itself alright make sure you
guys keep following on the social media
if you want to see more behind the
scenes stuff of this guy right here this
parven 1.0 as you can see I started put
radiators and things in there but yeah
if you guys want to see more about that
as it's happening start to get heavy
make sure you follow on the social media
Instagram Facebook Twitter YouTube is a
good place to to follow I'm not doing
build logs on that like I said I'm just
doing in social media updates as well as
at the end of course I'm going to be
doing like a complete rundown of the
system performance benchmarks and all
that stuff so there we go hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I enjoyed making
it for you and once again thanks for
