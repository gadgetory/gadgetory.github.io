mine
it's the babies it's actually kind of
gross you think about where it came from
the wife's right there I'm just trying
to embarrass her she's just off camera
so it's uh it's that time if you guys
remember last June
Barna Cleese came down to Southern
California in the summer and visited me
and nearly melted to death and so I made
a promise I said okay next time I'm
coming up to your place so of course to
make it fair I chose the winter to go up
to his place although I guess they're
having a fairly warm week and I'm there
but then again I don't know what the
weather's gonna be like in Portland but
it's gonna be in the 50s up there in
Washington which I guess is like a heat
wave for them it is currently right now
82 degrees here so dressed in a t-shirt
now and I'll probably be in a hoodie
shivering when I get there yep we're
gonna head over to the airport I've got
one layover in Oakland and then we will
be at Seattle SeaTac at nine o'clock now
if you guys are following on Twitter or
Facebook Jerry put up a post he's at
barnacle ease if you guys don't know his
Twitter handle he put up a post we're
doing a fan meetup tomorrow
in Bellevue Washington basically it's
like a gamer cafe slash bar thing from
11 a.m. to 12 p.m. or 12:30 p.m.
tomorrow
that's Thursday tomorrow as in Thursday
is that this video should be up tonight
late so you might be watching this on
the day of probably after
the event is but whatever so Thursday
11:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in Bellevue the
address is on his Twitter post to go and
find that I retweeted it you can find it
there so if you guys are in the area
come say hi and then Friday we're
heading up to PDX land we're down to PDX
land to Portland and we're gonna play
some games for three days so the only
depressing thing about this trip is the
fact that I don't get to ride my bike
till next Tuesday that's it no I mean I
guess it's like I'm kind of used to
leaving the family because how many
times have I had to travel for work I'm
not used to leading the bike this is the
first it's not that it's I don't want to
stop the progress in momentum but
everybody that I've talked to in a
professional sense of it whether it be a
doctor or personal trainer has all said
you got to take some time off take a
week off let your body rest and relax
and then shock it with a good workout
after that rest and you kind of keep
things shaken up be careful when you
tell me to get take a break you usually
end up being about remember that time I
went there's no beach
for the dirt bike ride and they came
back with a broken arm anyway alright
let's go ahead and get on an airplane
they're that razor burn it's terrible so
turns out my gate here in Ontario is
gate 404
I hope they can find the plane
you
well I made it
we're in Seattle and I'm like one of the
only people left in the stupid gangway
thing I said gangway okay so apparently
ctek is as empty as ontario in the
evening I'm not too sure where I'm going
Oh his feats in baggage claim down so
already people here are a little bit
different I guess let's say I saw a guy
was a nice set of a kg case 702 so I was
like hey nice 80 kgs and you just turn
around gave me like a dirty look like
dick Nicole I think I'm officially lost
I'm not even sure baggage claim
that's what I want is baggage claim oh I
guess I have to take a train interesting
all right totally lost in this place I'm
going back I don't want to go on a train
I don't think
Jerry helpin lawston this is literally
the most dead airport I've ever been to
do you know seriously felt completely
lost in this place
Lana Kate and I've been to most major
airports all right so now we're just
here waiting for Jerry where is Jerry I
was really close
Oh Jerry it's a little chilly out here
but it's not too bad not too much colder
than it is back home during this time
so now it's like a black screen what
happen well because we're just logging
on your rx100 mark 3 now that I'm on the
iPhone we're like shadows that thing is
amazing a low light oh yeah no that's
why I got it it's got a hue it's got a
huge sensor on it I can see my eyes for
a second Carolyn well I've made it yeah
Jerry's on caffeine or something
I am I drink it makes sense and I am
starving because I haven't eaten since
11 o'clock and I was doing you a favor I
actually stopped and got food before I
came and God she just lied enough to rub
my McDonald's in your face I just need
like a chicken and I'm good we have a
file oh it's the same five I think
actually I want to go only the 405 Wow
we're back in Southern California
alright guys well that's the end of my
travel vlog it was kind of uneventful
was nothing like Jay Cherry's epilogue
back in June where every other jump cut
was like another announcement of why
you're not getting where you need to go
Southwest didn't screw up I still didn't
have to get out and push it is now
completely black all right guys I'm shut
it off we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
