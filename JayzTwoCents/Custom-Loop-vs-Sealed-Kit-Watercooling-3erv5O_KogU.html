cooling a PC oh yeah hey everybody
welcome back to Jays two cents and if
you can't tell by the beginning of this
video or even a title at the top of this
video today we are going to talk about
water cooling and we are doing it by
popular demand you've asked and I'm
answering how do you know water cooling
is for you well water cooling can be for
everybody but it's definitely
recommended for those people who want to
achieve the maximum overclock they can
of their processor or live in a hot
environment one thing I do want to let
you know water cooling isn't necessary
for people who are not overclocking or
even people who are doing mild
overclocks
because there are plenty of high end
high quality heat seek fans out there
that offer just as much cooling capacity
as some of the lower end kits that are
out there however there are some
instances out there where water cooling
just may not be for you if you're not
overclocking or you're only doing a mild
overclock there are much cheaper options
out there that offer just as much
cooling capacity if not more at a
cheaper price so keep that in mind
price of water cooling can vary anywhere
from 50 dollars for a cheap
self-contained unit like the Antec H 50
or all the way up to $1,000 if you go
just full-blown custom water cooling
loop the problem with some of the
smaller kits out there is they just do
not generally offer as much cooling
capacity or simplicity as a high-end
heat sink fan as I mentioned earlier the
Noctua CPU heatsink fan is definitely a
hard one to beat when it comes to the
low end water cooling kits as it just is
a monster of a heat sink so if you're
thinking about getting something like an
H 50 or in 860 I would right off the bat
tell you to probably go with a high-end
heat sink fan like v8 or an acht or I'd
like to go into some of the pros and
cons of the self-contained units out
there for water cooling to try and give
you some decision-making power if you're
thinking about going that route some of
the pros from the self-contained units
are their maintenance-free they're
cheaper they come with a warranty and
they can fit in almost any case however
some of the cons are they have cheap
quality fans on them
the radiator is generally pretty small
life of the pump has been known to be
iffy at times and they do not expand so
if you decide later you want to add a
new part or new water pump or just
generally add more cooling capacity
you're stuck with that kit and you have
to replace the entire thing if you want
to upgrade now if you want to get
something a little bigger has more
capacity than one of those prepackaged
units there are plenty of companies out
there that offer a kit that come with
every part that you need to put together
a custom water cooling loop some of
those companies are ek Swift Tech X SPC
and they contain all the parts you need
radiator hose clamps fans and they
contain all the parts that you need to
put together your loop and keep it going
the only thing you have to do is just
add a fluid or a coolant and in most
cases I recommend that you go with some
sort of distilled water and PT nuke anti
algae or a silver coil to keep any sort
of algae growth or corrosion happening
in your loop the pros to these kits are
everything you needs included they
generally have higher quality parts
they're generally larger parts that have
more cooling capacity to them and they
are expandable so if you decide later
you want to add in a video card to your
loop you can if you want to add another
radiator you can so you're not locked
into just one particular kind of cooling
capacity the constant oor now you have
to put the loop together you have to
make sure you do it properly otherwise
you can cause damage to your computer or
the water cooling unit itself it can
leak if you don't do it properly which
would lead to increment or death of your
computer and they do require maintenance
you have to drain and refill the fluid
every so often usually once or twice a
year is recommended otherwise you can
get corrosion or algae buildup issues
the last option would be going with a
custom water cooling loop from scratch
like you see here which is what I did
with my computer and the pros and cons
are generally the same as the
prepackaged kits a lot of the parts are
actually the same and a pro with that
would be that you get to control every
part that goes into your system
however a Conda that could be that you
are now confused and overwhelmed with
the amount of individual water cooling
parts there are when putting together a
custom water cooling loop so you might
run into some part compatibility issues
if you don't know exactly what you're
looking for just like buying any new
computer part when it comes to water
cooling there are just tons of choices
and it's easy to get overwhelmed and
accidentally pick up the wrong part or
get something that's not entirely
compatible with your setup and not only
that you might actually forget to get
something that's very important and you
might not realize it until it's too late
and you're trying to put together your
water cooling kit lastly I'd like to
address some myths when it comes to
water cooling and there are three major
myths that I hear all the time on the
forums that I go to and I would like to
go ahead and dress those right now the
first one is that people will say you
don't have to worry about killing your
computer because there are plenty of
non-conductive coolants on the market
that is absolutely true
there are non-conductive coolants on the
market fluid XP was one of the first
manufacturers of non-conductive coolants
on the market however running any fluid
in contact with metal 24/7 it will
eventually ionize and pick up some of
those minerals and metals thereby making
it conductive water itself is not
conductive pure water or distilled water
does not have any elements in it that
conduct electricity
however tap water does which gives
people the misconception that water
conducts electricity what actually
conducts the electricity inside of water
are the minerals that it picks up in the
pipes that's carried to your home but if
you were to take distilled water from
the grocery store and do a conductive
test on it you would see that it's
actually very resistant the second myth
I want to address is probably one of the
most common I hear in the forms of
that's very frustrating to try and
explain this to people but people have
this idea that if you go water cooling
your rooms not going to get as hot or
your office or wherever you have your
computer here's the bottom line people
whether you have a heat sink and a fan
taking the heat away or you have the
water and a radiator taking the heat
away you're taking the heat out of your
component and sending it to the
atmosphere fans and radiators are just
two different methods of the same result
just because you go water cooling does
not mean your room or your office is
going to be less warm when you're gaming
if anything you might actually find that
the room is hotter because you're
getting a better thermal conductive
element to your cooling system so you're
taking more of that heat out of your
processor in your video card or whatever
you're cooling and moving more of that
heat into the atmosphere the last thing
I hear people
say all the time is I want to go water
calling because I want to go completely
silent and I've even seen some pictures
of people who've gone water cooling and
removed all of their case vans with the
exception of the fans on the radiator
that is bad just because you have water
cooling in your system does not mean you
are water cooling every part that
contains heat there are plenty of
elements on your motherboard that still
require air to flow over them to cool
them off it is true that you can run
your fans at a lower speed on the
radiator however just like anything else
the actual cooling capacity of the
radiator is dependent on the amount of
air flowing through it you have to take
that heat from the radiator and exchange
it to the air and carry the air out of
the radiator in order to take the heat
out of the water so if you have your
fans set to the lowest speed possible on
the radiator yes it is extremely quiet
however you are reducing the thermal
capacity of the radiator itself so there
is a bit of an exchange you can go with
more radiators at a slower speed to get
the same result I'll go with a smaller
thicker radiator with a higher speed fan
and get the same exact temperatures
there is a science there and you have to
know that science before you either
undersized or oversize your cooling
capacity based on decibel requirements
of your space so if you want something
extremely quiet you're going to have to
go with more surface area larger
radiator or more radiators in order to
get that same effect on my system I run
a dual radiator setup I have a triple
120 millimeter up top which is an XP
extreme edition from Swift tech and have
an ex SPC quiet Edition radiator at the
bottom of the PCE and they are both in
the same loop and I am running fan
control software that controls both
radiator fans independently from each
other one is controlled through the CPU
and one is controlled through the GPU so
if I'm running a CPU intensive task I
can have one radiator cranked up while
the other one stays at the same speed
allowing me to customize the noise
levels depending on the load of the
graphics card and CPU inside of my
system I hope you found today's video
useful and some of this information can
help you decide whether or not water
cooling is for you it's impossible to
cover every single aspect of water
cooling a single video on youtube so I
ask that if you have any questions

them down in the comments and I'll do
the best it can to answer all of your
questions don't forget to subscribe if
