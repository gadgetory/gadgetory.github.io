bring back old-school with doing a vlog
here at the house because my upstairs
left slash gaming room has been lacking
something as long as I've lived in this
house which is over a year and a half
and that's decent audio I've had decent
video now with the LG OLED panel which
is a eg 65 earth 65 ET 9600 but I've
always been using the onboard speakers
which until today is not gonna be a
thing anymore because Dolby Atmos has
actually sponsored a video and they sent
us over the LG sj9 which is a 500 watt
RMS 5.1 point to surround sound sound
bar I know that sounds like that sounds
like a lot to ask of a sound bar I think
we're gonna test it out today and see
exactly how it really is is working out
before we talk about that sound bar
let's kind of take a look at what's
changed over the last little bit so this
is Little J setup right here she's
obsessed with said it's a little messy
right now she knows we're making this
video and she's at school but she's
obsessed with setups in fact she's been
watching Jonathan Morrison Tod today's
dream setup series it's costing me money
so Jonathan stop it
in all seriousness that's the same
system she built when she was five it's
over three years old now it's gonna be
going on four years old it's time for an
upgrade but she's been being a little
punk with an attitude lately so I just
have not felt like gracing her with a
new computer she keeps asking me and
until she burns that she ain't getting
it
but for now this is her setup right here
again it's messy this is the IKEA Freddy
desk we got that and put it together
it's like one of the most iconic desks I
think amongst PC enthusiasts it's
inexpensive and you can fit a lot on it
but with that said we still have our
nice brown couch right here with a
chaise lounge I'm a tall guy I'm six
foot four I don't know that isn't stones
and whatever else but I can stretch out
on that which is kind of nice these are
our sumo lounge bean bags right here
this is probably the highlight of the
room because when you want to watch TVs
you just or movies or whatever you just
plop down the bean bag it's memory foam
it forms to you and yeah it's it's
really comfortable
so you guys have seen this before this
is my a butter revolution racing cockpit
we added our hydro brake recently for
when we do drifts in rally and stuff in
this in VR but this also has my fana
tech wheel and pedal setup it's also got
the additional load cell brake edition
on there so the brakes really hard it
really represents like a real race car
we don't have power brakes nice racing
sim I think part of what we'll do today
- and we test this sound is we'll test
the actual like demo stuff that was sent
but I think we should also pit J versus
Nick font you can do the fastest
Nurburgring lap what do you think I'm
down you're down
yeah challenge accepted dry that dry lat
right you already know I beat you in the
range by a lot so here's our here's my
vibe right here this is what I use to
actually race on there I don't race
using the TV I don't like once you go
with VR and racing sim you don't go back
so we also have our lighthouses that are
mounted up here this one here is mounted
with white channeling around the window
frame so that we don't get wife aggro
and the other ones mounted to the
bookshelf itself and then these
bookshelves and the TV and stuff is all
tethered to the wall because I live in
California
things like to fall over when the ground
likes to dis randomly shake but no setup
it's complete without at least a home
theater PC right the irony about this is
it's in a home theater PC chassis this
is the fractal design note 605 it's
brushed metal real metal we have to have
a water-cooled GT X 1080 Ti in there
remember I did the X 299 build with the
77 40 X because I couldn't come up with
a good solution for a CPU that didn't
make sense so why not put it in the form
factor with a build that didn't make
sense 1080i water-cooled in a home
theater PC really it's just my VR
machine it runs my VR and we want all
the horsepower so we can maintain that
90 FPS which is important so that I
don't throw up all over the place
Xbox one oh my god unsub on top you know
I like Forza that my daughter likes to
play her Lego games so there's that and
then down here this is where I keep my
logitech wireless keyboard and mouse our
games and then we've got my why are my
charging station here for the
controllers one of them is on
little J's desk or doesn't belong I'll
be sure to let her know about that later
and then of course we've got the whole
point of this video the Dolby Atmos
enabled sound Barda this one's a five
point one point two channel what that
means is that's gonna simulate the five
points around so Center left and right
rear left and right the point one means
it has one subwoofer and the point two
means we have two overhead projection
speak loudspeakers right here so these
are going to be firing up and bouncing
off the wall so you want a flat wall for
that as best as possible which is gonna
simulate overhead because Dolby Atmos is
about well it's called Atmos because
it's atmospheric or 360 degrees sound
sound in real life is not on this flat
plane like you hear about all the time
or you see in just basic theater setups
or basic home theater setups sound is
coming from all around us my AC just
kicked on my brain can tell that the
sound came from above me and that's what
this is about simulating and I feel like
that's a lot to ask of a sound bar
because at most is also enabled in
individual speaker setups so you can do
a Dolby Atmos setup with nine point two
point six or whatever you could just
expand it right movie theaters are like
that they have tons and tons of overhead
speakers they have more than just a rear
and a front they have speakers all down
the side of the theater because they
want to give the surround of effect as
best as possible the more points the
surround the more realistic it is and at
most is expandable in that same way but
today with the sound bar specifically
the sj9 from LG it's a 500 watt RMS
which is a decent amount of audio but
we've got it all set up running
fiber-optic straight to the TV so I
think it's time to demo it alright so
the first one we'll look at here is the
747 takeoff audio transparency this was
sent to us by Dolby alright so here we
go 747 takeoff
right there you hear that fungal that is
so weird
it is weird but we know it's coming from
like one spot in the room but yet we can
hear it behind us it's a magic as food
it was what it is
that's so weird it's like you hear the
crackle in front of you but then you can
hear the echo like sort of move behind
you right like it sounds like it's
getting farther away behind you like you
wouldn't like a mountain
like you just heard that bird takeoff on
the left go right and fly back again
what funny is we're looking at this so
specifically knowing it's coming from a
soundbar and we're like I think we're
almost more closed-minded knowing that
mm-hmm where if you just had that hidden
in some way and had someone listening in
here I feel like they'd be looking for
the surround speakers problem that yeah
that's highly likely you know it's
coming from a sound wave and we
convinced that you were hearing it from
me from above you and to the right oh
yeah definitely
yeah I heard it it was just weird how I
can do that with just that instead of
having speakers everywhere yeah all
right you know it's time for everything
he knows I'm the better driver but I
think whoever goes second can be under
more pressure so I Senor
rock-paper-scissors for it okay Paper
Scissors shoot
fine you go first that way one can see
me smash his feet blowing us now for the
record we know that PC is not a dolby
atmos enabled I just want to see how
good the sound quality of the sound bar
is at this point
I'm so Nick today seven 39.2 in his
Porsche orestes I'm running the Cadillac
ats-v our gt3 which is my absolute
favorite gt3 car so what Nick will do
and start me up
I did a 735 after that spin and then the
car wouldn't start
so I lost at least 10 or 15 seconds
there I was on track to do like a 7 5 a
7 10 it was clean though
and that's spin I didn't touch anything
so yeah we have the driving line on but
Nick will tell you the driving line on
Nurburgring is like useless it's
completely useless that sounds pretty
good I could totally do that without
headphones and like it and you can even
hear like the yeah okay so fast-forward
about a week now I have been putting
this LG dolby atmos sound bar through
its paces but more importantly not just
me
Nick experienced it he sat through some
of the demos with me including we
watched Wonder Woman he had not seen it
yet my daughter my wife my daughter Prai
spent more time up here than anyone else
but she was just like oh my god this
sounds great because we've been using
like I said it started this video
built-in speakers on the TV for about a
year and a half and it just hasn't been
cutting it so this has been an awesome
upgrade to the space but the cool part
about this is that you can experience
Dolby Atmos now in a bunch of different
ways so they've got Netflix of course
blu-rays 4k blu-rays now you can find a
lot of movies that have the Dolby Atmos
logo on the fact Wonderwoman being one
of them which is why we watched that one
tons of explosions very convincing an
immersive surround especially the
overhead that's the part that kept
tripping me out the most cuz I'd never
experienced a Dolby Atmos a sound bar or
sound system of any kind but here in my
home with a single point of reference a
single spot of the room spitting out
sound and convincing me that it's coming
from behind me like I said with some
voodoo magic that I just don't
understand buzz okay I don't have to it
sounds great and that's really all that
matters now doesn't matter whether or
not you have a lot of money to spend or
you're on a tight budget there are price
points that meets just about everyone's
budget so you guys need to go to the
link in the description below you guys
can learn more about Dolby Atmos you can
check it out it you know big-box
retailers online there are tons of
different ways to experience it and they
have a price point that's pretty much
gonna fit anyone's budget so definitely
check it out but anyway guys it's time
to go thanks for watching today's video
this one took a while to make
simply because we wanted to really kind
of experience it and put it through its
paces
and I'm really glad that I did because
I'm not an audiophile by any means any
stretch of the imagination but I do love
good audio and having good video like
the OLED panel behind me but terrible
audio just made for a very unbalanced
experience and now I feel like we've
brought that balance to this space
anyway guys I'm gonna go make sure you
check out the link down below to learn
more about Dolby Atmos and again a huge
thank you to Dolby Atmos for sponsoring
today's video otherwise this experience
would not have been possible thanks for
watching guys and as always I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
