Jays two cents and today's episode is
brought to you by the number four and
the color blue everybody thanks for
watching
Tech addiction is going to be a new
series that I'm gonna do every single
Friday where I discuss cool and
interesting things that are happening in
the technology world anything regarding
pcs PC gaming cell phones or just plain
bizarre I want to talk about it and
right off the bat I want to talk about
the fact that AMD has announced that it
is no longer going to be making desktop
performance processors once piledriver
is released so unfortunately if you're
an AMD fan like I am this is the end of
the road there's just nothing beyond
this so I'm having a really hard time
now considering staying with AMD because
Intel is gonna be the only path anyone
has any option and that's kind of scary
because who knows what the hell's gonna
happen with prices now the Intel is
gonna be your only route for
performances desktop processor
not only that piledriver is coming in at
right around 250 dollars with some of
the leak pricing and it's performance is
just abysmal there is nothing to be
excited for it barely performs any
better than the 80 120 or the 81 50 and
even though it was showing maybe a 10%
improvement over bulldozer
it just just gets a big fat thumbs down
so if you're looking at going AMD my
official advice is gonna be just skip it
don't even bother and on the path of
Intel Intel us also announced an entire
line of processors that are gonna be
discontinued that's right Sandy Bridge
the most popular selling processor in
the world of any manufacturer is gonna
be chopped March of 2013 you'll no
longer be able to order any of the
retail package processors when it comes
to the Sandy Bridge line that's the 2500
K 2,600 2,700 any you know the lower end
than that no more and if you're gonna
get what they call their sleeve
packaging or the OEM which is just the
chip no fan no box nothing you can order
that up until September of 2013 so you
have another year but I have a feeling
that supply is gonna be extremely low
because they're no longer gonna be doing
any more manufacturing of it
so if you want it or you think about
upgrading or pulling the trigger on a
Sandy Bridge processor to save some
money over Ivy Bridge
I recommend you do it now because who
knows what the supply line is going to
be like come 2013 video card news the
Sapphire HD 7970 six gigabyte X edition
whew that's a lot of words was just
benchmarked and released and it features
this really interesting cooling design
this is what they have to say about it
the basic premise is that pure water is
used to transfer the heat load away from
the core through vaporization where it
is cooled and condenses back into a
liquid state at this point the liquid
returns to the heat source through
capillary action in the wicking medium
to follow the process again what allows
the water to vaporize at low
temperatures is that the vapor chamber
works in a very low pressure state
allowing the water to vaporize earlier
than normal so basically what it means
is that the water above the processor is
gonna get hot turn into a vapor the air
is gonna flow over the heat sink take
the vapor way it's gonna cool off again
turn back in the water that's gonna get
hot again turn it into vapor the fans
had to come and blow the air way yeah
she sounds pretty gimmicky to me I don't
know about you I'm in the water cooling
but I don't know if I'm in a vapor
cooling so how did that new 7970 beast
of a card actually match up against some
of the other Nvidia models like the GTX
680 it didn't do very well folks it was
beaten in Haven
battlefield 3 Batman Arkham Asylum it
did win in dirt 3 in Metro 2033 2033 is
poorly optimized which is great because
usually the AMD cards are somewhat
poorly optimized - and dirt 3 is
actually sponsored by AMD so you know
might be a little bit of shenanigans
going on there unfortunately the card
cost $600 and it's being beaten by the
reference gtx 680 and $100 less so your
AMD Fanning you really want the flagship
card this is gonna be for you I can't
recommend it go gtx 680 it's what i've
got sitting right over there and it's
what i'm going to continue to use until
something better comes along and even
then I might not get rid of this thing
because I love my graphics card things
amazing speaking of GTX Giga Byte came
out with a brand new GTX super
overclocked and they said that this is
the fastest factory overclock there is
of any gtx 680 on the market so the good
boys over at the overclockers club.com
took that model threw it up against the
msi gtx 680 lightning and wanted to see
how it compared and guess what once
again it did not hold up
so if your look
giving yourself a high-end Nvidia card I
highly recommend going with the msi gtx
680 lightning it does cost about $40
more than the gigabyte but you also were
gonna get the fastest card with the most
overclocking ability and it definitely
gets a thumb up for me so the iPhone 5
came out everyone was happy it's the new
Jesus phone I want one I waited but I
want one I have an iPhone 4s but guess
what thousands of people have reported
that their iPhone 5 came out of the box
scratch what is Apple doing about it
they said aluminium scratching on
anodizing surfaces it's completely
normal where the bare colour of
aluminium will show through scratches
yeah no however do you think it
should come out of the box pre scratched
are you considering this like preshrunk
clothing is you know are you just doing
it for us get it out of the way so we no
longer you know get a heart attack and
go huh the first time you drop our phone
or it gets a scratch or our kid you know
take the key to it or something I don't
know Apple kind of reminds me of the
antenna gate with the official just
don't hold it that way from Steve Jobs
but you know now how can you mention the
iPhone without talking about the galaxy
s3 I actually have a galaxy s3 that's
provided to me through work it's a great
phone it's really big I don't like the
way it feels in my hand but I have a
problem with my phone it likes you just
randomly reset itself if I set it down
on the table boom it turns off resets
all right okay that's not what I
expected from Samsung's flagship model
the makers of slender have teamed up
with blue Isle Studios to bring you a
new and improved slender game that's
expected to come out towards the end of
this year it is gonna be a full
commercial game so if problem they're
not going to be free but it is designed
to scare the crap out of you
the original scare the crap out of me
just look but it's gonna be using a lot
higher graphics and actually looks a lot
like the old Source engine but they
promise that there's gonna be more
levels there's a storyline and objective
to it and it's it's guaranteed to
deliver an extreme scare so I'll be
looking forward to that one
I do like slender you know it scares the
crap out of me but when that comes out
I'll be sure to do a live show
maybe a video review of it once again
you'll catch something epic coming out
on all Gideon platforms on October 30th
is Assassin's Creed 3
I'm extremely looking forward to this
game I am a big fan of the Assassin's
Creed franchise and this one takes place
in the 1700s and you are helping George
Washington with the Revolutionary War
you get to go through some factual
historical events that have taken place
in American history like the Boston Tea
Party and I think they even mentioned
the signing of the Declaration of
Independence or something like that but
it's mixed in with a lot of fiction in
order to bring a you know tomahawk
toting assassin into the equation here
but the graphics on this game look
absolutely intense I cannot wait for
this game to come out I will be buying
it I will be playing it we'll be
reviewing it and I will be sleeping with
it
now I may don't go that far but if
you're into historical figures and
sneaky ninja like Indians this is
definitely a game for you look for it
October 30th or pre-order now on Tuesday
the 25th Blizzard released its World of
Warcraft expansion the 4th and its
franchise called the mists of pandaria
if you are in the World of Warcraft you
probably aren't watching this video
right now likely you are playing the
game it is known to eat your soul as
somebody who's played the game for five
years and gotten free miss append area
it takes place in just that a new island
called Pandaria where the Panda race in
a new class called the monk take place
so stepping into this game you get to
choose either a brand new character as a
monk or a panda or continue on your
quest in from your old level 85s up to a
max level of level 90 I have absolutely
no idea what's at the end content I
haven't even cared to look but if you're
into World of Warcraft fill us in what's
going on and Mists of Pandaria in the
crazy news scientists are warning us
that there is going to be a worldwide
helium shortage if we don't stop using
helium to fill party balloons scientist
suggests that if we don't stop using
helium to fill party balloons we will
run completely out of natural helium in
the next 30 to 50 years give or take a
few decades okay fine you run out of
helium
fuse hydrogen what could possibly go
wrong New York City is reporting that
the theft of Apple devices is 40 percent
increased since the iPhone 5 is launched
particularly in their subway system from
January 1st of this year until now there
have been
eleven thousand four hundred and forty
seven robberies involving Apple products
I know that Samsung was really mad about
losing that patent suit but I think
they've really taken things too far this
time
speaking of Apple products there was a
huge brawl on Sunday in the north part
of China at the Foxconn factory where
workers are complaining that they are
under too much stress and being worked
entirely too long to keep up with the
Apple demands of their products
especially the iPhone 5 so 2,000 Foxconn
workers began to fight each other and of
that two thousand forty were injured how
do you have two thousand people fighting
and only 40 are injured maybe it was a
Guinness Book World Records attempt the
largest pillow fight in the world
alright guys that's today's show but
what I want to do when I close out every
show every week I want to feature a
stupid criminal that did something that
involved technology and this week we're
gonna feature Donald Goodrich who got
his iPhone 5 and loaded up his bust a
cap in that ass app and was very upset
that the dimensions did not match the
new screen so he marched into his local
Apple store went up to the Genius Bar
and demanded that they fix his phone so
that it fills the entire screen and when
the Genius Bar associate told him
there's nothing they could do about it
that it was up to the app developer to
make it fit the new screen
he said fixed my phone or the iPhone
gets it if you don't fix my phone I'm
gonna pull out my 9 millimeter and I'm
gonna bust a cap in my iphone right here
so what's he do he opens up his jacket
and displays his 9 millimeter he is now
doing time for aggravated mischief and
concealed weapons charges Donal Goodrich
you are a technologies dumbass of the
week alright guys that's all for today
if I miss something and you would like
to talk about or it's just generally
funny or involves technology put it down
