J's two cents and today's episode is
brought to you by the number four and
the color blue what the everybody thanks
for watching tech addiction is going to
be a new series that I'm going to do
every single Friday righteous cuts cool
and interesting things that are
happening in the technology world
anything regarding pcs pc gaming
cellphones or just plain bizarre i want
to talk about it right off the bat i
want to talk about the fact that AMD has
announced that it is no longer going to
be making desktop performance processors
once pile driver is released so
unfortunately if you're an AMD fan like
I am this is the end of the road there's
just nothing beyond this so I'm having a
really hard time now considering staying
with AMD because Intel is going to be
the only path anyone has any option and
that's kind of scary because who knows
what the hell is going to happen with
prices now the Intel is going to be your
only route for performances desktop
process not only that pile drivers
coming in at right around two hundred
and fifty dollars with some of the leak
pricing and its performance is just
abysmal there is nothing to be excited
for it barely performs any better than
the 8120 of 8150 and even though it was
showing maybe a ten percent improvement
over bulldozer it just just gets a big
fat thumbs down so if you're looking at
going AMD my official advice is going to
be just skip it don't even bother and on
the path of Intel Intel us also
announced an entire line of processors
that are going to be discontinued that's
right sandy bridge the most popular
selling processor in the world of any
manufacturer is gonna be chopped March
of 2013 you'll no longer be able to
order any of the retail package
processors when it comes to the sandy
bridge line that's the 2500 k 2,600
2,700 any you know the lower end than
that no more and if you're going to get
what they call their slave packaging or
the OEM which is just the chip no fan no
box nothing you can order that up until
sep tember of 2013 so you have another
year but i have a feeling that supply is
going to be extremely low because
they're no longer going to be doing any
more manufacturing of it so if you want
it or you're thinking about upgrading or
pulling the trigger on a sandy bridge
processor to save some money over
ivybridge
I recommend you do it now because who
knows what the supply line is going to
be like come 2013 video card news the
sapphire HD 7970 6 gigabyte vapor-x
edition whoo that's a lot of words I was
just benchmarked and released and it
features this really interesting cooling
design this is what they have to say
about it the basic premise is that pure
water is used to transfer the heat load
away from the core through vaporization
where it is cooled and condenses back
into a liquid state at this point the
liquid returns to the heat source
through capillary action in the wicking
medium to follow the process again what
allows the water to vaporize at low
temperatures is that the vapor chamber
works in a very low pressure state
allowing the water to vaporize earlier
than normal so basically what it means
is that the water above the processor is
going to get hot turn into a vapor the
air is going to flow over the heat sink
take the vapor way it's going to cool
off again turn back in the water and
it's gonna get hot again turn into vapor
the fans into come blows air way yeah
she sounds pretty gimmicky to me I don't
know about you I'm in the water cooling
but I don't know if I'm in a vapor
cooling so how did that new 7970 beast
of a card actually match up against some
of the other nvidia models like the gtx
680 it didn't do very well folks it was
beaten in Haven battlefield 3 batman
arkham asylum it did win in dirt 3 in
Metro 2033 2033 is poorly optimized
which is great because usually the AMD
cards are somewhat poorly optimized to
and dirt 3 is actually sponsored by AMD
so you know might be a little bit of
shenanigans going on there unfortunately
the card costs six hundred dollars and
it's being beaten by the reference gtx
680 at a hundred dollars less so you're
at AMD Fannie you really want the
flagship card this is going to be for
you I can't recommend it go gtx 680
that's what I've got sitting right over
there and it's what I'm going to
continue to use until something better
comes along and even then I might not
get rid of the same because I love my
graphics card things amazing speaking of
GTX gigabyte came out with a brand-new
GTX super overclock and they said that
this is the fastest factory overclocked
there is of any gtx 680 on the market so
the good boys over at the overclockers
club com took that model threw it up
against the msi gtx 680 lightning and
wanted to see how it compared and guess
what once again it did not hold up so if
you're
giving yourself a high-end nvidia card i
highly recommend going with the msi gtx
680 lightning it does cost about forty
dollars more than the gigabyte but you
also were going to get the fastest card
with the most overclocking ability and
it definitely gets a thumb up for me so
the iphone 5 came out everyone was happy
it's the new Jesus phone I want one I
waited but I want when I have an iphone
4s but guess what thousands of people
have reported that their iphone 5 came
out of the box scratch what is Apple
doing about it they said aluminum
scratching on anodizing surfaces is
completely normal where the bear color
of aluminum will show through sketches
yeah no however do you think it
should come out of the box pre scratched
are you considering this like preshrunk
clothing is you know are you just doing
it for us get it out of the way so we no
longer you know get a heart attack and
go the first time you drop our phone or
it gets a scratch or our kid you know
take the key to it or something I don't
know Apple kind of reminds me of antenna
gate with the official just don't hold
it that way from steve jobs but you know
now how can you mention the iphone
without talking about the galaxy s3 i
actually have a galaxy s3 that's
provided to me through work it's a great
phone it's really big I don't like the
way it feels in my hand fifo but I have
a problem with my phone it likes you
just randomly reset itself if I set it
down on the table boom turns off resets
what okay that's not what I expected
from Samsung's flagship model the makers
of slender have teamed up with blue I'll
studios to bring you a new and improved
slender game that's expected to come out
towards the end of this year it is going
to be a full commercial game so if
problem they're not going to be free but
it is designed to scare the crap out of
you the original scare the crap out of
me just look like we're gonna scare the
crap
are you kidding me but it's going to be
using a lot higher graphics it actually
looks a lot like the old source engine
but they promised that there's going to
be more levels there's a story line and
objective to it and is it's guaranteed
to deliver an extreme scare so I'll be
looking forward to that one I do like
slender no it scares the crap out of me
but when that comes out I'll be sure to
do a live stream and maybe a video
review of it at me here once again
you'll catch something epic coming out
on all gaming platforms on October
thirtieth is Assassin's Creed 3 i'm
extremely looking forward to this game i
am a big fan of the assassins creed
franchise and this one takes place in
the 1700s and you are helping George
Washington with the Revolutionary War
you get to go through some factual
historical events that have taken place
in American history like the Boston Tea
Party and I think they even mentioned
the signing of the Declaration of
Independence or something like that but
it's mixed in with a lot of fiction in
order to bring a you know tomahawk
toting assassin into the equation here
but the graphics on this game look
absolutely intense I cannot wait for
this game to come out i will be buying
it i will be playing it will be
reviewing it and i will be sleeping with
it now they don't go that far but if
you're into historical figures and
sneaky ninja like Indians this is
definitely a game for you look for it
October thirtieth or pre-order now on
Tuesday the 25th blizzard released its
world of warcraft expansion the fourth
and its franchise called the mists of
pandaria few are in the world of
warcraft you probably aren't watching
this video right now likely you are
playing the game it is known to eat your
soul as somebody who's played the game
for five years and gotten free miss
append area takes place in just that a
new island called penned area where the
panda race in a new class called the
monk take place so step it into this
game you get to choose either a brand
new character as a monk or a panda or
continue on your quest inform your old
level 85 s up to a max level of level 90
I have absolutely no idea what's at the
end content I haven't even cared to look
but if you're into World of Warcraft
fill us in what's going on and missed
app and area in the crazy news
scientists are warning us that there is
going to be a worldwide helium shortage
if we don't stop using helium to fill
party balloons scientists suggests that
if we don't stop using helium
party balloons we will run completely
out of natural helium in the next 30 to
50 years give or take a few decades okay
fine we're not a helium fuse hydrogen
what could possibly go wrong New York
City is reporting that the theft of
Apple devices as forty percent increased
since the iphone 5 is launched
particularly in their subway system from
january first of this year until now
there have been 11,447 robberies
involving apple products I know that
Samsung was really mad about losing that
patent suit but I think they've really
taken things too far this time speaking
of apple products there was a huge brawl
on Sunday in the north part of China at
the foxconn factory where workers are
complaining that they are under too much
stress and being worked entirely too
long to keep up with the Apple demands
of their products especially the iphone
5 so two thousand Foxconn workers began
to fight each other and of that 2040
were injured how do you have two
thousand people fighting and only forty
or injured maybe it was a Guinness Book
World Records attempt the largest pillow
fight in the world alright guys that's
today's show but what I want to do when
I close out every show every week I want
to feature a stupid criminal that did
something that involved technology and
this week we're going to feature Donald
goodrich who got his iphone 5 and loaded
up his bust a cap in that ass app and
was very upset that the dimensions did
not match the new screen so he marched
into his local apple store went up to
the Genius Bar and demanded that they
fix his phone so that it fills the
entire screen and when the genius bar
assoc had told him there's nothing they
could do about it that it was up to the
app developer to make it fit the new
screen he said fixed my phone or the
iphone gets it if you don't fix my phone
I'm gonna pull out my 9 millimeter and
I'm gonna bust a cap in my iphone right
here so what's he do he opens up his
jacket and displays his 9-millimeter he
is now doing time for aggravated
mischief and concealed weapons charges
Donald goodrich you are a technologies
dumbass of the Week all right guys

it's just generally funny or involves
technology put it down into the comments
