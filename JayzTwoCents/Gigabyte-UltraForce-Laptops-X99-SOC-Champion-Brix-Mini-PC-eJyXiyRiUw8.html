taken a look at a lot on this channel
and I get a lot of questions about is
gaming laptops I've actually not really
paid a whole lot of tension of what's
going on in the industry of gaming
laptops so today we're going to take a
look at gigabytes ultra force ultra slim
lightweight mobile gaming computers now
we've got the p34 w here it's a 14 inch
gaming laptop it's available up to a 512
gigabyte msata SSD GTX 970 am capable
full HD screen it's actually giving you
one of the best performance per size
ratio here coming in at under 4 pounds
the thing is extremely light it's got
fan tweak on their amazing battery life
you can actually adjust the fans to make
the thing quieter if it's not under load
not many laptops actually give you a fan
curb adjustment but the ultra force is
actually giving you that now if you want
a little bit bigger screen maybe a
little bit more power than the p35 XV 3
would probably be a little bit more in
your alley and it's a 15 inch screen
available all the way up to a 9 ATM
graphics card for the fastest graphics
card you can put in a mobile solution
right now and of course the storage is
linear as well you can actually have two
SSDs in this laptop now if you just want
to pull out all the stops and you just
want to get the best performance you
possibly can out of a laptop and the
ultra force p 37 x it's a brand new
laptop laptop but they're bringing the
market here it's a 17.3 inch screen it's
got a 9 ATM graphics card in there which
is you know we've already mentioned is
the fastest mobile graphics card you can
actually install but here's the thing
it's got macro keys on the left side
which people have said they want it's
also got to em say two slots in there on
top of the SSD that's already installed
in the unit giving you three hard drive
slots and on the front here it actually
has an optical drive I'm but not only is
it an optical drive right if you're like
me you think I don't use optical drives
why would I want that or you already
thinking like I am and check this out
you could actually hot swap out the slim
drive use their included bracket for SSD
saitta slide this in with another SSD
you have
for hard drives in a gaming laptop so no
longer do you have to deal with storage
capacity and size issues with the
computer guys become a superior hey
what's up guys Jay's two cents here
continuing my gigabyte coverage here at
CES 2015 and as you know intel mentioned
and launched Broadwell just the other
day and of course that means gigabyte is
bringing you a brand new bricks tiny
ultra mini PC alright guys now let's go
and be honest i am going to cheat and
use the little card here because this
thing is so new i have not had time to
memorize the specs on this but first
thing to mention is it does feature both
or all three i3 i5 and i7 Broadwell cpus
the 50 1050 twenty and fifty five or
fifty 250 500 you broadwell cpus now
they're claiming that we're seeing
upwards of twenty percent improvement
overall by using broadwell in the bricks
now if you guys are know what bricks is
it is basically just a altra tiny PCM
aids got msata in here it's got em say
to m dot two for the wireless so you no
longer using that you know that pcie
mini PCIe so you get faster wireless
speeds on this you get the bluetooth 4.0
and the i7 models actually have NFC
capability now what people were doing
with the bricks is also using these as
multimedia pcs and hooking them up to
some sort of a cloud storage or in-home
storage for your movies and stuff in
fact some of these models last year I
think this one does too but don't
entirely quote me on it actually had a
visa mounts you could mount this on the
back of your TV a bricks is actually
something that I think is really cool
it's something that I was kind of fan
blowing over last year and I thought was
really awesome but you guys know me when
it comes to overclocking and gigabyte
also launched this year here at CES the
brand new x 99 s OC champion
overclocking motherboard now I'm on the
surface it may look like an OC force but
this is actually when it comes to
overclocking pulls out all the stops got
a layer PCB you've got extra pins in the
2011 socket which you can actually
toggle those pins on and off with a bio
switch here so that you can actually
activate and deactivate those pins based
on your overclocking mood but this thing
is freaking heavy I wish you could feel
this I mean you can actually see from
the side there is no bowing or bending
in this
thing you actually it's yeah I'm bending
their board guys I'm trying to anyway it
is very very rigid but this was actually
used on Monday in their overclocking
event where they exceeded 4000 megahertz
speed on ddr4 I mean ddr4 is really
starting to mature now we're starting to
see motherboards that can actually
stabilize that speed and the SOC
champion is certainly nothing short of
that I mean you've got heat pipes
running on all of the via the vrm
coolers here mosfet coolers but you
still have 4-way SLI capable so you can
still run this thing in a gaming system
and just overclocked the hell out of
your 2011 dash 3 socket cpu so guys
check out the x99 SOC champion on
gigabytes website if you want to learn a
little bit more about that and well this
is awesome actually alright guys well
huh you know we are here in the gigabyte
booth and of course it wouldn't be
gigabyte if we didn't have water force
now I want to point out that i'm
standing next to the thing and i'm still
alive so that's not entirely terrible
right but no they actually are very
committed to this project I mean the
water force is something that they
believe in and I guess they actually
sold out of the units they had sent over
to the United States so somebody is
obviously introduced interested in this
but i do want to kind of point out that
the case of though you see here was
apparently a lot more befitting of the
project than the one that i was using
but you know hey i figure we at least do
some mention here the water force this
is their big push and we had a meeting
with gigabyte actually want to point
this out and I got an opportunity to
really tell them you know how I felt
about the water for swear I felt they
missed the mark what they should have
done they have definitely seen your
comments so i wouldn't be surprised in
the future if we did see some revamp of
the idea so that's why we're even
talking about it today is I do want you
guys to know that they heard you and
that they are committed to water force
but of course it's their very first
attempt at doing water cooling they
really wanted to hit the 3-way SLI
market but they're definitely hearing
especially with the meeting that we had
my emphasis on single card single card
is where it's at so who knows maybe in
the future we could see a single
120-millimeter version of that my call
to action on you guys is what do you
want to see from gigabyte when it comes
to water force what would be perfect now
I had suggested doing a single
120-millimeter read and calling it a day
and they definitely heard that and they
definitely feel that that could be
possible but I think it's important for
you guys to really be constructive in
the comments and tell people or tell
gigabyte what it is you think would
actually be viable what would you buy
and guys they're watching so I figured
would at least talk about water for so I
kind of beat up on it a little bit but
hey here we are and we're all still
friends so that's a great thing right as
always guys we were hanging out here at
the gigabyte overclocking event going on
as well as checking out some of the
things that they're bringing a market
here in 2015 as always guys thanks for
helping crowdfund this video no sponsors
on this one just you guys and as always
following twitter if you have any
questions behind the scenes coverage as
see you in the next one yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
