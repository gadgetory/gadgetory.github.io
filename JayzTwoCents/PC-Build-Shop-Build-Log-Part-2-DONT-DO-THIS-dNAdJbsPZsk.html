a little bit of a work log here today so
more things I want to get on with the
shop preparing for vacation next week so
we've got a lot of videos to make to get
us through that period where I won't be
here but fun fact during that time and
I'm gone we're getting a big-ass AC put
in the warehouse finally as we can
control the temperatures out here but
today we're going to start by and I'm
trying to fix this plug and not die
miss oh man I wish there's a better way
to play warships we're gonna play on my
computer
apparently you haven't heard of world of
warships and yeah you play it on a
computer
well the warships is a free to play
strategy game where you take command to
some of the most iconic war vessels from
World War one and World War two vessels
like the HMS hood USS Missouri or the
ships that changed naval warfare forever
the dreadnought class each ship is
recreated using historical photos and 3d
scans of the real vessel to ensure the
most realistic detail possible so real
in fact you will swear you were on the
ship itself but we all know that the war
is won in the sky so that's why world of
warships features a completely revamped
carrier play style where you get to take
control of squadrons of aircraft
performing bombing and torpedo runs to
devastate your enemy in fact new players
can start devastating their enemies by
using art for code play Langley 2019 to
receive a free starter pack featuring
the USS langley aircraft carrier 302
blues 1 million credits and 3 days of
premium time now get out there and start
putting some shells downrange Taylor
yeah this is so much fun you can
start having fun too by downloading
world of warships by using the link in
the description below
so we've got two giant electrical panels
here which is kind of nice we've got a
408 277 we've got a 120 208 over here
with lots and lots of empty as you can
see but we've anybody were to open a
machine shop okay so the problem is this
guy right here that is going right into
this panel only this right two plugs
they're working and as you can see right
now because we don't have the conduit
and plugs installed on this wall yet we
would have to run everything off with
contractors cables mature unfortunately
only rated to 15 amp which isn't
terrible but these are 20 amp circuits
so we could technically over work the
cable and extension cables are not going
to be good for overclocking and stuff
like that so what I said I want to do
eventually very soon hopefully after get
back on vacation as I want to have like
five or six dedicated 20 M plugs on
these Walter each one is its own
breaker so that we can get the cleanest
power possible for overclocking the
problem with this is this plug this side
of this gang is not working and I don't
know why so I figured how hard could it
be for me to figure this one out right
actually it's not that hard at all but
what I do need to figure out is which
breaker is this gang so that I or this
this box in here so that I can will not
die at the start of the video that's
fine if I die at the end of the video at
least you got some content out of it but
four minutes in that's not worth while
death so we're already off to a great
start considering I do have circuit
testers and stuff because I guess I used
to work for an electrician and I forgot
all this up at home unfortunately we
have an eccentric over the light so I
can see which breaker it is when we turn
it off now if I were a betting man
because this is on the right side of the
panel I'm gonna guess it's probably this
twenty amp right here or on the right
side of the panel yep
so because the actual plugs mount to the
box itself when I take out these two
screws the plug should come out with it
I like a wall click in your home where
those mount to the box and then the
cover comes off and then those stay
mounted so this will be easier to to
work on and see what's up it's so slow
or they're not hooked up at all I mean
there is that why why go through the
effort I've installed a ceiling fan that
makes me a certified look at you :
engineer just like one of them science
people never did I dream that it would
be on YouTube channel showing people how
to backyard electrician which you should
never do you should never backyard
electricians or if you do this use a
tutorial that's not hard it's oh yeah do
this at your own risk you take your own
life in your hands I am NOT responsible
electrical really is easy if you
understand how it works it's when you
don't worry that bad things can happen
I like how grounds a nautical is safety
but ground in skydiving could be bad
it's just like okay now you just shove
it all back in there you know if nothing
touches that's why you make sure there's
nothing like you make sure those are
trimmed so they're all the way flush
down in here there's no wires exposed
especially me having exposed ground wire
like I've got here alright if the second
I flip the breaker it doesn't flip right
back or go to half position there we're
good you have a light we're good we're
here for moral support and you were
standing close to the thing that I could
have blowed up some seating out there
watching it's just like the guy that
literally climbs like transformer hole
easily so I mentioned that we need an
electrician to come out because of
permitting and and all that sort of
stuff you know - because we're in a
commercial space and all that obviously
you need a permit and a licensed
electrician to come out and do anything
conduit based and all that I'd love to
do it myself like I said but I'm not
going to do that because
yeah I'm about to be legit but what I am
gonna do is I am gonna use the same type
of cord or cable like you just saw me
use for fixing that which is the same
stuff I used over here on the set and
I'll show you that in a second to run
power to here because basically it's
just gonna be an extension cord we're
gonna run it down along the wall we're
probably gonna come right in between
these two or it might go up the side and
straight from the side I think I walk
over there less so we'll see we're gonna
tape it down with GAD tape just like
this but then we're gonna mount like a
big-ass truck outside and we're gonna
mount a like a power strip or something
under here so that I have power running
to my bench so when I'm doing things
here on the extension cords running
everywhere but it will also be powerful
enough so if I want to plug in something
like clockwork which uses this gauge
cable because it's a 1600 watt power
supply then we can do that because right
now it's running through keep it like
this which is not rated nearly as as
tough as these cables are and not only
that when you start dealing with
overclocking and we're doing like our
overclocking competitions and stuff
anytime you linked in the cable you also
increase the likelihood of dirty power
that can cause an instability issue so
by using the higher rated cable or gauge
wire and stuff we get cleaner wire and
because it's solid versus strand like I
talked about earlier then we can
hopefully get better clean power to the
table as well as along this wall so
we're gonna do now we really go to our
favorite place ever we spent so much
time and money and they're starting to
notice on a first name basis
Home Depot not a sponsor but they should
be at this point
I know Isis I didn't want to do a
pegboard but do you know why people do
pegboards because it's cheap and it
convenience we've got someone by twos
right here to build a support sport so
it stands off the wall because you know
pedal boards have to be off the wall
that can't be flush otherwise you can't
cut the pegs to there we've also got
some RG forty rj45 ends because we have
to get network out here too obviously
and then we've got our ends I semi used
to make an extension cord to bring over
to this table and we've got this power
strip we'll be mounting underneath the
table so that when we do put systems up
here one of the things we had to do with
the old studio which kind of sucked and
it actually use this cord right here is
we have this one extension cord that was
taped down in the ground and it had
these three plugs on the end but then
this was on the floor and we had to
cable streaked everywhere and it kind of
sucked so the idea here is that we have
a bouncing under the end of the table
then we have like system up here and
monitor for showing something to just
plug it all in right here and then it's
just permanently wired don't worry about
that I don't find I'm moving this table
around and rotating it and stuff but if
we do for some reason obviously it will
be able to unplug it so I can be taped
down but before we do any of this with
you night of time we spent going to Home
Depot first and then loads looking at
all the solutions of like what FastTrack
and gladiator and craftsman and all
those other rail systems the problem
with like the Swiss rails is they're
good for hanging like brooms and shovels
and ladders and things like that peg
boards obviously perfect for mounting
all kinds of tools and I want to have
like our most common stuff mounted on
here it's an extension cord called the
heat gun and all that sort of stuff and
then the cart that's at the other studio
is still a bit debris here that's gonna
be my water cooling cart on my water
cooling tools that I typically need are
going to be in that and then I think it
may need to feel like spool of wire and
stuff up here so when we have to make
custom stuff we have it all accessible
so it's both functional and a design
so this is interior grade power wire
same thing you just saw me use a piece
of to fix the plug over there so this is
what's running through the walls of your
home and usually daisy chain six or
seven plugs sometimes more in your wall
it's designed to carry more current than
like a regular extension cord so I'm
gonna make an extension cord out of this
so what are we doing that using these
guys right here so you can actually use
these to also repair these frayed cables
you may have things that are wearing out
like if you've got any frayed cable
showing it all in any sort of plug
that's dangerous but you can use these
ends to fix it we are going to be
connecting our neutral because the
fatter you see on the US plug any way
you have grounded plugs obviously that
big one down there is the ground
you've got the longer prong and the
shorter problem well that's the neutral
and then that's the power wire so we are
going to be wiring it up so that the
white wire goes here the black wire goes
here and the copper wire or green wire
depending on your setup well go here so
the nice thing about these two is
instead of being the kind of just crimp
on the side it has the hole like you
just shove it in ol yeah our neutral
here first we've got to get this on
there this is our crimp the end
here we go just to sit on that thing
dude that thing's pretty cheap do it's
funny about these videos is it how many
other creators out there can you go wow
this guy can do a lot of cool wow
this guy's stupid got some really cool
things but he's really stupid alright so
on the surface might look like we didn't
get much done Jay you built two stools
and you fix the plug and you built an
extension cord and you hung a pegboard
on the wall will you'd be right that's
all we got done today but it's something
we're just about to the point now to
where we can start truly doing builds
again in here I think the next one the
next project I want to do in here is
finally playing with that W 3175 X which
is that 24 core 48 thread Nvidia or a
video yeah and video makes EPS now until
chip we've had for a while with our
Dominus motherboard play around with
some of the water cooling just to see
what that many cores is like because
when we got that chip and that was kind
of monstrous but now we hear about a
potential epic CPU that's 64 cores 128
threads
we're Cinebench would be like pixel by
pixel squares but just doing all the
work so yeah I think we'll play around
that and then
no no what else we're gonna do we renew
some videos it's up around here anyway
hey we're gonna go now guys thanks for
watching hanging out with us on this
build blog oh yeah I know I said peg
warts are overrated and everyone uses
them but I mean this is a reason why
everyone uses them there's a reason
we're gonna outline where the tools go
on there just like everyone does - so
you can say we're copying whoever else
does that but that's why it's a standard
that's why you do it because it works
some of that alright guys thanks for
watching as always we'll see in the next
one well I already apologized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
