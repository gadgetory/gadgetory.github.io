welcome to part 2 of the three part
thread Ripper embargo lifts as the guy's
nose for talked about specs already and
then we could talk about unboxing and we
could talk about the actual performance
and stuff coming up very very soon so
AMD has sent over a care package and we
kind of knew that thread Ripper was big
but also expect need to be how that big
I just scratched my fingers whatever
cooler masters master key pro series of
keyboards offer sixteen point seven
million color RGB genuine carry switches
a variety of sizes as well as surface
mounted controls allowing full
customization without the need for
stand-alone software learn more by
following a link down below we're going
to set this aside because this is
actually eight into that we should have
an embossed like engraved name plate on
there that's cool looks like it's
starting to come unstuck though whatever
okay that's fine we also have this guy
right here I was expecting to see PU
more than I bargained for I think that
that's a y Oh God
I warned you this was going to be bad
good night when I told you that there
was like an embark unboxing embargo okay
not trying to be disrespectful with this
stuff we have a very heavy
Venis the upside-down extreme x3 ninety
nine motherboard from asus these boxes
are empty these are just fillers he has
to how lioness like drops everything but
he started with his videos with
embossing he's like the unboxing cheap
damn it I'm bad at unboxings I'm telling
you I never do them because I'm bad at
them that's kind of that rise and thread
Ripper try to read this backwards the
components you need to create the
ultimate desktop system platform unlocks
unrestrained just unrestrained
uncompromising that's hard to read
backwards and inside out we've also got
here some tried it D
RTB memory which kind of funny they
reached out to them it was like hey can
you send me some more try to NZ I want
to use some of the thread Ripper build
and then this showed up in the box with
it does like oh never mind we're good
then we have some Thermaltake stuff that
I don't know I'm just going to go out on
a limb and say that AMD wasn't aware of
my current and ongoing boycott of
Thermaltake products we and we don't
read those and some other boards have
always kind of had this I mean you'll
have you'll have these agnostic brands
like Asus MSI gigabyte they always make
you know motherboards for AMD and then
make them for Intel but the Intel
motherboards always had this greater
feel of quality if you will in terms of
the components that were on there the
weights of it the just overall build
quality but that has changed through
this we've got the armour on the back
this definitely feels like a Republic of
gamers product and look at that socket
holy hell
you just can't get a feel for how big it
is until you experience it in person
rather than that in but you might notice
there's actually no levers on here to
open the socket up just Torx head that's
because this is actually a socket that
requires a tool and specific torque on
here to mount it so yeah we'll be doing
will be using this in my personal build
because I told you guys I'm going to
build a risin thread Ripper system for
my my personal rig slash professional
rig and I think I'm going to stick to
that because I'm liking what I see here
so far but obviously this is the part
you guys are here to see this is the AMD
risin thread Ripper media case we'll
call it the other stuff was just
supporting parts in case we didn't have
anything in inventory to do our build
obviously we do so we appreciate the
extra parts but here it is right here
it's an ax Pelican what is it start a
trach case yes it was inside ready
that's this
whoa oh look at this
get that pretty cool this is like
magnetic this is an actual what the heck
good alright guys I can't be bought with
cool stuff but this is cool though I
remember one look at that does this
actually work
what's a limited edition 37 is 250 did
they make 250 Jason's one I kind of
wanna know if this really works or not
now okay fine
he obviously read the shipping a packet
thing I didn't okay I'm kind of
experienced this raw might it is what
else we got here we've got shoe this is
the part that kind of worries me because
these things are suction cupped in there
already only that we've got to thread
rippers here actually this one right
here is the 1920 X and then here's our
1950 X that's cool we'll find you to
this case later obviously I think we
have another camera case next one for
the a7 SP okay so here's the part that
I'm not looking forward to if you wanna
know the truth
I'm so bad at these unboxings I think
you guys have already noticed this this
is the actual retail packaging right
this is the way it's going to look on
the shelves it's going to be pretty
massive but he's actually come apart in
a very specific way so we've got here
unlock the power so I'm assuming with
the turnit and this is also foam by the
way guys assuming you know it's fight
cringy but that's how we can expect it
to be protected and delivery that is
like a closed cell foam and that okay go
farther no this is come apart
you see why I hate doing school here rip
here rip here instead of care here do
you think that's a thread Ripper joke in
there ah there we go you're so smart
okay there we go see boom this is
actually the package right here
can I go home I really hope it's packed
well in there I mean it's waiting and
having I mean all the foam they should
have just really put this thing in a big
giant piece of bubble wrap for me you
guys know how Linus breaks things by
just handling it I can't take things out
of packaging my problem this is spring
loaded I'm concerned Nick this is the
spring it's like tension holding the CPU
down in there we have to do this don't
we oh all right wasn't so bad this is
going to port when they showed us this
at the little like press thing and I
showed like the exploded view of this
packaging I looked at Nick and I like I
am so screwed oh there we go
okay so this is the little installation
cassette is what they're basically
calling it thread Ripper if you guys
aren't aware has done away with the pins
on the CPU and the pins are now on the
motherboard so this is their
installation cassette we'll do a
separate how to install this video
I think Paul put it out a little bit
early people would just be actually
abide by the embargoes Paul just give
them a hard time usually he's the one
yelling and screaming about that so this
actually slides into the bracket on top
of the socket and then you leave this on
and everything that way you're not
actually trying to drop it on the socket
it actually slides into the lid the lid
goes down you torque it down so how do
you torque it well you've also got this
right here which is the thread Ripper
torque wrench and this is set to the
exact amount of Newton meters needed for
that bracket because it does have a
required torque spec on there which is
one point 5 Newton meters or 13.3 inch
pounds or 18-foot ounces that's actually
a measurement of point out okay or 15
kilograms per centimeter so I think I
covered the entire world on there thank
you for putting on there a mdro it is
seemed really stupid it's just a t20
socket head this wrench right here why
should click once it goes to the right
torque spec of course you got your
thread Ripper
go shredder for sticker and then your
installation instructions and then of
course lesson at least you have your ASA
Tech bracket so any of your ASA tech
base water coolers you can just remove
the bracket from those whether the intel
AMD doesn't matter this goes on to the
pump this then gets torqued down to the
motherboard and you can convert your ASA
tech cooler to this now we had some
concerns about whether or not the size
of this heat spreader was going to be
covered by the ASA tech cooler I'm as
you can see you're not going to get full
coverage because member the water block
is also narrower than that circle but
you're at least going to get coverage in
the center of it which is going to be
where most of the heat is centralized so
until we start seeing full custom water
blocks and they did say that ASA Tech is
working on a new design to cover thread
Ripper I think it's going to be thread
river specific though because to be big
enough to cover thread Ripper would
probably interfere on components around
the smaller CPUs like am for 1151 and
all of those EK water blocks though will
indeed have a water block available for
this I've already contacted them you
know I'm going to be using it so there
it is anything else we need to talk
about I'm not doing it again with that
one I was staying together until it's
time to use it because now I've got to
figure out how to put this back
together guys thanks for watching this
AMD risin thread Ripper media kit
unboxing if you will I knows very little
substance here but I never do this I
thought it'd be fun thanks for watching
guys can't wait to do this bill honey in
my last video I said I was gonna do a
thread Ripper build and there's some
folks that were like dude I'll never do
a thread Ripper build because he's such
an Intel shill it's like I said I'm
gonna I said I'm gonna and I am this was
the 1920 X right down here right now
this is my 1950 ok here we can use
alright guys thanks for watching as
always see you in the next Mick you're
up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
