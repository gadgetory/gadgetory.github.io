about time I bring us some videos
regarding my 4790k that I picked up when
I was in New York City the Micra Center
out there in Paterson and I tried I've
already spent a lot of time today trying
to do a different video that I'm just
going to scrap and start all over I've
been trying to see how well the 4790k
performs on a z87 platform which you may
or may not know is these 4770k or the
first generation has well platform this
gigabyte board that I'm using the UD 3h
it's a fantastic board for the 4770k the
46 70k in the first gen has well stuff
but this motherboard and this BIOS from
gigabyte it tried to kill my processor
when I first booted it up I knew better
than to just boot it up and go I knew to
check all the settings make sure
everything was kosher and it had my
voltage set to one point five zero one
volts one point five zero one I wouldn't
be surprised if they took some life off
of my processor just from idling it at
that voltage I mean it's just excuse my
language but around with this
thing for hours and hours today the u
d3h has to go it's just not doing well
with my 4790k so what i'm going to do
next is i'm going to take my MSI z97
empower we're going to throw that in
there along with the 4790k where I talk
about overclocking or talk about this
motherboard and see how things go now
first things first let's go ahead and
talk about this motherboard and some of
the features that it has I mean it does
have I mean obviously it's all about
overclocking the m-series from MSI it's
all about overclocking anything yellow
is overclocking when it comes to MSI I
mean it supports fourth and fifth
generation so future processors coming
out like Broadwell for instance coming
out next year z97 Express chipset it
supports up to 3000 mega hurt RAM or
mega Hertz
megahertz Ram it's got a Intel Gigabit
Ethernet eight channel 7.1 HD audio it's
got three times PCI Express
no 16x slots it is only capable of SLI
though it's not capable of 3-way it does
have six SATA 6 gigabytes or SATA 3 6
gigabit per second ports from the z97
with raid support so that's directly
hooked up to the chipset and it does
have to say Nats 6 gigabit per second
ports for the a s media ASM 1061
controller 8 USB 2.0 s2 and the rear six
in the front and eight USB 3.0 ports 6
in the rear 2 in the front it does have
expansion capabilities of three times
PCI Express times one one time three PCI
Express 2.0 16 @ slots and one m2 slot
it's got a whole bunch of other things
going on with it along with you know msi
military class OC Genie and all that
stuff so it's also got the audio boost
where the audio is separated from the
rest of the components on the
motherboard so that you're not getting
noise and interference from the power
going through the motherboard so there's
the motherboard right there we're going
to go ahead and get my air cooler we're
going to air cooling on this just to see
how well the 4790k performs under air
the new thermal paste is supposed to be
fantastic so let's go ahead and get that
installed in here let's drop it in here
and see how this thing performs well
it's not let's not like physically drop
it because it does say you know military
class and it's tough but I still
wouldn't I wouldn't do that alright so
part 2 of this video this has actually
been ongoing now for quite a few hours
in fact I've got about 5 or 6 hours
worth of tinkering time now on this
4790k but before we talk about that
let's go ahead and finish talking about
the motherboard now the z97 mPower
motherboard it carries over all of the
legacy features that you would expect
from all of the other npower
motherboards since the z77 series very
stable overclocker you can adjust every
single aspect of the motherboard every
single voltage everything is
customizable and that's what makes these
motherboards so awesome the sound card
on it sounds good the overclocking is
extremely stable and things run nice and
cool thinks that massive erm heatsink
now let's go ahead and talk about the
4790k
now if you follow on twitter you know
I've said some pretty frustrated
statements about this chip they seem to
be all over the place when it comes to
overclocking potential just like the 47
70k and that really frustrated me in the
beginning but then I really had to kind
of pull myself back and think about it
and go wait a minute what is the 4790k
well it's an evolutionary not a
revolutionary chip I have to remember
that so it's going to have a lot of the
inherit problems at the 4770k had now
one thing that they did improve upon I
have to admit is the thermal compound
now we were hoping it was soldered in
the beginning everyone thought it was
soldered it's not it's just more of a
polymer compound the custom blend I
guess I have to say that it's working
because I'm currently running 4.6
gigahertz on air you could never do that
with a Haswell 4770k they just get way
too hot but this thing has been running
for about an hour and yeah I mean we're
sitting right now in the mid 70s to low
80s peak maximum tempus Eve so far on
all the cores is 88 90 89 and 81 so yeah
that 90 could be scary
but keep in mind that's still 15 degrees
Celsius from TJ Maxx and now we're not
talking about the store we're talking
about where the CPU starts to throttle
the fact that you can do that on air and
I'm currently running 1.30 9 volts yes
you heard me right
1.30 9 volts on air and it's not even a
high end air cooler it's a 50-dollar air
cooler that's able to run at this speed
now the cool thing with that is it means
that the thermal compound is certainly
doing its job and it means that us water
coolers are going to be able to push
these things even farther as thermals
are no longer going to be what's holding
back a lot of our overclocks as they
were with the 4770k why was i mad in the
beginning well I think because I was
expecting a better overclocker but then
I have to remember like I said this is
inherently inheriting all of the
problems at 4770k had with the exception
of the thermal paste now they added a
few extra transistors and and capacitors
inside the chip which make things a
little bit more stable when it comes to
power delivery and I have to say 4.6
gigahertz is pretty stable on this thing
right now especially on air but it was
not a revolutionary chip redesigned
that's what Broadwell is all about so I
really have to reserve my judgment on
whether or not Intel is going to
actually appeal us enthusiast builders
for Broadwell next year but that's the
cool thing about going z97 is I'm now
set up for Broadwell and hopefully they
actually give us something that we're
asking
or which would be a 5 gigahertz
guaranteed chip I mean we we've been
inching up against that 5 gigahertz for
so long now the 4790k is something you
should definitely consider if you're
building a system today because it makes
no sense to get a 4770k considering
they're within ten dollars of each other
at almost every single retailer and if
you live near a Micro Center you can get
it for two hundred and seventy nine
dollars which is how much mine cost me
so under three hundred dollars you get a
chip that's nice and powerful and now
nice and cool thank goodness for that
hopefully the thermal compound will hold
out now this is the chip that I'm going
to be putting in project skunk works and
I'm going to be pairing it up with my
EVGA z97 classified motherboard and
we'll see how well that motherboard does
but in terms of overclocking this thing
is absolutely fantastic and the 4790k
I'm hoping once I can give more volts to
it cuz I've seen people go as high as
one point three seven five volts on
these chips and still maintain amazing
temperatures on water so I'm hoping that
that'll be me I'm hoping for a four
point eight ish 5.0 is not going to
happen with this chip it's taken too
many volts just to get four point six so
guys if you're building a new system the
4790k is going to deliver everything the
4770k does with a little better
stability and a lot better thermal
control I was hoping for more
unfortunately I had to remind myself
Evolutionary not revolutionary the Intel
tik-tok upgrade system it still has well
that's what you have to remember that's
still a Haswell chip but the cooling
aspect of it alone makes sense to a new
builder if you're currently on a 4770k
don't even consider updating if you're
on a 3770k i'm upgrading from a 37 70
but that's mostly because I'm in a
position where I can make these upgrades
make sense for me cost wise I probably
wouldn't recommend it even for 3770k
owners and it's hard for me to say
exactly who unless you're on a really
old like a 900 series intel i7 I don't
recommend jumping whatsoever to this
chip it's just not a big enough
improvement so guys Ben Jase two cents
follow on Twitter if you want to see the
tweets I said where I was like alright
just treat this chip blah blah blah blah
and I don't really say that but follow
on Twitter if you guys want to talk some
more tech stuff and as always I will see
you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
