here bringing it a product kind of more
of an overview rather than a full like
in-depth every product feature review
here of the asrock g10 AC 2600 gaming
router now I know some folks get really
mad when they put the word gaming in
something that has to do with Wireless
it tends to really make a lot of people
angry whether it be mouse keyboard or
router but at least we're going to talk
about this today I'm going to show you
how I plan on using it to increase the
wireless here in my house and then you
guys can hopefully make a decision about
whether or not this product is right for
you
the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro
from Coolermaster combines modularity
with creativity giving you the freedom
to build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description all right so here it is
right here and as you can see it is a
piano finish which unfortunately you
guys know I hate you can already see
there's fingerprints all over it simply
because I've been getting myself
acquainted with it and it already looks
very smudgy and greasy and I just
cleaned my hands it's it's something I'm
always going to give negative points for
anything that has a piano finish like
this because what's going to happen is
it's going to attract dust it's going to
attract fingerprints and when you wipe
that clean it's going to start to get
micro sorrel scratches in here and it's
going to look terrible please for the
love of God if you're watching and you
manufacture routers or a device period
monitors keyboards whatever no more
piano finishes we need textured plastic
it will always look better in the long
run this is this is I'm always going to
knock points off for this I'm sorry
that's subjective I know but I just
I hate piano mirror you know polish
finish on plastic well that out of the
way here is the device right here and as
you can see it looks a lot like a ps4 it
really does now you're not going to be
able to mount this flat if you wanted to
put it like on your desk or something it
has to go up right you can't even wall
mount it they I think they really
dropped the ball on that one wall
mounting this would have been a big deal
because it has to go upright anyway but
the reason why I has to go up right is
there's eight antennas in here giving a
you know obviously giving you
connectivity to the wide spectrum 2.4
gigahertz 800 megabit per second
connection and the 5 gigahertz wire
this AC 1733 megabit connection over the
five gigs which is a big deal and they
advertise this as being the world's
fastest 44 r8o 2.11 AC router I don't
know how long that's going to be true I
don't even have a way to test if that's
true but I can tell you right now that
they are advertising this as being
extremely fast and one of the reasons
why I'm doing this review is because I
plan on using this as you guys know as
part three of my wireless video that I
talked about here in the new house is
using this to extend my five gigahertz
coverage here in the house now 2.4
coverage here isn't too too bad does
drop off a bit towards the front of the
house because the router that have now
is all the way in the back of the house
but I plan on using this to try and get
good coverage downstairs on the 5
gigahertz spectrum I want to get 5
gigahertz coverage if I can because it's
so much faster than 2.4 now this is a
mu-mimo router which is a multi-user
multi-input multi-output and you've got
two USB 3.0 plugs right here on the back
which is going to allow you to hook up
wireless USB drives that you can have
movies on and music and stuff it access
over your entire network as well as two
IR transmit lenses right here on the
back which are going to allow you to use
the asrock app to learn the IR function
of your remotes and then your router
through the software can actually
control many of your devices like your
TVs and smart appliances and things from
anywhere within the network without even
being in line of sight of those products
as long as the router itself is in
line-of-sight unfortunately those are on
the back of the router so unless these
things are putting off a ton of
intensity on that IR spectrum and is
bouncing off all the walls to allow you
to connect your devices being on the
back might limit some of the
connectivity you have to the device or
the appliance that this thing is hoping
to control now on the top right here
you've also got held in there by a
magnet this they say that this is this
is a free like addition I think it's
part of the router obviously because
it's you know designed to sit right in
there
this is their wireless dongle and it has
two purposes one you can it's HDMI right
here on the end and on the other side
it's us micro USB for power as well as
rj45 Ethernet here this allows you to
connect this to any TV or us or HD
am i connected device plug-in power to
USB it includes a cable for that and
then you can easy cast whatever you are
displaying on your smart device like
your tablet or your smartphone onto the
HDMI input that this is connected to on
to your big-screen TV so you can be
playing mobile games and then have them
casted right on to the TV which is kind
of neat but from what I understand I
have actually tried this myself it I
want to I might do a separate video on
this for what I understand it's really
picky and finicky to set up which was
why I want to kind of do this in a
separate video rather than making this
one you know 20 minutes long or whatever
it might end up being but the dual
purpose of this too though is with the
rj45 on the back if you go to say a
hotel or something that doesn't have
wireless or maybe it has really spotty
Wireless but it does have access to RG
45 port I said something like I said RG
rj45 port you can plug this into the
access port for the hotel room or again
wherever you may be and then this
becomes a wireless access point itself
using the application from asrock you
can then use this as your wireless RUP
access and get online much easier that
way so it's kind of neat that they
include that want the test that out in
the future and see how well it works but
it is something that I wanted to mention
on the front of the router right here it
has one giant LED that changes color and
blinks in certain fashions to give you
different sorts of indication of the
status of the router that is a
disappointment to me because one of the
things I really like about the router
that I currently use is it's got an
array of LEDs and I can always see what
the different statuses are of whatever I
want I want of the status of the two
point four gigs Wireless the five gig
Wireless I want to the status of the
network the you know the intranet and I
want to know the status of the actual
internet connection it's all happening
independently so I can monitor all of
that not have to wait for a series of
flashes and functions and color changes
to try and figure out what's going on
and then look at the LEDs and try to
remember what yellow meant and what red
meant and have to look up the manual
it's much better to just have the LEDs
down the front with a label next to each
one and call it a day I get that they're
trying to make this minimalistic but I
think they really missed a mark on that
one okay so with that said I'm going to
go ahead and hook this thing up to my
internet Here I am going to set this up
as a wireless access point to my current
network by hooking an rj45 into the back
of one of the land ports and then we're
going to set this up as a like I said an
extender basically for my wireless and
see how well the actual wireless
strength on this thing works so what I'm
doing here right now is I've actually
just taken my router unplug my PC from
my working switch I have in this office
because I have more than one PC in here
so I needed a switch and I have my
computer connected to the router only
now I've logged into the router and I
have copied down all of the SSID
settings all of the security encryption
type the security password and all of
that stuff and move that over into the
wireless settings here on the asrock so
what that means that they are the same
on both my master and my slave routers
now the other thing you're going to have
to do is go in here and disable DHCP
because we don't want this router
handling DHCP we want that handed off to
the main router that way we have no
conflicts and we have one nice simple
gateway that's going to be handled for
everything so it's pretty easy to
actually set up that Wireless now one
way you can verify that the settings
have actually taken place and has worked
is you can look at the wireless SSA IDs
that are being broadcasted before you
start and you'll notice that on the ass
rock anyway it hasn't had an asrock 2.4
gigahertz wireless that was being
broadcasted and once I made these
changes that's gone that disappeared I'm
only seeing one SSID that matches the
one that I had already existing and have
now copied over to here now I can see
that I have an AZ rock 5 gigahertz band
that's showing so I need to do the same
thing for the 5 gigahertz and then
reboot the router once that's done what
we basically do is then put everything
back to the way I had it and then we can
start moving this router around the
house and seeing what's actually
happening here with our wireless
connection now the way that this is
going to work best is by having an
Ethernet plugged in to the wireless or
to the router that way this router
becomes a wired access point giving us
extended range on our wireless which is
the whole point of having a second
router or wireless router as an access
point now there's a lot of ways that we
could have done this I know I could have
found some you know POA or power over
ethernet you know access points that
literally just plug into the ethernet
and call it a day but I would have had
to purchase those and I already had
this so I'm making do with what I
already have plus I can see if all of
the five gigahertz strength at this
thing is advertising is all it's cracked
up to be so right now I've got the
asrock modem rebooting and there is no
more asrock wireless networks that are
showing up only the SSID is that I
already had set up now the idea here is
that by this being wired into the
Ethernet and having identical settings
to the master router here is it's going
to basically seamlessly handoff to
whichever router has the best signal as
you move around the house now the best
part of this being you know setup the
way it is is I can try different rooms
of the house that have Ethernet plugs
inside the rooms and see which is giving
me the best coverage now of course have
to make sure have power in there and an
Ethernet cable in my office right here
might be the best room so we're going to
be playing around with that and seeing
exactly how well that works out
now one last setting that you have to
make sure is correct on here is that the
default gateway or the IP address of the
router is actually on the same gateway
as the main router for instance as you
know most routers hat used 192.168.1.1
192.168.0.1 however asrock uses
192.168.0.1 so what I had to do is I had
to make sure this router was now on the
exact same IP address subnet as my main
router so now I've just given this thing
a static IP that is well outside of the
dhcp range that's been selected my
master router because we don't want to
get any sort of conflicts as wireless
devices connect and reconnect so that's
something you can find out in another
video maybe I'll do it show you guys how
to set up static IPS on your your you
know Internet connected devices in your
home so you stop getting connectivity
conflicts but anyway that's what we did
here we're rebooting now and now we're
ready now we're finally ready to
actually test this bad boy out now a lot
of folks said that they think that my
office right here being more centralized
in the house on the second floor would
be the best place to actually leave this
router so that's what I'm gonna do first
and now we are going to transition here
from the actual camcorder which I have
here on my DSLR set up by 70d we are now
going to switch over to vlogging style
and that was really dark right there my
bad
apparently I'm terrible at vlogging one
of the things I like about Wi-Fi
analyzer is the fact that it actually
lets you scan the networks based on MAC
address so I can tell which wireless 2.4
is the router inside there versus the
router inside the master bedroom so now
as we walk around in the upstairs you
can see we've pretty much got just the
needle is pegged that needle is
completely pegged so let's go ahead and
go downstairs and see what we got
so once again here's the asrock router
going right there and you can see that
again our needle is just absolutely well
we just moved into halfway the crane but
we're pretty much pegged through most of
what we're doing here now I'm going to
go to the other end of the house which
is where we typically had the worst
connection right now we're pretty much
exactly underneath the router and if you
can't tell yeah there you go we are
exactly underneath it and as I'm going
to the far extreme you guys remember I
was having some connection problems over
here in this part of the house and one
of the things I was thinking about doing
was I'm not trying to make you guys
dizzy by the way as I was thinking about
actually putting the router over here on
little J's computer desk right there on
top that way I had a router on both ends
of the house so let's go and do this
let's go ahead and do a speed test over
here in the extreme and we can compare
it to what we got on the other video
because we were barely getting what 9
megabit per second something like that
wasn't too good okay so here's the
Internet right here in my area and what
they want to point out earlier before I
did this I didn't have any 5 gigahertz
coverage whatsoever but as you can see
we've got full coverage and this focus
sucks on this ax 33 well we've got full
coverage right here at 5 gigahertz first
let's go and do the 2.4 gigahertz tests
let's do the speed test and let's see
exactly what we've got if you guys
remember last time we were all hitting
like 9 megabits per second but now look
by just having that router more in a
centralized location look at the better
connection that we have now so much
better than it was now we're going to go
ahead and test out the 5 gigahertz as
you can see the according to this we've
got pretty bad signal for 5 gigs which
actually isn't too bad because we didn't
have any connection here before what I
find kind of funny about
that is according to the iPhone we've
got strong coverage so let's go ahead
and see which one here is actually
telling the truth so let's go ahead and
test again that's in Los Angeles I don't
think it I think the first time I done a
vine but again I can't control the
server's here on the app but like that
obviously the five gigahertz is giving
us the speed we want so I'm going to say
that the radio on the Asus device here
just isn't as good when it comes to the
5 gigahertz compared to the iPhone but
look at that we are getting 66 megabits
per second and the full four point or
the full four up so that's actually as
fast as my isp can supply it if it's
only a sixty by four so as you can see
now we are actually getting the coverage
I wanted so I think that pretty much
settles it the router should probably
end up staying in the upstairs in my
office the only problem is I don't
really want it on that desk right there
so I have to figure out where I want to
put that but as you can see the five
gigahertz coverage right here in this
part of the house absolutely flawless so
at the end of the day the Azra gaming
g10 wireless router is delivering a very
strong signal which is exactly what I
was hoping for now what's funny about
this is it's only two walls between the
other router and here and then this
router has the whole floor to contend
with you know go through the floor and
multiple walls to get to where we just
were so this thing is actually putting
out a very strong signal and being right
here centralized in the house is
actually getting us pretty good
connection but what I notice is moving
around the house it does handoff
obviously which is what I wanted one of
the two routers to work in conjunction
with each other to give me the best
coverage I could possibly have anywhere
inside this house now there are a lot of
reviews out there that go much more
in-depth into the software coverage of
this router it's definitely worth taking
a look at I know a lot of gamers get
really upset when they feel like they're
branded too with the word gaming of
things that typically wouldn't be gaming
I think I think one comment I saw when I
showed this router was like what's next
gaming printers and say you know maybe
but tell me what you guys think about
this router as rocks stepping into the
router game so it's a only time will
tell if this is a space that's
worthwhile for them to be into it's a
very saturated space I mean you've got
at asu's that's doing it net gear
Linksys
there there are just so many brands out
there that are actually doing wireless
solutions now it's it's making me wonder
if the whole gaming branding of a router
really makes any sort of a difference
and we guys tell me what you think down
in the comments I'm going to ahead and
get on out of here I've got some cool
things coming up here I'm the gaming rig
the simulator is back in the house I
can't wait to start playing some more i
racing and project cars and stuff like
that but i'm gonna get out of here guys
thanks for watching today's video I know
it was a little bit like kind of kind of
chaotic and and sort of like pieced
together but it's the best I could
really do today anyway hope you guys
enjoyed as always we will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
