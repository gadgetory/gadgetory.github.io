meetings with AMD officially were
guarding their Xen to Architecture
running on seven nanometer FinFET well
AMD promised us that it was going to be
worth the wait that in q3 of this year
we would see amazing improvements over
the first generations in architecture
well did they deliver Coursera is proud
to present their new Hydra X line of
custom water cooling products the new XG
5 series radiators offer the perfect
balance of finden City and airflow to
keep your loop cool and quiet the x3 7
water blocks feature full coverage
cooling for GPU while also maintaining
an aesthetically pleasing design while
the XC 7 and XC 9 cpu blocks keep all
your modern cpus nice and cool to see
the complete lineup of high directs
cooling products from Corsair click the
link in the description below you know
it's funny when it comes to CPU reviews
there's lots of different ways you can
do this the problem with CPU reviews is
there is a million different ways that
you can use a CPU I mean we're talking
from basic internet browsing email
machines remember the eMachines back in
the day they called a machine because it
was super cheap and entry-level because
you could like go online and write email
right it didn't have to be powerful or
anything like that but as we've moved
forward we've started to see the
multi-threaded revolution where programs
are starting to use threads over just
IPC and core clock and all that sort of
stuff and now we see a huge benefit to
both multi-threading and hike or clocks
seeing 5 gigahertz now on CPUs
especially like the 9900 K is nothing
special in fact the fact that Intel even
came out with the 9900 KS
running at 5 gigahertz out of the boxes
it's just kind of dumb in my opinion
because I've yet to see a 9900 cade I
couldn't run if I get your Hertz out of
the box so it takes more to really sort
of WoW
I think the mainstream audience and
especially the enthusiast when it comes
to CPUs like I said there's there's live
streaming there's gaming there's
productivity there's work flow there's
photoshop there's editing there's so
many different things you could be doing
with your machine it's very very
difficult to find any sort of testing
methodology that's gonna sort of touch
on all of that so
today as we focused specifically on the
CPU let's gonna talk about our testbench
with this because we have multiple
motherboards that were sent for review
we're gonna be testing not only the
obviously the x5 70 which is the latest
PCI Express 4.0 compliant you know
utilizes all the features built in to
your CPU we tested with the G scale
royal trident z memory and and all these
great things we're gonna scale it back
as we go forward in these reviews we're
gonna go and test not such high-end
hardware with these CPUs to see how
performance scales but for today we used
the crosshair hero it's an X 570 we ran
16 gigabytes of Trenton's e memory the
royal gold it's just really pretty but
it's still trying to Z memory and then
we ran a 3900 X and a 3700 X versus kind
of a weird lineup I guess our 90 100 K
and our 8700 KS so ninth gen and 8th gen
the 9900 K is an 8 core 16 thread CPU
compared to our 3900 X which is a 12
core 24 thread CPU and we did that for a
couple of reasons one they're more
directly comparative in pricing if we
wanted to do core 4 core we'd have to
compare it to an HP DT processor which
is a high performance desktop and do
something like a 99 20x which is
significantly more expensive than the
400 $99 price point of the 3900 X now a
3700 X is being compared to well again
the minute 90 100 K and then 8700 really
the 8700 for us is just thrown out there
one because it's a six core 12 third
processor although this is an 8 core 16
thread processor core 4 core this more
directly compares to the 90 and 100 K
but then when you start comparing
pricing it doesn't really line up it's
significantly cheaper because remember
the 3900 X compares to the Intel's
pricing point so what we're seeing here
is more core count at a lesser price
nothing new though they did that with
Zen one the 1800 1800 X in the 1800
series or the thousand series and then
the 2000 series we saw the same thing
more cores for less money but what we
saw then was at IPC although extremely
close to Intel was still slightly behind
now the 1900 K wasn't out yet then that
the seventh gen processor and then the
8th gen processor and the ninth gen
processor so we saw slight IPC
improvements as time went from Intel
although not a lot but still there it
meant that the 1,800 X and that 1000
series then fell behind a little bit
more an IPC but still gave us a massive
improvement over FX which is something
that they had promised us and they
delivered on that well this time around
they're saying not only did we catch up
but we passed Intel now when you look at
the benchmarks it's one thing to keep in
mind here we ran the memory at 21 33
that is base clock for ddr4 now I know a
lot of you already are gonna be like
what the heck man you know Xen runs
better with fast memory and that's
because of the Infinity fabric and that
all that sort of stuff built into the
architecture with a and B but what we
tried to do here is give ourselves as
fair of a fight as possible we're going
to be addressing things like
overclocking memory and overclocking Xen
2 and a separate overclocking video to
see how that performance scales because
one thing we saw with first gen or a
thousand series in arisin was that
faster the memory the better now they're
running a whole new architecture I don't
know exactly how that's gonna hold up so
we want to do some more testing with
that and then we'll include that in our
overclocking guide for Xen 2 because
overclocking your memory is always a
part of what we're clocking your CPU so
that's why you're not going to see that
that's why you're seeing 2130 300
megahertz speeds we also ran everything
out of the box with the exception of one
test you're gonna see a Cinebench r15
result not our 20 our 15 because we've
got previous CPUs that have run it we
can kind of see where it stacks up but
because we want to get single core
performance to see how I pcs have really
held up and what we did was we locked
both of the CPUs well I'm pointing at
these two the 9900 K at 4 gigahertz
versus the 3900 X at 4 gigahertz and yes
we are well aware that that's gimping
the 9900 K but it's also gimping this
guy because it would run up to 4.6
gigahertz on single core so we just
wanted an arbitrary number that locked
them where we could get a comparison
there on IPC and remember whatever that
performance difference is as the clock
speed increase increases the IPC
difference and the score difference
would be approximately the same
percentage difference
if the 3900 X is beating it and then you
speed it up and the clock stay the same
the difference just it kind of does it
widens as it goes it's a percentage
Delta so that's how percentages work the
higher percentage no okay whatever
here are the church
when it comes to CPU usage you're gonna
see obviously there are some synthetic
benchmarks in there like Geekbench and
blender and Cinebench and stuff like
that those what they give us is a bit of
control because it's extremely
consistent between runs so what we're
looking for here is not so much what the
actual score was but with the difference
between the CPUs are because that gives
us a some sort of a metric to compare so
that's how you should be looking at that
the real world world tests gonna be
things like the premier export or the
warp stabilized and Gaming is something
where I'll talk about in a separate
video because this video could be an
hour and 45 minutes long easy if we
talked about everything a CPU can do and
how they compare so we just kind of kept
it as simple as possible here because
what we really want to do here right now
is we sort of want to do a checks and
balances when it comes to AMD's claims
on how these CPUs perform versus you
know the real-world experience and what
we're getting because as we always
preach take the actual marketing
material from any brand with a grain of
salt
because they're always gonna present the
best possible numbers because that's how
marketing works in fact gamers Nexus did
a great piece showing why you would
never use the slow setting on an OBS
livestream or capture or whatever
because it's just unrealistic and the
performance difference was really in
proportionate to the quality difference
in fact in a blind taste test as I
showed you could even tell the
difference between fastest and slow
versus the actual render quality it was
nothing more than a test to show that
the horsepower of the multi-threading of
the CPU and AMD slide was was very very
good it was Impractical to use that and
say that the 1900 was bad so that's the
kind of stuff we're looking for in these
types of tests we also did as you guys
saw a single-core IPC test using
cinnamon ar-15 and spoiler alert the
knight 3900 X which is the same
architecture it's in the 3700 X and all
that beat the 9900 Ches IPC so that is
HUGE because that is not something that
is necessarily promised to us but it's
something that we saw and in
multi-threaded performance it makes no
no surprise at the 39
hundred X is just running rings around
the no no no okay
because it has 24 threads versus sixteen
so that is where the CPU reviews start
to become difficult to kind of give us
direct comparisons is comparing it to
what so we chose price point and at the
$499 price point
give or take twenty or twenty or so
bucks depending on sales that's what the
1900 K costs and this was giving us
better results in single thread as well
as multi thread so when it comes to
premiere export we used a four and a
half minute 4k h.264 100 Mbps video that
we did has a full color grade on it plus
a small montage and we use the built-in
YouTube 1080p preset now you might be
asking yourself J why did you go from 4k
to 1080p footage like this and we're
changing its scale and using maximum
render we're putting max load on the CPU
so we want to see how the CPUs handle
that sort of rescaling and transcoding
so that we could see which did a better
job of if we went from 4k to 4k there's
a lot less load on the CPU we wanted the
CPU to really be taxed in this test it's
not a realistic thing for us to go from
4k to 1080p but that's besides the point
but that was maximum render quality
software encoding using the mercury
encoder and we are the mercury playback
engine no GPU on either the AMD or the
Intel and no I GPU on the Intel
whatsoever so this is just CPU cores
now the 900k took 22 minutes and 19
seconds whereas the 3900 X took 19
minutes and 56 seconds so it's kind of
interesting to see that they were fairly
close although this had many more course
a lot of that still comes to the fact
that the premiere software definitely
favors core clock as well as
multi-threaded so it's one of those
things that we're gonna look at is we
overclock this in the future to see if
we can get that number down and the gap
to be you know kind of reminiscent and
linear with the core count of the CPUs
but we know for a fact premiere loves
core clock and 4.8 ish on all cores on
the 900 K which is kind of where it goes
to by itself versus just over 4
gigahertz on all cores on the 39
X so the 900k was 800 ish megahertz
faster but still lost to this running
significantly slower but with more core
so that's something we're talking about
now if you've ever had to do any sort of
warp stabilized fixing or processing
inside a premier you know depending on
the length of the clip it could be
significantly taxing not only to your
system but time-consuming so the faster
that process can be done the better it
is for your real world scenario so the
99 100k performed that 10-second fork
h.264 100 Mbps video with no effects or
any of that we saw 2 minutes and 22
seconds to process a 10-second clip and
that's because warp stabilized is more
so a single-threaded function so it
doesn't completely tax your system you
can still do other background tests and
other things while that's happening so
this is more indicative of that single
core kind of an IPC thing where the 3900
X performed it in two minutes in 15
seconds so although faster once again
with a slower clock speed if we get the
clock speeds up on the 3900 X then we'll
see an improvement to that score as well
so something that's one of the reasons
why warp stabilizes is in this test is
because it's kind of indicative again of
that single-threaded performance now
let's go ahead and talk about Geekbench
again they use a single core and then
multi-core so in the multi-core the 3900
X just obliterated the 9900 Kay 31,000
667 for the Intel I nine part versus the
3900 X is forty-three thousand nine
hundred and sixty when it comes to the
blender BMV MW test the lower the number
the better the 900 can two hundred nine
seconds versus 153 seconds for the AMD
part what about the IPC comparison
directly well you guys saw in the charts
there we had a better IPC performance at
four gigahertz on the 3100 X versus the
9900 K so that tells us the amount of
work that that CPU is capable of doing
the amount of instructions per clock is
higher on this versus the Intel part so
that means that this whole time that
Intel has just kind of been sitting back
like yeah yeah okay whatever and AMD's
just kind of been spending the last few
years just refining refining refining
which is what they
promised the community they've actually
delivered on that promise okay but Jay
if I pcs better on the 3900 X Y is the
3700 X which is the same core count and
thread count as an N a 100k losing in
many of the tests well that comes all
the way down to clock speeds so that is
where AMD is still kind of lagging
behind Intel's the fact that Intel and
again we have not to overclock these we
have not done any overclocked testing so
we still have to spend time with that to
see how overclockable these are Intel a
still superior in the all core clock
speed they are allowing and I keep doing
this to think it's Intel but I'm in my
mind I've got Intel and AMD here sorry
until doesn't give us retail boxes we
don't have one I can put a cardboard box
here that's kind of what they send them
to us in but actually that's what they
send the CPUs to I said they don't even
care enough for the reviewers to
actually give us pretty boxes so that's
their there's Intel well one could argue
that the 3700 X price point of 329
dollars being only a handful of
percentage points behind the 9900 case
400 and what 84 dollars is the best
price we could find it for in amazon 480
$4.99 that is a 150 dollar price
difference between the two so I'm the
kind of shopper that would go well if I
can get basically all the performance
from then in 100k as soon as I turn up
the dial on this a little bit with
overclocking you know me and have a
hundred and fifty bucks to now put
towards a better GPU or more RAM or heck
more storage or pay for a part entirely
like my case that's the better buy and I
am confident that as soon as we start
overclocking these CPUs that we are
going to see them catch and exceed than
9900 K but none in 100 KS fairly high
strung as it is out of the box because
it'll go for 8 for 9 all cores but going
above 5 1 is difficult you can get 5 1 5
2 on water once you start chilling it
but day to day you're going to be
pushing enough voltage in that to where
you're gonna be degrading your CPU over
time and I would not trust running and
then I drew K at 5.2 every single day in
fact getting above 5 2 was very
difficult when we were doing our
overclocked testing on that 5 gigahertz
is easy v 1.is depending on your lottery
in 5 to
above is just so you don't have a lot of
room to play with on a 90 100 K so if a
9900 is already showing basically all of
its potential and this is only a couple
of percent behind it and more even
multi-threaded performance and we still
have a lot of overclocking Headroom into
this or on this then that makes this
obviously the better buy but what AMD
has done here it's delivered on the IPC
promise it has delivered on the
multi-threaded promise and now that we
know that things like games and your
productivity programs are certainly
leveraging multi-threading or multi-core
you know availability then that only
makes this the better buy now where the
real story is on this and I really can't
wait to get my hands on this are the r5
and r3 models because the r3 model
coming later
we know that the 3400 G and the 3200 G
are still gonna be using Vega part but
you know as well as I do as soon as
those parts get refreshed probably later
on this year and this is all
hypothetical I have no information right
here is that it's going to be utilizing
the new Radeon 5700 XT architectures or
whatever they're calling it Navi is
gonna be using the new navigator
textures and that making that a
significant budget system when it comes
to performance you're gonna get amazing
performance out of it without even had
to buy GPU because that's exactly what
the Omega part did for the 2420 200g but
J what if I've already got like a be 350
motherboard or a next 370 I mean back
when first Rison came out well
AMD made a promise that that was gonna
be a five year socket the best socket
would be completely usable and valid for
five years Allah Intel likes to change
the socket up just by a couple of pins
sometimes so that you have to buy a new
motherboard for a new CPU or the
architecture demanded a different pin
count which means you need a different
motherboard no backwards compatibility
we saw a couple generations where you
could use the new CPU with an old one
but you lost various functionality the
AMD Zen 2 architecture is backwards
compatible all the way back to first gen
Rison so you could be using your X 370
or your be 350 motherboard and you can
still use the modern CPUs and they will
work just fine with nothing more than a
BIOS update
the only thing you're gonna give up
quite honestly and I asked AMD this
point-blank in our meeting what do you
lose all you lose is that PCI you four
we already know that PCI 3 is not being
saturated by graphics cards yet so we
know it's not necessarily for PCI you
for although the new Radeon stuff does a
PCI you've already unless you're using
crazy fast storage drives using PCI
Express that's probably a feature that
you're not gonna care about buying a new
motherboard for so unless you care about
any of that sort of stuff you could take
a new Zen to CPU and plop it in your old
motherboard with a BIOS update update it
first before you get the new CPU so
you're not swatching swapping your CPU
twice to do it it's completely backwards
compatible with motherboards so AMD has
promised us forward support with the CPU
socket IPC improvements and bringing the
fight back to the consumer the
mainstream and enthusiast CPU market
well I feel like AMD has delivered on
all three of those this is simply a case
of not being enough competition in the
market and became complacent and didn't
really feel the need to innovate
well you don't innovate you stagnate and
that's exactly what's happened to Intel
although Intel is still a great
performing cpu it costs more and gives
you nothing extra for it so this is
where you guys sound off in the comments
below
did intel fall behind or did AMD promise
and over deliver I kind of feel inclined
to say that they kept all their promises
but sort of kept it quiet about how far
they've really come so that we would all
go holy crap rather than potentially
over promise and under deliver this is
kind of the opposite so you guys sound
off in the comments below
coming forward on this channel there's a
lot of discussion to happen here we're
gonna talk about backwards compatibility
of those motherboards which I just
mentioned we're gonna do testing and
compare it to these results to see if
you truly lose anything we're also going
to be doing a complete overclocking
guide for Zen 2 and we're also going to
be doing I don't think I'll do any crazy
custom cooling but we're gonna be just
testing obviously gaming performance and
that sort of stuff because I know
someone's already typed it and if it's
you okay fine you've already typed it
yeah but Intel so much better at gaming
well that was because Intel was superior
in IPC
so as long as we get the clock speeds up
where we want them or even with current
based clock speeds I don't think that's
necessarily true anymore we got to do a
video to prove it all right guys thanks
for watching and as always we'll see you
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
