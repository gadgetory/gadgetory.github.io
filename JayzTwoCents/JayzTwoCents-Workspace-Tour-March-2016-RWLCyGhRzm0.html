gonna take you on a little
behind-the-scenes tour since that seems
to kind of be the thing everyone's doing
now so of course I want to follow suit
and copy I'm gonna take you on a little
behind-the-scenes tour of a lot of the
tech that I use on my daily basis here
in my house not only in my personal life
but also unrunnable that would be
interesting right okay so we're gonna
start off today in a space that you guys
saw in the previous video I did showing
the house but this would be remember was
just full of stuff stacked up but anyway
this is a built in desk that was
actually built in with the house so I
was thinking what am I gonna do with
this thing so I got to thinking kind of
like how hotels do they have their
little business center tech center it's
almost like a little cubby that you
could just go to and do your printing
and you know if you need to print
airline tickets or whatever I wanted to
make a space here where little Jake can
do homework the wife can have her laptop
set up now this is really the new like
star of this area here and this is the
HP laserjet m4 77 it is an extremely
powerful and flexible printer solution
that I'm using here HP a messy part of
their campaign here which is a reinvent
the office and I think youtubers have
kind of done that right we've turned our
our passions into a business and our
offices are very unconventional so
that's why you know I know what to call
it I don't really I don't really have an
office and I really have a studio I
really just turn regular areas into
workspaces but because of that I need a
printer that can actually do
full-fledged business needs so it's not
just a printer it's also a scanner a fax
machine a laser jet so it's it prints
very very fast especially right now
during tax season I have got hundreds of
receipts and documents invoices
statements that I've got to scan and get
over to my tax people which are not
local and I actually had a very I was
having a hard time trying to figure out
how I was gonna get this stuff all over
to them especially if you go to
someplace and pay to have all that stuff
scan it's very expensive so HP
approached me about doing the review on
this I'm like heck yes I need this for
my business so this is one of the
reasons why we'll be doing a review on
this now if that seems kind of weird to
you guys like really you're gonna be
doing a business printer review remember
guys I worked in IT for nearly a decade
this is stuff I had to deal with on a
regular basis and I didn't have a
printer here because home grade or you
know personal use grade printers just
don't fulfill the need that I have as a
business so we'll be doing this review
here soon up here in the walls we've got
some stuff we put up here for Little J
getting 100's on her tests Booya so
anyway this is a place that we she's
always liking to hang her artwork and
stuff but we have a stainless steel
appliance that you know magnets don't
stick to so she can come here and just
kind of put her own thing up on there
and then she can yeah she can hang up
her own working stuff a chore board here
that we've got for her she's really keen
on trying to earn money so this is her
chore board where she could earn her
allowance and stuff and then over here
we are going to be plugging in our
tablets and things this is my ax 33 Sony
camera it's actually a 4k camera it's a
very nice camera really like that it's
like that's why I did my vlogs with in
Seattle but I need to either build or
come up with a place to dock all of
these tablets and phones because we have
quite a few so I want a place where the
cables can be nice and tidy without
being all over the house so that's what
I'm gonna be doing here I just got to
figure something out if you guys know
something I can use link me to it on
Twitter or put it in the comments or
something I need something for right
here and then of course we have my shop
in my inventory which you guys have
already seen this is where I'm gonna be
doing all of my builds it's we're gonna
be doing all of my testing of hardware
and stuff this is the test bench that I
just set back up if you guys hear lawn
mowers I apologize all of the neighbors
seem to have different gardeners that
all come on different days
therefore there are lawn mowers running
every freaking day in this neighborhood
and it is super annoying anyway here's I
move the stack of stuff that was over
here to over there and the reason for
that was the plug and then there's the
powerline adapter which you guys saw the
review on is right there
so I had to move the desk closer to that
wall that way I could actually get
everything to reach on the shelves over
here the two lower shelves the black
ones on the right these are this is all
my water cooling stuff so I can do all
my water cooling builds I actually
bought some stuff to organize all the
fittings that way I can find them a lot
easier
and then everything here is pretty much
organized based on the type of stuff
that it is we've got headphones and
headsets up top AMD graphics cards
Nvidia graphics cards motherboards power
supplies coolers microphones and hard
drives this power supply is actually
slated for a build for read missus
getting an update the master master
error maker eight guide to review on
that still keyboards it's more
miscellaneous stuff and then extension
of headphones and some tight mixes and
stuff but anyway that's that the office
used to be my YouTube studio slash
office slash builder space which really
kind of sucked because it was an 8 by 10
room that literally had very little room
to do anything if I had to build a
system it made a huge mess it kept me
from getting work done it just was
frustrating and recently I moved and
that's not the case anymore so I've kind
of got a few different places here that
I actually do all of my work so we're
gonna start here with the office which
I've clearly recorded some videos in but
it also doubles is where I get all my
business done now I get asked all the
time about my desks this is an Ikea
Galant system the reason why I call it
system is because as you can see by the
seams in the desk
they are modular and that means that you
can expand it you can shrink it same
thing with this desk over here it's
another piece of the Galant system if I
wanted I could have technically attached
it you know to the end right there and
it could have blocked the doors
unfortunately IKEA discontinued this
desk and they replace it with something
called the Becket which is not modular
like this because it's very angular and
it does not have the extensions on there
but taking a look underneath the desk
you can get a pretty good idea of what I
mean by it being modular because you
literally bolt on these extension frames
here put a new top on there screw it
down and then there it is all my cable
management's being pretty much handled
by these under trays which are also part
of the Galant system at IKEA
unfortunately I believe that they've
discontinued those as well which is
really disappointing another thing I get
asked about a lot is my chair this is a
dxracer iron series chair it's designed
for dudes that are up till oh I believe
350 pounds I'm currently 240 pounds so
this is you know obviously a bit heavier
duty than I would need
but I used to have the Kings series
chair which was made for really big
dudes and since I lost all my weight I
don't need that big of a chair anymore
so I've got this very form-fitting very
comfortable chair from dxracer you guys
seen a lot of my videos I literally just
love this chair upstairs here I've got
another Wireless this is my asrock g10 I
just recently did a video on that for
the audio I'm still using the monoprice
large diaphragm condenser mic it looks
nice it's got a built-in shock mount
it's XLR haven't been having too many
issues with it I'm having some issues
with my audio though but I believe it's
the cable because I cheaped out on like
a $8 cable so that's probably going to
be the issue it's hooked up to a hile PL
2 T arm
it's a terrible arm by the way I don't
recommend this arm it's extremely
overpriced and it costs way too much for
the quality of it it's also not very
long so it doesn't reach out very far I
mean yeah you can see it reached out you
know all the way to to there but the
problem is it's just it it's just not
good for its price that's the only way I
can really explain it it's kind of
squeaky it makes a lot of springy noise
and it just I don't know I got it
because it was designed to hold a lot of
weight and at the time I had a blue Yeti
attached to it which is pretty heavy my
audio setup for Tech Talk is the same as
it's always been this is the alesis
multi mix 4 it is a very inexpensive
like 40 but $45 sound board or mixer
board here I've got one mic hooked up to
it it's also got its audio output which
is my headphones too so I can monitor
what's happening everything with the
audio of the mic as well as the stream
and it's a USB output so it's connecting
to the PC via USB interface so it's also
a sound card which means if i plug in my
headphones then i get all the system
sounds and gaming sounds to so that's
pretty neat of course little Jay thinks
I'm number one dad so I've got that on
the desk when it comes to monitor I am
using the predator x 34 mounted on a
rose wheel arm back there as you can see
I don't like having desk Stan our
monitor stands like better on the desk
so I always use an arm as you can see
right there
technically it was a to monitor arm that
I took off one of the arms and made it a
single monitor for keyboard I'm using
the Corsair k70 RGB I've had this
keyboard for a while and for a bit I was
using the g.skill RGB that's just
because I was trying it out and
unfortunately I'm getting tired of all
the flickering on camera with the other
keyboard as you can see with this one
there is a very little flickering if any
at all
now you guys say what the flickering I
can change you know get rid of that with
the frame rate of the camera
unfortunately I've played around with my
Canon here a ton to try and get rid of
the flickering with the g.skill it just
doesn't go away no matter what I put the
FPS at this is still by far my favorite
Mouse of all time this is the CM storm
Reaper Mouse unfortunately they do not
make us anymore I don't know why they
stopped it was part of their aluminum
series where it has this removable
aluminum top here you could paint it
Anna dies it do whatever you wanted to
customize it I don't know why they ever
stopped you know producing that but they
did this is my horas gaming Matt it is
the extra log version so you can see
it's actually kind of dirty but what I
like about this is it is made out of a
material that you can seriously just wet
and wipe down and all these fingerprints
and stuff come off so it's really really
nice where it starts to look kind of
grimy like this you can literally just
clean it I love that now a lot of people
have gotten mad at my cables here the
problem is I like to kind of kick back
with my feet up when I'm editing and
stuff if I if I put a hole back there
for them to go through then there's not
enough slack for me to put the keyboard
on my lap if I'm sitting back it also
not enough slack for the mouse to make
it all the way to the computer tower
which is all the way over here so that's
why I've got it like that if you guys
know of any wireless gaming stuff that
has very little to no lag on keyboard
and mouse I might consider it so put it
in the comments down below if you think
there's something I should check out
I'll gladly buy it and I don't even want
to receive it for review I want to go
buy it I don't want to try it out to see
exactly how well it performs because for
gaming you know lag sucks all right this
is skunk works this is my main system
and it's kind of the staple of the
channel it's gone through many different
iterations right now it's three Titan
X's water cooled on a gigabyte X 99sec
SOC champion it's got a 50
60 X until extreme CPU overclocked it's
got 32 gigs of corsair dominator ddr4 of
course it's got a 560 read a 280 read of
480 rad fans everywhere water-cooled
galore everyone loves the water cooling
it's what I do hey you can see me in the
reflection right there so yeah if you've
never seen this PC you definitely must
be new to the channel but that's ok we
we welcome you here now the lighting
that you see on my desk right now is
nothing more than LED strips that are
stuck on literally on the edge right
there they are
RGB so you can change the colors they
are preset colors though you can't like
you know you can't do fade and stuff
like that so here's yellow you know we
got some blue we got some pink we got
some white green so we got all kinds of
stuff there yeah I'm really happy with
this and I like that I can change the
color based on my mood it's like I'm in
a bad mood I don't want to be conforming
to society know I'm red you could be
like oh I'm happy now we're go with blue
blues happy this is my main tripod right
here with my battery adapter for my
camera which is a Canon 70d I'll show
you that in a bit
I kind of cheaped out on it it's an IR
any image I've got it from Sammy's
camera it's a pretty good pretty steady
camera tripod I mean but it's doesn't
have the smoothest a panhead on there
even though it is fluid so I want to get
a better like a Manfrotto or something
like that but it is what I use for most
of my shots when I'm using you know a
static camera so I'm still putting this
area together here this is pretty much
it's gonna be the guest PC slash backup
PC if skunkworks goes down or something
this is my 6700 K build I did in that
NZXT s 240 it's got the z170 in there
for the wind from EVGA 6700 K and all
that stuff here's the G scale keyboard
that I got moved over here from the main
rig and then this is also the g.skill
RGB Gaming Mouse right here this thing's
pretty cool actually it's it's an
ambidextrous Mouse so it's got equal
buttons on both sides and these little
parts right here literally just stick on
this is hard with one hand they stick on
with magnet power so you can set this up
for comfort it comes with a bunch of
different
pieces here that you can use so you can
make it truly ambidextrous I've got this
set up how I want it it's fully
adjustable it's a it's a pretty neat
thing might actually do a review on this
so these are the soft boxes that I use
they're not very expensive in fact
they're quite unstable they're always
wanting to fall over on me but I cheaped
out on these from Amazon I want to
replace these with some good LED light
panels so if you guys know of any good
video production LED panels let me know
but there are six lamps per each as one
in the middle and two on the top two on
the bottom it gets really hot using
these they are I believe 32 watt LEDs in
there they're very very very hot when
all ten of these or twelve of these are
turned on but anyway that's what I use
when I do my lighting and stuff inside
the closet here not much to show
quite honestly we've got some radiators
and stuff there the g10 box some other
things chilling in here so there's not a
whole lot to see yeah I've got my xbox
360 down there
what what what about it but this is
quite honestly one of my favorite pieces
of tech that I've got right now and this
is the racing simulator as you guys have
seen me talk about and tease and and
really just wear the heck out when it
came to any excitement over this thing I
know you guys are like okay are you
going to race me assume I just don't
care anymore well I care and that's the
whole point of this video but it's the
art racing cockpit from GT Omega you
guys can check the link in the
description or just search my channel
for GT Omega and you guys can find you
can save 5% using my discount code which
I believe is Jay's 2k14 yeah we need to
update that anyway this is the rig that
you guys just saw me build or put back
together the other night with coconut
monkey obviously I've got my Audio
Technica headphones hooked up to it
Logitech g27 steering wheel and pedals I
need something better I really really do
and then I've got three Acer 1080p 60
Hertz panels nothing and entirely too
incredible there no no g-sync nothing
insane but yeah that thing is so much
fun I loved it last night instead of
going to bed I actually sat here in and
raced at Willow Springs for a bit my
local track anyway guys that's just kind
of it a quick tour of the tech that I
used and I just realized I forgot to
talk about the camera I'm actually using
here this is my Canon 70d and it's got a
17 by 55 ultrasonic lens on there
just perfect for video it's an F 2.8 all
the way through so when i zoom in or
zoom out there's not going to be any
darkening of the image so I'm pretty
much a homebrew mount that I made or an
actual rig that I made so I've got my D
focus follow focus on there and I'm
using my Sennheiser wireless mic setup
so if you guys are interested in any of
that stuff just hit me up also you can
do a search my channel for camera and
you'll see the stuff that I've been
using when it comes to the camera hey
guys thanks for watching hope you've
enjoyed this tour I know it's not all
like teen crispy and stuff like that
with like gorgeous b-roll and whatnot
but hey this is my style and it was kind
of like we were walking around together
taking a look at all of this stuff
around here anyway guys thanks for
watching we'll see you in the next video
and if you guys have any video
suggestions remember you know what to do
hit me up let me know and maybe I'll
touch on it alright guys see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
