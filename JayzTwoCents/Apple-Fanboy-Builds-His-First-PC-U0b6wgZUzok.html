I am joined by Jonathan from slick reps
if you guys can see we have a bunch of
computer parts here we're gonna be
building a computer today you guys
remember the case rap I showed a while
back where it was wrapped by slip grabs
well that's Jonathan's company here and
he admits that he is a matte guy he has
never built a PC he's never done
anything like this so why are we
building a PC now so my video ographers
back in stock wraps absolutely hate
working iMac just not enough power so
were you forcing them to use Mac because
that's what you already had yeah and we
were just used to the ecosystem we burn
man usually the editors want Mac yeah
and we shoot 6k raw footage from a red
okay and the iMac Pro just can't handle
it all right so you already are saying
that pcs better thank you I hear that
but we got a whole bunch of parts right
here we're gonna be using but we're
missing a case though and we're gonna do
that case how are you always just like
it is the fractal design define r6 you
can buy new egg other places as well
it's incredibly awesome Jay's done a few
builds with it and then you know
whenever you want to come back in here
professional youtuber who's prepared
with the case do you want to be cooler
you want to be more desirable well
you're in luck because right now you can
own your very own Jay's to send swag and
immediately be the cool kid on the block
max out your sex appeal by following the
link down below so we don't want another
Virg type situation right here so I'm
going to just sort of guide you and I'm
gonna let you do all of this it's great
so a couple of tools we need we don't
need tweezers okay we do just have my
multi fitting screwdriver there side
cutters for when we use of ties and
stuff and
it's gonna be pretty much it I guess a
knife to cut open the boxes and we'll
start with the motherboard the CPU and
the memory great that's the motherboard
it's cool Daniel you don't need manuals
around here so this is an anti-static
bag it keeps it from getting shocked and
translator when it's being stored so but
before we go handling it you probably
should have an anti-static or strapped
dude I got you leave this cover on
though because you don't want to mess
that up I've got no reason to reapply it
if you don't have to sure some
publications might have you think you
need to put thermal paste on this
thermal paste but that's not so you just
run it up here yeah or you can write it
as a motor coming through the little
grommet yeah so like a handy handy
feature so basically can like right
okay so it works obviously it booted
Jonathan's first time ever building a PC
so alright I may ask what was the
hardest part in your pan you know the
cable management you know it's it can
get a little frustrating just because
you want it to be perfect even though
you can't see it yeah it turned out
great but yeah just making sure that all
the cables come together zip tie
whatever you know it's a little
frustrating well yeah I mean Jonathan
admitted to me what we were doing this
that you know part of the the Apple
lustre or whatever the part that draws
you to devices and stuff obviously slick
wraps is all about making a device look
good and kind of being a personal
extension of yourself is the fact that
you are into ascetics yes that it's are
a big deal so that's why we went the
vertical mount that's why I specifically
requested or recommended this
motherboard because it's got all the X
299 features obviously the RGB you can
leave this on the rainbow mode if you
want or you can go in there change it to
anything you want but the fact is that
you can make this bill totally yours
you're planning on wrapping this aren't
you yeah so we actually make a r6 wrap
and available now isn't it yeah and we
completely changed the look of this so
yeah we're gonna put a wrap on it maybe
our new green shade here but yeah we're
gonna wrap it as soon as we can get it
back to the office what was the was your
favorite part of the bill you know just
seeing it all come together you know
when we first put the motherboard in it
just kind of all made sense you know you
can start seeing where the pieces go and
understand and then obviously when we
started it up yeah it just is it's
amazing looking just really cool a
showpiece you got more comfortable as
time went on like in the beginning I
could tell you were very kind of nervous
handling the first job but then you sort
of realized maybe by me throwing your
motherboard around and the fact that you
can see that it works I mean this is
probably freaking some people
chat right now perch at the videos
whatever yeah maybe that puts you at
ease a little bit we planned this
several weeks in advance do you guys
seen this video so is there anything
that give you anxiety leading up to this
about being nervous wedding photos just
because like I've been with Mac for 15
years I've never owned a PC and I'm just
not being familiar obviously seem like a
typical Mac user knowing nothing about
pcs yeah and not knowing really what the
components do and what the importance of
the components are this is a really I
wake inner because from putting this
together I'd learned you know what the
importance of you know each component
how they work together and yeah so it's
something that I definitely value and
now I know how to build a PC and
serviceability - you're right you need
to change up that graphics card add more
hard drive space with Java how to do
that I had a swap-out Ram you know just
tons a room in this case so what's
awesome about the case is that it has
tons of expand ability and I can take
all the panels off being a novice it was
really important for me to be able to
get to every single piece of the
motherboard or putting plugging cables
in this case does support a front mount
30 ml rat with 25 millimeter thick fans
and still can support all of the hard
drive cages so that's one of the reasons
why we chose the r6 as well is if you do
want to expand storage on this local
machine later you can do that or your
editor whoever's gonna have this machine
yeah yeah this thing is awesome I mean
there's tons of expandability obviously
aesthetics it's amazing
the case is very like simplified but yet
you have all the lights and all the
different components and it just works
really well together and I'm glad we
didn't do our DB strips or anything
because I think there's just enough
ambient lighting I think it's perfect
for the office space and where we're
gonna be putting it for my video
ographers I think it's it's subtle
well I've said before and I'll say it
again the best editing machines are
powerful gaming rigs so you have to
definitely keep an eye on your editors
and and I guarantee there'd be playing
some games of this at some point so so
now we've seen the birth of a new PC
gamer because what's gaming like on Mac
none exists exactly that's why to hear
you say it
alright guys we're gonna go out here
guys go and check out slip wraps we put
a link to them down the scription below
of course for actual design and EVGA for
supporting this bill by sending us
obviously the cooler the
the motherboard the power supply and the
graphics card of course which is a huge
support on this project so Jonathan
welcome to the PC race and I guess a
master race I'm just at a PC race happen
because everyone is uh everyone's a
master
whatever that means so alright guys
thanks for watching as always we'll see
you in the next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
