the one to give you your breakout run
Jim right there what's up guys Jase two
cents here coming at you with a little
bit of an unboxing here of the Logitech
c920 brand-new webcam I bought because
my HD life cam from Microsoft blows and
if you've been watching tech addiction
you know that Microsoft is spying on me
while spying on other people I guess I
don't know I don't want them watching me
through that so I went ahead picked up
this brand-new Logitech c920 and
apparently I can't focus all of a sudden
I have like Parkinson's disease of the
focus ring I guess there we go so right
off the bat where I take a look at the
back of the box here I don't really like
doing unboxing so we'll make this very
quick and painless you can use it in
Skype it is a 1080p camera my last
camera was a 720p it will give you it
will cause you to have a very happy
families as you can see these people are
very happy but why is this family
talking to this like creeper guy right
here I don't get this okay so you have
to talk to strangers on the internet
with this camera apparently and you have
to put vegetables in your eyes so
there's the camera right there it's kind
of neat looking here's the back of the
box it's got a whole bunch of stuff that
nobody ever reads on the side of the box
here it says c920 I can't focus oh my
god worse unboxing ever there we go see
full 1080p video recording 720p video
coleen h.264 compliant it's got a carl
zeiss
zeus lens whatever in at 20 step
autofocus and automatic low-light
correction and it does have USB 3.0
which i think is amazing with an LED LED
um icing led for a tripod ready
Universal clip that fits under laptop
and CRT monitors who has a CRT monitor
anymore
these days anyway I was gonna go ahead
and bust this thing out of the box but
Lucas you can see it so there you go in
boxed in boxed unboxed and it's in my
inbox too in all seriousness guys I
swear to god there was absolutely
nothing to unbox with this right I mean
if you don't believe me there's nothing
in here
there's the camera which comes out with
the court attached to it and then who
reads this nobody reads the manual
what I want to go ahead and do now is I
want to compare this with my Microsoft
LifeCam HD to this brand-new logitech
c910 right 9920 oh my god I don't even
know what I'm doing I need to know what
I'm using
Logitech c920 and so what we're gonna do
right now is we are going to go ahead
and reveal what you're currently
watching right now is the Microsoft but
when you go ahead and now switch it over
through the magic of editing to the
Logitech look at how much better this is
it is incredibly better it is sharper it
it's smoother that's not so fuzzy at all
and when you put the two side-by-side it
just absolutely blows me away at how
much better it is than the Microsoft
LifeCam and I'm gonna go ahead now and
put up the price for each of these
webcams I'm gonna go ahead and let the
picture speak for itself because I think
that you can't go wrong with this
Logitech c920 if you can get it for the
price that I did I got this on sale at
Best Buy
it's normally 99 bucks it was on sale
last week for 79 and then I waited and
when I went online and looked the other
day it was 4 on sale for $69 so I just
couldn't pass it up so here you go this
has been a review of the Logitech c920
it comes with some really great software
involved as lots of controls it's got
you know a lot of easy integration when
it comes to your various you know VoIP
in social media you can integrate videos
into Facebook and YouTube and Skype and
it's just really really easy to leap to
use I swear to god it was as
plug-and-play as it can possibly be I do
think it's very important to point out
though that the audio quality of the
microphone
completely blows if you're doing
commentaries or you're doing something
where you can use this webcam and audio
you're gonna want to use some sort of an
external mic you know I've got my Yeti
you know the Yeti is probably a little
bit extreme for a lot of people but you
know you're no one use it maybe a
headset mic or even just a cheap USB
just mic or something because you're not
gonna want to use the audio on this
it's very base it's very echoey and it's
just 100% do not recommend using the
microphone on this thing it absolutely
blows hope you guys have enjoyed this
review and over on my second channel I'm
starting a project 365 when it comes to
vlogs I'm trying to do a vlog a day and
you can go ahead and click right about
there and that will take you over to my
second channel where you can check out
some of my vlogs and just random things
that don't necessarily pertain to
technology but things that I wanted to
bring to my audience because I'm
starting to gain a relationship with you
guys and I hope that you guys will go
and check that out but in the meantime
make sure you subscribe to both channels
make sure you subscribe to Jays two
cents and stick around for more
unboxings reviews random
cellphones flames games all sorts of
crazy stuff on J students and above all
have a Happy New Year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
