waiting on you sir
done with this do it hey hey I can
actually see the comet and CEO YouTube
like revamped its whole live-streaming
thing I can actually see the comments
from the life control room now that's
cool so I don't have to try a faster and
easier way to stream it's fancy I like
foreign watcher thing I like faster and
easier ways to stream yeah I also like
that they do that podcast thing where
you know when the streams about to start
it's not just a countdown anymore it
looks like a legitimate broadcast like
waiting thingamajigger yeah because I
loved how in the past it was always like
hey guys when did the livestream start
and there's like a big-ass counter
counting down in the middle of screen if
there was a gonna start
so this Slee Tech Talk 88 let me see oh
the title I like that by now we really
have no idea what's going on I that's
that's probably the most accurate title
who used it it only took us 88 shows to
figure it out about about about 60 of
those were with you so yeah we should
probably be clear though the in this
episode we do actually have a document
that was hastily created in the last 20
minutes by me so hey Jerry did agree
about five hours ago to do the doc for
me she brought more than that and then
15 minutes for the show he's like oh
fuck doc yeah that's right I'll be right
back
I was like squirrels so ya know a baby I
still hammered out like three pages in
20 minutes that's not I'm not I'm
actually wait no shit five pages so so
I'm getting ready to pull the the whole
the whole anchorman thing where I have
no idea what I'm reading or talking
about and you can just be like jay is a
big fuckface
and smells like poo and I'd be like you
know that speaking sorry that Jay is a
big fuckface it smells like poo wait a
minute because I have at least 15
minutes experience with all these these
topics that I've typed down oh whether
you're an expert by the YouTube
standards so do we did we have a rolled
intro yeah halfway note we're rolling it
right now what welcome to tick-tock
number 88 by now we really have no
fucking idea what's going on but there
will be text tonight so enjoy I can't
see you because you added the f-word in
there which means it made maids it which
maids it 10% different than the original
there for copywriting
oh shit flick row and we already got
eight down votes which is awesome that
is things that guy is that it appreciate
so much well you know it's not the end
of the show by the end I'm thinking we
might hit a hundred but if we if we only
hit a hundred we're doing good examine
your heard on the internet hate is the
new love that's what it is a hate is the
new light is it should we just should we
just skip a few topics and start on that
one yeah might as well just segue right
into the elephant in the room and that's
uh that that's our favorite Canadian if
she Canadian she is and that is even
worse no no this is hilarious because I
was just thinking about this this
morning I was like I can't think of like
mean Canadians Canada is like the nicest
nation on earth it's like the one
country that nobody wants to bomb or do
anything to like Canada can defend
themselves with like a Cessna a
nine-millimeter panda is the new
Switzerland there they are they
basically are like Switzerland is jelly
of Canada and here you have only had
only hamburgers don't cost $45 this is
sherlynda
this is true I heard about that from
Logan he was bitching about hey I
remember we were eating when we were in
Seattle and the burger is like 12 bucks
he's like man only 12 bucks just like
the cheapest burger ever like what the
fuck is Logan lobe he's like we don't
even know Oh anyways uh we're gonna keep
the topic of Nicole Arbour kind of brief
targeted her and then we're gonna talk
about the real issue behind everything
that's going on and that's that's
censorship in a bullying oh I was gonna
say blonde hair dye and silicone blonde
hair dye and silicone works too I mean
it ends is the same here no anyways you
have Nicole Arbour basically she's you
know this Canadian blonde not
unattractive woman who is she fancies
herself a pony
I like how you worded that without dirt
like that lamenting I go I know right I
guess we're going because if we're going
based on personality she is pretty damn
Cryptkeeper ish oh she is she's
definitely the Skeletor and in that
arena like as soon as she opens her
mouth you're like oh man any any
redeeming qualities there out the window
but anyways she's always been a shock
type comedian if you go back and watch
some of her old videos which I highly
recommend you don't because you'll
probably
just like want to cut yourself but but
but she was never funny shocked comedian
likes a Seth Rogen no no no that that
was the big difference is you could tell
that she was just trying to be funny by
being offensive mm-hmm like that that's
the difference is there's a difference
like when you go to like Richard Pryor
and I was that like louis c.k and stuff
like that there's there's it's its
strategic you like I can listen adored
Ricky Gervais s talk about fat people
for 15 minutes and I find it quite
hilarious because one he was a fat
person himself yeah at one point in time
so he can relate and the other thing is
is he's self-deprecating to a certain
point where it kind of rounds it out you
can tell that it's a very jovial nature
and when you have her saying it it
literally comes off as hatred yeah
that's what I was just about to say was
it's one of those things where you know
can can fat people make fun of fat
people and get away with it
yeah I'm sorry she was cutting out here
Jay I used to make fun of heavyset
people really heavy yeah your skype went
to poop oh man mic myself snow them on
here again my connections good but your
skype went to poop oh there we go you
said you sound good again I think it
just it just wants to hit a dipper ooh
yeah we need an alternative alternate to
Skype we need an alternative sky can't
be the only voice out there no there's
gotta be some other good ones that's
funny how Skype is always the one that
comes up though I mean we could do like
Google Hangouts but I don't think we've
ever found a really good way to make
Google Hangouts work mmm no not really
anyway so okay so she opened up the
doors to a discussion about bullying and
censorship which was actually the topic
here not not Nicole Arbour she was more
of the conduit to the discussion yeah
let's just call her the catalyst
okay she's the catalyst and you know
what we can't we can all we can all feel
happy that if you wanted something bad
to happen to her well she got canned she
lost her jobs so you know there is that
but again it as much as you may disagree
or agree with what she said cuz plenty
of people agreed with her rant that is
it fair to punish someone for a freedom
of speech and his freedom of first of
all do the hepatoma speech in Canada I
don't know they're so nice they
fucking eat it the other thing if Anna
days are so annoying in a gray area yeah
I think she's gonna set the president
they're gonna have to actually start
like reviewing their laws oh my god
yeah so so you and I talked a little bit
about this offline was it how do you how
do you stop bullying well if that
bullying is through words by the way
we're not talking about like I'm
punching your face I you can't stop me
that censorship that's different we're
talking about mean words like she's
that's only in Russia right yes that's
just that's just a normal like traffic
altercation in Russia you know you went
through the red light you're getting
your face pounded in - cams
everybody loves Russia so anyway how do
you keep her from having the right to
saying what she wants without censoring
her but then get mad at her when you
don't like what she says I I agree with
the difficulty in navigating these
waters oh absolutely and the other thing
is like you were saying I mean that
we're not talking about punching people
in the face
but one thing that I've been I've become
kind of acutely aware of over the last
year is that work can be hugely damaging
they can be absolutely a mijung like as
much as you guys remember when you know
I used to say oh fuck the trolls bla bla
bla I don't care what people have to say
fuck that I'm slowly getting back to
that mentality now because it's the only
way to survive because you just let that
hate it you know just kind of beat away
at you a little bit every single day it
wears you down and if you're like an
emotionally unstable person to begin
with and you're already in a dark place
hmm I mean words are every bit as
damaging I mean there's been situations
in my life where I would rather had
somebody just punch me the fuck out then
say what they said so it's bad language
sir fuck what you're terrible oh I'm
sorry I'm sorry let me get a snit I I
I'm trying to get a censored on YouTube
okay but actually actually the word fuck
is one of the most versatile words in
the in the English language I've seen
that video that video is hilarious that
goes that goes back like 15 years ago
that is old remember you can have you
can have fucking nearly the entire
sentence itself fuck the fucking fuckers
every single one of them has a different
like a different part of
the sentence structure yeah it was like
narrated by like some guy that like
you'd expect to narrate a documentary on
Discovery Channel he was British and he
was with yeah very well-spoken why I
guess that goes without saying if he's
British like I said somebody somebody
with a smart British accent could tell
me the most off-the-wall thing and I
would believe it so so back to back to
the whole subject of bullying and
censorship the person that I was telling
Jay that kind of like Pete I don't want
to say like my interest in the subject
but more like question how I feel myself
would be boogie2988 a lot of you guys
know him he's kind of like a fat people
Martin Luther King jr. I think I'd refer
dude oh man
well I and how does this tie into tech
well because she claims she was being
censored by YouTube that's why the
channel was taken down I still think it
was automated takedown because of the
thousands of flags she was getting so I
mean we still know exactly what what
happened there with the tape there's no
questioning she wasn't even taken down
that she did it herself because a lot of
evidence and all the direct links uh
were still accessible which was really
strange every other channel that has
been taken down for DMCA or anything
like that all the links directly to the
videos would just say this video you
know the link you put in doesn't work
and in her case all the links worked but
it said this video is set to private so
that so again we really don't know what
happened I'm not saying that it didn't
happen that it didn't get taken down but
it's entirely possible that was part of
a publicity that picked up by CNN okay
so yeah and and I have a hard time
believing she's actually smart enough to
figure out a strategy I have to say I'm
not sure she's smart enough to
strategize at that no and she has a team
too but obviously they're not a very
fucking good team if they've been a team
of you makeup artists I don't know if
she really has a business strategy the
other day and I bet sir they're not
Canadian because they had been Canadian
I adapt a matter she has one business
strategy it's this and you can't see
what I'm doing but I'm squishing my man
boobs together that's her business
strategy there you go there I got I got
bigger ones than you right now so I
think it's more appropriate for me to do
the illustrations of the woman that's a
mystery but anyways guys just a just
kind of paraphrase what boogie was
saying as he said I
don't agree with what Nicole Arbour said
and I thought I was downright horrible
but I will defend her right to say it
yeah and boogies always kind of had that
stance that he'll defend anybody I mean
it doesn't matter what she he believes
heavily in freedom of speech but on the
flip side of it when we look at it is
YouTube is a private company freedom of
speech does not fall within their terms
they're not a government agency they're
not the public they're a private company
and Terms of Service specifically state
that you can't you can't put porno on
YouTube you can't put hate speech right
on YouTube and the thing is the satire
and comedy are okay and she's claiming
that what she did was satirical but at
the same time I watched the thing like
three times now granted I'm a fat man
myself so I'm kind of sensitive to the
subject but but keep in mind I also am
very self-deprecating fat person then I
get comedy I do and all I felt through
that whole video was a huge emphasis on
hate and intolerance towards that group
of people yeah you know I okay so I
didn't watch her initial video I didn't
really have to because I got suggest of
it but I did watch that the the comedian
that you linked on Facebook's response
to it oh yeah and yeah he had to play
portions of it and he's a real comedian
by the way like an actual comedian who
did a very good job at ripping her apart
in her and her her whole concept of
shaming yeah so I got to see a lot of
her video through that one obviously but
there was nothing there was nothing in
that video that said I'm trying to be
funny in fact not me at the end of the
day she even tried to play it off like I
want you to be healthy so you can live
on this earth longer and we can enjoy
your beautiful human bodies and it's
like at the very end of her video Jay
she pretty much spent like 30 seconds
saying no but seriously I want you to be
healthy you know I want you to live
longer blah blah blah blah blah and but
you could tell it was completely
disingenuous it didn't fit it all with
the rest of the video wasn't like a
segue it's almost like she finished
recording and then they were like fuck
that was dark you should probably go
back and say something undo all that
damage yeah and it just came off as
completely unguent
but but then you've got like the person
we were talking about
meghan tonjes which is not she's
opposite yes she's the opposite she's a
Bazzi body-positive person and she's a
little overweight herself but absolutely
beautiful woman I know her I met her at
a vlogger fair for like two years now
amazing person absolutely amazing person
and she's an amazing singer too and she
took so much offense like she is a heart
this lady
Megan if you met her in person she is
hard person to crack like she is she
dropped to tears in her apply I have
never seen a video where she was so
bothered it's funny I told the wife I
said oh hey Megan responded to the made
a response video I bet you she rips
Nicole a new one and we watched it and I
was shocked it was completely the
opposite response I was expecting she
she literally that was the most
heartfelt thing that I've ever liked
like literally watching it I almost went
I almost came to tears I was like it was
that it was that good of a video and
then like you said the comedian I can't
caught I wish I could remember his name
right now the guy with the huge beard
who ripped her apart
that was funny that was absolutely
hilarious or he was basically playing
the response to every single thing she
said in that video and that was amazing
but it was one of these things were her
video definitely divided an audience I
would say the majority definitely felt
that the message she said she was
sending was hate-filled but there was a
lot of support for her to which you know
I personally at the time found
disgusting right did I enter what the
topic is there's always a line there's
always a line there's always gonna be
and she's always gonna have an audience
and as soon as you and as long as you
have an established audience you can
keep doing what you're doing I mean
she's not gonna stop doing it if it
keeps making her famous but like we said
I mean she's getting fired from TV
programs now because she's crossed over
that line and just to be clear here
usually when a celebrity or a comedian
crosses the line right what's the first
thing that they do after they realize
they crossed that line let's just
apology they try to explain their stance
even if they're unapologetic like like
some people have been they still come
forward and tried to defend what they
were actually trying to do and she did
you know on the other hand no is she on
the other hand is playing the victim of
censorship exactly the victim of
censorship she basically stood exactly
by what she said and the tone she
defended her tone and it was very weird
because if you read her
sweets in in one minute she's saying no
I really want fat people to get healthy
again I really want them to live on this
earth bla bla bla and then the next one
is like no fat people are fucking
disgusting and they need to know it so
that they can fix it it's like why is
your tone flip-flopping so much yeah you
know you could use it and that's the
thing is is at the end of the day a
comedian that it's talking about
something like a good a good comedian to
be an example for this would be Lisa
Lampanelli right Lisa Lampanelli uh for
those of you that know who she is she
talks about everything she says racist
shit she talks about fat people she
talks about sex and everything but she
herself is the butt end of the joke it's
self-deprecating humor and she can speak
from the perspective of it because she
is in that class she's talking about
yeah and that's what and she don't get
me wrong she's still highly
controversial a lot of people don't
agree with the stuff she says and get
really deeply offended well but my being
is her group isn't the one you know
she's not attacking a group that she's
not a member of yeah you know what's
funny is uh hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna
ban a few people here just because I can
and I want to I know it's fun people
have been doing it a lot lately you know
this this this also plays into the
YouTube gaming thing right where Jimmy
was Jimmy Kimball was making fun of the
YouTube streaming he's like who are our
gamers so dumb that they would watch
other gamers play games and and he tried
to he tried to play it off not by
apologizing a very large group of people
I don't think he understands just how
big and strong and powerful the gaming
community is but he on the backside of
gamergate and stuff too so it's like
it's not exactly like the gamers are
sitting happy and you know but but look
it but also look at what happened I mean
he tried to play it off by taking the
mean comments and responding to them you
know live on air yeah which is which was
of course he only took the most asinine
unintelligent comments to try and take
those and make it look this is what
gamers are like I can't spell right they
can't formulate a sentence you know and
right but I think boogies response to
that was absolutely amazing
did you see jimmies did you see boogies
response to Jimmy I did not actually I
need to go watch that
oh no no he it was a tweet so what he
said boogie tweeted Jimmy camp it's
Kimmel right yes he tweeted Jimmy Kimmel
he said Jimmy the reason why most people
watch gamers play is because they're a
lot better than we are what we're
attempting to do you know the same
reason you watch Jimmy Fallon all that
is epic yeah I read that I was like hook
and sinker it is done the conversation
is over that's absolutely perfect I
guess here let's go ahead and wrap it up
so we move on to some tech but the
reason why we wanted to address can you
turn down your mic volume everyone's
told me to turn you down I've already
turned you down to 30% and they still
say you're too loud hold on let me drop
my gain House is that better
it didn't change hey hold on how about
now we'll just have to let time tell all
right here I dropped it down a little
bit I assume the people complaining are
first-timers here they don't understand
just how amateur hour the show is and
I'm really loud I'm just a super loud
person you are loud so anyways just to
wrap up the whole the holding Nicole
Arbour situation she kind of set the
fire that put the whole thing in motion
but it's been something that's been a
little bit of a tinderbox for a long
time and that is censorship versus
bullying basically online but at the end
of the day if your comedy is designed to
basically be hurtful mmm in the first
place then I I don't want to watch your
shit but again I kind of agree with
boogie at this point that's like if you
want to sink your ship and you want to
shoot yourself in the head and you want
to go find a group of toxic people yeah
that's on you but it's like well then
don't walk around going but the other
thing is don't call bullshit on freedom
of speech when this is a private company
and YouTube has a policy against that
type of video now you may not agree that
YouTube classifies it correctly and
again YouTube brought it back so
obviously YouTube thought that that she
was within her rights to say what she
was about you what she said but at the
same time it's like no if if a video
gets taken down because some guys up
there and he's saying racial this and
racial that and saying that all you know
like for instance black people should be
eradicated or some shit like that no
that does not belong on YouTube if you
want to go create your
own website and find some overseas
company that will host that shit and
stream it knock yourself out but YouTube
is not for you to put that film
it just isn't yeah all right well let's
move on to the other topic that's
guaranteed to create a divide amongst
the people how about that there Apple
huh yeah how's about that Apple so of an
orange feller myself so we all know and
if you don't know this is gonna come as
a bit of shock to you but Steve Jobs
died along it I know I know there's some
people the news takes a while to get
around to but 2010 wasn't it 2011 ten
it's been a while I mean it's been a
long time anyway so it's been long
enough for Apple that we get completely
derailed so I'm sure you guys have all
watched like them the many different
iterations of movies showing how
important Steve Jobs was to Apple and
how you know he came in founded it got
kicked out got brought back because they
were failing made the company super
successful again then died and then the
company had some other troubles but
again is still making more money than
the entire US government combined but
basically Apple has been running amok a
little bit lately without Steve at the
helm and that the two things that I want
to cite like first off would be the
Apple pencil let's go ahead and just get
like the funny ones out of the way so
the Apple pencil basically you have a
stylus that costs $100 okay
you-you-you-you but at the end of the
day that's what you have I don't give a
shit what they say the feature set is on
it you have a stylus that is $100 and
the meme that is circulating the
internet right now that oh guys oh but
what but but but it's a stylus made out
of aircraft-grade aluminum and sapphire
crystal tip I don't know if that's true
yeah I'm just like data mint him and I
think it was powered by a leprechaun
leprechaun pubic hair I heard it was
powered by minecraft redstone redstone I
like that I started playing minecraft
now let's end I feel like you know what
I'm talking about
I don't know how to make anything out of
redstone guys I'm sorry I'm very new
yeah mom actually I've always been I
played minecraft for like six months and
still couldn't figure out how to do half
the shit and always had to play with
other people but I know
oops accidentally pushed the wrong
button and deleted it no creepers in my
house so anyways a hundred dollar stylus
but here's here's where it gets funny is
years and years and years ago when the
iPhone I think was like the iPhone first
generation like when the first iPhone
came out steve job gets steve jobs gets
up on stage in the first thing he starts
doing is ripping on every other company
for having a stylist he basically says
like it's stupid to have a stylist who
wants to have this thing with humina a
touchscreen right he made fun of it he's
like how you gonna interface with it a
stylist
yeah i know i watched i watch you know
yeah 2007 so so you know so you gotta
you have that for context to understand
this the Apple is now basically
releasing a stylus that they're calling
a pencil because everybody else calls
and pens and stylus they want to be
different so they're like we're gonna
release the Apple pencil it's gonna be a
hundred dollars because you know Apple
they did they really like those really
super high price points you know the
packaging's probably cost more than the
product need to produce uh so now you've
got this $100 stylus and Steve Jobs
himself basically went on record saying
that nobody should ever have to use a
stylus it's the dumbest fucking thing
ever invented every other remembers
remember remember when Steve Jobs did a
visual aid of how the how the
interaction of your device should always
work he held up his family yeah yeah no
no so so so and everybody knows this
it's still pretty much fresh in
everybody's mind especially the Apple
fanboys that have been there for the
whole time but it's just really strange
that now Steve's out of the picture and
you have two things that I don't think
Steve would have ever gone for and one
that's a SmartWatch and the other one is
the stylus now now to kind of segue away
from the stylus cuz what are you get a
SmartWatch have its own stylus nope it's
a little toothpick so the SmartWatch I
have one guys
I wouldn't bought an Apple watch and it
was it was like yeah I know exactly I
was like five hundred dollars I had to
have one it was the new shiny and no no
the one that I got was the Apple watch
sport and then I got the warranty thing
with it because you know being a watch I
smashed those things and break them all
the time so I get the watch and I have
pretty high expectations for it now to
give you guys some background I had a
pebble I didn't like the pebble that's
just me but it was more of a gripe I had
with the company and their quality
control than the product itself and you
do have some rant video
about your payable actually I didn't put
any of them online I did I shot up I
added them and never published any of
them because they were just they were
just too toxic I didn't want that type
of it well then I'm I'm I must be
remembering our conversations offline
about it then oh yeah I shit over a shit
all over pebble and a lot of our Tech
Talks but all over a lot of things there
including yes is what weather I don't I
don't like pebble because the company
not because of the product pebble a lot
of people really love it because it's
the only SmartWatch you only have to
charge like once a week and it does what
it does fairly well before we go forward
on this yeah I I need to get my Apple
music playing did your Apple music
alright alright you just you just kind
of keep going and I'll to start playing
it when I find it here nice okay so
anyways guys I get the Apple watch
previously I own the Microsoft
SmartWatch do you guys remember that you
probably don't because Microsoft really
sucked ass at marketing for a lot of
their products especially Hardware back
in the day but anyways there was like
five different watches that Microsoft
made through through various different
manufacturers and they all ran their
little operating system it was just a
liquid crystal display it was actually
very similar to what the pebble is today
but overly complicated and the charging
mechanism never works I decided what I
want to do here is that at the end of
this segment I want you to let's see how
long is this file this file or this this
song here is 33 seconds long oh we lost
that we lost the Jerry I don't think I
didn't disconnect him there you are okay
connect you you just got to cut out the
last thing I heard from you was 33
seconds no I your camera's not on oh it
is it oh I better fix it hold on hold on
technical difficulties well there you
see me boom there we are okay so the
little Apple music thing is 33 seconds
long so at the end of this segment I
want you to kind of think about like a
33 second commercial for this for the
pen or the pencil you got and we'll do
an improv or you get to do an improv
pencil ad we're doing it we're gonna do
it so great to go we'll do it at the end
of this segment
okay so so guys back to the back to the
SmartWatch so I had the Microsoft
SmartWatch it was okay it was kind of
gimmicky pretty much all I used it for
was weather in time
I mean that's how that's how worthless
it was it didn't really do anything with
your phone and it received everything
over a radio frequency like we're not
even talking like cell cell tower stuff
here we're talking just rate just pure
radio frequency and they didn't work
everywhere anyways that was a long time
ago now you got Apple coming out with
again this is what Apple kind of does
Microsoft drops the ball and is way
ahead of their time so now Apple steps
up something that I don't think Steve
Jobs would ever have approved and
releases the watch and the watch
basically is another interface to the
phone without the phone the watch just
tells time it doesn't do anything beyond
that right so I put on my watch and the
build quality on it seems nice the touch
interfaces on it's actually pretty
responsive and the screen looks great I
think it's awesome I'm not wearing it
right now yeah and the reason being is
the software is beyond buggy on not only
that it makes you it makes you act like
a complete dick to people you're talking
to what I mean by that was how many
times are you talking to Parrillo and
like because of how animated you have to
flip your wrist over to make it respond
yeah it's supposed to be you lift your
arm and it just turns on but it never
does you have to do the whole but but at
vloggerfair I kept seeing I kept seeing
Chris had to do they have to do the very
animated like yeah and like look at his
arm and he was very he was very act like
very stern and the way he brought up his
arm so you be sitting there talking to
him he'd go to check a notification when
almost looks like yeah you know this
conversations over because you know time
yeah like the way he had to bring his
arm up just to make it respond it almost
looked like he's telling you like oh I
feel like like like Steve Jobs seriously
would have just thrown the thing in the
garbage and not even continued and the
reason why I say that is you make a good
point one thing we know about Steve Jobs
is that he always wanted the experience
to be a polished one right he was all
about it appearing to be more like magic
than science yeah right and then you've
got the Smart Watch here's the bugs that
I've run into that I that I just pissed
me off like this is why I'm not wearing
it today every time you need to see it
you gotta flip your wrist over and flip
it back right which which which looks
like you're like you know I don't know
masturbating something with a very very
crooked penis but now that you've got
that vision stuck in your head with the
with the watch you have to do that but
not only that
when you're doing directions like I was
tellin ya you're welcome when you're do
when you have the GPS software load on
it only works with Apple maps which we
all know are Apple maps are the worst
they'll drive like seriously they'll
just steer you off a cliff into the
ocean doesn't matter let lemmings mode
and so you drive along and it pops up
and I love how it's supposed to work if
it worked right I would love it it taps
your wrist with a cool sensation it's
not a vibration it's more of a tap you
look down and it says which way to turn
and how far to turn it's like just very
very simple information the problem is
half the time it's super delayed and you
miss your turn before you get the damn
screen up and then the other thing is if
anybody sent you an SMS message or calls
your phone while you're doing it it
flips the screen away from your
directions and then when you're done
with that interaction it doesn't go back
to the directions so you have to
basically go open apps go back to the
thing reopen my Apple maps right on this
thing and it's so so it ruins it like
basically I don't even use it for
navigation anymore because I've missed
so many damn turns and then when you
sync it to the iPhone it fucks Siri up
on the iPhone you pull out my iPhone you
hold down the button for Siri and Siri
just sits there it doesn't it doesn't
make the ding noise it doesn't wait for
you and a lot of people have reported
the same issue okay they said two
software updates they haven't fixed it
I'll be honest I don't know how much
this is making it up to YouTube right
now because I think YouTube is having a
problem oh I've got upstream health is
good on my end I've got zero dropped
frames and we've been live for 31
minutes but like YouTube is just not
responding for me well I'm watching the
stream the stream still going but then
again it's delayed by you know who knows
so you're hearing yourself talk though
yeah I mean obviously we're still yeah
yep no we're still we're still going hey
probably it's probably a node issue on
my end then at least some demos B yeah
no no we still look good on the stream
stream still looks live if it's it's
weird how I can up I can send up to
YouTube without any problems right now
but I'm I can't actually view the
YouTube watch page right now weird yeah
it's still working so don't touch
anything J and Skype still says the
internet connection problem between you
and I but clearly that's not the case
yep so guys internet chill the Apple
watch is it's honestly not ready for
primetime Steve Jobs never would have
green letting it interferes with the
phone this it's probably what about six
six or eight months I want to say still
have this many Pro
that there that long no no and there's
been Tucson Orton they claim that
there's oh at the the second version of
the OS is dropping you know with their
latest announcements hopefully they
address a lot of these problems um but
it's all stuff that shouldn't have
shipped yeah like I mean they're bad
issues that anybody like testing this
thing for 15 minutes on a lunch break
would encounter these issues and they
continued forward like here here's one
that really pisses me off is Dick Tracy
right everybody likes the Dick Tracy had
the watch where you could talk on it
right that's like so now you can finally
do that with the Apple watch but the
speaker and it is so quiet that even
just driving down the road with the
windows like rolled up in your car just
the engine noise or the wind noise is
enough to completely kill that speaker
and you can't hear it unless you put it
up to your ear like this mm-hmm and it's
got calls gone again or than to just
have it just piss off a bunch of people
my video again didn't you
yeah the video is gone alright along
they push little button now back I need
to redo my network here I've got a
really crazy bridging Bridge to a bridge
of a bridge type of system and it's I've
actually got some hardware that was sent
to me to kind of redo the network here
so we'll see I'm typing in Cherry now
technical difficulties are just a
feature of Tech Talk it's not really a
technical difficulty though the stream
still going right
yeah but they said audios lagging and I
could even see it over here it was like
jumping and no for a second for a second
there it did hiccup okay no no it looks
like it's smooth now everything seems
working alright but Apple watch
not-ready-for-prime-time it's literally
just gonna sit on the charger on my
nightstand until another software update
drops that hopefully addresses some of
these issues but I was really
disappointed for something that cost so
much it was developed by Apple was just
what just just had such a bad experience
it was nothing like the iPhone at all
but yeah even the experience on the
iPhone has gotten a little bit less than
desirable no that's true that's true and
the thing is when we sunk the i'f when
you sync the watch to the iPhone it
creates some new bugs on the iPhone
itself it's almost like a virus and a
way to the iPhone the I virus the I
virus isn't it still like I said Siri
works flawlessly you literally how shall
I think the watch to it then you
literally have to wear the virus
all right so should we do that should we
do the commercial for the Apple pencil
all right let me get the music cued up
let's do this all right I can't see chat
or anything so oh wait there we go it's
loaded for me now so let me bring up the
chatter all right guys we're gonna go
ahead and do Jerry's gonna do a 33
second commercial about the eye pencil
eye well the Apple pencil remember we
don't call em sighs I forgot Steve's
dead so I is no longer used I forgot all
right but we still call it iPhone iPad
iMac I know it's very confusing don't
try to understand it'll hurt it'll hurt
your brain so all right on the count of
three you can take it away you know what
you can do ya know I'm getting just
figure it out as it go all right three
two one and go
do you find you have an iOS device that
you operate with your fingers well
that's probably because Steve Jobs told
you at one point to using a stylus is
for poor people well guess what Apple
has unveiled to honor Steve Jobs memory
long after he's passed not the stylus
but the Apple pencil we're talking about
cylindrical aluminum approximately the
length of two fingers and only costing
you $100 actually only $99 because if
they put three digits in there it might
look offensive so guys get your eye
pencil today and start using your device
like Microsoft did ten years ago was
that close you you were to about six
seconds long but boy did I have to you
have to look at my visual aid on the on
the two fingers oh did you put did you
put stuff up on the screen no I just
more or less did a physical response to
use the size of two fingers okay I'll
wait for the stream to catch up but
honestly okay so now now we've kind of
ribbed Apple now let's actually give him
some praise for some cool stuff that
they did okay so the new iPhone 6s and
6-plus
actually come with a new feature called
3d touch which is fairly innovative I
don't know how well it's gonna work in
practice but it's cool because now
they've got pressure sensitivity on the
screen so now they can actually change
the function between a slight touch and
a hard push so that's gonna give you
kind of a third dimension all I see a
few things
oh yeah it's a three fingers that might
have been the shocker huh can you tell
the difference between a slight touch
and a big push oh yeah you know it
that's what she said Jay oh so so the
whole 3d touch feature I think is
actually kind of cool like what do you
think about that Jay do you think about
something that you could actually get
used to is giving you another dimension
of control over your device like put
touching an icon versus pushing it guys
I cannot see what Jay does and I can't
hear what he does either like no I'm
gonna give it a hard push you gonna give
it a hard push do you like to give it a
hard push on the front or the back of
the device oh god here we go
it isn't a livestream unless Jay drops
ass at some point so so another cool
thing about the new iPhones in this and
this is hilarious is they emphasize that
they made them out of much stronger
aluminum and much stronger glass and all
I can think about when I heard that
feature was bendgate
this is like their response though shit
were embarrassed that our that our
phones basically compete over if you
think that Lou is gonna see if he can if
you could push his finger through the
glass
I think Lou's gonna put it under a drill
press like he'll do whatever it takes to
get it guys it didn't actually hold up
against my carbide bit Jay and I are
gonna predict this right now that on
launch day within a half an hour of the
device going public you're gonna have
loo from unbox therapy driving over it
with a dump truck like I'm just gonna
predict it at this point and be like it
is not dump truck proof because that
would be hilarious Lou if you're
watching this please please make that
happen oh yeah like Lou is watching this
I know right he's too busy flying around
and as f-18 Hornet over California
anyways uh better cameras front and back
that was to be expected right faster
processor a nine chips though again to
be expected and they have a new
photography feature which they touted is
moving photos and I just thought to
myself video anyone moving the photos
capture your moment is moving photos now
they've got like some moving photos
I don't know anything about it but I
just when I hear moving photo I think I
think video I think I think back in 1942
and they're going to see the Tucker show
the flick your show yeah even have like
a little thing on the edge of a finger
flip it they have I flip the I flip
there it is dude they're gonna steal
that from us make like a billion dollars
so uh so the other device that they
announced was the all new Apple TV I'll
be honest uh when I was over at Chris
Pirillo house he had an Apple TV and I
thought it was pretty cool and I'll tell
you the only thing I really thought it
was really cool is that you could mirror
your iOS device to the TV and it was
perfect it was like lag free you could
play games on the TV your audios on the
TV I only wanted to get it for that one
reason and I never got around to getting
one because like honestly I didn't
really care like it wasn't that big of a
deal to me but the new Apple TV they got
a version for $69 in a version for I
think 159 or one hundred and $69 but
it's actually got support somebody
pointed out that copy served was first
to the gift was noise America basically
basically they did a movement picture it
and get back into the control panel
we're gonna go ahead and end tonight's
dream yeah we're gonna go ahead and shut
it down Dori our last topic was Amazon
stops selling the fire smart phone and
will style we'll just move that off the
next week or if we talk about it at all
I mean after all it is a it is a fire
it's the fire phone like nobody even
knows what we're talking about anyways
are like what a phone from Amazon that
makes no sense yep and my AMD Nano video
is gonna go live tomorrow so if you guys
want to check that out feel free but
other than that that is it I am turning
this off and I'm going to go hang out
with family and probably play some
minecraft tonight sweet now I'm gonna
try to shoot my vlog and not have my
lavell ear mic fall off my shirt at this
time you need a wire under your shirt
like I do I'm going to now I've learned
my lesson Jay I've learned well hey
thanks for hanging out I'm gonna go
ahead and roll the out true all right
Tiffany's goes you will see you guys
next week please okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
