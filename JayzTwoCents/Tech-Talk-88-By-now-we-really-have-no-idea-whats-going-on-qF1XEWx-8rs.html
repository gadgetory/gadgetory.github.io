waiting on you sir done with this do it
hey hey I can actually see the comet and
CEO youtube like revamped its whole live
streaming thing I can actually see the
comments from the life control room now
that's cool so I don't have to try a
faster and easier way to stream it's
fancy I like foreign watcher thing I
like faster and easier ways to stream
yeah also like that they do that podcast
thing were you know when the streams
about to start it's not just a countdown
anymore it looks like a legitimate
broadcast like waiting thingamajigger
yeah because i loved how in the past it
was always like hey guys when is the
livestream start and it's like a big-ass
counter counting down in the middle of
screen if there was a gonna start so
this Slee Tech Talk 88 let me see oh the
title I like that by now we really have
no idea what's going on I that's that's
probably the most accurate title who
used a it only took us 88 shows to
figure it out and about about 60 of
those were with you so yeah we should
probably be clear though the in this
episode we do actually have a document
that was hastily created in the last 20
minutes by me so hey Jerry did agree
about five hours ago to do the doc for
me she bribed more than that and then 15
minutes for the show he's like oh
doc yeah that's right I'll be right back
I was like squirrels so ya know FBI
still hammered out like three pages in
20 minutes that's not I'm not I'm proud
actually wait no five pages so I'm
getting ready to pull the the whole the
whole anchorman thing where I have no
idea what I'm reading or talking about
you could just be like jay is a big
face and smells like poo and I'd be like
you know that speakings ra that jay is a
big face it smells like poo wait a
minute me choda because i have at least
15 minutes experience with all these
these topics that i've typed down Oh
whether you're an expert by the YouTube
standards so do we we did we have a
rolled intro yet have we note we're
rolling it right now what welcome to Tik
Tok number 88 by now we really have no
 idea what's going on but there
will be textin I so enjoy
because you added the f-word in there
which means it made maids it which made
it ten percent different than the
original therefore copyright oh
flick row and we already got eight down
votes which is awesome that is things
that I didn't appreciate so much well
you know it's not the end of the show by
the end I'm thinking we might hit a
hundred but if we if we only hit a
hundred we're doing good examine you
heard on the Internet hate is the new
love that's what it is I hate is the
deal it is it should we just should we
just skip a few topics and start on that
one yep might as well just segue right
into the elephant in the room and that's
uh that that's our favorite Canadian if
she Canadian she is and that is even
worse no no you this is hilarious
because I was just thinking about this
this morn nose like I can't think of
like mean Canadians Canada is like the
nicest nation on earth it's like the one
country that nobody wants to bomb or do
anything to like Canada can defend
themselves with like SS nine a nine
millimeter Posada is the new Switzerland
there they are they basically are like
Switzerland is jelly of Canada and here
you have only had only hamburgers don't
cost forty five dollars this is shirland
just a true I heard about that from
Logan he was bitching about it hey I
remember we were eating when we were in
seattle and the burger was like twelve
bucks he's like man only twelve bucks
just like the cheapest burger ever like
what the is Logan Logan it's like
we don't even oh oh my god anyways uh
we're gonna keep the topic of nicole
arbour kind of brief targeted her and
then we're gonna talk about the real
issue behind everything that's going on
and that's that's censorship in a bully
oh I was gonna say blonde hair dye and
silicone blonde hair dye and silicone
works too i mean if it ends is the same
here no anyways you have nicole arbour
basically she's you know this canadian a
blonde not unattractive woman who is a
chief fancies herself Akane I like how
you worded that without during like that
limited I know I don't know right I
guess we're going because if we're going
based on personality she is pretty damn
Cryptkeeper ish no she is she's
definitely the Skeletor and in that
arena like as soon as she opens her
mouth you're like oh man any any
redeeming qualities they're out the
window
but anyways she's always been a shock
type comedian if you go back and watch
some of her old videos which I highly
recommend you don't because you'll
probably just like want to cut yourself
but but but she was never funny shocked
comedian like say Seth Rogen no no no
that that was the big difference is you
could tell that she was just trying to
be funny by being offensive mm-hmm like
that that's the difference is there
there's a difference like when you go to
like Richard Pryor and I was it like
Louis CK and stuff like that there's
there's its its strategic you like I can
listen adored Ricky Gervais us talk
about fat people for 15 minutes and i
find it quite hilarious because one he
was a fat person himself yeah at one
point in time so he can relate and the
other thing is is he's self-deprecating
to a certain point you to where it kind
of rounds it out you can tell that it's
very jovial nature and when you have her
saying it it literally comes off as
hatred yeah that's what I was just about
to say was it's one of those things
where you know can-can fat people make
fun of fat people and get away with it
yeah I sorry she was cutting out here
Jay I used to make fun of heavyset
people really heavy yeah your skype went
to poop oh man Microsoft's noman here
again my connections good but your skype
went to poop oh there we go you said you
sound good again I think it just it just
must a hit a dipper ooh yeah I gotta
love skype we need an alternative
alternate to skype we need an
alternative skype can't be the only
voice out there no there's gotta be some
other good ones that's funny how skypes
always the one that comes up though I
mean we could do like Google Hangouts
but I don't think we've ever found a
really good way to make Google Hangouts
work no not really anyway so okay so she
opened up the doors to a discussion
about bullying and censorship which was
actually the topic here not not nicole
arbour she was more of the conduit to
the discussion yeah let's just call her
the catalyst and she okay she's the
catalyst and you know it we could we can
all we can all feel happy that if you
wanted something bad to happen to her
well she got can she lost her jobs so
you know there is that but again it as
much as you may disagree or agree with
what she said cuz plenty of people
agreed with her rant uh that is it fair
to punish someone for a freedom of
speech in a freedom of first of all do
the heifer you miss beach in Canada I
don't know right oh is that they're so
ice they don't need it the other
thing if Canada is so nine in a grey
area Josh I think she's gonna set the
president that they're gonna have to
actually start like reviewing their laws
oh my god um yeah so so you and I talked
a little bit about this offline was it
how do you how do you stop bullying well
if that bullying is through words by the
way we're not talking about like I'm
punching your face I you can't stop me
that censorship that's different right
we're talking about mean words like
she's that's only in Russia right yes
that's just that's just a normal like
traffic altercation in Russia you know
you went through the red light you're
getting your face pounded in ash cams
wait everybody loves Russia so anyway
how do you keep her from having the
right to saying what she wants without
censoring her but then get mad at her
when you don't like what she says I
under I agree with the difficulty in
navigating these waters oh absolutely
another thing is like you were saying I
mean that we're not talking about
punching people in the face but one
thing that I've been I've become kind of
acutely aware of over the last year is
that word can be hugely damaging they
can be absolutely damaging like as much
as you guys remember when you know I
used to say oh the trolls blah blah
blah I don't care what people have to
say that I'm slowly getting back to
that mentality now because it's the only
way to survive because you just let that
hate itch you know just kind of beat
away at you a little bit every single
day it wears you down and if you're like
an emotionally unstable person to begin
with and you're already in a dark place
mmm I mean words are every bit as
damaging I mean there's been situations
in my life where I would have rather had
somebody just punched me the out
then say what they said such bad
language sir what you're terrible
oh I'm sorry I'm sorry let me get a snit
I i I'm trying to get a censored on
YouTube ok actually actually the word
 is one of the most versatile words
in the English language I've seen that
video that video is hilarious it's that
goes that goes back like 15 years ago
that is different
remember you can have you can have
be nearly the entire sentence itself
 the I remember that
every single one of them has a different
like a different part of the sentence
structure yeah it was like narrated by
like some guy that like you'd expect an
area to documentary on discovery channel
he was british and he was with yeah very
well-spoken while i guess that goes
without saying if he's British good very
good like I said somebody somebody with
a smart British accent could tell me the
most off-the-wall thing and I would
believe it so so back to back to the
whole subject of bullying and censorship
the person that I was telling jay that
kind of like peaked I don't want to say
like my interest in the subject but more
like question how i feel myself would be
boogie2988 a lot of you guys know him
he's kind of like a fat people Martin
Luther King jr. I think I referred to oh
man well I and how does this tie into
tech well because she claims she is
being censored by YouTube that's why the
channel was taken down I still think it
was automated take down because of the
thousands of flags she was getting so I
we still know exactly what what happened
there with the taken place there's no
questioning she wasn't even taken down
that she did it herself because a lot of
evidence and all the direct links uh
were still accessible which was really
strange every other channel that has
been taken down for dmca or anything
like that all the links directly to the
videos would just say this video you
know the link you put in doesn't work
and in her case all the links work but
it said this video is set to private so
that so again we really don't know what
happened i'm not saying that it didn't
happen that it didn't get takedown but
it's entirely possible that was part of
a publicity they got picked up by CNN ok
yeah oh my and and i have a hard time
believing she's actually smart enough to
figure out a strategy i have to say i'm
not sure she's smart enough to
strategize at that no and she has a team
to but obviously they're not a very
 good team if they fed a team of
you make up artists I don't know if she
really has a business strategy other
thing I bet you they're not Canadian cuz
they had been Canadian I have to imagine
let's face it she has one business
strategy it's this and you can't see
what I'm doing but I'm squishing my man
poops together that's her business
strategy that's right
there you go there I got I got bigger
ones than you right now so I think it's
more appropriate for me to do the
illustrations of the woman the things of
its history but anyways guys just that
just kind of paraphrase what boogie was
saying as he said I don't agree with
what nicole arbour said and I thought it
was downright horrible but I will defend
her right to say it yeah and boogies
always kind of had that stance that
he'll defend anybody I mean it doesn't
matter what she believes heavily in
freedom of speech but on the flip side
of it when we look at it is YouTube is a
private company freedom of speech does
not fall within their terms they're not
a government agency they're not the
public there a private company and Terms
of Service specifically state that you
can't you can't put porno on YouTube you
can't put hate speech right on YouTube
and the thing is a satire in comedy
you're okay and she's claiming that what
she did was satirical but at the same
time I watched the thing like three
times now granted i'm a fat man myself
so I'm kind of sensitive to the subject
but but keep in mind i also am very
self-deprecating fat person then i get
comedy I do and all I felt through that
whole video was a huge emphasis on hate
and intolerance towards that group of
people yeah you know I ok so I didn't
watch her initial video I didn't really
have to because I got suggestive it but
I did watch that the the comedian that
you look linked on Facebook's response
to it oh yeah and how he had to play
portions of it and he's a real comedian
by the way like an actual comedian who
did a very good job at ripping her apart
in her and her her whole concept of
acquisition aning yeah so I got to see a
lot of her video through that one
obviously but there was nothing there
was nothing in that video that said I'm
trying to be funny in fact not me at the
end of the day she even tried to play it
off like I want you to be healthy so you
can live on this earth longer and we can
enjoy your beautiful human bodies and
it's like at the very end of her video J
she pretty much spent like 30 seconds
saying no but seriously I want you to be
healthy you know I want you to live
longer blah blah blah blah blah and but
you could tell it was completely
disingenuous it didn't fit it all with
the rest of the video wasn't like a
segue it's almost like
she finished recording and then they
were like that was dark you should
probably go back and say something undo
all that damage yeah and it just came
off as completely unguent but but then
you've got like the person we were
talking about before is Meghan tonjes
which is not she's opposite of yes she's
she's the opposite she's a bossy body
positive person she's a little
overweight herself uh but absolutely
beautiful woman I know her I met her at
a vlogger fair for like two years now
amazing person absolutely amazing person
and she's an amazing singer too and she
took so much offense like she is a hot
this lady Megan if you met in person she
is hard person to crack like she is she
dropped to tears and her apply I have
never seen a video where she was so
bothered it's funny I I told the wife I
said oh hey Megan responded to the made
a response video I bet you she rips
Nicola new one and we watched it and I
was shocked it was completely the
opposite response I was expecting she
she literally that was the most
heartfelt thing that I've ever like like
literally watching it I almost went I
almost came to tears I was like it was
that it was that good of a video and
then like you said the comedian I can't
cut I wish I could remember his name
right now the guy with the huge beard
who ripped her apart that was funny that
was absolutely hilarious or he was
basically playing the response to every
single thing she said in that video and
that was amazing but it was one of these
things were her video definitely divided
an audience I would say the majority
definitely felt that the message she
said she was sending was hate-filled but
there was a lot of support for her to
which you know I personally at the time
found disgusting right the better what
the topic is there's always a line
there's always a line there's always
going to be and she's always gonna have
an audience and as soon as you and as
long as you have an established audience
you can keep doing what you're doing I
mean she's not gonna stop doing it if it
keeps making her famous but like we said
I mean she's getting fired from TV
programs now because she's crossed over
that line and just to be clear here
usually when a celebrity or a comedian
crosses the line right what's the first
thing that they do after they realize
they crossed that line let's just say
public apology they try to explain their
stance even if they're unapologetic like
like some people have been they still
come forward and tried to defend what
they were actually trying to do and she
did you on the other hand no she on the
other hand
playing the victim of censorship exactly
the victim of censorship she basically
stood exactly by what she said and the
tone she defended her tone and it was
very weird because if you read her
tweets she in in one minute she's saying
no I really want fat people to get
healthy again I really want them to live
on this earth blah blah blah and then
the next one is like no fat people are
 disgusting and they need to know
it so that they can fix it it's like why
is your tone flip-flopping so much yeah
you know you could use it and that's the
thing is is at the end of the day a
comedian that it's talking about
something like a good a good comedian to
be an example for this would be Lisa
Lampanelli right Lisa Lampanelli uh for
those of you that know who she is she
talks about everything she says racist
 she talks about fat people she
talks about sex and everything but she
herself is the butt end of the joke its
self-deprecating humor and she can speak
from the perspective of it because she
is in that class she's talking about
yeah and that's what in he and she don't
get me wrong she's still highly
controversial a lot of people don't
agree with the stuff she says and get
really deeply offended well but my being
is her group isn't the one you know
she's not attacking a group that she's
not a member of yeah you know what's
funny is uh hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna
ban a few people here just because I can
and I want to that's what people have
been doing it a lot lately you know this
this this also plays into the YouTube
gaming thing right where Jimmy what
Jimmy Kimball was making fun of the
youtube streaming he's like who that
would our gamers so dumb that they would
watch other gamers play games and then
he tried to he tried to play it off not
by apologizing a very large group of
people yeah I don't think he understands
just how big and strong and powerful the
gaming community is um but he will us
like on the backside a gamer gate and
stuff too so it's like it's not exactly
like the gamers are sitting happy and
you know but but look it but also look
at what happened I mean he tried to play
it off by taking the mean comments and
responding to them you know live on air
yeah which is which was of course he
only took the most asinine unintelligent
comments to try and take those and make
it look this is what gamers are like I
can't spell right they can't for
like the sentence you know and right uh
but I think boogies response to that was
absolutely amazing did you see Jimmy did
you see a bookies response to Jimmy I
did not actually I need to go watch that
definitely no no he it was a tweet so
what he said boogie tweeted Jimmy um Kim
it's Kim oh right yes he tweeted jimmy
kimmel he said Jimmy the reason why most
people watch gamers play is because
they're a lot better than we are what
we're at empting to do you know the same
reason you watch Jimmy Fallon all that
is epic yeah I read that I was like uh
hook and sinker it is done the
conversation is over that's absolutely
perfect yes I guess here let's go ahead
and wrap it up so we move on to some
tech but the reason why we want to
address can you turn down your mic
volume everyone still me to turn you
down I've already turned you down to
thirty percent and they still say you're
too loud k let me drop my gain house is
it is that better it didn't change the
old on how about now we'll just have to
let time tell all right here I dropped
it down a little bit I assume that
people complaining are first-timers here
they don't understand just how amateur
hour the show is and I'm really loud I'm
just a super loud person you are loud uh
so anyways just to wrap up the whole the
whole nicole arbour situation she kind
of set the fire that put the whole thing
in motion but it's been something that's
been a little bit of a tinderbox for a
long time and that is censorship versus
bullying basically online but at the end
of the day if your comedy is designed to
basically be hurtful in the first place
then I I don't want to watch your
but again I kind of agree with boogie at
this point that's like if you want to
sink your ship and you want to shoot
yourself in the head you want to go find
a group of toxic people yeah that's on
you but it's like well then don't walk
around going owners do domu no but the
other thing is don't call on
freedom of speech when this is a private
company and YouTube has a policy against
that type of video now you may not agree
that YouTube classifies it correctly and
again YouTube brought it back so
obviously YouTube thought that that she
was within her rights to say what you
she was about you what she said but at
the same time it's like know if
Oh gets taken down because some guys up
there and he's saying racial this and
racial that and saying that all you know
like for instance black people should be
eradicated or some like that no
that does not belong on youtube if you
want to go create your own website and
find some overseas company that will
host that and stream it knock
yourself out but youtube is not for you
to put that film it just isn't yeah all
right well let's move on to the other
topic that's guaranteed to create a
divided amongst the people's how about
that their Apple huh yeah hows about
that Apple so some of an orange feller
myself so we all know and if you don't
know this is gonna come as a bit of
shock to you but Steve Jobs died um
along it I know I know there's some
people that news takes a while to get
around to but as a 2010 wasn't it I 2011
was a 10 it's been a while I mean it's
been a long time anyway so it's been
long enough for Apple to get completely
derailed so I'm sure you guys have all
watched like them the many different
iterations of movies showing how
important Steve Jobs was to apple and
how you know he came in founded it got
kicked out got brought back because they
were failing may the company super
successful again then died and then the
company had some other troubles but
again is still making more money than
the entire US government combined but
basically Apple has been running a muck
a little bit lately without Steve at the
helm and that the two things that I want
to cite like first off would be the
Apple pencil let's go ahead and just get
like the funny ones out of the way so
the Apple pencil basically you have a
stylist that costs a hundred dollars
okay you at the end of the day that's
what you have I don't give a what
they say the feature set is on it you
have a stylist that is a hundred dollars
and the meme that is circulating the
internet right now that I guys go ahead
what but but but it's a stylist made out
of aircraft-grade aluminum and sapphire
crystal tip I don't know if that's true
yeah I'm just like it was like
adamantium and I think it was powered by
a leprechaun leprechaun pubic hair I
heard it was powered by minecraft
redstone redstone I like that yesterday
I started playing minecraft now let's
sudden I feel like you know what I'm
talking about
don't know how to make anything out of
Road stone guys I'm sorry I'm new very
new yeah mom actually i've always been i
played minecraft for like six months and
still couldn't figure out how to do half
the always had to play with other
people but look I made a door I know
door oops I accidentally pushed the
wrong button and deleted it no creepers
in my house so anyways got a hundred
dollar stylist but here's here's where
it gets funny is uh years and years and
years ago when the iphone i think was
like the iphone first generation like
when the first iphone came out Steve job
gets Steve Jobs gets up on stage in the
first thing he starts doing is ripping
on every other company for having a
stylist he basically says like it's
stupid to have a stylist who wants to
have this thing which I mean it's a
touchscreen right he made fun of it he's
like how are you gonna interface with it
a stylist you do yeah i know i watched i
watch out you know yeah 2007 so so you
know so you gotta have that for context
to understand this the apple is now
basically releasing a stylist that
they're calling a pencil because
everybody else calls and pens and styles
they want to be different so they're
like we're gonna release the Apple
pencil it's gonna be a hundred dollars
because you know Apple they did they
really like those really super high
price points you know the packaging's
probably cost more than the product in
to produce uh so now you've got this
hundred dollars stylist and Steve Jobs
himself basically win on record saying
that nobody should ever have to use a
stylists the dumbest thing ever
invented every other remembers remember
remember when Steve Jobs did a visual
aid of how the how the interaction of
your device should always work he held
up as fast yeah yeah no no and so so so
in everybody knows it's still pretty
much fresh in everybody's mind
especially the Apple fanboys that have
been there for the whole time but it's
just really strange that now Steve's out
of the picture and you have two things
that I don't think Steve would have ever
gone for and one that's a smart watch
and the other one is the stylist now now
to kind of segue away from the stylist
cuz what he get a SmartWatch have its
own stylist I know it's a little
toothpick um so the SmartWatch I have
one guys I went bought an Apple watch
and it was it was like yeah I know
exactly I was like five hundred dollars
i had to alvin it was the new shiny and
no no the one that I got was the Apple
watch sport and I got the warranty thing
with it because you know being a watch I
smash those things and break them all
the time so I get to watch and
I have pretty high expectations for it
now to give you guys some background I
had a pebble I didn't like the pebble
that's just me but it was more of a
gripe I had with the company in their
quality control than the product itself
and you do have some rent videos about
your pebble actually I didn't put any of
them online I did I shot up I added them
and never published any of them because
they were just they were just too toxic
I didn't want that tell event well then
i miss i must be remembering our
conversations offline about it then oh
yeah I over a all over pebble
in a lot of our tank tops but all over a
lot of things there including with the
pages is what weather idol I don't like
pepper because the company not because
of the product pebble a lot of people
really love it because the only smart
watch you only have to charge like once
a week and it does what it does fairly
well before we go forward on this yeah i
need to get my apple music playing did
your Apple music something right all
right you just you just kind of keep
going and I'll to start playing it when
I find it here nice okay so anyways guys
I get the Apple watch previously i own
the Microsoft SmartWatch do you guys
remember that you probably don't because
Microsoft really sucked ass at marketing
for a lot of their products especially
hardware back in the day but anyways
there was like five different watches
that Microsoft made through through
various different manufacturers and they
all ran their little operating system
and it was just a liquid crystal display
it was actually very similar to what the
pebble is today but overly complicated
and the charging mechanism never work
I've decided what I want to do here is
at the end of this segment I want you to
let's see how long is this file this
file or this this song here is 33
seconds long oh we lost that we lost the
Jerry don't think I didn't disconnect
them there you are okay I didn't
disconnect you you just gotta cut out
the last thing I heard from you was 33
seconds no I your camera's not on oh it
isn't oh I better fix it hold on hold on
technical difficulties well there you
see me here we go boom there we are okay
um so the little apple music thing is 33
seconds long so at the end of this
segment I want you to kind of think
about like a 33 second commercial for
this for the pen or the pencil you got
and we'll do an improv or you get to do
an improv pencil at
we're doing it we're talking to do so I
pray to go we'll do it at the end of
this segment okay so so guys back to the
back to the SmartWatch so I had the
Microsoft SmartWatch it was okay it was
kind of gimmicky uh pretty much all I
used it for was whether in time I mean
that's how that's how worthless it was
it didn't really do anything with your
phone and it received everything over
radio frequency like we're not even
talking like cell cell tower stuff here
we're talking just rate just pure radio
frequency um and they didn't work
everywhere anyways that was a long time
oh daddy got Apple coming out with again
this is what Apple kind of does
Microsoft drops the ball and is way
ahead of their time so now Apple steps
up something that I don't think Steve
Jobs would ever have approved and
releases the watch and the watch
basically is another interface to the
phone without the phone the watch just
tells time it doesn't do anything beyond
that right so i put on my watch and the
build quality on it seems nice the touch
interface on it's actually pretty
responsive and the screen looks great I
think it's awesome I'm not wearing it
right now yeah and the reason being is
the software is beyond buggy on not only
that it makes you it makes you act like
a complete dick to people you're talking
to what i mean by that was how many
times are you talking to Perillo and
like because of how animated you have to
flip your wrist over to make it respond
kasee yeah it's supposed to be lift your
arm and it just turns on but it never
does you have to do the whole but but at
vloggerfair I kept seeing I kept seeing
Chris had to do have to do the very
animated like yeah and like look at his
arm and he was very he was very act like
very stern and the way he brought up his
arm CP sit there talking to him he'd go
to check a notification when almost
looks like ah what time is it yeah you
know this conversations over because you
know there's the time yeah like the way
he had to bring his arm up just to make
it respond it almost looked like he's
telling you like oh yeah look at the
time I gotta go I feel like like like
steve jobs seriously would have just
thrown the thing in the garbage and not
even continued and the reason why i say
it as is you make a good point one thing
we know about Steve Jobs is that he
always wanted the experience to be a
polished one right he was all about it
appearing to be more like magic than
science Yeah right and then you've got
the SmartWatch here's the bugs that I've
run into that I that I just pissed me
off like this is why I'm not wearing it
today every time you need to see you
gotta flip your wrist over
flip it back right which which which
looks like you're like you know I don't
know masturbating something with a very
very crooked penis but now that you've
got that vision stuck in your head uh
with the with the watch you have to do
that but not only that but when you're
doing directions like I was tellin ya
you're welcome when you do when you have
the GPS software load done it only works
with Apple maps which we all know it
Apple maps are the worst they'll drive
like seriously they'll just steer you
off a cliff into the ocean doesn't
matter lemmings mode and so you drive
along and it pops up and I love how it's
supposed to work if it worked right I
would love it it taps your wrist with a
cool sensation it's not a vibration it's
more of a tap you look down and it says
which way to turn and how far to turn
it's like just very very simple
information the problem is half the time
it's super delayed and you miss your
turn before you get the damn screen up
and then the other thing is if anybody
sent you an SMS message or calls your
phone while you're doing it it flips the
screen away from your directions and
then when you're done with that
interaction it doesn't go back to the
directions so you have to basically go
open apps go back to the thing reopen my
Apple maps right on this thing and it's
so so it ruins it like basically I don't
even use it for navigation anymore
because I've missed so many damn turns
and then when you sync it to the iphone
it siri up on the iphone you pull
up i phone you hold down the button for
Syria and Siri just sits there doesn't
it doesn't make the ding noise it
doesn't wait for you and a lot of people
have reported the same issue I'll be
they've done to software updates they
haven't fixed it I'll be honest I don't
know how much this is making it up to
YouTube right now because I think
YouTube is having a problem oh I've got
upstream health as good on my end I've
got zero drop frames and we've been live
for 31 minutes but like YouTube is just
not responding for me well I'm watching
the stream the stream still going but
then again it's delayed by you know who
knows oh so you're hearing yourself talk
though yeah oh let me so obviously we're
still yep yep no we're still we're still
going hey there brother it's probably a
node issue on my end then at least Im de
Monte yeah I don't know we still look
good on the stream stream still looks
live if it's it's weird how I can up I
can send up to youtube without any
problems right now but I'm I can't
actually view the YouTube watch page
right now weird yeah and we should still
working so don't touch anything Jay and
skype still says the internet connection
problem between you and I but clearly
that's not the case yep so guys in a
nutshell the Apple watch is
it's honestly not ready for primetime
Steve Jobs never would have green
letting it interferes with the phone
this it's probably what about six six or
eight months I want to say still have
this many problems after that long no no
and there's been two song or they claim
that there's what the the second version
of the OS is dropping you know with
their latest announcements hopefully
they address a lot of these problems um
but it's all stuff that shouldn't have
shipped yeah like I mean they're bad
issues that anybody like testing this
thing for 15 minutes on a lunch break
would encounter these issues and they
continued forward like here here's one
that really pisses me off is Dick Tracy
right everybody likes the dick tracy
have the watch where you could talk on
it right that's like so now you can
finally do that with the Apple watch but
the speaker and it is so quiet that even
just driving down the road with the
windows like rolled up in your car just
the engine noise or the wind noise is
enough to completely kill that speaker
and you can't hear unless you put it up
to your ear like this mm-hmm and this
got calls gone again her than to just
have it just piss off a bunch of people
my video again didn't you yeah the video
is going along they push a little button
now back I need to redo my network here
I've got a really crazy bridging bridge
to a bridge of a bridge type of system
and its I've actually got some hardware
that was sent to me to kind of redo the
network here so we'll see I'm typing in
cherry now technical difficulties are
just a feature of tech top it's not
really technical difficulty though the
stream still going right yeah but they
said audios lagging and I could even see
it over here it was like jumping and no
for a second for a second there it did
hiccup okay no no it looks like a smooth
now everything she was working all right
but Apple watch not-ready-for-prime-time
it's literally just gonna sit on the
charger on my nightstand until another
software update drops that hopefully
addresses some of these issues but I was
really disappointed for something that
costs so much it was developed by Apple
was just what just just had such a bad
experience it was nothing like the
iPhone at all but yea even the
experience on the iphone has gotten a
little bit less than desirable no that's
true that's true and that thing is when
we sunk the eye for cinco watch to the
iphone it creates some new bugs on the
iPhone itself it's almost think of virus
and away to the iphone the AI virus
the I virus isn't it like I said Cirie
works flawlessly you literally have it
shall I think the watch to it then you
literally have to wear the virus alright
so should we do that should we do the
commercial for the Apple pencil alright
let me get the music cued up let's do
this I i cant see chat or anything so uh
oh wait there we go it's loaded for me
now so let me bring up the chatter all
right guys we're gonna go ahead and do
Jerry's gonna do a 33 second commercial
about the eye pencil and well the Apple
pencil remember we don't call em right I
forgot Steve's dead so I is no longer
used I forgot all right we still call it
iphone ipad imac i know it's very
confusing don't try to understand it'll
hurt it'll hurt your brain so all right
on the count of three you can take it
away you know what you can say do ya
know i'm getting just figure it out as
it go all right three two one and go do
you find you have an iOS device that you
operate with your finger well that's
probably because Steve Jobs told you at
one point to using a stylus is for poor
people well guess what Apple has
unveiled to honor Steve Jobs memory long
after he's passed not the stylist but
the Apple pencil we're talking about
cylindrical aluminum approximately the
length of two fingers and only costing
you a hundred dollars actually only
ninety-nine dollars because if they put
three digits in there it might look
offensive so guys get your eye pencil
today and start using your device like
Microsoft did ten years ago it was that
close you would about six seconds long
but I didn't have to you have to look at
my visual aid on the on the two fingers
oh did you put so did you put stuff up
on the screen no I just more or less did
a physical response to use the size of
two fingers society okay I'll wait for
the stream to catch up but uh but
honestly ok so now now we've kind of
ribbed apple now let's actually give
them some praise for some cool stuff
that they did ok so the new iphone 6s
and 6 plus actually come with a new
feature called 3d touch which is fairly
innovative I don't know how well it's
going to work in practice but it's cool
because now they've got pressure
sensitivity on the screen so now they
can actually chain
change the function between a slight
touch and a hard push so that's going to
give you kind of a third dimension all I
see you finger side by side oh yeah they
didn't say three fingers that might have
been the shocker how can you tell the
difference between a slight touch and a
big push oh yeah you know it that's what
she said Jay oh so so the whole 3d touch
feature i think is actually kind of cool
what do you think about that Jay do you
think about something that you could
actually get used to is giving you
another dimension of control over your
device like put touching an icon versus
pushing it what are you doin nothin guys
I cannot see what Jay does and I can't
hear what he does either like other than
none I'm gonna give it a hard push you
gonna give it a hard push do you like to
give it a hard push on the front or the
back of the device oh god here we go it
just it just isn't a live stream plus
unless Jay drops ass at some point so uh
so another cool thing about the new
iphones in this and this is hilarious is
they emphasize that they made them out
of much stronger aluminum and much
stronger glass and all I could think
about when I heard that feature was ben
de this is like the response to oh
were embarrassed that our that our
phones basically grumpy over if you
think that Lou is gonna see if he can if
you could push a finger through the
glass I think Lou's gonna put it under a
drill press like he'll do whatever it
takes to get I go guys it didn't
actually hold up against my carbide bit
uh oh I'm gonna predict this Jay and I
are gonna predict this right now that on
launch day within a half an hour of the
device going public you're gonna have
Lou from unbox therapy driving over it
with a dump truck like I'm just going to
predict it at this point and be like it
is not dump truck proof because that
would be hilarious Lou if you're
watching this please please make that
happen oh yeah like Lou is watching this
I know right he's too busy flying around
and as f-18 Hornet over California
anyways uh better cameras front and back
that was to be expected right faster
processor a nine chip so again to be
expected and they have a new photography
feature which they touted is moving
photos and I just thought to myself
video anyone
moving up in here photos capture your
moment is moving photos now they've got
like some moving photos I don't know
anything about it but I just when I hear
moving photo i think i think idea i
think i think back in nineteen forty
tuna going to see tucker show the flickr
shell yeah even have like a little thing
on the edge of a finger flip it they
have I flip the I flip there it is dude
they're gonna steal that from us and
make like a billion dollars so uh so the
other device that they announced was the
all new Apple TV all be honest uh when I
was over at chris pirillo house he had
an apple TV and I thought it was pretty
cool i'll tell you the only thing I
really thought it was really cool is
that you could mirror your iOS device to
the TV and it was perfect it was like
leg free could play games on the TV your
audios on the TV I only wanted to get it
for that one reason and I never got
around to getting one because like
honestly I didn't really care like it
wasn't that big of a deal to me but the
new Apple TV they got a version for
sixty nine dollars in a version for I
think 150 969 dollars but it's actually
got some part somebody pointed out that
compuserve was first to the gift officer
was noise our America actually basically
basically they did a movement picture
and get back into the control panel
we're gonna go ahead and end tonight
stream yep we're gonna go ahead and shut
it down dory our last topic was amazon
stops selling the fire smartphone and
we'll style we'll just move that off the
next week or if we talk about it at all
I mean after all it is a it is a fire
it's the fire fun like nobody even knows
what we're talking about anyways are
like what a phone from amazon that makes
no sense yep and my AMD nano video is
gonna go live tomorrow so if you guys
want to check that out feel free but
other than that that is it I am turning
this off and I'm going to go hang out
with family and probably play some
minecraft tonight sweet i'm gonna try to
shoot my vlog and not have my lavell ear
