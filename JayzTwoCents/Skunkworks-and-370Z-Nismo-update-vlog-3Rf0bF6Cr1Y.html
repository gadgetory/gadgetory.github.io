are starting work on skunk works finally
with its specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance free plug and play
operation the EVGA 980 TI hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
so the orange build is moving forward
we're going to go ahead and start some
of the blog's here and I know I already
did a vlog showing you some of the parts
I was putting in and because of the
fiasco I had with the block on the
motherboard not fitting I decided I was
gonna go ahead and change a few other
things while I was in there completely
unnecessary and mostly cosmetic but hey
that's that's the story of my life so I
got all the new stuff that I needed
there the new block for the motherboard
that fits it properly this right here is
actually the clear Evo block I'm gonna
be using I've got to clean it a little
bit of blue chilling in there right now
from this was actually the one that was
in the apartment build we got a new
supremacy Evo right here in black that
I've got to find a use for I actually
cannot find the installation kit for
this I don't know what to do with it
some lost somewhere in the water cooling
closet anyway I've already installed the
motherboard blocks the proper ones on
here I'll show you guys those I'm it but
we're going to start with doing the
orange tops here on the corsair
dominator
Platinum Ram a lot of folks have asked
Jay where did you get those tops holy
crap what are the colors are available I
got this directly from course there
that's why they're packaged like this
because they're not for sale
individually they have a special edition
16 gigabyte kit of RAM of the Dominator
platinum series because you're chirping
birds and stuff the windows open it's a
nice day outside oh and there's the
coolant as you guys can see it has not
fallen out with just one of the reasons
why I mixed it and let it sit I want to
see if it would fall out and it has sit
mixed in perfectly in the PCP or coolant
there from primo chill mixed with some
Mayhem's orange dye but anyway so they
have the orange tops that are part of a
kit already and I requested these
individually which they graciously sent
but normally you cannot buy these
individually so
want to kind of put that out there what
I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna go
ahead and put the tops on you're just
some tiny tiny tiny a bit of focus come
on focus these are some really small
allen heads right they're very small as
you can see compared to my fat thumb
there so I was lucky enough it actually
had a Torx bit that fit in there just
fine I think it's like a t1 or t2 like
something super small but anyway we want
to change those out and then we'll see
how they look so I've got the top bar
off of one of the corsair dominator
platinum sticks and i want to show you
here kind of how the screws work as you
can see they just sort of push through
and then kind of like where's my fingers
at look Rep they just kind of like clamp
together they go away through the hole
there both sides of the holes this is
the most festive Christmas baby in all
of Christmas this is the most festive
baby you know hey say hi Internet no
don't grab the memory oh man she's
reaching for the ramp say hi Internet
say hi Internet hi yeah you freaky good
right now one thing to keep in mind is
these are not the lighted bars but some
of these like special edition ones or
lighted versions have kind of like
see-through cutouts right here that LEDs
that are in between the heat spreader
right here right down in there will
light on both ends and then you've got a
plastic bar very similar to this that
will just kind of it'll sit in there and
then light will reflect through the bar
and then show up through the top right
here so I just want to kind of show how
that works for some folks who may have
never seen the inside of Dominator Ram I
don't I do not have the lighted version
so we won't be seeing any lights on
these unfortunately I'm in cool lab
orange LEDs though right
then you get out how to use Corsair link
which I don't want to use anyway all
right so here they are yeah I mean I
want to mention this real quick a lot of
people ask me why I got the orange tops
instead of just taking these off and
painting these a
question especially since that's pretty
much the option most of you guys would
have to go because like I said these are
not readily available by themselves to
the public so because I had the option
of getting these you know that being a
big youtuber in the PC space does have
its benefits and I do like to leverage
that when I can I want the orange tops
because they're anodized they're not the
paint is it gonna flake off I have to
worry about taking the time to paint in
or worry about the tolerances for these
small holes is you fit pretty snug on
the RAM and it's not going to cover up
where it says Dominator ddr4 it's gonna
all show however these are very very
paintable it's very easy so it's
something that I would I mean we're
going to keep these around in case I
ever change the color scheme again I can
paint these and then take the orange
tops off but I'm always a fan of
anodizing when you can get it I mean
these are aluminum or aluminium
depending on which you know country
you're from then you guys would know
aluminum when you when you anodized it
you basically put it in a chemical bath
the pores open up it absorbs the dye and
then the metal itself becomes that color
doesn't flake off isn't scratch off or
chip she strengthens the aluminum as
well so I like anodizing when you can
and it's actually a pretty good pretty
good color match to all the other orange
I'm going to be using so yeah there's
that it's going look at the motherboard
so here's the motherboard my SOC
champion you guys saw the video of me
trying to put on the other block which
fit down here but the vrm block did not
fit as you can see here is uh some
people might automatically be going what
the heck J why is it clear plexi and
nickel
well that's because ek for whatever
reason has not made a black version for
the motherboard but this is all it's
available so I decided to go ahead and
switch like I said all of the blocks to
clear including the ones for the
graphics cards now this is one of the
blocks right here it's actually on a 980
TI I already had this block so I haven't
sent me two more that way I have to
waste one this is what it's going to
look like granted this one here has the
Chrome or nickel plated back I won't be
using that I'll be putting the black
ones on I like it for a couple of
reasons one it's going to be lighter
because it doesn't carry all the way to
the end
and two I'm going to be able to see
inside because if you remember I said I
have a feeling that my block on the
Titans might be getting clogged in there
because the temperatures have been
steadily going up and the flow inside
the loop is very very poor so I'm going
to be taking out the other blocks and I
figured instead of disassembling them
and cleaning them I'm gonna do a
separate video on that that won't indict
you know will determine how long my
system is down so I'm going to be
putting the clear blocks in like this
all around plus you'll be able to see
the orange fluid in there which is going
to be really nice at least if I was
looking up at the system and I'll have
an inverted systems you won't see it but
you'll see the orange going through here
through the CPU block and through the
VRMs so I just wanted to show that yeah
we'll do that what I'm gonna do right
now too is I'm going to get this kind of
situated here I'm going to put my 5820k
in here just so that I could get it
spaced up properly and that's actually
wrong it's bugging me right there there
we go I might take this bracket off
right here and paint it orange as well
because that black kind of stands out as
being improper I don't know we'll see
we'll see what I do a lot of these
builds I just sort of do them I don't
plan out everything very very very well
I just sort of go I think you guys
noticed that but anyway I got to clean
that blue out like I said I've got to
switch the internal jet in there for the
x99 or the 2011 socket that way we have
a proper flow right now that's set for
z97 or you know like 4790k 6700 KX that
our Exeter anyway well figure out these
fittings and how all this is going to go
together because as you can see we've
got a lot of fittings really close
together here here here here here and
here that all of these have to tie in
and I want it to look neat at the same
time and that's what she looks like with
the orange Ram eye bits it's funny how
it doesn't look like the rims covers
we're gonna match the orange on the
motherboard but they they do they look
pretty damn good let's take the fluid oh
just kind of put that over here too so
you can see we got a pretty nice shade
of orange going snap orange it's more of
a burnt orange but I really like the way
that that looks that looks really really
good
and
it's flowing all through the blocks and
you know you're gonna have three of
these bad boys chilling in there it's
not gonna look so bad
I one of the things I mentioned earlier
that I did too was I'm replacing all of
the fittings in my system with the if
you really see that I'm replacing them
with nickel-plated fittings instead of
black and I've got all new nickel-plated
revolver fittings for the hardline
tubing because I just kind of want to
bring a little bit of bling to the
system I've always thought orange and
bling looked really good like Chrome or
nickel plating so we're redoing all of
these fittings as well completely
unnecessary but just fun so why wouldn't
we there we go all clean and now it's
got the proper jet plate in there for
2011 - great so this is going to be a
challenge we looked at look how close
together these are um I want this side
to be the inlet I don't it doesn't
matter which order it goes in whether it
goes chipset CPU vrm or CPU chipset vrm
and now it doesn't matter it's all going
to be the same at the end of the day not
to mention this does not really get very
hot this is just honestly is going to be
a lot of aesthetics here the VRMs can
get pretty hot during overclocking but
again I guess it's not going to matter
at the end of the day but I think it
looks good as you can see I went with
all the nickel-plated fittings so it's
going to look really good but right now
we're going to do a little bonus content
here in this blog I'm going to head over
to the Nissan Fontana Nissan race shop
which has my car right now we'll do a
little blog over there we'll talk with
Chris who's a GTR master mechanic
working on my car and we'll just kind of
do some sneak peek of what's coming up
with the 370z Nismo if you don't follow
me on social media you should because
you would already know that I bought a
370z Nismo to replace the 350 automatic
transmission
you gotta take out all the exhaust
and they still have carbon-fiber
driveshafts in three 70s right
I did like carbon-fiber driveshafts
resonators there so I imagine what he's
in here he inspects all like for a lot
burying and all that stuff you don't
typically replace that unless it goes
bad or does that come with the new
clutch kit alright guys so this is Chris
over here master mechanic at mesa
fontana nissan race shop works on mostly
stuff like this over here gt-r their
gt-r they're made a little time for my
little poor man sports car are literally
doing right now I'm installing a new
pilot bushing it was pretty tough
good bad so that's my new lightweight
flywheel right yes sir is there a is
there a vetting process that happens
with a new clutch like this just
drunk-drive reserved for about 500 miles
okay that's going to be hard most
spirited driving okay so we did the what
JWT wolf kit on this right correct so
let's consider the stage - absolutely
so what's that going to be like compared
to the OEM clutch and pedal feel om
clutch pedal feel is going to be the
same the advantage to this flywheel
it's going to rev up faster because
there's less rotating mass it did feel
like this car read pretty slow you know
when in neutral if I read it I don't
know if maybe the electronic throttle
just wasn't responding as fast it's in
neutral they felt kind of slow the
difference in Y won't wait is probably
about 10 to 15 pounds right and that's a
lot of unsprung weight there to be
turning correct all right so that will
hopefully get some revs up quicker there
am I gonna smell anything while this is
breaking in if I'm driving it gingerly
probably not okay
what the old Fletcher look like this it
right here I'm curious as to what that
pressure plate looked like because it
was stinky if I got on it
there's your flywheel hot spotted him
everything okay so this is all bad right
for me with the doing proud neutral draw
or clutch drops and burnouts most likely
but you can see the glazed portion of
the actual oh yeah course plate or so so
just blazing here this why I was getting
some intermittent flipping that's where
I was slipping up if it wasn't slipping
all the time but every now and then it
seemed like it would just randomly slip
on me so I know if it was pressure plate
or what both see your heart so your hot
spots on your pressure plate so I made
the right call then thinking it didn't
feel right right
hey not bad for a guy who owned an
automatic okay so this is Scott Scott is
my parts guy here at Fontana Nissan and
you were founded the ratio I did how
long ago was that I was a 7 years ago
and why did you do that I mean
dealerships aren't normally synonymous
with performance shops or more to sports
well seven years ago I met the owner
and friends and he wanted to surah
nother company gave me a folding table
and put me on the stairs make it happen
so so it helps having a dealer owner
that's enthusiast yes you know just a
parts guy you also have unlimited class
Sentra right I do
b14 Sentra about 400 horsepower to the
wheels I think looks light though it's
gated right it's really good at caged
and custom arrow the car weighs about
2300 pounds so it's very sensitive in
every which way with for turning
breaking everything it does really well
right but uh drive it
I've got a friend that loves his GTI
Golf and I keep telling him I personally
can't drive a front-wheel drive if I get
into like a good simulator with a
front-wheel drive car I'm off the track
because it's backwards from rear-wheel
drive in terms of getting on the
throttle you turn wide get off the
throttle it turns in which is you know
obviously in a rear-wheel drive car you
get on the throttle mid-turn you start
to go wider start to a swing out so it's
so backwards from what I'm used to
yeah things just gotta be brave and
trust the car you know if the car starts
you know losing grip and you're over
steering your tendency would be to lift
on the throttle whereas with a frontal
Drive you actually gonna stay on it and
let your front tires play out of it so
you also a moto enthusiast right
I am so you're a motorcycle rider as
well as a racecar driver these are facts
all right so go ahead well you got a
channel don't ever what about your
channels our channel is The Adventures
of Scott and carry on on YouTube put a
link I'll put a link in the description
to so you guys can see it and they say
my my girlfriend and I were motovloggers
basically you'll follow us on our
adventures whether it be supermoto do
sports or on sport bikes
I like when you and your girlfriend are
riding because you have radio with each
other so you can hear each other's audio
yes as you know your you've got two
different camera perspectives hers and
yours and you switch back and forth and
your editing between what's going on
seems like she's always breaking down
though I see a lot of first starts with
lift up with that that is their super
motors which is fine right oh we're
having issues with Bob with the battery
because she went to that supermoto day
and fell in love with him right yes we
went to a SoCal supermoto school and she
had a blast and two weeks later she had
a supermoto to the collection so there
you guys I mean you can see right there
is he's not where the hell am i okay
he's not only a place i racecar driver
but he's a motorcycle rider it goes out
and does videos on that with a female
which is already like Rare she's she's a
unicorn right she seemed like a pretty
confident rider - I don't do motorcycles
not because I don't trust myself but I
don't trust anyone else on the road so
you guys already braver than me so this
question actually came for one of my
followers the accubow no compares to the
Brembo doing a very similar design right
acavano versus Brembo which one and why
Akebono with a few modifications or
better break 5
modifications as in like rotors ok
advances rotors cosmos slaughters will
have you the Brembos are smaller
350z were 13-inch rotors but they cool
better right so it's just for my
experiences and feedback with customers
who track their car the small upgrade as
an brake rotors will take away a lot of
the great vibrations near the warped
rotors so obviously with my 3:50 having
a brand new you know rebuilt Brembo
system on there it's the track version
so from 2004 but with like you said the
upgraded stop Tech's lotted rotors
stainless steel lines and the higher
temp brake fluid quite a few people have
driven my car said it feels like you've
got a lot of initial bike with my brakes
via this car in its current condition
doesn't that's why I'm having you do
stainless steel brakes and flush it new
pads do you think a lot of the
sponginess I feel right now is just wear
and tear these brakes possibly but the
initial
bike is in the pad material right really
fun field
you're going to feel spongy just go away
with the stainless steel brake right
like I kind of scared myself a little
bit in this car when I first got in it
because I'm used to that initial bite to
where I felt like I had to push the
pedal down a quarter to a half to really
get it to start fighting so I'm hoping
when you put the HP s because we're
doing HKS pads in this right yeah with
the stainless steel lines that it's
going to feel better yeah do you think
it will go proper braking yes and then
the still and intakes we're doing I hear
you hear a lot of you know the intakes
don't make a huge difference but
apparently Stillen has stumbled onto
some science with where they put their
map sensor versus the length of the tube
so people are seeing real-world anywhere
from 10 to 17 wheel horsepower
improvements even though the filter is
going to be tucked up above the crash
beam behind the nose so there's not
going to even be necessarily a high
pressure zone there so it's not like a
ram effect but you said you sold a lot
of them and you've had a lot of good
experience with them
yeah because there's a lot of options
out there when it comes to intakes and
you know you've got a e/m that brings it
down kneel behind the wheel well here
you've got KNN typhoon which is you know
up in the engine bay with some block off
plates to try and block heat in turn
also Mixon they come down here right
those people complain our water yeah so
well
Yeah right right in other states for the
a lot of rain it's funny though you got
a lot of cold weather guys who don't
worry about engine cooler or coolers as
much but here in the desert that's like
the biggest thing sitting in traffic
I'm Thanksgiving Day when I bought this
it was 65 degrees in the oil Tim still
got to 240 in traffic and we're talking
you know the car may be solved 2,000 rpm
for 20 miles and it still got up to
crept up to 240 degrees on a 63 degree
day I mean that was crazy that bugged me
when I saw that we got some things to do
this car Chris is the man that Scott
said is we want working on your car so
if you guys own a Nissan and you want
the best work done in Southern
California apparently people drive in
from out of state to see this guy so we
got a we've got the Jays two cents of
PARs working on my car right now just
like people from around the world want
my computers they want his automotive
work done okay so I just saw how long
this blog went so I'm gonna go ahead and
end this one now guys I know it's a
little different car stuff I've only
done car things one other time on the
main channel but it's stuff that I'm
into so I know I'm not the only one
that's into that stuff I thought I'd go
ahead and share it but I also wanted the
point of this blog to be that as you can
see we do have things underway with the
build and as you can see things are a
little bit messy it's kind of the way I
like it though I like it when things are
a little disheveled and as I've pointed
on the livestream that box right there
is going to have parts for the bill but
I'm going to be doing Oh next week I
hope we're gonna be doing a giveaway of
a computer yay all right guys time to
get out of here thanks for watching
follow on Twitter and Facebook and all
that fun stuff in Instagram and I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
