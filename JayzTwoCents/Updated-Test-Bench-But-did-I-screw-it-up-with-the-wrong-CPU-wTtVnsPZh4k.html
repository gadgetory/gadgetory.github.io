we may or may not be seeing new graphics
cards in the near or not near future and
that's why this test bench exists I
built this test bench years ago and it
has seen a lot of revisions and changes
but the only thing that really gets
changed on here often is the graphics
card obviously now we've been running
the 8700 K on here pretty much ever
since the 8th gen launched and the
reason why I've been doing that is
because I've always heard and even
preached myself that the more cores you
add and the more threads you add the
less performance you actually get in
games somewhat negligible depending on
the graphics card in the game a lot of
different variables
so that's admittedly why I've left the
8700 K on here for so long even though I
used to run X 299 and X 99 on here
forever actually no I never ran X 299
that's what we're in do today I am
preparing for the new launches by
putting on my X 299 dark from EVGA an
amazing overclocking motherboard
extremely over built vrm and the reason
for that is I'm finally taking my 79 80
XE out of the box which I've never used
for any project because this was such a
none practical CPU so I figured might as
well test that theory are we going to
lose performance by going from 80 700 K
to the 79 80 XE that's why we're using
this board because the vrm can actually
take it without exploding but I just
realize I probably have too small the
power supply now but that's okay MSI
brings ultra thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz 1080p
panel nvidia graphics and 8th gen intel
cpus make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more and how to preorder by
following the link in the description
below
so I'm only gonna be running two
benchmarks here to give me sort of a
baseline because what tends to happen
from one platform to the next and it was
especially when you're dealing with
Intel to Intel like until the AMD is
obviously a whole different story but we
tend to see whatever happens in a couple
of benchmarks kind of follows suit all
the way through with a few variables and
exceptions but it's also very important
to point out a couple of things one
we're not just switching to more cores
we're also switching to more memory
channels the mainstream CPUs on Intel
only used dual channel single single or
dual whereas the X platform of the
extreme platform can use anywhere
between one two three or four channels
so we are gonna be setting this up in
quad channel give me us more memory
bandwidth we're gonna be setting up
obviously more memory because of that
this is going to be having 32 gigs
versus 16 gigs over here I don't think
that's gonna have a huge impact on
things but we could always pull out two
sticks of rams to compare that and
that's another video coming up where
we're testing the 2018 version of does
memories memory capacity matter with
games I did that back in like 2013 but
things have obviously changed since then
so we're gonna do our baseline test
right here this is Metro last light I
still really like this because it's
definitely a good CP or a GPU test and
what we're looking for here is
bottlenecking with the CPU or I hate
that word it's not really bottling we're
just trying to get numbers to compare
settings wise though we are running 1920
by 1080 quality is very high texture
filtering is at 16x motion blur normal
tessellation very high the reason we're
not running 4k right now is we want to
see if at the higher frame rates that
we're gonna get with 1080 obviously
offloads a lot of that duty to the cpu
to handle all those frames we're gonna
see whether or not we get a big
difference there we've tested into the
ground
what happens with 4k where CPU is was
less important with 4k than GPU that's
why we won't be testing it today if you
want to see the 4k results and just add
4k to your search bar and you'll find
something so
I could smell the half PS okay so here's
our result we ran this test what four
times four times and we were pretty much
within plus or minus 2 or 3 FPS highest
we saw was a 193 Louis was a one eighty
nine point five three average frame rate
a couple things I want talk about here
Oh quick one the 8700 K is running with
sync all cores on the Asus BIOS which
means it's not adding more frequency but
it is making all the course run at the
same frequency it's a setting I always
leave on number two I thought this
seemed a little bit low and I went and
looked at my original 1080 TI review not
of this exact card the msi card and you
could see in 1080 with the same settings
we were getting 220 FPS and then I
looked at this video and realized I was
running X 99 at that time but then I'm
sin you're looking at trying to figure
out what was running to maybe make me be
losing approximately was that about ten
percent no fifteen percent close to 15
percent whatever the number is Phil come
annotate with the number was but it
dawned on me we weren't dealing with the
spectres and meltdown issue back then
and we have significantly seen a
performance reduction in in total max
FPS at really high frame rates like this
after Spector and meltdown was patched
perfect example skunkworks is still
running Windows 8 and a 69 50 x10 core
20 thread and it is faster than my D
frame running a 7900 X that's
overclocked on water with two Titan X
Peas little peas which are faster GPUs
than my regular Titan X Pascal cards on
skunkworks skunkworks beats it in all
fps testing it beats it in 3d mark and
it beats it in PC mark specifically
because of this vector and meltdown
patching so that just shows you how much
power or how much FPS you actually lost
with that so these are out new baselines
right now at least for this test one
eighty nine point five three and we're
gonna go ahead and run now far cry 5 use
its synthetic and see what that goes the
only thing we did the GPU though we
didn't overclock it we just allow power
limit to go higher so it wouldn't do any
sort of throttling with power limitation
and then we up the fan curve to make it
a little bit more aggressive because we
want consistent results so
yeah apparently now we have to patch Far
Cry 5 this is hold spend a week away and
everything has to be updated
far cry 5 in ultra settings 123 average
FPS twice in a row so I'm going with
that number 123 so now we've got a swap
over stuff and do it again why are you
playing the RAM out because I'm shallow
I wanted to use the burnt Ram I just
can't do it I can't do it and I've got
this beautiful set of white and black
corsair dominator which will just look
so good on this test bench loo this this
guy that's got look good moment of truth
exception not handled what the 79 80 XC
and all of its 18 cores and 36 threads
of glory obviously before we do our
benchmarks of the GPU I want to see what
happens with our CPU make sure
everything's running fine and just see
all of these cores just look at that oh
 I hit 84 instantly 85 86 4318
cinnamon score now you know I can't help
myself and to keep things fair
I was running 4.7 sync all cores on the
8700 K which is as much as I wanted to
push it with the water cooling and
attempts we were seeing so I've been
playing around now for about an hour
with my overclock to figure out where I
want to dial it in and this is where
I've decided 4.5 gigahertz it's actually
doing it at 1.2 volts
yeah golden ship probably Bend so now
that I'm convinced that I am good and
I'm stable now we're gonna go ahead and
run the same benchmarks again that's
what all this was for the benchmarks did
I now skew results moving forward this
may seem an awful lot like the does core
count affect your games video I did not
that long ago but that was just an 8700
K we at a 6 core 12 thread and I were
disabled cores and hyper threading with
the same chip now we're going from 6
cores to 18 cores with 32 36 threads
which is a significant gap there and I
forgot to turn on MSI Afterburner
smell the half PS but surprisingly
here's the thing our average frame rate
came up to 200 point seven one here's
what's interesting about that we ended
up putting raising and reason why MSI
Afterburner is open right here as we
raised our power limit to one hundred
and twenty percent so we're allowing it
to draw 20% more power tbp than it's set
to from Nvidia's you know bass and we
also set a higher fan curve this is the
exact same settings that I ran on the
8700 K what did not happen over there
while running our Metro last light was
we never saw the power limiter come on
member how it jumps up and down says
power power power that tells you when
you're hitting power limit we saw that
during this test we saw we were hitting
power limit which tells us that worth it
looks like we were potentially I don't
say bottlenecking bottlenecking is not
the right term but we were limiting the
amount of FPS 8,700 could handle while
we sent a ton of FPS like this to it so
I'm gonna run this test one more time
because you can't just run a test one
time and get you know your result but I
want to see if it does it again if we
start seeing power kick on if we if it
does then we'll know that the CPU is
actually allowing the graphics card to
just run balls to the wall as hard as it
possibly can power limit did not come on
as much this time
oh there was once once more at least we
saw it a couple times 200 point for
another 200 so okay Metro last light at
least that title benefits from more
cores now going from 6 to 18 it's not
examine we can what 1 FPS per not even
an FPS per quarter so our last test here
in Far Cry 5 with ultra settings we had
consistent back-to-back runs of 123 FPS
average so our average FPS here was 129
an increase of 6 I don't know what
percentage that is fokin again could put
that up on the screen but the reason
we're using Far Cry 5 is even the
synthetic built in benchmark is still
using a lot more CPU than other
synthetic benchmarks so when we were
running Metro the CPU just said it like
39 see 46 it wasn't really doing
anything but you'll notice now the CPU
temp has gone up significantly in the
GPU usage drops down to more
80-85 and will sometimes hit the 90s and
come back down doesn't get as hot which
tells us the CPU is doing so much more
but over because we're doing far cry fly
that I feel like I should be talking
like this we're gonna do a test one more
time here we're gonna make sure the
results are the same we don't want to
mislead folk down the wrong paths and
you know definitively the CPU was
actually gave us our improvement here
but I digress that's besides the point
now I'm expecting probably a pretty
consistent result but if you look at the
temperature right here is certainly
doing something with the CPU all right
so that time we got 127 versus the 129
all right so that time we got a 125
average so we've gone down to every time
129 127 125 but if you look the maximum
FPS is the same number of frames renders
a little bit less on the second test but
our minimum FPS dropped from 99 to 95
what we think is actually happening here
is that the GPU is getting warmer and
we're starting to see the GPU sea States
or P States actually called pcs in GPU
starting to come down a little bit so
this one's probably not one that we can
actually draw a conclusion from because
yeah so this one really didn't show much
of a difference yeah 123 is still lower
than 125 no one's gonna notice this fps
anyway so anyway the whole point of this
video like I said new test bench I was
curious of whether or not we caused
myself a problem we test the new
graphics cards are inevitably coming I
think I'm just gonna roll with it I'm
fine I mean there's gonna be plenty
people doing reviews on all sorts of
platforms and this is just another one
to the add to the mix so guys thanks for
watching today's video if you have any
ideas for videos we should do in the
future make sure you hit us up on
Twitter or just comment down below and
as always guys we will see you in the
next one
ah I don't know look at me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
