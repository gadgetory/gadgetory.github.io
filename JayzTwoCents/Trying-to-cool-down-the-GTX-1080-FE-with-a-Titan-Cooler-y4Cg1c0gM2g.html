my last video I talked about doing
something custom with the founders
cooler we're gonna do that today we're
gonna have some fun we're gonna tear a
card apart and see what we can do with
it but first a little bit thirsty so oh
yeah look at that
tastes like cleanliness cooler masters

to learn more check out the links in the
description below so if you guys
remember in my Loki ghost s1 video I
talked about my 1080 was actually
running a bit warm and it's something
that started ever since I water cooled
it and then put it back to air it is run
hotter than it ever did in the past it
even runs hotter than other 10 80s which
were Founders cards this one right here
if I set the fans static to 55% raise
the power limit to the max and raise the
template to the max it will actually hit
88 see where my other 1080 would stay in
the 70s so something is being really
weird about this I've just checked
thermal paste it's no problem with it so
what I'm gonna show here is I'm gonna
try taking one of the coolers off of one
of my Titan DS because the Titan B and
the 1080 TI are rated to 250 watts where
the 1080 is a 180 or 190 watts so the
cooler on this is technically beefier
now rather than just try and put the big
Titan D cooler on top of the 1080 even
if it fit that would be a lie it won't
fit technically I don't think because
this or this has a DVI port it might fit
I know doesn't matter I don't want to
lie and put the Titan D cooler on top of
the 1080 so we're gonna actually take
the vapor chamber cooler out of this guy
and put it on the 1080 and see if we get
any improvement so just to kind of recap
we hit 88 see on the 1080 55 percent fan
speed lock so it doesn't go up or down
and we did that because we need to
compare so if the fan was automatically
ramping we would be able to compare it
to be dynamically changing so yeah let's
go ahead and just let's take this out
put it in the 1080 and see if we get any
improvement now obviously I took the
whole cooler off of this this is from
one of my water-cooled cards so the
coolers pretty much brand had never been
used
to show you is how to take the actual
heatsink itself out as you can see the
black one from the 1080 so we're going
to a silver 1/2 which might look kind of
neat but imma show you I take the cooler
out and you can do this to change your
thermal paste or improve your thermal
paste liquid metal whatever you want to
do so you can do this with your founders
cards and not have to take the whole
cooler off which I've seen people do so
you're gonna take an allen key I don't
what size it is you remove this screw
this screw this one on the side this one
on the other side and then there's two
Phillips head screws on the rear shield
so take those two off as well now this
is probably going to not enough this
avoid your warranty but if it does
that's on you and the warranties we
don't believe in warranties around here
warranties are for sissies actually you
probably should you should care about
your warranty especially those expensive
graphics cards are today ok so once
those four screws are out you can lift
up the cooler on this side and then the
whole cover just comes off and the thing
is it doesn't matter if it's a 1070 a
1070 ti 1080 1080i or Titan D they're
all pretty much the same in the way the
cooler goes together but you can see
this is is it the same size I don't know
it looks like it might be it might be
absolutely no difference in this cooler
ability looks the same to me
i no one's rated to 250 and ones rated
to 180 whatever we're gonna we're gonna
do it anyway because then it'll look
cooler it'll look cooler with all the
black parts we're doing part swap but
first now you gotta start by cleaning
off all the old thermal paste and I
prefer to use the Dyson juice which is
99% you want at least 70% Dyson juice
but we only use the best around here so
99% Dyson juice you're gonna put it on a
paper towel or something that's non
fibrous you don't want to get little
fibers everywhere now paper towels will
leave a little bit of fiber but that's
okay see like oh well the Dyson juice
works it just just melts right through
that paste now if you have a little bit
of bleed over or just kind of musha's
over the side it's okay it's
non-conductive so we're not going to be
causing ourselves any problems here on
the die you can use q-tips or something
to make this nice and clean but it
it's off the actual surface that's all I
care about I have a video where I talk
about thermal paste and whether or not
you can hurt it so I want you guys go
and check that out I'll put the link to
it in the description below now we only
used ice and paste around here because
it has the best thermal conductivity and
it's not conductive of metal so we are
not going to be causing ourself any sort
of problems in terms of it getting on to
the traces make sure you use an ample
amount that's probably too much but
there's no such thing as too much dice
and paste now when it goes back together
the curved side like this goes towards
the fan that's the way you want this to
go so you're gonna slide it in like so
and then just pop it down look at that I
think they should have gone with silver
silver it looks better what do you think
alright so flip it over hold it by both
hands like that and sort of squeeze it
together it's definitely making contact
so I could feel it sliding around on
there we are going to put these four
screws back in first because this is
what actually holds the cooler in place
should have my tool ready first and
we're gonna start that screw start
opposite corner just like you're putting
wheels on a car so now we can tighten
this all the way down just go till the
threads stop because it will only go so
far
don't force past the stop otherwise
you'll strip out your screw head and
then you'll never get it off again and
there's that I think the silver cooler
looks really cool my goodness I don't
think I'm done yet though
put this on there that looks so much
better with silver so there's a 1080
with the silver cooler and the titan
with the black cool tell me this isn't
the way they should have shipped it I
mean this looks all murdered-out and
this just I don't know it looks cool and
contrasty with the silver showing
through so yeah anyway let's go and put
it all back together and see if there's
any temperature difference prediction I
don't think anything's changed I don't
know why this card is starting to run
hotter I really have no idea but it
looks cooler I mean there's that so now
obviously wait I've had a lot of people
complain that my test bench is not
realistic because it's an open test
bench so we fixed that problem through
the help of one of our sponsors so yeah
there's that this is now as a fan on the
side so it actually pulls a little bit
of cool air on the side
it pulls in probably a little bit from
the gap right there but this is more
reminiscent of a case I guess so yeah
whatever let's fire it up
let it run for like 20 minutes to
equalize the pressures or the
temperatures again 55% fan speed max
power slider max temp slider and let's
see if it came down from 88 C at all all
right so we've been running the hebben
benchmark on loop now all settings maxed
8x msaa all the same settings as the
1080 and you can see we actually have a
couple of degrees improvement it's
bouncing between 83 and 85 so 3 to 4 C
improvement it's kind of hard to say you
know whether or not the cooler really
made any sort of a difference I think
it's pretty obvious that the dice and
paste is what we can actually attribute
to the improvements
so definitely guys make sure you run out
and get your dice and paste link is not
in the description guys you're not gonna
find it yourself but 3 or 4 C is fairly
significant I mean just changing thermal
paste wouldn't do that in fact this is
the same exact thermal paste that I used
when I retested the 1080 thinking
thermal paste was probably an issue
after I put it back together from water
cooling it so at the end of the day at
least we have a better looking Titan D
cooler and a better looking 1080 cooler
and I don't think the this is actually
affecting it in any way because if I
take this guy off and if I take this off
the temperatures don't actually improve
so yeah that's a whole another video
concept for another day on we've we've
covered it a million times we'll
probably cover a million more times
about chassis cooling Z I took it off
and look nothing has changed on the
temperature so far what I want to check
real quick though is now I want to put
the cooler back to auto so you can see
we already have an improvement here
we're at 61% fan speed and it already
dropped 4 degrees from where we were
just a minute ago so anyway guys take
this video for what it was just having
some fun I was curious as to if the
cooler from the higher rated cards cuz
member these are 250 watt versus the 190
watt of a 1080 I was curious if there
was any improvement to be had it looks
like some because now you can see 59% at
81 C and if we were to take this now and
just give ourselves a little bit more of
an aggressive fan curve and you can see
that we are now drowned down into the
lower 70s at 72% fan speed
which is kind of interesting my
aggressive curve is basically set to the
temperature and the fan speed will match
so it's not too loud or too intrusive
and then obviously if it was in a
chassis it wouldn't be too bad but you
know the takeaway from this is really
all we gained was a cooler looking 1080
no pun intended and a cooler looking
Titan D all blacked out and stuff so
guys that's all for today just a little
experimental video to see what would
happen take away what you will from this
video it was kind of fun to see what
would happen but we've got some exciting
content coming up this week you guys are
not gonna want to miss we've got a
giveaway coming oh I got to take this
this is important hello
listen shark I told you you missed your
chance okay
we moved on I know I'm beautiful I asked
if they look good shaking it all over
the place are you oh god here we go
again Oh God day one right and to action
you're gonna pull out as I'm drinking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
