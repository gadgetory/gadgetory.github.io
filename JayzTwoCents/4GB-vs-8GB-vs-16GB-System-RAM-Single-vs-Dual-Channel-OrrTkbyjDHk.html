you may remember me from such videos as
iPhone 4 vs. iPhone 4s vs. iPhone 5 or
maybe you saw AMD vs. Intel for gaming
performance on a regular basis I am
constantly asked how much RAM do you
need when building a gaming computer so
that's exactly we're going to find out
on this edition of a little bite of tech
I started off by yanking out 12
gigabytes of my installed 16 gigs I'm
running four times for gigabyte sticks
here
I recommend 2 times 8 gigabyte if you're
going 18 gigs of ram just want to throw
that out there right there we got 4
gigabytes of ddr2 6 memory installed in
my 8350 FX processor by AMD and we are
overclocking it to the 4.8 one 6
gigahertz that I did in my previous
video system idles using 1 gigabyte of
RAM and I loaded up the brand-new valley
benchmark here by Unigine which is a
really cool synthetic benchmark and we
did the synthetic benchmark that way we
can get consistent results when
comparing the amount of RAM installed in
your system and the 4 gig results you're
in here we've gotten an 1886 score an
average of 45 point 1 fps and a max of
86 with a minimum of 23 and the physics
score on the 3d mark 11 is capping
outright about 20 2.1 frames per second
at 4 gigabytes of RAM and for the
combined tests it looks like we're
capping out right at about 27 frames per
second giving us a 3d mark score of 10
thousand and four and a combined score
of 68 84 and RAM usage overall in the
system never exceeded two gigabytes of
RAM whatsoever that's including all
these tests so I immediately threw in
another stick of RAM bring us to eight
gigabytes and as you can see here the
system is idling a little bit over 1.3
gigabytes and I reloaded up our unit in
benchmark here and as you can see while
the benchmark is running we are up to
about 1.9 2 gigabytes of usage but I
think the most noticeable improvement
right off the bat is the physics frames
per second we gain 4 frames per second
and the combined score we're jumping all
the way up to 30 frames per second that
is a huge increase but remember this is
sea
usage which directly uses the rim we
gained over 500 points on our 3d mark 11
score in a combined score of 77 85 and
of course last but not least we
installed the all four sticks of RAM
bringing us to 16 gigs of system memory
but we're only using a little over two
gigabytes while running the Unigine
benchmark at Ultra HD settings but now
we're hitting the point of diminishing
returns
we've only gained one point on the
benchmark and most notably our physics
scores did not increase at all on either
of the two tests in 3d mark 11 in fact
our overall score in 3d mark 11 went
down by a couple of points but that's
just because we're in the margin of
error of the actual test so take that
with a grain of salt now I hear you all
saying J those are synthetic benchmarks
they don't matter well here I am in 64
player map on battlefield 3 maxed out
settings we're only using three point
six seven gigabytes of system ram now
there's a few things that you can take
away from this video right off the bat
one four gigabytes is more than enough
to play games in fact in the benchmarks
you saw right there there was no loss in
frames per second at all in the real
world environment and when it came to
the benchmarks yeah it gained a little
bit but mostly that was because of the
fact that we were using physics on the
CPU which directly uses the rim who uses
CPU physics these days nobody does
graphics cards if you have an Nvidia do
all of the physics processing and if you
have AMD while you would need a second
card anyway to do physics you're not
going to throw it onto your processor it
honestly felt a little bit snappier
under eight gigs than four gigs but the
difference was certainly minimal it only
shows in synthetic benchmarks and as you
saw in the real world test with
battlefield 3
we weren't even using 4 gigabytes of the
RAM so you can get away with 8 gigabytes
just fine if you're doing gaming now all
of that changes if you're doing
rendering with your computer now while
rendering the intro of this video it's
only 23 seconds long but you can see
under 4 gigabytes of RAM we maxed it out
and it took 1 minute and 58 seconds to
render under 8 gigabytes we use 6.5 1
gigs and it only took 40 seconds to
render that's a huge improvement and
under 16 gigs we use 7 gigabytes total
while rendering and only 39 seconds to
render now once again you saw a little
bit of diminishing returns between
gigs and 16 gigs on rendering but keep
in mind that that video was nothing more
than an mov format converted to an mp4
the more layers you add the more
transition sound sound effects images
transparencies you add to your video
it's going to use a lot more RAM when
you do the rendering so there you have
it guys for verses 8 verses 16 gigs of
ram in your system for gaming and
rendering and you can see that 8
gigabytes is definitely a sweet spot I
still personally like 16 gigs I just
like to know I have the extra RAM in
case I need it
but you can get away perfectly with 8
gigabytes of RAM so what are you using
them why put it down in the comments
don't forget to hit that subscribe
button follow me on Twitter and I'll see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
