I'm not very good at motion graphics and
stuff so today I'm gonna use the video
blocks library here to make kind of a
cool intro and show you guys how easy it
is to really take these templates and
liven up your production value in your
content creation so anyway
don't go anywhere guys and we'll show
you how to make some pretty cool stuff
coming up now
so I think I'm gonna keep this little
series going maybe once a month here
where I show you guys some cool content
tips and tricks and how to get more out
of your videos without having to spend a
whole lot of time or even a whole lot of
money so today's video is brought to you
by video blocks now I've used video
blocks ever since I started YouTube just
now I'm starting to get to kind of show
you guys some more in-depth stuff of how
I use it because like I said I'm not a
content creator that makes motion
graphics and stuff nor do I even have
the time to invest on how to learn how
to do this stuff from scratch so
fortunately the unlimited library and
the marketplace is somewhere that people
like you and me can go get some pre
keyed footage in some templates and
learn a lot about how to use After
Effects and really spice up our videos
not even just After Effects but you can
get all sorts of footage you've got lots
of background motion backgrounds you've
seen those on my graphics card reviews
you've got some flyby footage aerial
nature I mean anything you can think of
just to add some value to your content
creation is available here but I said in
the last video that I want to show you
guys how to do an intro you know so
because intros are really what makes
videos pop and gets people's attention
and really kind of makes you legit when
it comes to content creation so I went
over here to the effort if that After
Effects tab because I'm gonna use After
Effects for this went over into the logo
reveal intro believe it or not this
would be more for like movies and things
but I went to the logo reveal and then I
thought this one was kind of neat down
here on the bottom left where I figure a
lot of you watch videos on smartphones
so wouldn't be neat to kind of have a
smartphone type intro so this was like
the the base you know this is this was
what this guy did here nothing too
special or spectacular about it but it's
just a swiping screen I thought well
what if we swiped between different
scenes of my videos so anyway we went
ahead and downloaded that one and you
guys did say in your straw poll 47% of
you wanted my next video to be how to
make an intro using After Effects so
that's what we are doing one thing I did
to get ready for the project here was I
moved in some various clips and things
that I wanted to use that I thought
would look neat on that little you know
iPhone effect so I've got here like a
trade show I've got a graphics card you
know b-roll I've got me as a talking
head to represent the reviews that I do
I've also got some transparent words on
here like build gaming reviews my logo
and the motion background you guys have
seen me using my GPU videos and stuff so
I've been using that one for quite a
while now but anyway let's go ahead and
open up the project file it's called
phone track 2 and it's what's included
with the what the actual template folder
structure if you will so the entire
everything you need is pretty much in
here with the exception of sound because
sound is trademarked and copyrighted and
you aren't going to be able to
necessarily distribute music like that
so you have to find music that you can
use on your own anyway this was made in
Mac etosha it's being converted to a PC
version and here we go so anyway this is
After Effects here and I chose this
project because it's super simple but
yet gives you a very cool effect and you
don't want to get too involved in After
Effects right away or you'll get
overwhelmed you'll quit and you won't be
happy
trust me After Effects is something that
can get very overwhelming very quickly
now over here on the left hand side and
all the project files you'll see a bunch
of different folders now the only one we
really care about is the edit comps
folder because this is where we're gonna
make changes that will take effect here
in the entire project now as you can see
here there's clearly no images or videos
or anything inside the phone and that's
the whole point of what we're doing here
today so image 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 this is the
order of which they appear when he goes
swiping through the screens so image 1
if we just go ahead and click double
click on that you'll see we have nothing
here because nothing was rendered here
yet in the final output because we
haven't put it in there yet so if we
open up image 1 then we go to our
footage folder where we moved in the
files and stuff that we want to use
let's go ahead and move in say all of
these files you can just drag all of
these because you know you're gonna use
them dragging them over here to the
project files and then we can just drop
them in there now what we're gonna do is
I want to have that Kington graphics
card b-roll to be my first clip so let's
find it here there it is right here you
can see it up here in a little preview
window on the left just drag it down
here and then I can sigh you know scale
at how I want because this video or this
intro thing
template was made with like a 4 or 4s it
doesn't have a widescreen on there
that's why it's got this more 4 by 3
format so we can just move that around
wherever we want it just so long as we
make sure that we don't move it in such
a way that we get these black bars
because that will look very unnatural so
we'll just do that and then I want to go
a step further by adding on top of here
you know some words to represent you
know what we are trying to showcase here
with our channel so I'll put builds up
here on top and then we'll put it down
here in the corner or something and
we'll say that you know hey Jays two
cents does builds but you guys never saw
that coming did you
so that's it we dragged that in there
it's in composition 1 now the final HD
is going to pull in those files
automatically and as you can see there
it is so he brings up the screen and
it's already in there he swipes to the
next scene and it's black because we
haven't put anything in there yet so
we'll go image 2 over here on the left
and the Edit comps double click on it it
brings up the composition now we can do
the next file we want to use so let's do
like my trade show video has that this
one right here we'll drag that down
there there's me as a talking head at a
trade show this was at e3 this year
there's a little disappointing cool game
titles and stuff but just the way the
convention is laid out I wasn't too
happy with it anyway we'll go ahead and
call that one gaming makes sense because
it is a gaming convention you know that
says the Electronic Entertainment Expo
it was like all games should we call the
electronic gaming expo and we'll put
that there now if we go over here to
Final HD again down here in our
composition navigator there it is see it
automatically brought it in and now the
next thing we'll do is we'll go to
composition 3 and we'll put in there me
as the talking head my 9 50 review there
it is we'll scale it down just a little
bit
we'll move and we'll go like that we'll
move that over that way my little bobble
head kind of shows and then we will put
in there the word reviews obviously I'm
doing a review right there scale that up
a little bit
drag that down into the corner
me a little bit bigger just like that
and then guess what just like you saw
before or is it gin here something there
it is then the last one is he leaves it
up on the screen longer because that's
intended to be like a logo reveal so
what we'll do here is we will go ahead
and open up image four which is
composition four we will drag down in
there my moving background and then we
will also pull down in there my logo
which is in here somewhere
it says logo imagine that only Jacob
lose something called logo it's clearly
labeled and we'll do that and go back
over here and there there it is now the
cool thing about these templates is this
seems incredibly easy right like oh that
wasn't a lot of work J what's the whole
point of this video well the point of
this video is to show you that by using
you know services like video blocks and
I've been throwing that out there quite
a bit but it's something I truly been
using ever since I started YouTube
because I'm not good at this stuff I'm
not a graphics designer I'm not a motion
graphics artist I don't know how to do
this stuff I don't have the time to
invest on how to how to pre key the
phone how to do motion tracking so that
everything moods moves flawlessly with
the phone it's just not I don't have the
time for that so I use services like
this to be able to customize it to make
it my own but let someone else do all
the legwork on how to do all this
movement pre keying and stuff but anyway
the next thing to do is go up to
composition here add to Adobe Media
encoder I use the media encoder not the
built-in after-effects surrender err
because the media encoder is much more
powerful and then we can select our
settings and stuff there and let it
output I'm going to HD 1080p at 29.97
fps you can tell it where to save and
then once it's done you will have a
project that is all done and looks
something like this
so there you go guys just a quick video
on how you guys can spice up your
content creation and make things look a
whole lot better without having to
invest a lot of time and only a little
bit of money and really gives you some
production value to your content so make
sure you guys go down to the description
check out video blocks there there's a
link you guys can go
anything in there unlimited library can
be used and downloaded all you want
there's even a free trial down there so
you guys can go and try it out and
download some stuff and see how you like
it and the cool thing about video blocks
is even if you guys are content creators
already and you know all this stuff and
maybe you're even a professional
graphics artist you can put your own
stuff up into the market place and video
blocks gives you a hundred percent of
the proceeds they don't even take a cut
of what you guys put up there they give
you a nice store basically to put
yourself up there showcase it make a
little bit of money for your effort and
I think that that's really an important
thing as Baby J's Yellin in the
background there I think she wants to
get in the video anyway it's really
important to be able to strengthen the
community and give you guys you know all
the proceeds for your efforts and that's
exactly what videoblocks is doing so
make sure you go into the description

you're a content creator and you want to
spice up your content and as always guys
thanks for watching these videos are fun
to make I couldn't do these videos
without your guys's support or the
support of people like videoblocks
because they've helped me get my content
looking a lot better ever since the
start anyway time to get out of here
