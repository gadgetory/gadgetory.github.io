youtube over there I use mine everyone
welcome to coconut monkeys first day at
work do you see you see where I cast him
with I was like organized as crap shells
crap
you gotta start the bottom sir actually
I think a lot of people would think it's
an extremely fun job just to play around
with all this hardware huh
yeah thanks Ally they should never be
jealous of not working working for me or
whatever you want to call it I wanna I
want to ask you a serious question here
look at its he's so focused on work
right now he's trying to log into our
inventory right try to log into
inventory there okay so what I want to
know is first day on the job just got
here what are your expectation and how
you think you're going to feel pin
that's whatever because we're gonna come
back we're going to look at this leg way
in the future we're going to be like you
were so wrong slow right I don't know um
I got free coffee so that's awesome
sorry yeah the wife made him coffee
yeah so already you owe me money how's
the for specific there you know company
coffee pot yet oh oh y'all starting
somewhere I don't know something
something different everyday thanks well
this is gonna take a while but well yeah
well given it's also super windy outside
get it kind of cool
it just blew the trash can over I like
that you have a jacket inside but you're
not wearing it up okay disaster and what
does Fonzie isn't for you to use I've
actually trusted him with the organizing
of this stuff on his own I've got to go
take care of some company banking today
I'm going to take care of signing the
lease for the new studio because part of
what he's doing here right now is
organizing this so we can organize the
crap get rid of it put together a for
sale pile I'm going to be having like a
Jays fire
sales selling graphics cards and
motherboards and all kinds of stuff you
get dibs yeah you can't afford it I know
what you make yeah
but also too so that we can make the
move easy as easy as possible a lot of
this stuff's actually going in storage I
don't want it taking up space in the new
studio what the news to do to be clean
and sleek at least until I make my first
video and then I'm going to wreck the
crap out of it
that's why it has me that's why it looks
like this right now this is what it
looks like after building that 570 X
crystal system this is what it looks
like I didn't even custom water coolers
I'm just a metal worker so here's what
I'm gonna do because I want some of the
new people get a little more custom to
you I think most people know who you are
I'm going to leave the camera with you
you know how like in reality shows like
every now and then they're like sitting
in a closet they're like today with such
a say today so I have to go do business
and the later I go to the doctor I leave
I leave you the camera so get done
and if you want to record something feel
free if you don't want to don't I also
want to point out the Presto the press
stones still running in there I didn't I
never said we were going to have a
problem with this system I just said
it's a problem PE T G but I didn't even
do that test yet which we need to do
soon our zero into a working and totally
forgot when we did inventory and there's
a lot to backlog and it's kind of scary
but hope I can pull through it because I
get paid to do that now so inventory is
going to be a bit of food be a few
moments later I got most of the stuff
well not most of it I got a large chunk
I feel is a large chunk out of here um
yeah so we're guys does it I got empty
boxes there for making new
organizational boxes but so far those
like power cables and then have
miscellaneous cables like monitor cables
or ethernet plug HDMI like that water
cooling tubing so far at least made this
below the rubber tubing and but those
are all the tools um some covers over
there so far I think I'm doing all right
this section scary to picked up and I
still have to finish off
that stuff over there yeah over this
area other than that figure out the
specs over here I think it might be
radiators I'll consolidate those into a
box
I really main goal is just to clean up
around the floor and stuff because this
has to go or at least up against the
wall so we know what when you get rid of
and what needs to say so far so good
and you haven't oh that needs to go yeah
I gotta move back oh yeah that way
everything's sorted out well yeah I
think even some is coming alone um after
I clean it up I'll probably start
throwing stuff on to the Google Docs oh
it's not Google Docs that's something
else too spreadsheets don't they I
forgot the name so whatever I have
inventory on there I feel pretty good
about this hopefully hopefully it
doesn't go to because that's
usually patent chef Ricky he he does
stuff with a computer like he has a
build going on back there and then I
cleaned up literally a bag of zip ties
off the ground
something that's one of my pet peeves
and he knows it
so Aaron every I come clean with the
workshop I don't mean to clean up the
workshop but it just happens because
even upstairs in his other room he I
fired it ties before I'd start taking
stuff up and me yeah and that coffee
cups mine it isn't his he usually has
three at a time it's about what four
hours in maybe it's probably like noon
let me check hold on yeah it is noon
it's noon ah I got most of the stuff
cleaned up on the walls
I wanted to three years actually sorters
radios now and then actually got all the
fans together that were lying around so
they're pretty easily access to now and
says rummaging around searching for it
right now I'm just working on sorting
out a bunch of screws and grommets that
he just has lying around the place so I
figured and this box wouldn't use it all
so I opened it up start loading that
stuff up with thing
here's what two jumpers it's pretty
pretty excessive but you never know when
you're gonna need more jumpers and zip
ties and twist ties you can never have
too many of those yeah what else we got
that's investing on the big project
right now actually I'm just digging
through all his tools because he has
bags of screws everywhere and I started
just putting them all into the box and
making it nice to meet and tidy oh come
on
see reaction come on oh the city's
bottle foot oh I was just saying we have
to drive the Durango because it never
gets driven because of devilment
batteries the battery's dead no what I
pull a car in front
I got jumper cables in the garage okay
wasn't the battery it was a starter
starter was stuck so I just kept I just
kept bumping the starter until it
finally started so it tells me now let's
change the starter in the same soon you
question is whether or not really get
stranded now what we're out because I
now know the starter is going bad and
I'm like yeah I brought this guy with me
that I can use to get it going again to
hit it so I'm making my car no I'm not
having you submit mileage report right
what I gotta teach this guy everything
about working a legit job when you use
your own vehicle for company purposes
uh-huh you are entitled to mileage
reimbursement 57 cents a mile 58 cents a
mile I did not know that jeez how many
mile how many miles you think you did
for work the other day
ah yes probably it's probably two digit
numbers a two digit yeah well because I
used to do mail run just to the post
office is literally down the street and
then illegally you were entitled to read
mileage reimbursement for driving your
own car
the other thing working for me is I'm on
the up-and-up right now just a not set a
thing and be like oh you want to guys
you don't get to fix air miles to work
though better job oh you can't be like
I'm driving all the way here and I get
to where to clear these - well there's
the post office stuff and then the
rehydrate which is also down the street
a little bit pretty well I used to drive
thousand miles a week for work now I got
to declare all of that that was a lot of
change in the most staying
5250 at the time of 55 cents a mile as
to do the math on that and that's all
tax-free money mmm
Oh else we have some food and stuff our
faces yes I don't even know if this is
going to make it into a total video if
it is look straight up bonus video so
this was your first full it's almost
been eight hours yeah we got like no
footage throughout the middle of the day
I had errands to run I let you take care
of things it is super into twin D and
something fell well here's the thing
does it look any different than when I
left a little bit not really a little
bit less stuff on the floor but the
point is I don't know if the point is
there's our point yeah what we did it
yeah this thing is this little
organization kit I've had that for like
a year finally forget you you're welcome
I need to get those little pullout
drawers and stuff for all my like water
cooling sitting has like all those totes
and stuff down there are fitting needle
aerial tool box like fitting screws and
we need to like redo the screws per size
instead of grouping than whatever looks
similar he wants to screw okay so the
first day has a feel it feels pretty
good is that it well I mean it feels
like something I normally do hanging out
with you but the Sun getting paid for it
that's weird right
it's like I'm getting paid to hang out
with my friends we'll get back to work
