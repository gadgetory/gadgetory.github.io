a life of that I've ever done there's
one window in this damn house doesn't
have blinds on it right there on the tub
above the tub and you've blinding me I'm
gonna do something I've never done
before huh I do one of those day in the
life of this probably goes luck yeah I
take Little J to school it's cold down
here
thank you forgot to turn on the heater a
rake for school hi Weiss's turn on the
coffee machine but she hasn't realized
there's no more baby I'm going to show
you I'm gonna show the Internet
you look like in the morning before you
put your bowl both both your faces on
some day we'll put away Christmas a big
ol pile of stuff why me that's Christmas
we just aren't ready to put away
Christmas yet I really wish I could
sleep in but nope someone has to go to
school and get an education and stuff
and thinks she's all kinds of some kinds
of smartypants
if she goes to school
I know that may not seem very cold to
some people but for those of us in
Southern California that's that's pretty
chilly 46 degrees yeah that's very
chilly I'm doing something I have never
done today and that is some some of my
wife's would tell me forever I need to
do this of course today she's happy that
she gets to say I told you so
and that is go to the chiropractor if
you have been following me long enough
then you know that I had back problems
I've got three things going on in my
back I've got a sciatic issue on my left
side that's caused by a piriformis
syndrome so the piriformis syndrome is
causing the sciatic problem because it's
a sciatic goes to the piriformis muscle
and then I've got an SI joint issue in
my hip that's causing the piriformis
syndrome that's causing the sciatic
nerve problem so the chiropractor is
pretty convinced that he can fix this
and I don't go to traditional doctors
very often at all I don't take pain meds
I don't take pills
I don't think drugs many type actually
and so I'm I don't go to the doctor
because all they ever want to do is like
cortisone injections and pain management
they don't ever want to fix a problem so
that's why I'm just like whatever but I
met with her chiropractor last week he
was very convinced that he can fix my
problem and that is making me so excited
because if I can get back to a normal
quality of life without that problem oh
my god that itself would make any cost
of going to the chiropractor worth it
sidenote the interiors in the back of
the car again which means I can actually
have a conversation with you guys and
you
hear me it's amazing how much the
insults the installation and the
classics in the back of the car actually
dead the sound of the car even the road
annoyance like everything is so much
more manageable I tried to do that vlog
the five things I hate about my Z I was
almost impossible to listen to so that
was enlightening
we had I talked to the chiropractor last
week like I said and he was pretty
convinced he could make my situation
better with the dysfunctional SI joint
in my very first adjustment man there
was so much crunching and popping and
yeah basically when he where as fat as I
was nearly 500 pounds 494 pounds and
then lose all that weight everything got
all kinds of out of shape and out of
whack and my body changed like my spine
changed everything changed
so we're fixing that now a lot of the
problems I'm dealing with now are
happening after I lost the weight which
was really kind of weird right you think
oh my god I have lost so much weight I
should be in the best shape of my life
well I'm stronger than I've ever been
I've got more cardio and endurance and I
ever have my lungs are good but
physically my body was just completely
just misshapen if you will want to come
to the spine so he said my hips were way
way twisted everything was very twisted
in my back so I'm excited now we got to
do this over the course of a next month
or two every single week and then we'll
start seeing some relief but yeah the
amount of crunching and popping and as
he was pushing and moving things around
in there it was pretty obvious he he
knew where the problem was because
everything he did triggered my back in
some way is there a good way or
backwards the freaking backlighting
there that it work anyway you guys get
what I'm trying to say right I think so
I know it sounds so cliche but I
absolutely I love this car this is this
has always been my obtainable dream car
a 370z Nismo and not the newer ones I
don't like those as much the 2009
through 14
a lot of guys dream about those cars
they can never own like a like a
Koenigsegg one-to-one or Bugatti Veyron
or an Italian a Ferrari laferrari or
four or five eight whatever I don't care
about those even GTRs don't give a
I have always dreamed about having this
car it's not that fast handles pretty
good but I can I could own it and guess
what I do I wouldn't I'm so happy about
that definite thing too is this car has
a lot of mods that are not visual but so
it looks bone-stock with the exception
of the side button hood and yes it is a
real carbon-fiber hood I get asked all
the time if it's a wrap or something no
it's real carbon fiber but there are no
replicas on this car anywhere there is
no rep anything I'm kind of proud of
that we live in a world where reps reams
supreme because people want the look but
they don't want to pay for it anyway
there's no reps on this car and I'm
happy about that you guys have reps more
power to you to your car I wouldn't
judge you for it but my car I want the
real thing and that's what we've got
carbon fiber in all its goodness anyway
time to put our way for now and we can't
I go to the gym later bye so this is
kind of a rarity right now little Jay is
at school and mini Jay and the wife ride
a dance class will Todd their dance
class so I have the house all to myself
which means I can play in the playroom
without the kids actually no I lied
about to go in here to take a dump but
you uh you can't come with me hon right
well I'm going to force myself to eat
more and I don't mean like eat more I
just sometimes I skip meals entirely
because I'm so damn busy and that's not
healthy and I put back on about ten
pounds of fat through you guys's notice
since I got to my lightest it's time to
lose that ten pounds but anyway so we
made today we've got some we got some
chicken and rice and veggies there's
some greens and some mushrooms in the
bottom of that though
grilled chicken yeah my homemade it's
the best part the wife is a hell of a
cook
so this is quite literally the most
boring part of YouTube where I sit down
and answer business emails and invoices
you receive some bookkeeping got to talk
about future projects literally this is
the part nobody thinks about all people
think about the glamour of being a
popular youtuber and we think about the
actual business side of it so I got
something cool I ordered that I want to
show you guys these are some lights I
bought off Amazon here because I've been
wanting to get a little bit more accent
lighting here in the office so these are
20 watt LEDs better you guessed it RGB
and get that SM right there the pretty
damn basic the 20 watts or ip65 so the
outdoor rated you can use these two up
light on the wall and such oh that's I
think that's the remote control since it
is remote control oh yeah
remote control right there you've got
the sensor for the remote so let's plug
one these in real quick and see how it
looks that's not where I'm going to keep
it obviously but I just wanted to kind
of check it out so it's it's yeah
interestingly enough I just pushed
orange and it's shining green that's
funny I push it or I push the orange on
the remote and green comes up I'm a bush
pink okay it's more about ultraviolet
about white white looks kind of blue
anyway yeah I just want to use this to
kind of get a little bit of more accent
lighting here in the office when I'm
doing some of my videos and such try to
be a little bit more creative if you
will sue me it won't turn off this
remote suck anyway that company had
actually offered to send me these for
review but I didn't respond to email I
just bought them they're cheap enough no
point doing a review of these it's just
little accent light so whatever all
right time to do that boring
administrative stuff so I'll eat my
lunch go through emails and we'll come
back later now the real reason you guys
should always be watching these vlogs
when they go out even though they're
very rare is you get an inside scoop on
what's coming up on the channel though
this behind me as you can see is the MSI
gt70 3 VR Titan which is like literally
their top-of-the-line balls-to-the-wall
the most Hardware we could stuff inside
of a notebook
I use that term loosely by the way
notebook and this is where extra I used
to edit all the videos at CES these
specs on this thing are absolutely
insane it's even got an SSD raid in
there so yeah we'll be doing a review on
that so I had some games and stuff
installing on here right now it is it is
such a big laptop to me look at the time
I also have one of the really thin ones
that just came in actually by doing a
review on that as well so I might be
doing some more reviews on notebooks and
such moving forward because believe it
or not a lot of people are like
notebooks suck there's a lot of people
out that rely on them every single day
like I used to when I traveled for work
when I worked in IT and having a laptop
like this that is capable of all the
workloads you need as well as being able
to throw any game you want at it yeah
pretty badass this one's got a full-size
Titan for us I wish it was a Titans got
full-sized 1080 in there but right now
I'm taking Little J to her Taekwondo
lesson she has the test on Saturday for
which belt yeah I was gonna say you
can't test for the belt if you don't
even know which belt you're testing for
geez kid yeah she was testing for senior
blue right now and she's enjoying it

dinner right now I'm not gonna tell you
guys why yet don't ruin or dinner if you
lay there like take me like one of your
french ladies this is weird I've never
done one of these whole like a life a
day in the life of videos but it is you
guys good to see how busy I freaking am
like for the moment I get up I just sat
down this couch for the like really the
first time today it's 11:30 3 at night I
mean 8 33 11 33 later you're like oh my
god really what happened
haha sorry a coconut monkey and I went
to dinner at Cheesecake Factory we
weren't date
we got a bro date actually should I tell
oh no I should tell coconut monkey is
starting February going to be officially
an employee which is weird he's always a
friend first but my my I was gonna say
my slave but they'd be like that's
racist you can't say that I am a slave
to you guys therefore it's fair no
seriously the this this year is this is
my year we're going to hit a million we
are getting the studio he's going to
help me set up the studio that's this is
I was showing him some of the studio
availabilities that are around this area
it's hard because I want to get the
right place I want the right place it is
a long term commitment but I don't want
to make do I want to be right and you
got some money to make money and I need
people to help me get to that point and
coda monkey by the time he goes full
time he's will start part-time at first
I hate where you're sitting
okay so see I'm gonna have to train you
on everything aren't I
oh man so he's still in college right
now though he's still finishing up his
final year University so he's going to
be part-time until he graduates and then
we're going to transition right into
full-time and hopefully by then we'll
already have the studio and already have
it all set up and ready to go so that's
kind of like the big thing here and we
had a we had a long man-to-man talk yeah
wages and salaries and expectations and
whether or not like this even just
dynamic even works out but I think it
does please been working like
true but you have the luxury of just
showing up doing the two idiots thing
and then leaving yeah well I do
everything else but now you're going to
be a part of the beginning the end I get
to be private madness true
anyway that's a day in the life of and
it was a really interesting day to vlog
all this because I think this is the
turning point for the channel hopefully
it's going to turn up and not down turn
to up for what turned out the way
but yeah oh it turned down for what yeah
but we're not going down suppose to
those expectations remember I'm just
going to end it there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
