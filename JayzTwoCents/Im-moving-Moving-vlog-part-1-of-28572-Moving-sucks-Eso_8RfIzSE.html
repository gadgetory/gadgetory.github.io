get really stressful around here because
we have a lot to do in a short amount of
time the lick max to 120 and 240 from
enter max is another awesome choice of
AI Oh liquid coolers for gamers and
enthusiasts without breaking the bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more so do you guys on Twitter that
I'm actually moving I think I talked
about it in a video or something
mentioned it anyway
we are moving and we currently rent this
house we don't own we're about to lease
another property here in California my
sister's gonna move into this house and
man things are about to be really really
hectic especially when it comes to
trying to unpack or pack up stuff trying
to determine what's worth keeping what's
worth garage selling or selling or
whatever because there's a lot of stuff
so yeah my sister's family my
brother-in-law just retired from the
Army after 20 years it is 20 years in
the army and they were located out in
Fort Drum New York so they were way in
upstate New York up by Watertown and
they just moved all the way across
country back here into Southern
California and their family of five have
been staying with a friend I've been
trying to get housing but the problem
I'm trying to get housing out here is
when you retire from the military it's
not easy to get a job especially here in
California when you're relocating all
the way from New York to California
there's a lot of stuff that has to kind
of fall in place them in the meantime
the military is like thanks for your
service best of luck out there and then
affort you it's not like before the
military get you housing and they set
you up
you got nothing so anyway the well that
was a really bright light right there I
got my softbox on so it all worked out
really well but yeah just like the
situation is somewhat complicated only
because my parents also rent some space
out of this house the garage was
converted to like a studio apartment and
my parents have been staying out there
because you know they're they're retired
they don't need a lot of space then they
asked my wife and I if we would take
over the lease in this house which we
did so I didn't have a garage I have a
garage for car stuff and have a garage
for storage I'm
when a business like this it's all
product based it really starts to
accumulate fast and I get rid of a lot
of stuff I do a lot of giveaways with it
I give it to friends I build computers
for family and friends and give those
away but the thing is I keep the stuff
that has value to the sense of making
future content so a lot of the
water-cooling stuff I can do future
videos with that motherboards and CPUs
and graphics cards I can do builds and
how to's does stuff with that so I can't
just get rid of everything so I feel
like the majority of the stuff that's
gonna have to move it's gonna be product
stuff so you guys have all seen this
before this is the what's inside the
closet in it man it is just cluttered
why do I have to yetis I have a Yeti
there and there's a Yeti in that box any
of you content aspiring content creators
one a mic maybe I'll do a mic giveaway
maybe we'll do like a streaming set up
giveaway that'd be kind of neat right
here's all my water cooling stuff
there's some more water cooling stuff
that came right there right now what I'm
doing is I'm kind of breaking down the
graphics cards and I'm putting them away
and you can see I never clean that block
out how terrible of me it will come
clean me will do a video on how to clean
your blocks actually I already did that
video so you don't even know what I'm
doing but yeah skunkworks is gonna be
the last thing to come down cuz I still
have to try to make videos in the
meantime some of them are gonna be
moving vlog style stuff I know a lot of
folks were like oh god here we go 6
parts of moving vlog just like Linus did
but this I'm not planning on doing that
I'm still gonna leave this set up for a
little bit here to try and create some
content in the meantime but there is
gonna be some spillover if that makes
sense on you know content being created
here versus getting set up at the new
place and making sure the internet is
going and plus having to move in and I
don't have a lot of help with moving so
it's it's getting ready to get really
frickin crazy and I saw some comments on
Twitter they're like haha he's moving
right after he did all that work yep the
living room set up yeah I know right
at least I stood up for my sister and
her family but anyway I just wanted to
kind of talk about that where some folks
were like well why is your
responsibility to get your sisters you
let your sister move in you guys first
of all you must not have any sense of
family if you say that so you can get
the on out of here with that
attitude and second of all if you know
anyone who retired from the military got
out of the military moved across country
and knows the hardship of trying to find
a job trying to find how
trying to get housing when you currently
don't have a job and you're living off
military retirement then you know the
struggles so anyway doll just worked out
really well let's we're gonna move out
they're gonna move in and everybody's
gonna be happy in the end so I mean I
don't I don't see the problem in that
and if you do well too freaking bad it's
not your house yeah so this is just the
tower of GPUs you can see they're still
boxes under there
oh my god I'm such a PC hoarder but like
I said these things are supposed to have
future content value to them see if I
just got rid of everything like everyone
says then what would end up happening
here is I would be able to continue to
make videos about future things like
okay this new driver effect of this
graphics card was it you know did it
work crimson came out what happened with
the old graphics cards if I didn't have
them I wouldn't be able to do any of
that content would I
anyway unfortunate thing is my kingpin
here they didn't send me a retail box
with it because the first one I thought
I had bad one turns out it wasn't a bad
one so they gave me a different one but
they kept the box I didn't give me a box
so I'll have to pack that one up a
little bit a little bit more carefully
yeah this is turning out to be a much
bigger project than I had really hoped
it was gonna be oh dear God alright so
it's actually been a couple days and I
know it doesn't look like much but I got
the shelves up the wall I'm patching the
holes that the shelves made and you can
see that the closet is mostly empty you
got my tools up there yeah so that was
actually a lot of work I know it doesn't
look like much but it's all at the end
of the earth my drill this is all
emptied out my router and stuff's on top
of there so I stopped to rewire all the
network in this house for the my
sister's family but yeah look at how
many boxes this was so all those boxes
right there were just the the business
inventory oh crap yeah and that's not
all of it either we saw the garage and
the shed if you remember that mess okay
so this blogs been going over the last
few days now and the
the baby and I little J's at Sakura now
we're on our way to the property to go
and take a look or do the official
walkthrough we've already done the lease
agreement and down payment or the
deposit and all that stuff
two things I want to talk about one
everyone asks why we're leasing and why
we're not buying even though it's a
buyers market right now one I don't have
enough money down that I want to put yet
I mean yeah we're qualified for FHA
loans and stuff 3.5% down it's that's
easy but I want to put more than that
down
I want to qualify for a conventional
loan not an FHA and I want the home to
have equity from day one rather than
being immediately you know we're nearly
upside down after interest and all that
stuff was accumulated into the mortgage
not only that my wife is a stand up
and I work on the internet so we can
live anywhere and we're not convinced we
want to stay in California as much as
California seems like so much fun with
Disneyland and snow and the beaches and
mountains and all that stuff
it is very expensive Bolivia's there's
very few states that are more expensive
to live in than California one of them
being Hawaii and the other one being New
York New York has more taxes in
California but yeah so we're going to
lease for the next year and we're gonna
see where we are at the end of that year
the other thing I want to talk about is
sort of piggybacking on Logan over a
tech Syndicates rants about ISPs and you
know I have a friend that worked for
Comcast up in Washington and I was kind
of ranting to him yesterday about this
situation now I live in an old
neighborhood right now I mean the
neighborhood was built in the 60s
the only broadband provider there is
AT&amp;amp;T u-verse which you guys know the DSL
sucks by the way and Time Warner Cable
now I know a Time Warner for before they
were Time Warner when they took over AOL
in stuff's like we go them for a long
long time
and over the course of being with them
forever they've continued to up our
internet speeds for the same price
without charging us anything extra
so for 99 bucks a month which again it's
a lot compared to other countries with
the speeds that you get you know some
guys in some countries are messaging me
saying they're getting 300 mega bit or
500 megabit for 40 bucks it's like wow
you know the u.s. just sucks when it
comes to the internet speeds but I was
getting 300 down 20 up for 99 bucks a
month which isn't terrible at all it's
fantastic the problem is that's the only
provider available there so moving to a
denser populated area you know that's a
newer area say cumin maybe I'll get a
chance of getting like FiOS or fiber or
something nice and fast
nope the only available provider where
I'm at now we're moving to is charters
spectrum which is a 60 megabit by 4
megabit and that's it that's one plan
there's no different tiers there's no
faster options unless you want to go
with the business and then it's only 100
by 5 and you paid more than twice as
much for only an extra 40 down and one
up extra ridiculous so I turn on the
phone Verizon and SM of a we're going to
be trying to expand into the area
because Verizon is in a few different
pockets of that zip code the same thing
with Time Warner I asked them the guy in
Time Warner told me that there are no
plans of expansion in that neighborhood
because of the lockdown agreement that
Charter has with that zip code in the
municipality and I got out of I got on
the phone my friend who lives up in
Washington and no I'm not imaginary the
one who worked at Comcast and he was
explaining to me the politics involved a
municipality and why you always have
that one dominant ISP provider in
different areas and it sucks you know
that because I have no choice if I have
to go with this 60 by 4 and I've got to
make it work it's going to take me five
times longer to upload videos which I
mean I'll be looking at about an hour
upload which isn't terrible but that
thing that means while I'm uploading now
I can't do anything else that would
require any sort of upstream and 60
megabit down that's not that's not bad
at all I can dump at the town I barely
scratch the amount of down a half now
even though I pay for 300 I've been
getting 350 so Time Warner's been giving
me an extra 50 on top of what I paid for
there I'm getting almost as much extra
with time order as I'm getting total
with charter so
I'm just ranting right now but the
stupid ISP situation that we have you
know it's it's really messed up when
utilities an internet for all intents
and purposes is a utility not a
commodity can have a complete monopoly
like that it's ridiculous and I don't
know if anything's ever gonna change in
this stupid country when it comes to the
ISPs but yeah it's ridiculous so anyway
we're going to do the walkthrough right
now yeah I just want to get the off my
chest I tweeted that yesterday people
you know that I was getting 65 for now I
can do I can bring in multiple lines
from charter and it's only 40 bucks a
month 39.99
so I'm saving money on that and I could
bring in two or three of them and pay
roughly the same as I was paying maybe
for 20 bucks more and get you know a
really decent connection the problem is
that I've got to pay for some sort of a
surface like pfSense
or mushroom networks to - you know
what's the word I'm looking for here I
want to say truncate them technically
it's not a trunking it's a link
aggregation but that's ridiculous
because I sometimes that's $200 a month
just to get that service that
anyway I'm sure some of you guys feel my
pain and I know some of you were like
whip bitch and we only get three down
point five up yeah we got trying to run
a YouTube channel with that connection I
hope anyway this affects my business
that's why I'm mad about this whatever
all right so I guess now we'll take a
tour how destroyed the house is you guys
remember this room I spent all this time
getting this set up this has kind of
become the baby's playroom while
everything else is pretty much getting
destroyed here's the TV and stuff Larry
the Cable Guy playing I guess I'll watch
that idiot
here all the boxes I showed you earlier
still have to take down that
entertainment center more boxes the
kitchen's destroyed with boxes and some
of that stuff is staying it's actually
not ours Oh see it's take a tour this
way and house very you never even got a
house tour of did you boxes in the
hallway boxes there here's the office
that kind of still looks like it's
together but it's not just the desk it's
together and you take that apart still
and the computer which I'm going to edit
this on shortly after I record this see
some more boxes there camera still
together there and the golf clubs
they're coming this way that's a little
Jays room yes pretty much
as you guys can see all packed up boxes
they're boxes they're boxes they're her
computer still together I've got to take
that apart actually the famous blinking
mouse let's see oh look suspension parts
master bedroom here the wife there
everything as you guys can see is
completely and utterly just dis come on
girl
what are you watching the news watching
the news how boring is that so this is
our brand new fridge that we bought
because old one took a dump it why she
didn't go bad I guess the condenser
froze over but anyway new fridge there
what's in the fridge I never do like a
like a MTV Cribs type of deal did we
yeah we got some egg beaters and stuff
down there
beers down there and yeah food what else
would you expect to be in there okay
moving on to the backyard our new
backyard actually doesn't have any grass
in it which kind of sucks but it's
completely water friendly almost out of
boxes see we got some stuff there this
is the other fridge going back in there
a bookshelf that we're gonna refinish
this looks like garbage but this was
actually my wife's childhood vanity
there's a mirror that goes to it too
that our neighbor's refinishing there
and we did this guy you me hey boy all
right hi there and then of course there
is the shed which kind of looks like
it's a complete shambles when it's
really not that's recycling bottles that
we got to take care of and then as you
can see back there hey white you as you
can see back there it's stacked up with
a lot of computer cases and monitors and
things like that is actually all stuff
in there but yeah that's pretty much it
so yeah I'm gonna miss this house when
I'm kind of not at the same time if that
makes sense
the house we're moving into man wait you
guys see it is freakin amazing I've got
to get the network patch panel finished
up in the new house but I don't actually
get the keys to that until Sunday night
Monday morning Sunday
Jerry and I are going to be at
Disneyland with our families who's
actually flying down in Southern
California and going to do that why are
you running around in circles down there
this guy is just like oh I'm gonna run
in circles max boy where's man where's
the dog where's the dog where is he oh
we're just doing circles now wait oh
we're gonna come this way oh all right
anyway that's enough of that doesn't up
that crap let me know if you guys want
me do a vlog from Disneyland he's saying
he's not going to I think you should I
think you should be putting up more
videos but anyway let me know if you
guys want me to do a vlog I'll gladly do
it and then I got a video like I do on
Friday figure out what to do about that
I might do some car stuff and I'll maybe
I'll do a vlog from the car you guys
tell me how the news II I haven't showed
it really much but the next week start
the official moving blog so we're going
out of here and into
anyway I know this video has been a
little bit on the weird side yeah it's
very upside down part of my life at the
moment moving into this giant house and
you know if we'd like it we might end up
buying it actually because this house
was on the market for sale and it was
turned into a leasing property and
depending what the market looks like at
the end of this year if we really like
it we might buy it who knows anyway guys
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next video let me know if you only do
the vlog from Disneyland I will gladly
do it and I will get that I'll call him
a codec hole I will get that codec hole
on camera with me doing a vlog as well
anyway guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
