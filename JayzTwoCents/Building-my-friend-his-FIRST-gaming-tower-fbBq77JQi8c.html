today's video is sponsored by Noor DPN a
virtual private network service that's
designed to keep your information safe
encrypted and secure from prying eyes on
the internet you wouldn't walk around in
your house naked with all the windows
open would you okay well maybe you would
but that's besides the point why would
you do that if you don't want to the
same thing happens we can connect to the
internet without a VPN anyone can spy on
that information so encrypt your data
and keep it safe and secure regardless
of where you live in the world because
they have more than 5,000 servers
including regions like the Middle East
Asia Europe of course the United States
and the Americas and you can keep your
information safe and secure this holiday
season you can also save 75% off a
three-year membership and if you use my
offer code J's two cents you can get an
extra month for free so what are you
waiting for give the gift of security or
buy it for yourself by using the link in
the description below ok so I'm actually
building a computer for my driving
instructor you guys have followed my car
stuff for a while you know that I do a
lot of high-performance driving events
or HPD events and I have a driving coach
his name is Steven Doherty winner of the
2012 GT Academy and yeah so he has been
giving me professional instruction for
the last couple years now to make me a
better safer faster competitive driver
on track well he he hasn't really been
into computers I mean he sort of kind of
sort of he's mostly been like
PlayStation and stuff like I talked
about Gran Turismo and about a year and
a half ago or so gave him a laptop an
MSI laptop but he's been playing some
stuff on there like R factor and whatnot
but now he's starting to get into
virtual reality specifically virtual
reality simulators mostly because he
spent time on mine and he got bitten by
the bug so he hit me up and was like hey
can you give me a list of parts and I
was like I could do you one better I
could build you a better computer then
you're gonna go out and buy especially
this time of year right now and there
won't be any import taxes so parts wise
on this I'm actually not going to over
the top because I want this video to
also sort of serve as a you guys are
used to seeing these kinds of builds
here right the small form-factor thing
we got obviously we've got the titan
sitting
they're the new r-tx Titan sitting on
the test bench and all of its gold glory
as well as the gold Ram and stuff here
I'll show you ridiculous gold Ram Gold
Titan white build it's heavy you know
because of all the gold you guys are
used to seeing these crazy builds like
skunk works and thread Ripper and all
that but you know that is not indicative
of the average PC enthusiast or builder
which is why this is a little bit more
modest but yet still amazing when it
comes to gaming performance so I'm
throwing in a 7700 K on an MSI Z 270 m7
gaming motherboard so it's nice and
gunmetal II it says 7700 X ignore the X
fill pointed out that I wrote X and it
was a K I know my alphabet I had
alphabet soup when I was a kid an
alphabet what's alphabet cereal
so anyway 7700 kz2 7tms im7 gaming
motherboard I'm gonna be putting 16
gigabytes of g.skill ddr4 that's
obviously because of 7th gen we need
ddr4 I may switch this Ram out for
something that's not read I don't know I
don't know if I'm gonna be doing
anything else read in here I know it
lights up red but anyway that's kind of
besides the point for storage
again nothing crazy we've got a 1
terabyte Kingston SSDs are amazing
values in fact you can find a link to
this down in the description below more
than like they'll put a list of all the
parts this time of year you can get
amazing deals on SSDs but the Kingston
SSDs always lesser expensively gave you
amazing performance we've used a bunch
of these in budget builds and smaller
sizes like 128 and 256 they last forever
I'm also running a two terabyte Seagate
Barracuda because he's not going to be
running a lot of titles he's not gonna
be running a bunch of storage you know
doing videos and pictures and stuff and
the load times on that a perfectly fine
for games plus what the one terabyte he
can put all his important games on here
that he wants and then the Barracuda can
be his you know whatever he wants on
there power supply we're gonna be using
the cooler master master what 750 tough
gaming Edition and repairing that with
cooler masters code is this the master
box MB 500
addition if you can't tell that there's
a obviously collaborative effort between
a soos and Coolermaster on the tough
serious stuff been looking for a reason
to use this and I think we finally found
it in terms of cooling though I think
I'm gonna use the H 150 I Pro because
it's a 360 I can put a 360 on the front
of this and I'm always switch out the
fans to RGB you'll produce of course
there are DB fans on this because I
don't want to do any case lighting but I
think if we put enough case fans in here
that have lights themselves it will
illuminate the build and will look good
so let's do this let's go ahead and
build it and then what do you do after
you build it you install windows some
crap like that updates for two days
let's get it all ready to ship to him
let's make his Christmas amazing now
it's important that I reiterate this
this build is not about being streamed
yes I'm aware that the parts on here are
not budget I I never said this was gonna
be a budget build I want to give him an
amazing build but everything you're
gonna see here is just direct bolt-in
it's stuff that you can buy off Amazon
Micro Center Newegg whatever throw it in
your system I'm gonna show you how good
a system can look and how well it can
technically perform without having to do
anything crazy or custom these rigid
tube builds and stuff behind me there
are fun to do but they're a huge
diminishing return in terms of
performance to cost so it's one of those
things where this build right here we're
not going over the top of the power
supply like I mention were using a 750
watt you guys know I like to put a
thousand watt and everything even like a
budget build I would throw a thousand
watt in there because I just like
fighting big power supplies in there
we're not going too crazy on the RAM we
could have gone with eight gigs and been
flying I would want to make sure that no
matter what he decides to use he's going
to have plenty of performance and in
fact for graphics on that I forgot to
even mention I'm gonna also be putting
in for graphics though I want to see if
the ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1080 amp Extreme
Edition will fit in there because the
accent colors for the tough Edition are
actually yellow and this has got a
gunmetal and yellow look which would
match our motherboards yes I know I know
how it sounds matching colors this and
that people
building rhaegar systems don't usually
have the luxury of matching colors well
fortunately in my inventory I have the
ability to do it and I want to do it and
I want to give him the best experience
that he can't look at that was he gonna
fit in there it will look at hello that
isn't the case just
okay Phil says this looks like Vegas
because of all the flashing lights and
stuff I like the particular blinking
lights I have it set to you right now so
you use a little Corsair controller
that's in the back side of the case to
change the lighting config these lights
that I used are not they don't plug into
RGB header on the motherboard which
means you can't control them with
software which unfortunately means now
we've got MSI mystic light to control
the RGB on the motherboard and I think
we have to download the zotac software
to control the hiding on the motherboard
or the graphics card and then we have a
different controller to control the
lights that are in the case so obviously
the next thing has to do is install an
operating and stuff and our operating
system and get everything updated BIOS
updates Driver updates and all that
stuff
I just want to show it does boot
everything works we're running at 29 C
on the CPU right now at 4.2 gigahertz on
the 7700 K we got 16 gigabytes of
Kingston HyperX or notice' HyperX it's
the Kingston predator RAM which is
actually the first set of ddr4 that ever
reviewed on this channel when it first
came out the zotac GT X 1080 amp extreme
is obviously going to do all the heavy
lifting when it comes to VR I'd have no
problems running games like project cars
or iRacing or whatever when it comes to
virtual reality and then this system
will last him quite a few years when it
comes to be able to play additional
games in the future like I said he has a
gaming laptop now this is a huge upgrade
from that and I think he's really going
to enjoy it so we will be doing a
complete build guide here in the near
future though a building kind of like
the ultimate 9900 K system again not
gonna be like rigid tube or water-cooled
or anything like that just again
off-the-shelf parts and stuff but
designed for people who are maybe this
Christmas getting their first PC parts
and they're uncomfortable putting it
together we're gonna do a revised and
brand new xx end of 2018 build guide so
stay tuned for that if you're curious
about building your first computer or
you're getting ready any guys I'm gonna
go this was just an opportunity for me
to shoot another build video if you're
into computers and stuff it's always fun
to watch it getting put together and
it's even more fun to watch me fumble
through the process I mean look at the
table remember that video idea where I
went to NZXT and I saw their BLD service
and I said
that they're not builders they're robots
because they are not messy these guys
aren't builders they're way too
organized I think they're robots that's
what I ended up with on the table and
all I did was build this and I did it in
about three times the amount of time
that they build it in and their stuff is
even neater so the difference between
building it every single day for a
living and then building it for fun like
I kind of do so anyway I digress thanks
for watching guys as always I'll see you
in the next one this is thicker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
