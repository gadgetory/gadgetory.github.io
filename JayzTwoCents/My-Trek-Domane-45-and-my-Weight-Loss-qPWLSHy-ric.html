obviously this video is a little bit
different than what you guys are used to
so if you guys were looking for some PC
tech or something you might want to go
ahead and skip this one but if you're
curious about how I've been getting into
shape and by popular demand people are
the one to know more about my bike then
go ahead and stick around I won't judge
you or get mad either way but that's
what I do hope you stay gigabites flex
display technology automatically detects
and connects up to four displays for the
best gaming experience and multi display
ultra HD click the link in the
description to find out more so over the
last three months you guys have been
very cognizant over the fact that there
has been a slimming of the J and in fact
we are going to continue that trend but
so far in the last three months I have
lost over 40 pounds because of well this
is part of it not all of it but this is
part of it I had no intentions of doing
any sort of a bike video on this channel
but once again I was reminded of the
fact that this is Jay's 2 cents and not
J's 2 computers or J's 2 tech it's about
anything I want to talk about and I do
think that there is a lot of Technology
in what you're seeing right here now by
popular demand people have asked me to
please do a video about your bike so
that's what we're gonna do here today
now obviously we're outside it's a
little bit of wind you might hear some
squeaking from that guy's attic vent
over there there's a guy using a power
washer so if you guys hear a lot of
outdoor noises it should be blatantly
obvious why that is now what I have here
is become one of my absolute passions
and this little piece of technology in
front of me has literally changed my
life for the better over just a
three-month period so I figured if I do
a video on this maybe it'll help some of
you out which is ultimately the goal of
this channel now one other thing I want
to say before we get into this video is
a lot of you watching may be avid
cyclists yourself very experienced
cyclists and some things that I say and
show in this video might actually make
you cringe now this is my trick domani
before you guys go and start googling
this thing to see how expensive it is
just know it is not cheap but you should
also be aware of the fact that this
could get much more expensive as well in
fact the trek Domane 4.5
you're looking at right here is kind of
a mid-level carbon frame bike it could
be much more expensive upwards of
$10,000 this one comes in right around
26 to 28 hundred dollars depending on
where you buy it it does have a full
carbon frame it also has carbon fork on
the front which is aluminum reinforced
and of course aluminum reinforced rear
on there in terms of the group set it is
a Shimano all tegra group set and it
does have Shimano 105 brakes now that's
kind of one of the things you sacrifice
a little bit when you go with more of a
lower-end domani it has a lower end
domani considering this series goes all
the way up to the seventh series I am in
the fourth series but if you stepped it
up to something like a domani 5.1 then
you get the Shimano all tegra group set
with the Altera brakes as well but the
brakes on this thing are absolutely
fantastic it can stop a guy like me
which currently weighs 265 pounds with
no problem even going downhill with
minimal braking force now some of the
supporting gear that's on here which
again came with the bike is we do have
Bontrager FSA handlebars on here and a
Bontrager wheel set along with the
Bontrager GL seat now the seat is not as
forgiving for a big guy like me so it's
very important that I wear cycling
shorts to get as much padding on there
as possible but this bike and its carbon
frame weighs only 18 pounds this thing
is extremely light in fact it's very
noticeable how much heavier it is when I
put my two bottles on here as well as
having my tool set in the back which has
two tubes 216 grams co2 cartridges a co2
cartridge threaded adapter for filling
as well as a patch kit and the tool kit
it can get pretty damn expensive and I
think I just hit my head on a branch now
one of the things that are going to make
people cringe when they see this right
off the bat is the fact that I am
obviously using platform pedals and I
get this all the freaking time Jay why
aren't you using clipless pedals
actually what people are saying is Jay
why aren't you using clip pedals I want
to set something straight real quick the
pedals at which your feet walk into
using a cleat are not clipping pedals
when someone says to me Jay why aren't
you using clips that tells me you
yourself are not necessarily an avid
cyclist because you would know that the
pedals that you clip into are not
actually called clip ins they're called
clipless clips are actually referred to
as toe clips which are like a
on the front where your foot slides into
and you tighten it down those are
actually kind of dangerous so clipless
pedals are the ones where your shoe
actually has a cleat that clips into the
pedal I know right your foot clips into
it and it's called a clipless really the
reason why I'm not using those yet is it
all comes down to confidence whereas
I've already put about 300 miles on this
bike and I've done about a thousand
miles total so far including my
Cannondale quick v which is a hybrid
bike that I started on I'm still not
confident in being quick enough to be
able to clip in and unclip if the event
calls it out to put my foot down quickly
and I being 265 pounds a fall off this
bike could do some damage to my shoulder
my hip break a shoulder blade or break a
collarbone I'm not entirely looking
forward to that so I'm waiting till I
lose a little bit more weight and get a
little bit more confident in the saddle
before I start moving to clipless pedals
but rest assured I do feel that I'm
being held back and would definitely
like to do that here in the near future
now I do of course have a GoPro mount on
here and I've got some GoPro footage
here I like to use GoPro time lapses and
things on some of my rides but I don't
do it all the time in fact a lot of
people have asked me Jay why don't you
do GoPro time-lapse videos the vlog
channel which I had Jays says actually
has quite a bit of footage over there as
well some of the weight loss stuff
that's been happening on the bike you
guys can head on over there to check it
out but I've showed some footage here of
what's actually one of my fastest rides
including a Strava metal ride where I
took first place in a Strava segment so
you guys can see some of that but I have
taken this bike up to 47 miles per hour
with a little bit of downhill help not a
lot but a little bit of downhill help
and the bike is very very stable now the
domani line is actually not considered a
speed bike it's not considered a race
bike this is considered an endurance
bike and what that means is it's gonna
have a lot of things about it that are
more tailored towards comfort than
all-out speed now it is a little bit of
a narrow wheel set especially
considering our wheel span considering
the hybrid that I've been riding felt
very long so I do feel like I'm much
more over the front handlebars which is
good because you get in a nice low
position I do love moving from flat bar
to road bar because I've got lots of
differ
options of where I can put my hands and
if you've ever gone on long rides
anything over let's say 10 15 30 50
miles then you'll know if you can't move
your hands around they start to get numb
they've all the vibration and it really
really sucks so these handlebars are
extremely comfortable the grip tape I
have on here has a lot of cushion to
them and I like being able to have that
versatile versatility of moving my hands
around now shifting on this bike is very
very crisp in fact moving from the high
gear to the low gear is very quick and
it's one of the things I love about the
Altera group set in fact when I bought
this bike the dealer I bought it from
told me you know what you don't want to
scrimp on your group set so we went
ahead and with all tegra over the 105
but shifting on this thing has been an
absolute dream now the wheels are very
narrow they are not treaded at all
there's no tread in fact they're slick I
have had about four flats so far one in
the front three in the rear and that's
because when you have a lightweight tire
like this with no light tire liners and
a nice smooth almost feels like a fabric
but it's kind of a roughed up rubber
it's got amazing grip
unfortunately in water it can be very
very slick fortunately I live in a very
dry area but it's also very thin which
means punctures on this thing are a bit
of a bitch so always have spare tubes
and tools with you I've never once been
stranded on the side of the road because
I've always been prepared for that now
we're gonna get into the part where I
talk about some of my personal
experiences here on the bike I've seen a
lot of tweets and a lot of Facebook
messages and comments of people saying
Jay that's nice and all but you know I'm
just too big to start riding a bike and
they tell me that they're like 250
pounds 280 pounds 300 pounds guys when I
started writing not this bike but when I
started writing on January 26 which was
the day I bought my hybrid I weighed 309
pounds so I was able to ride without any
problems the bike was able to handle the
weight without any problems in fact the
dealers were like 309 pounds isn't big
they have 400 500 pounds guy a guy is
coming in looking for bikes so that's
not the problem the only thing you need
to be aware of is the longer that you
ride the bike especially the heavier
that you are you're
going to break down certain aspects of
the bike your cables are gonna stretch
as you're shifting cuz the bike has a
lot of torque on it you're gonna put a
lot of stress on your chain mostly
you're gonna end up probably going
through spokes before anything else I
did break a spoke on my hybrid once and
I was constantly putting my spokes out
of tension what that means is going over
bumps and things even though I would use
my my knees and my elbows as there's a
good gift for you even though is using
my knees and my elbows as suspension it
was still a big guy on a heavy bike
putting a lot of tension on the spokes
so they were constantly getting out of
adjustment that's we're moving to a bike
like this even though I'm still a
heavier gentleman really came in handy
because of the fact that I was able to
really move into a higher-end wheel set
and the reason why I got this bike was I
was getting to the point to where I
needed to upgrade my wheels so I wasn't
constantly breaking them but that was
gonna cost me five six hundred bucks to
get a good wheel set on a bike that I
knew I was outgrowing so we just went
ahead and made the move to this but when
it comes to mileage miles on this in
fact I did 32 miles with coconut monkey
prior to this video so this bike right
now is still a bit dirty from that ride
chains a little bit dirty
you know start out slow I mean I start
my first ride was twelve miles and just
about killed me I had inner thigh cramps
I wasn't prepared for it but you push
and you push and you push and you
continue to train now 50 mile rides or I
mean I do them on Saturdays for the heck
of it today we did a 32 mile ride just
for the heck of it I'm gonna be doing my
first grand fondo which is a hundred
kilometer 62 mile ride this week and I'm
working up towards a century ride which
is 100 miles it's a great feeling
I feel very free on the bike it's
definitely changed my life I mean it's
not like cycling in the gym it really is
just freedom you're out in the Sun I've
got the you know tan lines to prove that
you know I've been out on this bike
constantly and it really is just a
feeling unlike any other I mean I look
forward to hopping on this bike just as
much if not more than hopping on
skunkworks and doing cool benchmarking
and games and stuff now it's easier to
do long rides like that too especially
on a bike like this because even though
it's a carbon frame
think because the bike only weighs 18
pounds that it means it's weak it's not
it's extremely durable in fact they have
what's called this ISO post that's built
into the seat where the seat actually is
almost like a suspension in itself where
there's a little bit of flex in there
because it's isolated from the rest of
the frame so when I do hit bumps and
things in the road I do actually feel
some bouncing and some flex on the bike
so low but scary at first because it
feels like the bike is gonna break or
snap but you quickly learn that that's
not the case the bike is extremely
comfortable and that's one of the things
that makes it an endurance based bike it
is a little bit squirrely though for
instance I'm still not comfortable
trying to ride this thing with no hands
when I do take one hand off the
handlebar to reach for a bottle or
something it does become a little bit
squirrely so it's not as stable as I
would like with one hand but and in fact
looking at some other reviews on this
bike I'm not the first person to say
that so that's just kind of a dynamic of
the design of the bike my biggest advice
to anyone who's interested in getting a
bike especially for fitness is the key
to that is consistency you can't ride a
bike once a week or even twice a week
for short mileage or short duration and
think you're going to get any sort of
results and on top of that it really
comes down to your eating you've got to
eat proper so that you fuel your rides
and you're gonna get more out of it one
of my favourite channels to watch is GCN
which is the global cycling Network the
hilarious guys there's three guys out of
England actually four guys out of
England that run that channel they are
freakin hilarious and pro cyclist and
they will tell you five one-hour rides a
week are way more beneficial than one
five hour ride per week so even if you
get out there and just do a half hour
every single day you're going to see
results you're going to see weight loss
I mean as you can see I am definitely
kind of like living proof of that I
never would have gotten in camera in
front of the camera like this full body
shot and been comfortable with that but
considering the fact that this bike has
made me feel more stress-free my heart
is strong my body is shrinking my
strength is through the roof my
endurance is through the roof for our
ride five hour ride is nothing I feel
like I can do more it's just really
changed every aspect of my life so I
hope you guys have enjoyed today's video
a little bit different just talking
about another love and hobby of mine
I didn't even want to do this video but
this is definitely by popular demand I
had been getting I don't know how many
requests to do a video about my bike and
about my cycling and about the weight
loss on the main channel not the vlog
channel to where I went ahead and
decided to do it if you guys didn't like
it that's perfectly alright too but this
video was tailored specifically to those
who were asking so there you go guys
make sure you guys I highly recommend
checking out the guys over at GCN they
have helped me a lot in just watching
their videos they kind of do what I do
for computer noobs for biking noobs and
they teach you a lot of stuff and they
made me feel more comfortable with
getting on a bike even as a big guy and
going and losing weight and getting
stronger and just getting healthier and
happier so guys thanks for all your
comments thanks for all the noticing of
the weight loss we're gonna continue
this we've got about 48 more pounds to
go I know I'm I'm starting to wonder
where those 40 pounds are but my trainer
he believes we got 40 more pounds to go
to 65 we can get down to about 225 and
be super healthy so once again guys
thanks for your interest in the biking
and my hobby and noticing the weight
loss and stuff it means a lot it keeps
me motivated and as always guys thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
