box it's guaranteed to make the PCMR EPN
just a little bit bigger and before
moving forward because I know you guys
are already staring at it let's go and
talk about the fuzzy patch on my
forehead well I grew this lovely lovely
beard and my forehead started to feel a
little bit left out so I decided that my
forehead can go ahead and grow a beard
too but he has to promise to maintain
the thing I'm taking care of this one
right here so yeah can we can we move on
now please inside this little black box
is something that I said I would
actually not get unless Intel sponsored
and they were gracious enough to go
ahead and sponsor it I didn't think they
would but they did anyway it is an Intel
6950 x10 core 20 thread processor this
is entirely overkill especially for a
gaming PC but skunkworks is not just a
gaming PC skunkworks is a centerpiece to
this entire channel and it's facing a
lot of things I do around here entirely
unnecessary and this is one of them but
it's fun anyway and I'd do it because I
like it I guess it applies to both so I
digress currently installed in here
right now is my 59 60 X which is an 8
core 16 thread processor so this is
effectively giving me 4 extra threads of
performance as long as you know an
application can actually take advantage
of 20 threads so that's why today I'm
focusing on gaming at all this is not a
gaming chip by any means you can game on
it in fact it's single core performance
is actually a little bit slower than
something like a 6700 K so that would
make this not the best choice for a
gaming PC but as I said skunkworks is
not only the centerpiece of my channel
it is also how I make all of my all of
my dollars if you oh my dollars and
pennies and stuff around this channel
and anything I could do that can make my
process just a little bit faster
especially now that I'm encoding 4k
videos for you guys to watch on this
glorious fs5 camera anything I can do to
make that a little bit faster would be
great
so as we're gonna do today we're gonna
go ahead and run it to test real quick
when you Cinebench with this guy here
and it is overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz
right now we will test testing overclock
on this guy as well but both of these
are 3.0 gigahertz CPUs with 3.5 turbo
clocks
I will be overclocking both of these and
then doing my test because that's how I
run them day to day that's what I care
about but anyway we're gonna run so the
bench on this and then we're also going
to
code my dirtfish rally video again we're
going to time it and then we're going to
install this guy find its overclock
we're going to do send a bench again and
then we're going to re-encode that same
video with all these same exact settings
and then compare the differences
all right well that was fun um you guys
got to kind of see what's involved with
doing simple things like changing out of
CPU when you have rigid tubing in your
system it's not exactly as easy as you
would kind of hope but anyway it's still
fun and looks cool but I have got the 69
50 X installed right now it's running at
4.4 gigahertz which it can go farther I
just did an effortless 4 point 4
gigahertz overclock on it one that I
know works with the 59 60 X so it kind
of gives us a good apples to apples
comparison anyway between both of these
tests when I compare them at the same
frequency now I'm going to be seeing how
far the CPU can go when I have more time
to spend with it I would not be able to
get this video done in time for when I
want to upload it if I was screwing
around with the overclocks trying to
find its max stable which sometimes can
take days or even weeks as some of the
CPU starts to settle in if you will for
lack of a better term but anyway at
least what you're gonna see here is
apples to apples 4.4 gigahertz Broadwell
II versus the older haswell-e so when
Cinebench the 59 60 X scored a 1725
which is actually really good that's a
very good score much higher than
anything you're going to get on
mainstream that's because Cinebench
takes advantage of multi-threading
heavily and so it's going to optimize
very well towards multi-threaded CPUs
that have tons of cores and logical
threads over ones that have better per
core performance so when I installed the
69 50 X actually got a 22 63 so we are
talking over 500 points of increase on
that that is huge that's that's closer
to 30% but what about with what I use
every single day which is being the
Adobe Creative Suite Creative Cloud
Photoshop and all that stuff well we
actually why rendering that video I
showed you with the rally school the
dirtfish rally school it was 16 minutes
and 50 seconds from the moment I hit
encode on a thirty five mega bit 4k
video on the 59 60 X but when I
installed the 69 50 X I'm always gonna
get those numbers
so if I say the wrong in this video I
apologize but anyway that 69 50 X at 4.4
gigahertz was only a difference of about
a minute and 20 seconds at 15 minutes
and 32 seconds from encode to complete
and the file is fully rendered so you
might be asking yourself now why did
Adobe not do as well or show as much of
an improvement as Cinebench did well
that's because Cinebench is highly
optimized for multi-threaded CPUs as I
already said
now although Adobe is also optimized for
using additional threads where available
it does not take full advantage of high
thread CPUs which is why in some tests
people have shown that the 6700 K is
actually better at Adobe than these
high-end massive extreme CPUs so it's a
little bit of trade-off there and the
improvement that we actually saw
although again the extra cores were
being used but not at full utilization
not a hundred percent we did also see a
little bit of an improvement in the
architecture with Broadwell a versus
haswell-e which is where that difference
really came from now is hoping for more
of an improvement we might see more of
an improvement as I bump up that core
clock again Adobe really likes clock
frequency and I think it takes a little
bit of a prioritization to that than it
does having a ton of threads available
to it in this case 20 threads but we'll
play around more with that but guys this
is why you hadn't seen the skunkworks
benchmarks video yet because when I did
that build I reached out to Intel and
asked that they're interested in sending
me a CPU and of course they were willing
to do that but there was a lot of events
and stuff happening between now and then
it took time to get it I've got it it's
installed now we can start benchmarking
games and stuff and I also have to
consider whether or not I'm going to go
to Windows 10 on this machine to take
advantage of dx12 or do all my tests on
dx11 because again I'm still in 8.1 pro
over here I'm happy with it it ain't
broken I don't really want to fix it
then again I could have said the same
thing about skunkworks and I upgraded
that anyway anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video I hope you found
something interesting with this I don't
want to get something new like this and
install it and not share it with you
guys so that's really the whole point of
this video but moving forward we're
going to see some pretty badass content
coming up I know it's kind of been
lackluster lately and I apologize for
that we do the best I can to make things
exciting for you to watch again so stick
around stick with me and tell me what
you want to see do the best I can
get that all in there anyway guys thanks
for watching it as always I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
