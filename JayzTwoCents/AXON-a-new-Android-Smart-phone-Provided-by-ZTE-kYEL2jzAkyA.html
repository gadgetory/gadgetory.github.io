today we're gonna do a review of a piece
of wood and my terrible tan lines from
cycling today we're gonna do something I
have only done a couple of times on this
channel we are gonna take a look at a
smartphone device and it's not an Apple
device so that'll be fun and the talking
hands thing well if you've never seen my
channel before you've never seen my face
trust me I am doing you a favor
but today we're gonna take a look at ZTE
s new axon Android smartphone they're
gonna be making a big push here in the
US so today we're gonna be talking about
this phone and why this might actually
be one of my favorite Android devices
that I had personally ever touched and
trust me that's saying a lot if you ask
me this looks an awful lot like Apple
now we'll go ahead and open up the
package here and you'll see what I mean
when you open it up you are greeted with
the device now the axon comes in three
different colors you've got this black
with kind of a gold trim which is what
I've got
you've got silver which is basically
just like a bare aluminum anodized and
then you have got a kind of a goldish
color so again kind of taking cues from
Apple on that one I think but once you
take it out here I'm just kind of set
that aside you remove this tray you are
met with a little fold out thing here
that's got you know Quick Start Guide
it's not easy to get this out and then
you've got inside charger cable charger
and earbuds or earphones so this is why
I say this is awfully a lot like Apple I
think their presentation at least my
first impressions of opening up the
package here this is this is way too
Apple I I would like to have seen
something a little bit more unique
because this let's face it the reason
why I'm doing this review is axon brings
something kind of unique and and
different that's not your mainstream
brand which is why I'm excited about
this product but anyway the headphones
they are JBL so these are going to be a
nice high quality earbud I don't want
evil come your but that's an Apple thing
earphone in ear earphone
that's gonna meet the sound quality that
a lot of the customers you know desired
I also would have liked to have seen a
black charging cable and a black brick
with black headphones because that's
more Android to me I don't I know I've
said there's like 15 times already but
my first impressions when I open this
package up and started messing with it
was it's an Apple product or what let's
go and run through the specs real quick
of the physical aspects of the phone it
is a 5.5 inch screen compared to the
iPhone 6 you can see it does look pretty
big but the display is not actually edge
to edge which is going to be good so if
you are gonna be putting case on this
thing it's not going to be covered up at
all by any of the case it does weigh
6.10 ounces or six point ten ounces or
175 grams so it's not the lightest phone
there's ever been but because of the
all-metal construction I do think that
that's an√≠bal weights in fact it's kind
of weighty which is in my opinion I'd
like to have a phone that's got a little
bit of weight to it
does measure nine point three
millimeters thick so it is thicker than
say an iPhone 6 or some of the other
Android devices but that's because it's
got this sort of a curve to it and
because it's got a curve it's got a
thicker point in the middle so that 9.3
millimeters is measured right here in
the center or the highest point of the
phone but other than that it is a really
solid feeling phone because it's curved
though it does feel a little bit
slippery in my opinion because there's
no edge really on the back to kind of
put your hand against so you do want to
be careful if you're not running with a
case that you don't drop this thing it
is very slick because of the aluminum
case but other than that it is not user
serviceable you cannot pop this back
cover off you cannot replace the battery
you cannot replace the storage so that's
something to keep in mind now one thing
I think is really really nice about this
device and I've always complained about
this especially with Apple is putting
the speaker on the bottom of the device
never made sense because when you're
holding it let's say like this you're
gonna block it with your hands or it's
just the sound is going away from you
you want the sound coming towards you so
ZTE has put the actual speakers right
here inside this really attractive
looking mesh grille
and then on the top here you have a
matching mesh grille but the speakers
are down here as well as the microphone
pickup so it's facing you imagine that
sound that faces you guy who would have
thought moving on to the front of the
device you've got a really beautiful TFT
display as I mentioned 534 pixels per
inch it's very very sharp it's very
smooth and it is not an edge to edge
screen which is nice because when you
put a case on this thing you're not
gonna have it wrapping over the screen
at all making some of the edges harder
to touch you do have a front facing
camera on here which we'll talk about a
little bit later in this video and then
you do have a dedicated home button
flanking the home button on either side
you've got two little dots the left dot
is a back button so let's say you're you
know in something whatever you hit that
dot you're gonna go back to the previous
screen and then on the right it brings
up a programmable key but it's also
brings up task manager which you can
clear all right from there so it's nice
and quick to actually enable those
functions now scrolling on this is very
very quick and snappy and that's because
in terms of hardware specs on this it's
almost a little bit ridiculous this is
using a Snapdragon 810 which is an 8
core 2,000 megahertz processor that's
probably faster than some people's
desktops and on top of that it's got 4
gigabytes of RAM this thing is an
absolute monster in terms of just
responsiveness now keeping this thing
alive is a three thousand milliamp
battery which is advertising 12 hours of
talktime and ten days or 240 hours of
standby time and it is not user
replaceable I just want to point out
this back panel does not come off this
is one of those Android devices here
that's not serviceable you can't get
inside you can't expand the memory you
cannot do anything to the device it's
almost lockdown hardware wise kind of
like an iPhone where you cannot expand
the memory so that's kind of a downside
number one Android always being used or
friendly in terms of adding more memory
and such you can't or storage you can't
do that in this case but this one does
come with 32 gigabytes of built-in
storage so that should be more than
enough for most people you're just not
gonna be able to put a ton of movies and
stuff on here you can put tons of
pictures tons of applications and tons
of music but I wouldn't go putting
a ton of movies on here because 32 gigs
will fill up fast it would be nice to
see a 64 gig or maybe even a 128 gig
variant but anyway that's what's
available on this model right here now
ZTE is claiming that this is the first
true HiFi sound device in the US it's
got two dedicated audio chipsets in
there it's got an analog to digital
converter or an ADC for improved
recording and digital to analog
converter for better playback so this
thing does have a built in sound
recorder that you could hook up a high
quality microphone to this or use the
built-in microphone which is going to
sound decent as well and it's got a DAC
built into this to give you superior
playback especially when you use high
fidelity headphones kind of like the
JBL's that were actually included with
this but it's going to sound fantastic
but the built-in speakers on this thing
are also probably amongst the best I've
ever heard now because they do have all
of this space right here to put a nice
massive well I guess massive compared to
the device - LED speaker in here the
playback on this thing is actually very
very good now I'm gonna play a little
bit right here a little bit of this
music you're not going to be able to
hear how good it sounds trust me
I just want to play this back so you
guys can at least hear the volume level
of this thing is actually pretty
impressive so the sound quality of the
speaker's is fantastic and as I
mentioned when you're holding it guess
what they face you or a height now we're
not going to talk a whole lot about the
operating system on this you can look up
pretty much any android 5.1 you know
review and you'll get a really good idea
of how this works but it's very
lightweight they're not sticking a bunch
of crap on here that you don't care
about and that you don't want but they
do offer you a couple of extra launchers
on here as well if you want to do that
you can scroll up and you can see you
know things that are going on for the
day etc consider I'm still kind of sucky
and Android you can see I have done 10
steps today obviously have not been
carrying this phone around very often
notice all right I haven't left my chair
don't judge me now one of the other
phones out there that's really kind of
made a splash in the Android community
with it not being a mainstream like
flagship device from Samsung or motor
Rolla you know HTC was the 1+1 but most
people had nothing but terrible things
to say about the camera well the camera
and this guy here is a 13 megapixel
camera in fact it's even got 4k
recording capability at 30fps built-in
but it's got a ton of different modes
now we're going to flip this around now
you guys can see me you feel pretty I am
do you see my pretty face so the
front-facing camera on here has got face
rate facial recognition it's also not
the sharpest camera in the world for
front-facing but I think it gets the job
done
now when you flip it around you've got
13 megapixels to play with on the dual
camera setup and both of these cameras
here are actually they're not the same
you've got two different apertures also
happening between both of these camera
cameras which are going to give you some
very near DSLR type of performance now
I'm not gonna call it DSLR performance a
lot of people are quick to say that
you're never going to get DSLR
performance out of something like this
size so I'm just gonna go ahead and say
that now but they do give you all of
these different modes here you've got
full manual mode multi exposure mode
where you can take two pictures and kind
of overlay them on top of each other
panorama sport which is a very fast
shutter speed with a very fast focus
slow motion and interval intervals kind
of neat it's kind of like a time-lapse
you can play around that a little bit
we've got auto mode and you've also got
a bokken mode now bokeh is a bokeh
however you want to say it it's
basically like depth of field it is
where you can make things that are
farther away blurrier because you can
play with the f-stop on this particular
camera now anything below f 2.0 is going
to be nothing but a software
manipulation of the photo it's not a
true f 1.0 in this trust me but you can
play around with this where you can take
a photo here and touch what you want to
focus on it'll beep at you when it gets
the focus take the photo and then it
actually adds more bokeh post-production
which as you can see right there the
axon is in perfect focus but then
everything else is super blurry now it
wasn't actually that
when it took the photo but it did a
process of post-processing to it which
added a little bit to it so it's not a
true you know depth of field or f-stop
that you're playing around with anything
below 2.0 anyways but and I just bumped
the shutter button but anyway it does
give you a little bit of creativity to
play around with now as I mentioned
earlier the camera does do 4k recording
at 30fps we'll put up a couple of
samples of that probably somewhere
around now but I will say the camera on
this thing is pretty damn good you can
see the detail on the flower is super
sharp it really likes to do macro
photography in fact this camera is
fantastic at doing macro stuff I even
pointed it directly at the Sun just to
see how the sensor could handle that it
did a fantastic job of giving me almost
like a dual exposure where even though
it was pointed directly at the Sun you
could still see the palm tree it's not
in super detail it's quite a bit
shadowed but you got an image that gave
you something than just a big Sun flare
in the middle of the screen okay so the
last thing I want to do with this is I
want to do a little bit of a gaming demo
on this that eight-course Snapdragon
processor is when this is this might as
well just be like a PSP or a full-on
gaming device because that processor and
that four gigs of ram is just absolutely
overkill for a device like this so I
just thought I'd do a couple seconds
here of Angry Birds - in fact it's so
loud I got to turn it down man told you
those speakers are loud but we'll just
do a few seconds of this Angry Birds
isn't exactly a very demanding game
oh yeah and as you can see there's no
stutters or anything it's very very
smooth a graphics processor on this is
really good dad turn down farther this
speakers are so loud
get back here and oh fail alright wow
that's a nail that alright I totally
meant to do that
alright but as you can see it the
gameplay on this is super smooth
although the driver really sucks
that's for sure and we're going to purr
fast
and I finished first oh yeah
all right well gaming on this thing as
you can see is pretty amazing I'm happy
with it so here in the US right now it
currently works on AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile NPCs
cricket Rogers Bell Tell entellus if you
happen to be in Europe or Asia it's
gonna work on most Europe Asia Oceania
Latin America country areas where GSM +
WCDMA Network roaming is actually
working so I can't use this on Verizon
unfortunately that's kind of a downside
but it is unlocked and you do buy it
carrier free you buy directly from ZTE
so you're not gonna have to deal with
contracts or any of that stuff and then
a price of 450 dollars the features that
you get for 450 bucks I think it's great
because you start dealing with phones
like Samsung and iPhone and all of that
to buy them carrier or contract free
they can be like 700 bucks or something
stupid so there you go guys
the axon from ZTE I think this is a
super super sharp device I really like
the way that it looks I like the way
that it performs I don't like the way it
doesn't work on Verizon all right so
what device you guys using sound off
down in the comments or hit me up on
Twitter and let me know it's always guys
thanks for watching maybe we'll do more
of these mobile content type videos this
was kind of fun
no but out of my element but I I do
carry a smartphone so I do feel like
I've got some opinion on the matter all
right guys time to get out of here and
we'll see you where are you were you at
there you are we'll see you in the next
