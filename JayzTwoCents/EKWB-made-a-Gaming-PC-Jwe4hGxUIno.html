we're gonna take a look at a pre-built
system but not just any pre-built system
this is what happens when you take a
very enthusiast company with the modding
community you get a mashup collaboration
known as the ek fluid gaming X 600
series today we're to look specifically
at the X 603 today's video is sponsored
by master up in the Sun highs RPC 37 X
professional-grade gaming headset
Sennheiser is known for its legendary
sound quality and now you can have the
best of both worlds without compromising
mic quality making it the perfect choice
for gamers and professionals alike the
detachable ten-foot cable and 3.5
millimeter plugs that share maximum
compatibility while running your own
amplifiers without taking up an
additional USB slot to learn more about
the sennheiser pc 37 X's for mass drop
click the link in the description below
but I'm wearing these gloves because
this chassis if you guys watched my
denver micro Center kind of a grand
opening that we did and I did that build
this is essentially the same thing but
they were just launching it around that
time so the idea here is that this is
utilizing a chassis that was designed by
dare power in conjunction with Lee and
Lee well obviously talk about all that
but back then the system was just
starting to kind of make it into the
retail space at least at micro Center
because it's the only place you could
actually get this system is that micro
Center but I built one on stage and
obviously when you get it it is already
put together and built as you can see
this is all packed up with insta pack
but here it is the power spec X 603 but
it utilizes the lien ly dynamic
zero-one-one
which was like I said a chassis that was
designed in collaboration with their
Bower world-class overclocker and mater
and so obviously the cooling is a
important one with this chassis you know
there's three models you can choose from
the X 601 602 and 603 now we're going to
take a look at some of the different
specs and stuff that you can get will go
down the list here on the left what I
found was and the reason why I didn't do
it with micro Center is because micro
Center is not available everywhere
there's only 25 stores across the
country whereas my Newegg does ship
across the country and with Micro Center
you can't buy things like CPUs and stuff
and have them mailed to you so I kind of
wanted to see how the price of this
compares to say putting in a cart with
like Amazon or new egg and what we found
is especially for the 601 the pricing
was extremely competitive in fact they
advertise that you can get this system
pre-built and sent to you because
there's only those three specs like you
can't customize it or have parts change
it is what it is those are the three
that's it is you can get it for not much
more than the cost of an AIO but of
course this is is using the fluid gaming
system in here which is the aluminum all
all aluminum pieces so no issues with
gabbana corrosion but your CPU is
water-cooled and your GPUs water-cooled
see what else we get here inside of this
little pouch these are all your extra
unused cables because obviously it is a
modular power supply power cable
antennas because it is an Asus z3 90
Strix II rubber block not sure what
that's for RGB extension cables extra
screws that came with the case some
plugs and all that stuff extra SATA
cables suspect wise the ex 603 comes
with an Intel 9700 K obviously Windows
10 Pro 64-bit this is the Strix z3 98
gaming motherboard I cut says system
board and one kind of called it
something to brown RTX 2080 PCIe
graphics card 16 gigabytes of ddr4 ram
now the picture shows g.skill trident zr
GBS we'll see what's in here
500 gigabytes solid-state boot drive
it's actually an nvme drive at least
from what we found online
I think it was a 750 watt power supply
but we'll see when we actually get in
there it's not showing here on the Box
what it is but let's go ahead take a
look at this and it does look like it's
empty so we will be filling it so
obviously that's how they're shipping it
I was kind of wondering how they shipped
these but they shipped them empty so
that way they don't get damaged sorry
tell
so as you can see in terms of packing
material - nice closed cell foam enough
to make Linus kind of is all over
himself alright so we I get the sense to
pack out of here to do that is these two
screws on the back if you've never seen
a dynamic zero zero or zero one one this
pulls off like this and the glass comes
straight up like that so there is the
inside and it's the pec hope everything
is in place
that is a perfectly sized sense to pack
right there isn't it you ready see all
the tubes are still on there would you
look at that so it's got residue like
water droplets in there because
obviously they pre test these here comes
the peel porn which apparently is a
thing and I won't I won't say anything
we'll just let them flow just let the
might get this sound for fill so this
also kind of goes in the same way like
that so you have to take this off peel
get to the fill port but you can see
it's got these little grooves right here
and they just fit into these little
channels so you set the little tabs in
the bottom and then you just slide it
into place that's the way that the
dynamic chassis works let's just kind of
get right into filling it up I guess or
kind of need to do that you don't want
to run it without water alright so I'm
about filling it real quick because the
manual shows you here using a fill
bottle like this which has a little tube
that you can kind of push down in there
I don't have one of these believe it or
not I never have I probably should
because it really helps with systems
like this because we are filling in the
distribution block this distribution
block doubles as a reservoir as well you
have two ports on here one of the
top-left corner one on the bottom right
corner so in the way it's sitting on its
feet this would be the drain and this
would be the fill air has to be able to
come out because it's a sealed system
it's not like there's another port over
here which would have been fantastic if
they had made just another port right
here so you can crack this open and
allow air out the water can't go in
until the air comes out it's volume
displacement and what you'll notice is
that if see how it's kind of more warped
going in there see how that just bubbled
like that if you fill this all up one if
you're not paying attention you're gonna
overfill this too as the air comes out
is a bubble and it kind of splashes so
that's kind of sucky so if you had a
bottle like they show in the picture
here you can put the tube down in there
and that's not sealed like this fitting
is then that wouldn't be a problem but
since I don't have that it's kind of a
problem for me so I'm gonna try here
right now is then doing this fitting
which I think I just dribbled down the
front and I'm gonna try to just kind of
poke it my funnel in there which is not
a euphemism I swear so if I do it like
this and then I tilt the system back or
they put something under the front to
get it up higher then that should give
me the desired effect that I'm looking
for here there we go see now we can
control the fill rate alright so here it
is all pretty much assembled so the nice
thing is the front manifold right here
which also doubles as the reservoir is
so this helps it bleed as you kind of
saw normally when I fill a system I'll
put the jumper on the power supply fill
it turn on the power supply switch let
just the pump run let it kind of fill
the system fill it up do it a few times
so there's no chance of running the CPU
block dry which would be bad for the CPU
now if any fluid is touching the block
at all even a little bit even those tons
of air it will help but we were kind of
like we realized that as soon as i
tilted it back and started filling it
that as soon as the water got to about
these top tubes right here or even this
bottom one right here that air started
pushing out and we saw the level going
down and it was sort of filling up the
tubes and the radiator so I kind of went
wow maybe we don't need to actually fill
this and use a jumper because there's no
jumper included in this box which we
thought was kind of strange because it's
included with the with the kit the 240
kit in the 360 Khitan all that but it
wasn't included with this so basically
as long as you make sure that it's
tilted back and you're filling this and
you get as much of the air out as
possible which will happen naturally air
wants to be free doesn't want to be
under pressure so as the water is
filling air is being pushed out and even
though it's only happening through one
port as long as you don't seal it off
with a tube and you use like a funnel or
a squeeze bottle or something that fits
down inside there and air can get out
then it's a heck of a lot easier now the
front manifold like I said not only
serves as a nice aesthetic piece it's
obviously very functional so all the
bits connect to the manifold to the
radiator both tubes to the manifold
block to the manifold GPU to the
manifold the only fans are in this
system though so I'm really kind of
curious as to how well this is going to
perform are the exhaust fans on the top
which are obviously 3ek Vardar RGB fans
so the bottom is filtered it's a
magnetic filter down down here as well
we've kind of sliding it around there is
it there it is so this sits down here
magnetically so you are filtering air
coming in so that's enough talking about
it lets go ahead and fire it up let's
get some benchmarks running to some
temperatures and let's see what it's all
about that's one thing I didn't get to
see in Denver with I built it off it
went and I didn't get to actually play
with it so today we get to do that so
I've had superposition running the 1080p
extreme which case you're wondering is
more stressful than 4k optimized we're
sitting about 48 C right now and it's
been running long enough to saturate the
loop this is exactly I was as it was set
out of the box I haven't touched it in
the overclocks haven't touched any fan
curves and the fan is fairly non
aggressive in terms of the fan curve I
get right next to it you still can't
hear like the noise floor stuff yeah
that's how quiet this is but this would
definitely be one of those situations
where is certainly acoustic optimized
but as you can see still doing a
fantastic job fantastic job with keeping
it nice and cool while being quiet you
can see we just hit 49 but also to the
air conditioner in here turned off so
that's going to go up and down a couple
of degrees based on the ambient
temperature here so if we go ahead and
exit this test we can take a look at our
chart right here 49 is where it sort of
capped out you can see our CPU
temperature obviously was not under any
real load it was in the 40s because this
loop is nice and hot right now what
we're gonna do is we're going to go
ahead and jump immediately into prime95
small so this is not a realistic
situation in terms of how much heat your
computer is gonna be generating but what
will tell us is kind of what the maximum
capacity of this system is going to be
like core temps immediately shot to 81
82 70s 80 70 80 79 the fans have
definitely kicked up vs. before so we're
gonna do right now is we're gonna let
this run for about 10 minutes see where
the temperature sort of equalized and
I think we'll see those temperatures
come down as a whole blah blah blah
well I didn't really change a whole lot
actually the the loop here or the
particular chord I got to 83 came down
and has been bouncing between 80 and 81
now so a couple of degrees we're running
at 4.6 gigahertz which is the you know
all core turbo boost clock for the 9600
or 9700 K so everything's running pretty
good here cores are all under load we
were kind of wondering if maybe one of
these cores my been throttling cuz the
way it every now and then drops down
like you see right there no the other
cores did that so with the TVA max of
105 we are way under that even when
we're doing a very unrealistic test that
would never come anywhere close to what
the actual you know main day-to-day
usage is gonna be like so we run this
one more time now with just blend which
is kind of all of the above which would
be a little bit more realistic tests so
it's sitting in the 50s and 60s which is
much more realistic obviously as you can
see it has no problems whatsoever with
with temperatures as I wouldn't have
expected it to with a 9700 K and a
single GPU with a 360 read I never did a
review of the dynamic zero-one-one from
Lee and Lee obviously the Dare Bauer
edition I think they're all they're
Bauer honest I think yep designed the
case but EK water blocks obviously is
handled all of the cooling for this
chassis and all the assembly and stuff
with their fluid gaming series like I
said there's three models to this the X
601 602 and 603 this is clearly the 603
at the top of the line this is this is
kind of the best we can get right now at
least with the current hardware and the
current year that we're in I kind of
think that the best value though if you
wanna know the truth is gonna be the X
601 because if you take a look at that
the only thing that's different it's the
same storage it's the same amount of RAM
it's the same kind of RAM the g.skill
and all that it has the same 500
gigabyte nvme SSD but you sacrificed the
20 and the 9700 K for 9600 K and you
sacrifice the 28 II which is non TI for
a 1070 TI and the price and I'll put the
links down below for you guys to go and
check out because the prices are always
changing a stuff at least at the time of
making this video if you live near a
Micro Center or you want one shipped to
you or whatever you can get the 601 for
thirteen hundred and ninety nine dollars
and I can tell you right now when I put
all those parts in the cart at Amazon
and Newegg
I couldn't even
match the price of this with an AI oh so
that particular model is extremely a
very good value of very compelling value
so it's definitely worth checking out
but obviously because that's running a
Pascal card at 1070 TI that model will
eventually be changing to what I don't
know so if you can get one and you're
looking for a water-cooled build that
will look exactly like this for thirteen
hundred ninety-nine bucks that's a hell
of a deal
once again a huge thank you to ek for
sending this over and obviously micro
Center as well for helping us and
allowing us to do this review so if you
guys want a system that is worthy of
looking like it belongs in any sort of
PCM our showcase with all the RGB
goodness which of course you can use Ora
to completely change the the scheme if
you want and make it stop being rainbow
puke you can do that and it's gonna look
exactly like this and you can even tell
your friends and your family like I
built this I built this they won't know
any different you said I'd built it who
cares if you built it or not just tell
people you did alright guys once again
links are down below if you guys gonna
learn more about this huge thank you to
ek and micro Center for sponsoring
today's video and as always we will see
you guys in the net
no salty crybabies anti-gravity this one
comes with the tesseract fluid get
triangle when your doctor walks in the
exam room it goes all right let's get
things started a doctor once tell me
relax I want you to cut my finger off
