Southern California and I'm not talking
about the heatwave I'm talking about all
the discussions regarding what's coming
coming out of III whether it be gaming
consoles or of course PC hardware
because AMD has obviously stolen the
show with the amount of news and and
press releases and all that sort of
stuff now yes I'm aware that this is
right on the heels of the last video we
did about Radeon but I think there's a
lot more to talk about we have more
insight we've done more research and we
got to have a finally have a meeting
with AMD engineers and talk to them
specifically about some of our questions
and concerns which I've seen parroted in
the in the comments section of a lot of
the video so we asked him does a lot of
those hard facts the hard facts the hard
questions and we got some information on
and then also kind of a new perspective
of how the sort of look at the 5700 XT
and the 5700 so let's go ahead and talk
about that with their 9 blade designed
the skier on D RGB fans from metallic
gear offer a balance of performance and
aesthetics available in both 120 and 140
millimeter sizes the ski run fans are
sure to fit any size builds hub mounted
LEDs provide a wide spread of lighting
while the daisy chain above wiring
harness and cherry tidy wiring job every
time to learn more about the skier on
RGB and D RGB fans from metallic gear
click the link in the description below
alright so let's rewind to August of
2018
specifically Cologne Germany when
invideo launched their r-tx lineup of
graphics cards and byte lineup I mean
2080 and 20 atti with a 2070 kind of
thrown in the mix there a little bit and
there here was the response and and this
is a totally justified response but this
was the general response from the public
they cost how much you're getting 20 to
30% more performance over pascal 1080 TI
but you're getting it's costing you 40%
more whatever it was 50% more something
crazy like that that the general
consensus was gamers want performance
they want high FPS low latency low
response times you know all that sort of
stuff so turning on a fidelity feature
like rate racing
at the cost of 50% or more FPS at the
time anyway there's been some
optimizations but still it's it's a
performance tax no matter what the
audience said we don't care about DX r
we care about performance
well let's fast forward nine months
later now to June of 2019 at e3 ande
launches its new high-end gaming cards
not to be confused with the enthusiast
level which is where the Vegas stuff and
like RT X kind of resides but a high-end
5700 XT in a slightly lesser high in
5700 featuring seven nanometer Navi
technology on the new rDNA architecture
completely different from GC n which
stands for graphics core next if you
didn't know the most common thing we saw
even though it was on average a hundred
dollars less than its direct competitor
from Nvidia and giving you anywhere from
2 to 21% more performance in gaming was
where's the RT X or where's the DX r
where's the ray tracing Navi was our
Savior why don't we have ray tracing
Navi you were supposed to save us
so I find it kind of interesting that
the audience back not even a year ago
was and even just last week when we do
our video about the quake 2 RT X update
was no-one cares about this crap but
then there's so many people out there
that are like what the hell why doesn't
have DX are so we're in this weird kind
of a limbo space where you have to make
this decision do you want max
performance or do you want max fidelity
and by fidelity I mean all the eye candy
right the global illumination soft
shadows the obviously DXR ray tracing
for light paths all that sort of stuff
you have to kind of take your pick
because right now we are on the cusp of
the next gaming revolution just like we
were nearly 20 years ago when
rasterization came out we're we were on
the next generation of the wait games
are going to be performed so I asked
this question specifically when we had
our meeting today with AMD I said
can you speak to why dxr is not
something that was mentioned outside of
the console space because that's the
other thing that confused a lot of
people was like well wait a minute if
project of whatever it's called for the
new Xbox Scarlet if it's going to have
8k capable gaming and it's gonna have
ray tracing and it's an AMD GPU or APU
technically why the heck is the PC space
not even mentioning it or talking about
it when that's Amy's bread-and-butter so
I asked him that very same question and
the general consensus here and of course
this was a lot of like not off the
record but this is off the slides at
this point because there was this was
not a specific forethought conversation
that was supposed to be had was that ray
tracing does indeed need some maturity
and not with the architecture which
obviously needs to happen I mean NVIDIA
is doing it through tensor cores for DL
SS and that's a super sampling right
deep learning super sampling and then it
needs to be also optimized in the arc RT
core space which is what's happening
with all the ray tracing calculations
all that math is being performed on the
RT cores and then the cuda cores and a
lot of the other push processing and you
know that sort of stuff so we've seen a
good first gen implementation of it in
terms of the fact that you can even do
it in real time was already kind of the
the wow factor and then doing it at
60fps is already great obviously had a
huge cost of $1,200 so $1,200 for 60fps
regardless of how good the scene looks
seemed like a huge step backwards to
gamers and then the outcry was obvious
so AMD made the conscious choice of
targeting where most gamers reside and
that is going to be in the well the 5700
XT and 5700 are indeed high-end cards
but it's going to be in that range and
down to be fair I think most gamers are
shopping around two hundred and fifty
dollars and if you want to spend that
kind of money on a graphics card you're
still going to be stuck with like the
art rx 580 our X 480 or will know that
the 48 585 70 or even a 590 but you're
not going to obviously be getting any of
the new RTR
our DNA tech architecture the best way
to kind of look at this is the way risin
first-gen like the 1000 series wasn't so
much a game-changer as much as it was a
disrupter it's referred to as a
disrupter because it was designed to
just kind of make people kind of go whoa
wait a minute what just happened
okay I'm not sure about this something
happened I want to see how this plays
out and then 2000 series rise in which
is still first gen rise in came out and
the market share started to shift
Intel's
market share gains stalled and then AMD
gain back cpu market share although
Intel was still the dominant player aim
to gain back market share and then Xen
to now giving us the amount of increase
we saw an IPC and now beating apparently
core four core Intel CPUs at a much
lesser price has changed the CPU
industry this is what AMD is banking on
our DNA being for graphics this is first
gen rising for graphics cards you're not
gonna see the disruption necessarily
happening right now but what you're
gonna probably see is a lot of people
adopt that whole wait-and-see attitude
and as long as AMD can live up to the
promises of we are going to be making
this as good as possible over the next
several generations and by generations I
don't mean we're talking five-year plan
I mean we're talking three-year plan
probably at this point then what you'll
start to see is a much broader spectrum
of competition taking place across the
board but like anything else you can't
get there without launching the initial
disrupter in the first place
the other thing that they reason why
they didn't launch this high-end God's
saving Saito saved the gamers Navi
architecture which everyone thought was
gonna be coming out because we don't
remember a year ago we heard that
there's gonna be a r-tx killing card for
250 dollars from AMD and that's called
na'vi well the internet sort of made
that up on their own AMD you cannot find
a single piece of information where AMD
even speculated or hinted at any sort of
performance for that before that dollar
range whatsoever but what AMD has
decided is that the raw performance is
more important than the eye candy but at
the same time what they
was more important was that you have
backwards-compatibility in terms of the
toolkits and because GCN is so matured
in terms of being in the console space
in the PC space in the cloud space as
well as mobile it was it's easier to
implement and get the technology out
into the wild by making sure that it's
backwards compatible with all of that
while featuring forward compatible
technologies as developers come online
for it so they adopted what a lot of
people said Nvidia should have done
which is the adopt now and then we
promise in six months to a year these
features will become available because
of the fact that you know it's gonna
take time for RT X and DX are to be
implemented by the developers they
decided to build a graphics card on a
new architecture because as much as
people want to say our DNA is just a
rebranded GCN it's not it is ground-up
different the difference is that it's
ground-up different with a hundred
percent backwards support our backwards
compatibility support so that allows you
to have a much broader spectrum of
adoption of this particular card in
terms of games being designed for it
while also utilizing forward-facing
technologies that are only going to be
available on the Navi based architecture
that once the adoption rate improves and
more Navi cards are out in the wild
then you're gonna see features come
online later on in games whether they're
new games or updates to existing games
that means your graphics card that you
buy today will get even more value in
the future features that people care
about like Radeon a min sharpening which
is gonna be sort of like a DL SS but
it's open source and anyone can use it
including Nvidia if they want to it's
kind of like the opposite of how hair
works and and the Nvidia game works was
back in the past although that was a
very close source and developers had to
either buy packages or buy particular
SDKs and stuff to use those features is
a hundred percent open you're also gonna
have the fidelity FX which is going to
be different features that people can
developers can put into their games that
are going to be optimized on obviously
now the architecture so forward
compatible stuff or forward technically
future proofing that as those features
come online the architecture that
was designed with those features in mind
are gonna be remained much more relevant
into the future rather than suddenly
going well I've gotta buy a new graphics
card now to use all these features you
buy a new graphics card now that gets
you an immediate performance bump and
the way games would played today on the
AP is and the SDKs that are available
today specifically being you know
obviously DirectX and vulcan and then
we're gonna see an improvement in the
future so that is sort of the strategy
behind why AMD launched at the 5700 XT
and 5700 now we tried really hard trust
me we tried to find out if there's gonna
be an rx 5800 XT or a 5600 because I
feel like - scuse on the rDNA family
that's a good place to start
I'd be shocked if we didn't see the
stack sort of trickled down a little bit
but I don't think you got if you guys
are waiting for a twenty atti competitor
from Navi I don't think you're gonna see
it in this family I would love trust me
to see a twenty atti rival right now
from AMD but it's clear that the Radeon
7 is the enthusiast card that you get
from AMD right now for more entry-level
stuff I almost feel like we're probably
not gonna see anything until a little
bit later on maybe when the new um the
updated Xen apos come out featuring Navi
I also asked that question I'm like can
we we see the 3200 and 3400 G featuring
ray Vega 8 will we potentially see those
utilising the Navi in the future and of
course it was will we're talking about
this today we can't talk about anything
in the future and of course I knew that
was gonna be the answer but I've got a
Trier I've got to ask the questions that
you guys were all wondering the whole
point of this video in fact if anyone
even said just skip this video and go to
this time point stamp this one if you
are waiting for an Nvidia killing AMD
rate racing card this is not it it's not
coming and you should probably just go
ahead and determine which purchase makes
sense for you right now whether you want
$100 more expensive in video card that
can do rate racing or $100 lesser
expensive graphics card from AMD that
gives you more raw performance than $100
cart a card that cost more
or you get your DXR and then the frame
rates kind of do that because you know
the XR is a huge impact of performance
but you have that choice and the choice
is yours in this consumer that's where
you vote not the comments section not
the like dislike ratio you spend your
money on what you believe in that's how
you vote all right guys thanks for
watching I just wanted to sort of add to
our last video because now that we've
got a little bit more insight and got to
get face-to-face and asked questions
that were way off the slide
I felt like an extension to our previous
video was necessary all right guys
thanks for watching and as always we'll
see you in the next one and the next
one's gonna include some hands-on stuff
with Rison which I cannot wait for
because teaser we might be going back to
Rison for long-term testing with our
editing rigs because of new graphics APR
graphics SDKs that are integrate they're
gonna integrate with Adobe and stuff if
and when Adobe ever gets off their ass
to implement alright guys it's an
exciting time to be a PC gamer as always
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
