delivery rgba CX 3.0 cooler and factory
overclock the EVGA gtx 1070 and 1080 for
the win are excellent choices for gamers
who demand the best learn more by
following the link down below
so last month I built a gaming PC for
under $400 including tax while though it
was with micro center parts it was still
my money and we did it for under 400
bucks problem is a lot of you guys were
really mad about the processor that I
chose the Athlon 5350 because admittedly
it is extremely underpowered but it got
us by and was able to play games like
doom no problem
what happens if you set aside about an
extra 200 bucks well you pick yourself
up in a md-83 20 e at4 cooler from
Coolermaster and a gigabyte ud3
motherboard 990 FX a allowing for a
little bit of overclocking the best part
is you could probably find someone that
wants to buy this CPU motherboard combo
for 30 40 bucks building some sort of a
internet browsing machine or word
processing machine of some sort and you
can do this whole upgrade for less than
150 dollars you can get some cash back
from that so let's go ahead and in let's
see how well it performs and let's see
just what you get for about a five
hundred and fifty dollar gaming pieces
well isn't so hard you know the crappy
part though about working in lower end
hardware is you cut the shit out of
yourself because they don't have refined
edges and stuff they're sharp my god I
have made plenty of sacrifices to the PC
gods today blood sacrifices had been
made a couple things you might have
noticed though is I had moved the rear
exhaust fan to the top of the case and
then I have the cooler pulling air
through and out the top of the case I'm
trying to promote a directional airflow
when we go in the front of the case
through the cooler and out the top since
I didn't add any more case fans because
we are going to be dealing with a bit
more heat than we were with the Athlon
system I want to make sure that without
adding more money to the system and
adding more fans that we were able to at
least have adequate directional airflow
if this was pushing air up to top and I
had the exhaust fan in the rear turning
pull air out that would be a split of
air and we don't want that another thing
too is I have not done a test boot on
this yet I wanted to do this test boot
on camera and other thing I'm hoping
here is that windows is going to detect
all the new hardware set itself up and
then we won't have to reinstall windows
in all of that crap so anyway let's go
ahead and uh okay Todd you beeped what
what because the hard drive started hope
we get a get a post here probably up if
I showed you guys the monitor oh do
light come on yay I actually shouldn't
be saying yeah yet until Windows is
actually doing its thing huh you guys
ask me all the time if it's possible to
change out motherboards CPUs and stuff
without having to reinstall windows most
of the time the answered yes sometimes
windows is just a punk and doesn't want
to detect the new hardware and reset up
its registry and whatnot this one looks
like it's gonna cooperate I think let's
see it's thinking you can see right
there it's thinking doing something up
getting devices ready yeah all right
we'll come back when this is ready to
test a few moments late ale of course
the very first game we're gonna play
here is Counter Strike global Offensive
reason why is in the last video we were
able to get like 60 FPS on average and a
lot of
of counter-strike go players apparently
watch this channel because many of them
China was like if you're not getting at
least 150 FPS it is completely
unplayable I still completely disagree
with you but that's besides the point
because remember we are in the
perspective here of this being a
newcomer to gaming PCs and they're not
going to be achieving or even aspiring
to get 150 fps they just want to play
the damn game guys so put the elitism
aside for a little bit here and let's
look at what the objective is so anyway
here are the settings here we have a
colormode computer monitor that's that's
always good we got monitors it auto -
everything - hi mixture of very high MSA
is at 2x motion blur is disabled so I
think we've got some pretty good
settings here so as you can see we are
getting quite a bit of FPS here in csgo
it doesn't take a lot of horsepower to
run this game which is why even the
Athlon was able to achieve it at a you
know anywhere between 50 and 60 fps
remember that was a $40 CPU motherboard
combo now that we are actually on wow I
came to jump up this thing now that we
are actually on a decent CPU I say
decent because you know is you can see
here that we are actually able to
achieve some pretty damn good frame
rates and I am so bad at this game you
really shouldn't be judging me yeah I
see this is being pretty damn playable
about to get my ass kicked I'm sure
ha thought you were gonna knife me
didn't you yes you did you thought you
were gonna knife me I'll think so
bitch
ah I was expecting that alright so next
up we're gonna play some doom here you
can see the FPS up here in the corner
and we go to settings that see what our
settings are here so we've default what
is 1400 by 1050 it's a weird resolution
gosh is weird because I went four by
three
holy hell why did I do that yeah I can't
click on things I suck
alright we don't want 4k although I bet
you could actually play 4k oh it means a
prize vertical sink is off anti-aliasing
is on SMA we'll leave it there and
advanced settings here it's going get
the guy to reload alright advanced
settings here wow it even went to
nightmare on shadow quality you've got
to be kidding me
no we are not going to try nightmare I
don't think it's possible there jeez I
think this thing is being a little bit
ambitious one thing we do a quick don't
put motion blur too low I don't like
that motion blur shit I do but I don't
if that makes sense
alright so pretty much all right let's
do it ultra which is the ultra preset
that way you guys can follow along at
home and here's what we got so you can
see so far FPS up in the corner there we
are achieving greater than 60 FPS with
ultra settings on Vulcan you can see the
explosions aren't really hurting
anything here Wow the explosions are
heard nothing here yet
take I take that Logan does amazing
things for games and telling you hi
there
you got killed with a plasma pistol
thingy well I got no complaints about
this fps here look look at all this
lighting this geometric lighting and
stuff happening here
and yet the FPS are amazing
well the menu is any indication we might
see a decent improvement that'd be cool
huh all right so what are the settings
last time we dropped these settings all
around to try and figure out why we were
getting terrible FPS but it's just for
whatever reason I think it was just CPU
bottlenecked big time so let's go our
video settings here oh wow that it gets
all confused I swear full screens on
multi samplings on refresh rate 59 vsync
off there we go
preset we're going to go here to ultra
let's just run the benchmark test and
see what it says so that has definitely
come a long way from the 20 of the 30fps
it was getting in low settings right now
and altro you can see we're getting
about hmm almost 60 fps and in some
parts you can see here we go over 60 fps
and others you can see we go down to the
high 40s which is still not great
remember we are on ultra on a 380 X in
dirt rally it's considered to be kind of
demanding when you have the tree density
turned up which we do right now
especially with it being on ultra okay
so I've dropped the preset too high and
it's going to go into benchmark mode
let's see if we get any immediate
improvements not a whole lot of change
honestly I mean we're going up into the
70s here a little bit but it started off
in the 50s see what goes all the down to
the 40s right there now this is a
benchmark test it is kind of considered
demanding I guess I know it uses a game
engine so that's why I'm okay using the
benchmark on this but we are getting you
know a 6 C ish fps a little bit higher
than that a little bit lower than at
some point but we've come up quite a
ways if you
the fact that we were in the 20s and 30s
on the Athlon cpu so this is definitely
money well spent in this upgrade right
here well there you have it dumping
about another hundred and fifty ish
dollars back into the system I say 150
cuz like I said you can get some money
back for the other CPU and motherboard
someone out there would spend 40 bucks
on that I did heck but anyway you can
see it brought our gaming experience up
quite a bit and we still have not broken
the bank considering the overall price
on this PC is right around five hundred
and fifty dollars including tax that is
not bad whatsoever now let's talk about
something real quick because I know
folks are going to be out there saying
why'd you go with an and three plus
motherboard or why'd you go with an 3
plus socket because there's no upgrade
path you're right right now with the
exception of maybe FM 2 plus on a and B
none of the enthusiasts grade or gaming
grade stuff like am3+ has any sort of
upgrade future whatsoever but you can
see we still got a huge improvement in
performance now this might all come in a
really weird time considering we are
right on the cusp of Zen finally
launching with AMD but just because then
is launching doesn't mean people are
necessarily going to be able to afford
it who knows what the price point is
going to be so the timing of all this
build might seem really strange but I
think a lot of people are not able to
shop in the latest and greatest when it
comes to their price point so that still
makes a build like this completely
relevant and again I'm going to say it
again for 550 bucks an amazing gaming
experience and because of the way we did
it the first time around we didn't have
to upgrade the power supply or the
graphics card for the memory or the case
or the hard drive now obviously the next
step from here I think would be putting
in an SSD because load times are a
little bit painful when you're loading
on a hard drive even though it is a 7200
rpm 64 megabyte cache it is still a hard
drive anyway guys thanks for watching as
always I hope this videos helped you and
I hope it makes you want to go out there
and do some gaming and realize you don't
have to spend a lot of money that's the
point you don't need to spend thousands
of dollars on a gaming PC
it's button it's definitely fun there's
no doubt about that but it's not
necessary
share this video with someone you think
it'll help and as always guys thanks for
watching oh and if you do want to win a
GTX 1080 I'm doing a giveaway right now
you guys will definitely want to go and
check out my channel if you're new
around here I'm giving away a GTX 1080
is right here yeah so this graphics card
cost more than this whole system you
know you want it I'm over here telling
you you don't have to spend a lot of
money and now I'm like I'm a give away
graphics card that cost more than this
whole computer Jay's a hypocrite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
