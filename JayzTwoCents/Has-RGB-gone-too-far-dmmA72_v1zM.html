are guaranteed to trigger all of you
well most of you and that is our so this
is a pretty typical RGB strip you've got
a teeny tiny little diode LED sensor
light emitting diode an RGB stands for
red green blue and you've got those
three colors you can pretty much make
any 18 bla bla bla million colors
because you know color palette and I
learned that in kindergarten art class
you take the tiny little RGB LED and you
put it on this SMD which is mounted to
this strip and this is what you get a
very widely spaced very I don't know I
guess monocoque archaic but this way
they've been doing LEDs for a long time
well fast forward years and you get
what's steel the LED backlit TV which is
a lot of very very tiny closely mounted
LEDs weird obviously on time at the foil
edgelet we're talking the actual full
backlit LED panels and they just
certainly determine hey this is a very
elbows I feel efficient in a way yes
this is a very energy efficient way of
lighting the back of the screen and so
that is kind of what as sort of inspired
Corsair to take something like RGB or
any LED to be to be honest and advance
it how do you advance this which is the
way it's been done forever well they're
introducing compell it's and this is
their actual surface mounted LED that
doesn't require an SMD to run allowing
them to really really create a dense
just clustered leds that you can do a
lot with so this right here is a 100
compell X LEDs in the same space that
you would basically fit four of the
standard SMD based LEDs so what can you
do with that well you can put it in more
places so they're starting with the
Dominator platinum memory right here the
corsair dominator which is right here
this came out back in 2014 and the
design really has remained unchanged
with the exception of a few special
editions which we've used and our build
and it's one of those things where a lot
of people went this is a high-end
product and paying a lot why doesn't it
have RGB the two common complaints we
hear with RGB is so
RGBA why does it have RGB and then they
go if I won't put RGB on it and it's
like why does it just have RGB it should
have RGB like those are the two
arguments and so whatever side of the
fence you're on everything's gonna have
RGB in the future just deal with it the
nice thing is at least you have color
options you can turn it to anything you
want like Phil turnaround right here you
got this white bill this isn't
compelling LED but it's all white and
uniform because the case has its own
lighting and then you've got the RGB
dims and it all matches it looks great
make it what you want but when you take
compel --ax it turns into something else
so what you see right here are 12 of the
compelling LEDs not 12 arrays 12 of the
tiny little guys that's how bright they
are and because they're not running an
SMD they're extremely energy efficient
so you can get extreme brightness
without having to have a big density of
them this is 132 capella LEDs they're
hooked up to a controller that you can
make a very like a dot matrix type
screen that you can control so it's very
similar to like an early model OLED but
think about the way you could do this
develop an SDK you can control the
screen you can start having things on
your system animate and do things so
it's not just about lighting at that
point it's about true customization of
your system and that's where Corsair is
really looking at doing with Capelli's I
don't know exactly when it's gonna be
available to like all of their products
but it is coming and it's not gonna be
on all of their products they're still
gonna keep this type of array on the
stuff to keep it more entry level more
affordable and I don't know what the
cost is on compelling in terms of like
implementing this but this is the future
because look it's flexible it's kind of
like those flexible screens that you saw
from LG back in the day so you have a
lot of endless options that you can do
with this if you get creative but the
dominator Platinum RGB is what their day
to day viewing it on first you can see
right here how bright it is it's only
using sixty nine milli amps or 130
milliwatts so it's not using that much
power because the other problem with lit
Ram
the problem with lit RAM at least that
we learned through our overclocking
competition is that any amount of power
that doesn't make it to the actual
module reduces your amount of
overclocking Headroom even milliamps
milliwatts like this that low of a
figure can actually determine how high
your overclocking is you go which is why
all the world world records and stuff
have been achieved with non lit memory
so they're hoping that this can also
alleviate some of that so not only can
you break records you can look good
while doing it too so I just felt like
this was worth talking about because
whether or not you hate RGB or you're a
tech nerd like us if you get excited
about things that change and evolve this
is this is probably gonna be the future
and that one's now on the floor cause I
dropped it so compelling this is coming
take a look at that in 2019 obviously
starting with the Dominator platinum but
we're gonna see it on more things we've
seen on cases fans coolers you name it
and of course it doesn't require any
introduction but it does of course tie
into iqcp patrol it individually it's
pretty obvious that is digitally
addressable alright guys thanks for
watching this video here about sports
are compelling of course are sponsored
our trip here to CES 2019 and of course
brought to you by the Corsair One and
Corsair one Pro check it out
