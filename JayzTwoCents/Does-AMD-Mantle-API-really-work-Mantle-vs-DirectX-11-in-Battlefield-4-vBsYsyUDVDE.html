you're watching Jays two cents some
people call me Jay and some people call
me well we won't get into what some
people call me but today we're going to
talk about mantle that is that new API
that everyone's talking about that came
out for battlefield 4 and AMD cards and
all that sort of junk and I went ahead
and tested a couple of different cards
and we're going to see if mantle really
lives up to all the hype that everyone
keeps talking about let's go ahead and
talk about what mantle is mantle is an
API that was developed on the AMD
platform specifically for GCN
architecture cards but not all GCN
architecture cards see it debuted just
recently and it's being used on the r9
series on AMD now that's the 290x the
290 the 280x the 280 the 270x the ii
said it you kind of see where we're
going with this but it is going to be
available on many 7000 series cards in
fact from what I understand it's already
usable on the 7000 series now when it
comes to mantle is strictly an AMD API
or can anybody use it well it is open
source but it's going to be up to the
developers of both games and the card
manufacturers aka a and B and NVIDIA to
actually make use of this new API but
more importantly how is mental interface
with the graphics card well as you guys
know or may not know when games are
developed they have to use some sort of
architecture for the engine on the game
to operate well here we are today at
eleven point two DirectX 11 point two
and we've been using DirectX for many
many years so a new API was developed
and that is mantle but instead of being
developed by a third party like it was
with Microsoft
it was developed directly by one of the
card manufacturers AMD or ATI which is a
subsidiary of AMD AMD body ATI in their
technologies now why should you even
care about mantle especially if you have
an AMD card today because as of the time
of making this video mantle is not
available on anything other than GCN
architecture AMD cards well you should
care because quite honestly it has
everything to do with how your CPU and
your GPU interact with each other you've
always heard of the term bottleneck and
bottlenecking is one of those things
that has scared a lot of first time and
even second third or even some novice
builders who are concerned about trying
to eliminate that bottleneck in their
system typically the bottleneck happens
to be the CPU because it can't handle
all of the processes being sent to it by
the graphics processing unit the GPU aka
the video card
well basically mantle alleviates a lot
of that load which means lower end CPU
based gaming rigs saw an immediate boost
in performance now the same goes for
lower end graphics card that may have
been paired with a lower end processor
now let's go ahead and talk about the
test bench behind me because this is
what we used I'm using an Intel i5 46 70
K at stock clocks now if we were to
overclock the CPU we kind of alleviate
some of that bottleneck which means that
the differences in mantle would be a lot
less apparent now to make sure that we
can further create a bottleneck both of
the graphics cards that I tested here
were overclocked to their max so for
clarification stock speed I 546 70 K and
an overclocked GTX I thought we were
talking about mantle here J there's no
GTX in mantle the r9 270 from MSI and
the r9 290 both from MSI they are the
boxes as you can see both are the gaming
Edition cards with their aftermarket
coolers so that meant that we could bump
up the overclock even farther than if
they had been referenced models further
creating a bottleneck or that's kind of
what we're going for or we're looking to
see if maybe there is no bottleneck hmm
now let's go ahead and talk about my
results and how I came to those results
the results of that is how I came to the
results this is a very clean show we're
going to keep it that way
I use the fraps frames per second
benchmark utility which will record the
frames per second over a 60 second
duration giving me a minimum and maximum
and an average frames per second I then
did that test five times during the
parcel storm map 64-player ultimate
preset then took the average of the five
averages so that's how I came up to
these results now first up we have the
r9 270 from MSI that is the overclocked
version that I overclocked even farther
to eleven hundred and fifty megahertz
it's a pretty good overclocking card and
with the thirteen point one two drivers
which is not mantle I got fifty four
point three nine frames per second
average at 1080p now by doing nothing
more changing no settings the same map
in fact the exact same server I loaded
up the beta fourteen point one mantle
drivers and I got an average of using
the same methodology I just described
are you ready for this sixty two point
five three average frames per second for
a 15 percent frames per second increase
on the r9 270 that is pretty amazing
considering that was fifteen percent
extra performance by doing nothing but
installing a free driver now how did it
do on the r9 290 well if you guys follow
on Twitter you know I was having a hell
of a time getting the driver to work
right behind Lee got catalyst to
cooperate and stop trying to run
catalyst with thirteen point one two and
fourteen point one on top of it it was
just being really weird with the r7 it
was perfect but the r9 it wanted me to
completely uninstall catalyst completely
wipe the driver about three times bring
up the basic VGA driver install the
catalyst fourteen point one four which
then was showing up as thirteen point
one two having me go into the device
manager delete the driver again
reinstall catalyst fourteen point one
two more times and it finally then
showed up as fourteen point one I have
no idea why the 290 required me to go
through all that but it did I figured it
out and we were able to get our results
so for the r9 290 gaming overclocked
edition overclocked to one thousand
85 megahertz we got ourselves a 13.1 -
which is a mantle or non mantle driver
an average of 94 frames per second which
is great that is absolutely great so how
did it do with the mantle drivers we got
ninety five point five that is one and a
half frames per second more with mantle
or a little bit over one and a half
percent
well guys remember if you look at mantle
and what it's intended to do it is
intended to remove some of the load off
of your CPU allowing your GPU to perform
to its full potential through better
efficiency of the API which is what
mantle is doing it allows your GPU to do
what it's meant to do and allows your
CPU to do what it's meant to do and it
further widens basically the virtual
bandwidth between the two and it all has
to do with virtual optimization of that
API now we can hope that maybe we'll see
with refined drivers better improvement
on the r9 290 now I know you guys are
saying what about the 280 guys I don't
have a 280 to test but I can tell you
this if you are looking at buying a
high-end r9 graphics card at 280 X 2 980
a 290x do not expect mantle to be giving
you any sort of an amazing increase now
I know there's other benchmarks out
there that have shown as high as 10%
improvement on the 290 for me that was
absolutely not the case
now that might be the case if I ran
higher resolution this actually is a
1200 P monitor behind me but I didn't
think that that would be fair to the 270
since the 270 is a 1080p graphics card
so it may be a little bit better for the
r9 running mantle at higher resolutions
maybe we'll test that in the future but
these are my results and take this as
this is what GA experienced with mantle
this is not the one benchmark and on the
planet telling you all there is to do
with mandala just shows you what my
experience was with it now if you're on
a budget this means that you can really
expect to get better performance out of
your graphics cards or your lower end
AMD cards that you may have already
purchased without worrying about busting
the budget and still getting more
performance to get 15% improvement in
fps by buying new hardware could be a
very
costly move however the new mantel API
allowed that to happen for absolutely no
cost whatsoever so tell me what you guys
think are you using mantle what card are
you using with sound off down in the
comments and let everyone who may be
searching for mantle and mantle capable
cards and help them decide what they
should buy let me know about your
experiences with mantle and whether it
did or did not increase your performance
in battlefield 4 as always guys I
appreciate you watching this video I
hope it's opened up your eyes for what
mantle really is and what you can expect
from it if you want to see more videos

mash that subscribe button if you're not
already a subscriber and if you are
you're awesome and you know it let me
get on out of here guys and as always I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
