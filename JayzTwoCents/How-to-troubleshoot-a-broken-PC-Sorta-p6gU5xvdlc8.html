be so raw it's going to be totally like
famous porn star name here what's up
guys Jays two cents here we're going to
do a video that I think that is going to
be write up a lot of people's wheelhouse
and that is how to troubleshoot a
computer that is just being a complete
koel mullick max to 120 and 240 from
enter max is another awesome choice of a

enthusiasts without breaking the bank
patented shunt channel technology

capability click the link below to find
out more so there's nothing more
frustrating than especially for a new
builder if you don't know what to
troubleshoot you go to turn on your
computer when you have power to it of
course you go to turn on your computer
and pretty much nothing is going to
happen where you think it's booting and
everything's good and then it will just
shut off and then will turn back on and
shut off and turn it and it needs like
you're like what the hell do I do so
we're going to kind of talk today about
what my first steps would be on this I
don't even have the DisplayPort plugged
in because we know that we have C just
shut off right there now if you watch
it's going to turn back on and I just do
that over and over and over again now
the first thing I would do honestly is a
most commonly when you get these types
of boot loops that something isn't
seated properly it could be the RAM it's
very unlikely that it's the CPU
considering it really only fits in there
one way and this CPU has been seated
ever since it was first built no problem
and the graphics card now he did tell me
that he transported this PC in the back
of his car so it made me wonder maybe
something with jostled loose so the very
first thing I'm gonna do here anyway
scoop my chair up I'm just gonna pop out
the memory both sticks and I'm going to
make sure that these are you know that
everything looks good with the pins no
issues there and I'm just going to
reseed it you want to make sure you get
clicks on both sides if you have a
motherboard where it only has one tab
put it on the side without the tab first
put it in straight and make sure that
the tab
top clicks some of the newer
motherboards only have a tab on the top
going to do the same thing here with the
mug the graphics card take off the cable
take out the retention screw unplug it
from the PCIe make sure it clicks in all
the way make sure the retention tab is
clicked and then tighten this back down
turn the power supply back on if it has
a toggle switch some don't if they don't
unplug the power from the back power it
on and let's see if we get anywhere all
right well it just turned off on us so
unfortunately that wasn't our problem
now the CPU fan is turning so you would
want to make sure that it's not turning
off because of the fan not running or
something like that but if that's not
the case then go ahead and once again
unplug your PC from power and now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to unplug
anything plugged into the motherboard
with the exception of the front panel
connectors and the RAM and graphics card
so I'm not going to have any Sada's
plugged in I'm not going to have any HD
audio no USB plugs USB three is
unplugged leave the fans plugged in and
now we're going to try it again we're
going to see if maybe we have some sort
of a conflict with the peripheral device
and if once again it's very repetitious
here you kind of want to do a form of
elimination here and see if anything
gives you any sort of different result
all right so once again it just power
cycled on us with none of the
peripherals plugged in so now what I'm
going to do is I am going to go ahead
and once again turn off power and I'm
going to unplug one stick of RAM now you
also need to consult to your manual on
which channels need to be used for only
one stick but it could be a bad stick of
RAM it could be a bad memory slot so in
this case here I'm just going to start
with one channel and see if that gives
us any different results
yeah that that's farthest we've gotten
yet alright so as you can see right
there
and what's funny about this is we've
actually spent I know what an hour of
troubleshooting this before even
starting the video yeah this is the
farthest we've gotten here where we
actually got into BIOS and we did that
by simply taking out one stick of RAM
and what you know what's what's kind of
disconcerting about this though it's the
fact that we did this already and this
didn't work but for the sake of the
video we were going back through the
steps so that's started sort of the
frustrating part about troubleshooting
pcs here oh look at that alright so
let's go ahead and get into our BIOS
this is a good sign what I want to do
now that I that I got into BIOS is I
want to load optimise defaults so in
your BIOS settings you you're going to
start your menus polygonal look all
different but typically in a menu that
says save and exit or something like
that you can find this load optimized
defaults a lot of motherboards f5 will
also in this case it's low previous
values let's try f8 nope
try f7 there so f7 on this one is load
optimized defaults so let's go ahead and
do that
f10 saved config and exit yes and let's
see if it actually reboots and if this
works I'm actually going to be shocked
because we already did this and it
didn't work that's normal for it to want
to turn off after you do a load
optimized default so it's possible I'm
not even a hundred percent certain that
it's bad Ram because we tried different
Ram already in this interesting so let's
see what happens here I know it's not
looking too good see and now we're boot
looping again so we've got a very
intermittent problem here now we've
already tried a clear CMOS that's
another thing that you could always try
when you do this yeah I'm I'm in one of
these situations here where the problem
here is so intermittent sporadic it
really doesn't make any sense
this one is messing with me quite
literally this computer with me and I
mean that because mids shooting this
video we started over it decided to work
we were like oh
okay cool so it's working now nope it
just decided to do it again so here we
are that time it turned off faster okay
so here are the symptoms we've got a
computer here that was working fine the
owner took it to work use it there no
problems sat there for a while
brought it look it just booted it's just
so it's been sitting here boot looping
and then suddenly decided to work the
main BIOS is corrupted the system will
be recovered from the backup BIOS please
do not turn off power or reset the
system this may take a few minutes oh
this reboots right now you're alright
come back to me so I was just saying
that this thing is fun with me because
we've been sitting here for a while now
just boot looping at trying different
things getting ready to do this video
and in the middle of me kind of
preparing for the next shot it just
randomly booted up so anyway it said the
main BIOS is corrupted system will
recover from the backup BIOS this is a
dual BIOS motherboard so that's a good
thing but this is an old b75 LS a old
piece of advice really not that old so
2013 2012 2013 ish era but it does have
a dual BIOS so gigabyte is auto backing
up this might end up being the problem
the question is why did it corrupt it to
begin with I don't know sirs we're going
to do we're just gonna let this go then
we're gonna see what happens next
I'm not gonna bother moving forward with
this video because this computer is just
gonna troll the out of me anyway
I'm gonna keep making this video because
I'm not gonna let this computer win
alright so where do I even start so I
started by making a video and show you
guys how to troubleshoot your computer
when you start getting weird wonky
things happening and I thought oh this
would be fun let's go ahead and do this
we can teach somebody something so while
preparing for this this I didn't plug in
the mouse while preparing for this video
um Captain Awesome is that really you
named your computer captain awesome
alright anyway this is getting better
and better he called me last night and
he said his computer would turn on and
turn off like you guys saw so he brings
it over this morning because I said hey
bring it over maybe we'll make a video
about this he brings it over I plug it
in it boot loops like crazy right about
every 10 seconds it would shut off and
reboot
I try I swapped out the memory I swapped
out the graphics card we unplugged all
the peripherals from it making sure that
there was no no conflicts in there all
the hard drives were onions or were
unplugged the USB devices were unplugged
same thing unplugged the graphics card
and the computer would boot well when I
say boot it would power on and not power
off so I said okay well let's see if
maybe we're getting an image out of the
IGP you plug that into the motherboard
no image we the monitors light would
turn blue like it thought it was going
to get an image but we just got a black
screen so I thought okay we're gonna
make a video about this because we're
going to we're going to troubleshoot
this and it's going to help people so we
start making the video in the middle of
the video the thing just goes into into
BIOS recovery and I don't mean the the
BIOS recovery you saw where it was
backing up but it went into a load
optimized default option screen so I
click load optimized default it reboots
and starts boot looping again so I was
like okay something is clearly not right
with this computer let's go ahead and
continue with the video so then we start
making the video again like you guys
just saw start to make where it just
suddenly goes Oh BIOS has crept it lets
back up and it recovered on its own it
only took about a hundred boot loops for
it to decide it should maybe do that so
here's what we're going to do because I
refuse to let this computer win we're
going to talk about what I would have
done based on the situation so let's say
hypothetically you're still boot looping
the first thing I would have done is
well let me shut this down let me see if
I can force it to do it again I don't
know I think I think it was a BIOS
corrupted BIOS and it just reflashed
itself so that's a good thing ok so
anyway I shut down the computer and I'm
curious now as if to whether or not it's
going to boot or troll so let's find out
together here all right all the fans are
ramping doing their thing USB came on
you I was kind of hoping
that it would have not actually booted
so I could continue this legitimately
all right so if you were getting boot
loops the first thing that I would
actually do is I would turn off the
computer
I would unplug the power cord or flip
the switch if you have one of those
toggle switch but for the sake of
simplicity just unplug the power cord
push the power button to drain all of
the energy out of the system and then I
would unclip the RAM
and reseed it and the same dude with the
graphics card I would take the graphics
card out of the PCI Express slot and
plug it back in if the issue continue
then the next thing I would do is unplug
anything on the motherboard that isn't
needed I would unplug all the USB s from
the back of the motherboard I would
unplug not the front side connectors if
your motherboard doesn't have you know
built-in power buttons on the
motherboard but leave the front side
panels connected I would unplug SATA
unplug USB 2.0 unplug USB 3.0 and
anything else that might be plugged in
with the exception of power and the fans
then I would try and boot and see if
anything improved if some if nothing
improved then I would take the graphics
card out of the equation unplug that and
if you have an Intel CPU then you do
have an IG P or a built-in HD Intel HD
graphics on the CPU you can always tell
because on the back of the motherboard
there'll be usually an HDMI or DVI port
plug the monitor into that with no
graphics card and see if it boots if it
doesn't boot then your issues more than
likely not your graphics card and then
the next thing I would quite honestly do
is take everything out of the case maybe
there's a short and I would start
inspecting the motherboard for either
swollen capacitors little black charred
spots both front and back but I would
take the motherboard place it on a box
and then so it's kind of like a ghetto
test bench and take the case out of the
equation and then try and boot it if it
works then you probably had a short
somewhere maybe a wire was pinched
behind the motherboard tray maybe it was
pinched in the back of the case when you
close the case up and if it works then
put it all back in be very careful of
how you route your wires make sure
nothing's pinched on the back of the
motherboard is quite often there's
really sharp traces for the for the back
of the motherboard where all the leads
are in the solder points they can be
very sharp sometimes and poke into wires
and that can create a short if you put
everything back in and it works great if
it doesn't work when it's out on the
test bench or sitting on the box it
could be bad CPU more than likely a bad
motherboard motherboards tend to go bad
before memory or CPUs one of the things
you could also do early on which I
should have mentioned we were talking
about reseeding the RAM is try different
memory slots try
different memory slots can also tell you
if you've got maybe a bad memory channel
if you've got more than one dim take out
all but one and see if it'll boot if it
doesn't boot with that one then swap it
to the other to stick if it does boot
you got a bad stick if it still doesn't
boot could be bad memory channels could
be a bad memory controller it could be a
bad motherboard again there's a lot of
things that it could possibly be but the
point here is you want to do an order of
elimination you want to take out as many
equations and things that aren't needed
for the bare necessities of a computer
to boot to try to determine what the
problem could be and the only thing your
computer really needs to turn on is a
CPU with the GPU in it now unfortunately
AMD FX series processors do not have
GPUs in them so you'd have to use the
dedicated discrete graphics so if your
Intel you would need just the Intel CPU
motherboard memory power supply that's
all you need to make it turn on and if
you're on an AMD you would have to add a
graphics card to that all the other
stuff is peripheral and not needed to
actually boot into the BIOS here we are
now I want to do one more restart to see
what happens it looks like this
motherboard here it's problem turned out
to be a corrupted BIOS and that's
something that if you don't have a dual
BIOS motherboard or a selectable BIOS
switch which a lot in is still
definitely working but if you don't have
a selectable BIOS switch then a bad BIOS
quite honestly can also brick your board
if you can't get into the BIOS to do the
flash recovery then pretty much the
thing is toast and that's unfortunate
but in this case he lucked out because
we were quite ready to go to the store
and buy new hardware now he doesn't need
new hardware whether or not he wants new
hardware that's another thing if only we
knew a place where there was a lot of
hardware just kind of hanging out not
not being used or utilized not this
place I was going to do everything I
just mentioned for the sake of this
video but the point here is that now it
would have just been going through the
motions and not showing you whether or
not it would have solved the problem to
start doing the process of elimination
because as funny as it is we were
laughing we quite honestly we're
laughing this computer trolled me it
waited we we sat it for an hour I at
least 20 minutes at one point I just let
go I just let it keep boot looping
because
some other boards like you saw will
detect that there's a problem and then
it will kind of start to do a correct my
gigabyte motherboard that I use upstairs
did it x99 EVGA board has done it for me
where after a few bad loops it'll
recognize like Oh something didn't wrong
go right and it will fall back to kind
of a fail-safe err last known good
configuration this one for whatever
reason just waited what two days to do
it he saved a little bit of money but I
think he might be itching to upgrade
anyway especially since he has the
atrocity of having an i-5 35 70 K in a
b75 LGA 1155 yeah you'll get to get up
here you're gonna face the facts or the
camera man owns this computer right now
I'm giving him cuz he's got a case
Q CPU and a b75 motherboard guys thanks
for watching today's video I'm sorry
that I couldn't actually go through the
process of elimination I will find a bad
computer I'll find someone with a bad
computer hit me up if you guys are local
to me and you've got a bad computer
maybe we can figure this out together
anyway guys thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next attempted video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
