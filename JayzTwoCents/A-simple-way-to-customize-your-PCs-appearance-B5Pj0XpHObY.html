you know wrapping your device is not
really anything new but it is a great
way to protect your device and to give
you a nice custom look and feel doesn't
matter if you're talking about iPhone
Android heck even Nintendo switch and
d/s and all of that stuff when I'm
holding right here is an iPhone 10
that's wrapped with slick wraps shade
skin I think they sent me this one
because they're they're saying I throw
shade but whatever this is actually not
the point of today's video this is what
you would typically see when it comes to
a rep but what happens when the company
that designs this slick wraps is also a
PC enthusiast well you get computer
cases that are wrapped allowing you to
turn your build into an extension of
your personality but a better way to
bring out your personality is with a
custom website now Squarespace sponsored
today's video and I view Squarespace in
the past I am NOT a web developer I'm
very bad at it and when I wanted to sell
my custom cycling jerseys I set up a
Squarespace ecommerce cart allowing me
to more easily start selling the
merchandise and not have to worry about
setting up the website now Squarespace
empowers millions of websites across
thousands of industries for people just
like you and me who are not web
developers but want to get up and
running easily and seamlessly if you
need to domain they can handle that too
with easy domain registration transfer
or registration so what are you waiting
for start your custom web site today
with Squarespace calm and when you're
ready to launch head on over to
squarespace.com slash chase two cents
and save 10% on a website or a domain
now stay tuned to the end of the video
because this is actually a giveaway
piece yes worldwide anywhere in the
world well except for avoid or
prohibited can win today's case slick
wraps wanted to give this case away
which kind of sucks for me because I
think it's cool and I'd love to build a
system in it but I can just get another
rep now you're not actually buying the
case from them what you're buying from
them is the rap itself just like you
would with any device so you buy the rap
as instructions you apply it
crap there we go meant to do that
look at that now here's the thing I
wasn't expecting the whole thing is
wrapped that is awesome the top aback
this looks so much better on the case in
my opinion that does on the phone
where's the phone the phone doesn't have
a huge amount of surface area to catch
that light and sort of reflect it but
look at this this this almost has like
an oil slick feel to it like it doesn't
feel this texture is you would think it
looks like it would be really textured
but it's not you can definitely see how
it catches the light here is the top
panel so you can see right here how the
wrap actually goes edge to edge now I
think the reason why they went with the
r6 is because well this is the perfect
candidate simply because it's got so
much flat surface on here which allows
you to in clean cloth which allows you
to have an easy you know surface to
apply this to it this this is gonna
require kind of heat when you do devices
like this when you have to do the bezel
or the edges and it's rounded this is
where it can get a little bit tricky
because it requires heat to kind of make
it form fit but because the case right
here is completely flat that makes it a
whole lot easier oh look at that they
even kept it going on the inside right
here I think the most intricate part
here is going to be the top panel right
here because this has to fit around
obviously our top plate here which you
know you block off plate for your fans
but that's the best part about this is
this is all computer cut they do all of
measuring and I'm not sure if libri in
other cases in the future I would be
surprised if they didn't but they've
obviously started with the r6 for some
pretty obvious reasons but the
installation instructions are gonna show
you exactly how to do this and how to do
it properly the fitment is guaranteed to
be perfect because they do again all of
the laser cutting which is extremely
precise I know it doesn't show up on
camera very well this is a UV flashlight
they included to kind of show because
you can use UV light to energize things
that glow in the dark very quickly if
you have black lighting in your case so
you could actually use their UV reactive
wrap to make some pretty neat things
happen inside of the case okay so I know
you guys can't really see this too well
on camera
but trust me when I say that it is
definitely glowing someone throw a
motherboard and a graphics card in here
just to kind of see what it looks like
and to sort of show how you can kind of
tie in a whole theme with the wrap
pretty pretty easily but because we've
got the shade skin
I think the ASUS Maximus X apex is a
pretty good fit for this so as you can
see once you put some parts in there it
definitely starts to fill out and come
together I don't think the big s W logo
and the slick wraps lettering is
actually part of the the wrap it could
be I'm not sure but I think obviously
for advertising purposes for today's
video that's why that's there so you
don't forget who was actually the one
who wrapped this but once you start
putting the components in here it
definitely all starts to tie together an
easy theme but what I like about this
you might be watching this video going
whatever it's just a vinyl wrap big deal
if you paint a case we powder coat a
case or you anodized whatever that is a
big deal to try and reverse and I see
you can traverse got to reanalyze it and
every time you do an atty something you
actually lose a little bit of the
material on the metal thread start to
fatigue a little bit and lose some of
the material powder coating is not easy
to get off you have to use a chemical
stripper and paint once again you got to
use something like air craft remover or
another stripping technique which is
just an awful lot of work if I decide I
want to change the theme of this case
now I just peel off the wrap and start
over it's not expensive it's completely
reversible and allows you to customize
your build to something that's truly
unique in yours now yeah they offer tons
of different designs and patterns both
pop culture sports whatever you name it
they probably have it but the best part
is you can actually take your own
designs and upload them and kind of
customize the wrap how you want it to be
enable print it cut it and send it to
you so if you had a very specific thing
you were after you can create it and
have them make it so that's why wraps
with pcs I think is definitely gonna be
sort of something we start seeing more
of in the future in fact one of the most
common themes suggested to me when I
asked what theme I should do another
bill done somebody said well a lot of
people actually suggested do one based
on your car your zl1 and that's a white
car with polished or exposed carbon
fiber that's glossy as matte black
that's white there's red and it would be
an easy way to
- actually theme the case to match the
car rather me trying to figure out how
the heck I'm gonna paint it or this and
that so starting with a white case and
doing custom carbon fiber wraps and
stuff would you be a much easier way to
get a very custom feel but like I said
the start of the video if you want to
win this case the case not the
components in it this these are my name
it says mininum on there so that's mine
obviously says J unless you're a J that
it doesn't matter it's still mine if you
want to win this case worldwide except
where prohibited if you guys live in a
place that don't allow you to win things
that really sucks but check the
description below you'll find two links
one a link to slick rap so you can see
what devices are supported and what the
raps currently look like and all their
different patterns costs all that sort
of stuff and you'll also find a link to
the giveaway so the case is going to go
to anywhere in the world that giveaways
are allowed and a huge thank you to
slick raps for sponsoring that giveaway
because shipping this case to someplace
like Zimbabwe would be very very
expensive so again a huge thank you for
that also
again thank you guys as slick raps for
sending me this case to have a look at
if you guys have any suggestions on
future content or any design suggestions
you guys have for doing any sort of
themed build put it down in the comments
below as always guys thanks for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
