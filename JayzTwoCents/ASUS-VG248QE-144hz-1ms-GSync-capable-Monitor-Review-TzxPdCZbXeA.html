the buck high refresh rate panel then
the asus v g2 for 8qe has to be on your
shortlist now let me start by saying
that this is not a review about products
sent to me for review this is a review
that has been months in the making with
my own dilemmas on what to do about
panels now I scoured the Internet I've
checked Amazon review new aid review
I've reached out to my Twitter followers
quite often and just could not make up
my mind on panels and many of you guys
said that you have the VG - for 8qe
and you highly highly recommend it so I
went ahead and took your guys's advice I
picked up three of these bad boys and
let me tell you right now the worst
thing I ever did to my setup was GIMP it
with sixty Hertz panels now before I go
a little bit deeper into that let's go
ahead and talk about the specs of the
monitor really quickly it is a one
millisecond refresh rate so that means
there's no tracing there's no ghosting
it is an extremely fast refresh rate to
kind of put that in perspective my Acer
panels which I was using prior to this
have a 5 millisecond response rate
making these panels a 5 times faster
response rate now I've always said that
response time is not a big deal when it
comes to gamers but holy the
movement is so smooth on the screen if
you have the horsepower to push those
high frame rates that I just didn't
realize what I was missing out on all
this time now the VG - for 8qe is 144
Hertz panel that means it can display
144 frames per second before we start
getting any sort of image tearing and
that is massive when you have 3 GTX 780
s overclocked like I'm running so I was
gimping them with these 60 Hertz panels
and I never even realized it it is a
backlit LED it's got 3d content support
DisplayPort vga although for the love of
God please don't plug anything into the
VGA just pretend it's not even there
it's even got built-in speakers now does
have HDMI support however do not plug in
anything in the HDMI port if you
to take advantage of the 144 Hertz
refresh rate HDMI is capped at 60 Hertz
so please don't just ignore HDMI I don't
even know why it's there to be honest I
guess that would be for console but then
again if you had a console you wouldn't
be able to take advantage of the 144
Hertz anyway when you open up the box
you greeted with some hard foam but it's
very very thick hard foam protecting
your investment well in transit are
being shipped or dropped or whatever
it's I don't think anything's going to
happen to this panel with the amount of
foam that's in here now the back stand
is actually already mounted to the
monitor but it does have VSA 100 by 100
mount which is what I'm planning on
using once my ergo Tech 3 monitor stand
arrives we'll talk about that a little
bit later in the future
now the stand has already mounted like I
said all you've got to do is take the
stand thing and put the base thing on
and turn the screw and next thing you
know you're mounted up and ready to go
now it is a four-way ergo designs you
can actually rotate the monitors
portrait mode if you want it easily
moves up and down with effortless
effortlessly
it's got spring load in there it's
actually really really cool I really
like the base it's got some built-in
cable management but there are some
things I don't like about the actual
design of the monitor and that is that
Asus used a glossy piano finish
everywhere on this on the base on the
front on the back and I'm personally not
a friend a piano finishes whatsoever
they tracked us a check fingerprints and
I personally wish that they had gone
with a matte plastic but I digress is
the minor thing you guys may love the
elegance of a piano polished plastic me
personally I don't but I live in a dusty
area and that's why I hate piano
finishes and it seems like all the
monitors have that now so whatever that
may be I'm the maybe I'm the weird one
who doesn't like those now it's got a
nice ventilated a well vent on the top
of the monitor and that's because this
has an integrated power supply it is not
like other LED monitors where the power
supply is a separate power brick now
with that said pretty much got
everything you need for connectivity for
a high refresh rate low response time
gaming monitor and that's exactly who
this is tailored to now this monitor
comes in under $300 most places in fact
I put an Amazon link down in the
description
guys can look up most current pricing as
you know pricing is always going up and
down though these are I have the 24 inch
model and I couldn't be happier with it
in fact as you can see behind me I've
got three of them now let's go ahead and
talk about what it's like to game 144
Hertz monitors and maybe you've been
wondering if it's for you and the
question is if you take first-person
shooters
seriously this is something you owe it
to yourself if you have a high-end
gaming rig like I do if you've got the
horsepower to push more than 60 frames
per second on a consistent basis you owe
it to yourself to at least go and look
at these monitors now the color
correction does need some work
out of the box it comes very faded the
blacks are not deep at all they look
very grey the colors are kind of muddied
but that's because they come not like a
dynamic setting like TVs tend to come
from the store nice bright popping
colors they're very flat but the cool
thing is you can go online and download
different profiles and different user
settings and you can go online and find
what other people are using and
calibrate it yourself it's got multiple
scenery modes or whatever you want to
call it on there that make it very easy
to tune this to your liking so if you
give it some time and you actually
calibrate it you can get some pretty
decent colors now it's going to it's not
going to come anywhere close to IPS or
VA panels I mean it is a TN panel so
that means the off angle viewing does
have a little bit of that foiling effect
does have a little bit of that negative
viewing angle so that when you get above
or below the panel it starts to invert a
little bit but as long as you're looking
at it with at least a 30 degree angle or
flat or a single monitor most of the
time TN isn't going to be an issue but
that again TN panels or what have the
massively high refresh rate low response
time and that's exactly what I was after
these panels are really really cool I've
been using them in battlefield 4 and I
was just amazed at how smooth they are
and even in my 3-way surround setup
we're staying well above 100 frames per
second usually sitting right around 140
frames per second so I had the
horsepower to push it and I couldn't be
more happy I thought about going with
1440p monitors but because I'm on three
gigabyte gddr5 cards I'm already getting
up to 2800 mega bytes utilized on my
ethics cards just in 1080p so 1440 would
have turned into quite a bit of a
bottleneck and I can't believe I said
the word bottleneck
I have to go banned myself now I'm just
gonna ban coconut monkey back there he's
that's fine he can take it but
everything is so smooth and it brings
your game to the next level you can just
cut it you can turn so fast and you
could turn on fools you can cat faces
and just be gangster I think I think
that's how I think that's what the kids
say these days I don't really know but
all I can say is that so frickin awesome
your friends will come over and they'll
take over your system and they won't let
you play anymore
speaking of which can I play now guys
it's in the asus v g2 for 8qe oh and one
other thing I forgot to mention it's
apparently moddable with gia sync I
don't know I better start freshing up on
g-sync I hadn't really cared a whole lot
but now that it's a something I can
actually consider hmm but I would like
to play my game no I see you back there
soon bitch
and help what you do I'm gonna start a
video now okay I think maybe I'm gonna
start the video all over Thanks so we're
patient when you start filming in order
to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
