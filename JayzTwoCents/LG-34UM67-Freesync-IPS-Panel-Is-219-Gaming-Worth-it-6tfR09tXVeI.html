here and today we are gonna answer the
question that has been on everybody's
mind when the hell is the r9 390x gonna
launch and my answer to that question is
I have absolutely no idea so we're going
to move into question number two which
is is ultra wide 20 1 by 9 aspect ratio
gaming really all it's cracked up to be
no no we're going to find out in this
video this one right now the new EVGA
silent series power supplies offer
excellent silence and efficiency through
their new EVGA Eco mode technology and
also features a seven year warranty for
worryfree gaming click the link in the
description to learn more well guys
sitting on the test bench behind me we
have LG's brand new 34 um 67 TN IPS 2560
by 1080 P 21 by 9 aspect ratio freesync
panel we took a look at this thing at
CES and this was one of the first panels
being marketed as utilizing a Indies
freesync technology so that's why I
actually have an AMD card sitting on the
bench now for the AMD card we'll be
using to test this today it is the Asus
matrix 290 X so we're gonna actually see
how freesync works with this bad boy but
there's three things that are kind of
puzzling about the specs of this monitor
one it is obviously being touted as a
gaming monitor with the fact that it has
free sync if you weren't gaming on it
who the hell cares but they're not has
freesync technology built in but that
being that it's also an IPS panel IPS
panels tend to have much lower pixel
refresh rate or response time when it
comes to games or anything fast motion
anything over 5 milliseconds it's kind
of considered slow by today's day and
age especially when you compare them to
TN panels which are anywhere from one to
two especially like the asus rog swift
which is a 1 millisecond panel or even
the new Acer xB 2 8 0 HK sorry I can't
remember that which is a 4k panel but TN
with a 1 millisecond response time so it
kind of makes you wonder free sync with
IPS who exactly is their demographic and
the other thing being that it's a 21 by
9 aspect ratio which is me
it's not going to be as widely utilized
when it comes to a lot of your games as
you know the standard 16 by 9 or 16 by
10 ratio that we've been accustomed to
for years leading to you having to hack
some of your registry files to get a lot
of your games to utilize that space
without giving you just a black bar on
the side of the screen and because this
thing is an IPS panel though I'm more
interested in personally I would be more
interested in its panel for productivity
and workflow things like video color
correction or you know Photoshop once
the screen is calibrated even let's I P
s it still does need to be calibrated
out of the box to become perfect but
still the colors are going to be much
more realistic on an IPS panel than
anything TN before we move into some of
the live gaming and kind of off-the-cuff
responses of how I feel about gaming on
this thing let's go ahead and talk about
some of the physical aspects of this now
as mentioned this is a 34 inch panel
they do also have a 29 inch Edition out
there as well but because this thing is
so wide and so short in terms of height
I find 34 inches to kind of be the
perfect sweet spot where 29 is just way
too small I want to say that's what
that's what she said joke but that's
just ridiculous
now it does have a little bit of tilt
adjustment but it has absolutely no
swivel and no height adjustment built
into the base you get two options when
it comes to height you have to
completely unbolt it and rebuilt it in
those two different positions to give
you any sort of height adjustment but
because the thing has an acrylic base
plate on there or stand or whatever you
want to call it it does kind of give it
a neat free-floating sort of effect to
it but then that's kind of completely
killed off by the fact that you can now
see the cables running behind the
acrylic piece there and now that kind of
kills the fact that it felt like it was
floating otherwise the panel does feel
like it's being suspended in midair
which is kind of a neat effect
controlling the on-screen stuff is very
simple through a joystick that's pretty
much built in underneath the bottom of
the middle of the screen I call it a
joystick it's really just more like a
d-pad that you can just move around and
go to different on-screen options now
built into the menu option there is also
refreshed time adjustment on there with
high middle and low and off where
basically you can I guess take over some
control of the response
time of the pixels I guess we'll kind of
play around with that a little bit in
the live testing I'm not entirely sure
exactly how that's going to work out now
when it comes to the free sync one of
the things that a lot of people have
said about this panel that seems to be
kind of odd is the fact that the free
sync range is only effective between 48
and 75 Hertz but that's a really weird
range considering at this resolution
2560 by 1080 it is possible for non
high-end graphics cards things like the
290 X or the 290 or even the 285 are the
285 or 280x
to dip down below that 48 Hertz now
high-end cards are going to be hurt by
this considering the fact that they are
going to be slowed down to 75 Hertz so
it's one of those things where it's a
really strange range of why 48 to 75 was
picked considering the panel vendors
pretty much are the ones that are able
to control the range of which these
monitors are going to be responding at
when it comes to free sync now there are
multiple inputs on this thing DVI HDMI
and DisplayPort but if you want to use
free sync you have to use the display
port because free sync is using
DisplayPort 1.2 as its standard for
using free sync so anyway let's go ahead
and turn around let's get in is playing
some games on this thing and it's just
kind of get some first-hand experience
on what it's like gaming on this thing
I'm not too concerned about the refresh
rate or free sync or any of that
personally I kind of care more about the
aspect ratio of 20:1 by 9 now the amount
of real estate you have here is
definitely no joke I mean it's pretty
much to perfect squared screens
side-by-side not even a 4 by 3 let's go
ahead and let's try an FPS first we'll
go ahead and try some battlefield 4
sorry guys I don't have hardline
installed on this machine yet so here we
are in the battlefield 4 test range you
can see maybe you can't I don't know if
we go over here to the monitor settings
we do have free sync currently on it's
right there
and so you can see that also on the side
here we do have two black bars now
initially I thought that these were
going to be probably because maybe the
game wasn't working with 21 by 9 but
this is just the menu because as you can
see here
I hit resume in the game we do get the
entire side back it's very very smooth
that's for sure
it doesn't feel like there's any
perceived input lag which that 14
milliseconds could end up you know
that's what it could feel like am I
gonna hit that thing Oh
so what I want to check here real quick
though is what that setting for the
response time was and how that actually
plays in all of this so this is found in
the picture adjust there's also a black
stabilizer so we can you can see here
for FPS games we can kind of play around
the blacks a little bit here sharpness
you can really make it too sharp if you
want and then response time as you can
see we've got low middle and high so I'm
going to set it to response time high
because technically I don't know that
makes me think that response is going to
be high like high response time would be
a high number that would be bad so let
me make it low now just to compare I
don't know I don't feel any sort of
difference with this I'm not entirely
sure how exactly let's turn it off I
don't know that's supposed to be just
some sort of enhancement or what doesn't
really feel any different to me though
boom I do like the extra peripheral on
this if you're playing a game like
Battlefield and you're flying around or
whatever you've got man you can see for
days so you can see our fps in the top
right where you pretty much just stuck
to 60 at least here inside the test but
the test range trying to see if I can
just get that number to fluctuate at all
so but that's alright thought means
60fps is extremely smooth when it's
locked there when there's very when you
crash into buildings like that your FPS
matters no it's it's extremely smooth
this doesn't feel like standard 60fps
like with a regular vsync it's certainly
a smooth I mean the 290x is definitely
doing its job and pushing all these
pixels and it freesync is clearly doing
its job in terms of keeping the FPS
completely locked I mean make sure my
head's not blocking that number of B as
you can see it is definitely I mean I'm
not seeing any tearing on the screen
whatsoever
I do have motion blur turned up people
are always like Jay why do you run
motion blur I like motion blur um see
fov fifty fine everyone's always like
fov seven-day up I'll be 70 so let's do
that and let's go ahead and turn motion
blur down off see I don't like this fov
it's all fisheye looking so that's a
personal preference personally but as
you can see it makes no difference at
all to the FPS it's still extremely
smooth to see what I can ping this guy
to this guy so close I want to hit this
guy nope that's gonna miss oh I got him
nevermind his wing so here it is with
fov 70 I personally don't like fov 70 it
feels very fisheye to me but that's just
a personal thing well clearly Tomb
Raider is capable of rendering out the
entire game across the monitor without
stretching it out or requiring any sort
of modification to any files I am
noticing that there appears to be a
little bit of stuttering here and there
graphics card starting to I'm going to
jump in the water and die graphics cards
starting to actually ramp up a bit
temperatures are probably really hot on
that 290x but vsync is off so let's put
it to double buffer even though the
panel should be doing the work I don't
think it matters but it did indeed just
smooth out quite a bit pretty certain if
I jump in there I'm going to die let's
see
no no Schmidt yeah this is an amazing
aspect ratio especially for games like
this I mean the amount of peripheral
view you have especially for yeah
especially for games like this where you
need to see around to the sides so low
my old friend
yeah she got a gun and she pissed
now I totally thought I had a here that
was not gonna be able to take advantage
of the aspect ratio and that was Counter
Strike global Offensive considering the
age of the game the how age of source
and all that I figure there's no way
that this game would have been set up to
actually utilize 21 by 9 especially
since it's not in the map that's not in
the settings you have to use yeah I love
this you have to use 16 by 9 in the
settings as you can see here it's under
16 by 9 but the resolution shows up 20
2560 by 1080 so yeah it's actually able
to utilize this and I wonder if this is
something that would give someone a
competitive edge have a little bit more
peripheral in a FPS like this I'm
totally dead but as you can see Counter
Strike global Offensive uses 21 by name
well alrighty then so I find myself in a
pretty interesting position here with
the 34 um 67 from LG and that is that I
love the aspect ratio from a
Productivity perspective the amount of
real estate you have but how compact it
is on your desk versus running some sort
of an NV surround or an eyefinity setup
and the fact that games do seem to be
utilizing it pretty well and those
titles that aren't are being updated
constantly for you to be able to utilize
21 by 9 or those registry hacks as well
that are available to use but my real
major flaw with this panel and the one
thing that I just can't seem to get past
for me is that 1080 resolution I've been
using 1440p panels and 4k panels now to
the point to where going back to a 1080p
vertical resolution just I don't think I
can do it I'm so used to looking to that
that Q HD or UHD now to the point to
where 1080 like this I can see
pixels even sitting at a you know good
three feet away I can see the pixels and
it bothers me I'm used to not seeing
pixels anymore freesync is doing a very
good job at keeping the frame timing
very consistent so there's no stuttering
lagging or tearing of course I am
running a 290x with it it's not
overclocked by the way this is a stock
settings for the matrix and I am running
it with the 5820k in a Intel setup but
you might start running into problems
with lower end graphics cards where if
it's not able to drive that many pixels
because there is quite a bit more pixels
than this and there is in 1920 by 1080
you're going to find that lower end
graphics cards are going to start
bumping down underneath that 48 Hertz
freesync refresh rate where then it just
turns into a standard you know the way
LCD crystals refresh and there could be
tearing even down at that low refresh
rate but the fact that it's a 1080p
vertical for me is just it's one of the
reasons why I can't make this my main
panel I'm still using the 1440p Swift
you know 28 28 inch Swift as my main
panel on skunkworks over here and I
don't know how if that's going to change
anytime soon
especially since I'm running in video
graphics cards on the main system I
would lose out on the free sync on this
entirely so it would be a little bit
wasted on skunkworks but I do think it
fits perfectly right here fits perfectly
underneath the Shelf perfect width
between the edge of the desk and the
test bench it's got a pretty nice home I
just to find a place to hook up the Acer
maybe wall mounted up there is something
the 280 HK for K 1 millisecond panel
yeah that's pretty insane so what do you
guys think of the 21 by 9 aspect ratio
sound off down in the comments or hit me
up on Twitter if you guys want to tell
me what you think about this I think
this is probably going to be one of the
aspect ratios of the future we've seen
them becoming more and more prevalent
especially since CES this year and I'm
especially with the curve technology now
I do see a lot of people going with this
type of format I could certainly see
myself running one of these as a main
panel if I wasn't already surrounded by
LCD technology everywhere alright guys
well thanks for watching today's video
sorry the content quality isn't as high
as I would have liked now that I'm full
time officially last day has already
been put in I can start working on
upping the quality of the content that
give you guys up in the quantity but
being the quality so that you guys can
have a great time here on the channel as
always guys thanks for watching I really
shouldn't be making a video right now
cuz I feel like crap
I know you guys want to hear that but
I'm giving you at least a little bit of
an excuse as to why I sound this way but
I still wanted to make a video for you
guys so I figured I know I said I was
gonna do a bill blog I'm still not doing
a bill dog I'm keeping my promise on
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
