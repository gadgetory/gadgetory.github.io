fractal design and I was going to do
like this whole thing and I decided you
know what since I have to build it as
well take you guys along for the ride
on some of the loop planning and all
that sort of stuff because I've gotten
some feedback lately of the the montages
are cool and all but people kind of miss
the old days where we used to just sort
of talk about every little thing that
we're going through and I figured maybe
we'll do that today it's kind of like
two birds with one stone
recording the work that counts as the
work rule the games from the seven
kingdoms with your iron claw Mouse from
your Iron Throne it has a scroll wheel
that looks like a off-road tire and
buttons on the side and top to do stuff
don't lose grip while doing stuff with
the textured sides and do it in style
with the odd learn more Coursera
the components in this build are kind of
secondary to just the point of doing the
build I guess building in a case is
obviously one of the best ways to get
familiar with it now the chassis on this
is gonna seem very very familiar this is
very derivative of like BS - obviously
it's cs2 vision which means you have
tempered glass side panels we'll talk
about all that once it's done because
that was kind of the plan originally was
have it done and show it all beautified
and now I decided to just to show you
the process so the components like I
said are secondary but because I know
you're gonna ask for a CPU with an i7
9700 k-8 corn on hyper-threading CPU so
not a high-power part not a super high
heat part so we're definitely good there
EK waterblock on that that is the
velocity block we have on the
motherboard it's an msi ma gz 390 ace
not the godlike bits the ACE still has
the OLED panel and stuff right there
for memory haven't put in there yet
though we have 32 gigabytes of the
HyperX predator ddr4 RGB memory graphics
card we have an msi geforce r-tx 28 ET i
seahawk this is the one that has the EK
r d-- block already installed so that's
kind of nice we have to worry about that
it's got to eight pin power plugs plus a
6 pin now the nice thing about the s2
vision here is the fact that it comes
with all four of these 140 millimeter
Prisma fans these are RGB they're high
static pressure but they're also good
for case flow so you can use in one
things like radiators or your case
obviously typically case manufactures
only include one maybe two fans one
intake 1 exhaust but as you can see here
you get four of these and these are
digital RGB so these can hook up to
things like mystic light which is why
we're using MSI for this build and
you'll be able to control them and
obviously control your themes so with
that let's go ahead and build it and
talk about the loop and stuff because
the loop I'm really sort of doing like a
water cooling build ish review with this
it's kind of see what we can come up
with here when I'm doing my builds with
water cooling I usually try and figure
out the reservoir placement first the
the thing with reservoirs is there's
lots of different options you've got
your combo units you got your individual
components unfortunately I had requested
that we get a combo unit and I was sent
to individual component so I'm gonna see
if this works out if not I've got a few
other options I mean I've still got this
guy from when we did the
six gold and white build which is the
photon from excess PC still one of my
favorite reservoirs glass which makes it
kind of nice but also kind of scary to
handle at times so we'll see I'm not a
fan of that one though because it's a
round pump all the fittings come off at
weird angles rather than nice and square
so I like to get the reservoir and pump
sort of figured out first the nice thing
about the the s2 vision here is the fact
that it doesn't of course come with the
back wall here which has all these slots
so that you can mount things like
reservoirs and pumps I'm just using a
fitting in between these two it's a
double rotary a double rotary 90 so I
can recenter it because the problem is
if you look at the bottom this reservoir
does not have a centered hole so I
couldn't Center it on there so we're
just gonna have to see I mean that's
kind of the name of the game here is to
play around with it and see how it goes
I don't know because the problem here
what kind of straighten this out fulfil
is it's not straight because that
fitting does not push the pump over
enough to like make it perfectly
centered but the hole on the reservoir
mount is centered the pump is also
centered because of the slots that we're
gonna mount it to because it comes with
the two little brackets so you can see
is crooked because of that because it's
not centered on left and right between
where these mounts so my either got to
see if I can't come up another fitting
option for that or I'll be ditching this
ek system altogether for a different
brand entirely so this what I'm talkin
about like this this crap is round and
so you got one coming off that way one
going that way one going that way one
going that way it just looks stupid it's
dumb that's literally the only word I
could think of the people who designed
these round reservoirs with fittings
coming off the way they do are dumb yeah
I think that's got to be my flow order
Brad to take the ride out now and clip
it back over
fantastic
I'm already bleeding you know there was
open the drawer how good that guy
okay so every time I do any sort of hard
to video you guys see this fitting and
everyone asked me what is this fitting
so this is actually from primo chill and
it's not even like specifically a
fitting they make I think it's just one
they resell but look at the look at this
this is this is all jacked up right so
it's literally and it works with 12 mil
and 13 mil just put it in it's worth the
like 20 bucks or 15 bucks whatever it
costs honestly and then you can actually
use it to shorten a tube to four
millimeters at a time I get no kickback
on that by the way so I cut this tube
too short like two different times I'm
like men I cut another tube and I'm like
man then I forgot that it does slide up
top so we could have just slid it to
where it needs to go so one of the
things I like to do when I'm doing
custom loops like this is sort of test
fit everything so as you can see this is
not a complete bill there's no RAM
there's no callers on any of these
compression fittings but this is the
order that we chose and that obviously I
used 90 degree angles fittings for this
one because I already had them too I
wanted to use them again they look they
kind of add something to this I guess I
started to bend the 12 millimeter tubing
though just to see how it would look and
twelve millimeter tubing with the only
two millimeter wall versus three does
kind of kink a lot easier and I wasn't a
fan of the way that was turning out so I
just decided to use the elbows anyway
and they stay in their spot pretty good
I also use these when I'm doing glass
tubing so it's kind of the same effect
but this is ptg so we're coming out of
the reservoir and pump combo going up
and over into the radiator through the
rad back down into the cpu in so right
here is where I have it coming into the
graphics card now it's not explicitly
labeled as in and out like you would
find on the CPU block but it's very
similar design you can see you've got
this sort of a jet plate here it goes
through it splits goes to different
directions it meets again back here
there's a cover here so you can't see
but I like to come in and down through
here instead of having it split this way
merge and come back up because what I
found is where it splits over here when
you're in a vertical mount like this you
can get air sort of trapped and it can
kind of be a pain in the ass to get it
all out so I found that when you flow
this way it sort of pushes the air back
up because air naturally wants to rise
site so anywhere that fluids going down
the air is gonna fight it and get
trapped at the top so when it goes like
this I found it naturally
sort of pushes the air out and then of
course comes out of there back into the
reservoir so all of this is just sort of
loosely mounted I mean this isn't
tighten down the riser card the CPU
block is mounted obviously with the
thermal paste and stuff though this can
still sort of move so I'm gonna do now
is I'm gonna take all of this out I'm
gonna take a picture of it too so I know
where all the tubes go because they kind
of suck trying to realign it all up
later but now that the loop is done I
can go ahead and build the system and
then we can fill it and do all that
stuff so what do you say we let Phil do
his montage of filling
now for the RGB what we do is we took
basically our own we made our own
splitters four way five way splitters
and just plug everything into like I
said the 12 volts have their own
splitter because there are some 12 volts
stuff on here and then we've got all the
Prisma fans plugged into the digital
decibel on the motherboard which works
seamlessly with like mystic light and
aura and all that stuff so this is what
the back end looks like nice giant
cutout to be able to get to your back
plate for whether it be an air cooler or
a water block like we have here and then
right here and I've got these brackets
which we're not using because we don't
need them you can mount additional three
and a half inch hard drives or two and a
half inch drives and three more of them
like that
I just take them off when we're not
using them kind of probably a bad
practice since if you need them later
you might lose them but we are only
using the single SSD right here which is
mounted to SSD trays on the back these
could also mount to the front if you
want and since it is RGB you could do
that and it would be you know nice and
pretty and show off in your system but
since we're using the vertical mount I
chose not to do that and just put it
right here on the back now let's talk
about the top because this chassis does
come with a solid glass panel on the top
that you have to remove and basically
discard entirely if you want airflow on
the top of the chassis so rather than
having any sort of air gap or having it
rise or
come up with some sort of a solution
that doesn't require you to lose the
glass pan altogether you replace it with
this very basic filtered grille for the
top which is the same as what you'd find
unlike the r6 or the define s2 so that's
a little bit disappointing because it's
kind of like you've got this premium
glass all the way around the chassis and
then this very kind of a cheap looking
plastic frame for the top which then in
my opinion two tracks from the elegance
that this chassis is supposed to be but
in terms of air flow plenty of air flow
no issues whatsoever when it comes to
cooling the graphics card or the CPU
when you go with a radiator on the top
or even if you put one in the front
there's plenty of airflow and it just
kind of keeps with the standard
tradition of fractal design keeping it
close to the chest with the very
familiar rectangular box but there now I
think what happened is they realize a
lot of us we're taking additional glass
panels from other cases and putting them
on both sides because they are
interchangeable you could put the back
panel on the front and vice versa they
are 100% mirrored you can flip it upside
down and it works on both sides people
were doing that as sort of a mod and I
think fractal kind of took it ran with
it and then added the glass to the front
and to the top unfortunately like I said
you lose the top if you aren't using
only the rear exhaust fan which then in
my opinion is not enough because if
you're running high-end hardware with
the amount of heat that's gonna be
generated in the chassis even if you're
running air coolers one 140 millimeter
fan that's a lot of heat to have to
exhaust so you then have to run it at a
higher rpm to kind of match the amount
of fans pushing air in which then means
that you're gonna be dealing with a ton
of positive pressure air coming out of
all the cracks and then only one fan
having the responsibility of exhausting
the heat which i think is substandard
but that's that's my opinion what's your
guys's opinion on this hopefully you
guys like the way the bill turned out
this is just an example of how you could
water cool a chassis like this and you
can see there's plenty of room to do it
we could have added another rat if we
wanted in the front with that removable
plate in the front you could go all the
way up to 80 millimeter radiator with
fans and still have plenty of room for a
long card like you can see this is a
pretty long card this Seahawk is for all
intents and purposes a water-cooled trio
which is one of the biggest cards they
make with the exception of the God light
card are the Lightning card and so yeah
you can see there's plenty of room in
this
considering the fact this is still
technically a mid tower it's pretty
impressive what you can fit in here so
this is where you guys sound up in the
comments below about this chassis how do
you feel about it
what would you change oh I forgot to
mention it does also include an LED
strip which is kind of nice because
large Hasse's are not including any sort
of lighting in them you just can't
really notice it and this one - well
because it's in between the radiator and
the wall of the motherboard because this
is an offset radiator design which means
it doesn't fit up here in the front
where it's pre-installed so I relocated
it but anyway here we go again
tell us what you guys think about this
chassis what would you do what kind of
build would you do and more importantly
what would you change if it was your
build thanks for watching guys and as
always we'll see you in the next one
alright so I was gonna do this whole
know this always fractal design define
