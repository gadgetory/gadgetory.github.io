missed the tape
I can't unbox here we go oh I'm
cutting the cardboard so it's no
surprise that GPU prices have not come
back down so that's why this might be
more make more sense than ever to
actually consider a pre build and what
we've got here today is actually a pre
built computer by NZXT yeah NZXT
actually makes computers did you guys
know that so this is part of their build
or BLD and you guys can go to their
website configure a system and have it
shipped to you and the best part is
graphics cards are actually pretty close
to MSRP alright so here's what we got
inside I've not opened this yet an
opening on camera for the first time so
it looks like we've got a cam is
complete monitoring solution through PC
it shows you how to plug everything in
quick start I mean if you've never had a
computer before this might be useful but
we don't need that around here we've got
an order summary here of all of our
specs and we'll talk about that in a sec
because I basically just went for the
top I wanted to see what the best damn
system we could build was sure hope it's
packaged well I mean if it can't
withstand me tipping it over and can
ascend through shipping
so we got some extra power cables for
our see Sonic PSU and this is the good
host
I think we know what brand GPUs in there
mostly because I mean I picked it so
gaming beyond open-world good because I
hate gaming enclosed worlds so here's
all of our brackets and stuff for the a
i/o cooler that's in there and we've got
power cable ethernet cable video cable
not sure what kind it is is probably
gonna be this plate port or maybe an
HDMI this will see and that's everything
it's in the box
no it's the pack dude how fast is that
instant though how fast it's instant
yeah obviously they use this instapass
to protect the internals and the GPU
from bouncing around it's obviously got
to survive be soft and gentle touch of
UPS and FedEx
with that said let's go ahead and get
that out of here
tempered glass side panel so careful and
nicely my insta pack is when you put it
in there it just expands and it fills
out the space
there it is everything nice and safe now
for this bill that obviously went
straight for the top I kind of wanted to
see what like close to the best we could
build was but they offer Intel systems
AMD systems and they keep the parts as
close to retail as possible and when we
tried to actually piece this system out
we found that it was very very
comparable to going to like Newegg or
something and buying it on your own and
putting it together but the best part is
you get a warranty with it they only
charge a $99 billed fee and obviously
get a warranty and all that but getting
a graphics card near MSRP is obviously
the best perk so the specs that I put in
this here obviously it's an H 700 I
black because it's NZXT only ends 8 C
cases are going to be offered but it's
got the Kraken X 62 cooling we got an
MSI Z 370 gaming Pro carbon motherboard
it's a 1080 TI 11 gigabyte for the win 3
graphics card 8700 K they do offer rise
in mainstream like up to a 1700 I didn't
see a 1700 X or an 1800 X or any thread
Ripper builds but that's because they're
trying to appeal to the mainstream
rather than the extreme enthusiasm
there's no X 399 for AMD so just keep
that in mind power supply chose an 850
watt see Sonic 80 plus gold it's got the
cable mod 6 + 2 pin base or 6 + 2 basic
cable extensions so these are all cable
mod cables here so they've got combs on
there to keep everything looking nice
and pretty we've got 32 gigabytes of
g.skill ddr4 obviously in red you can
see we went with the red theme because
you can also choose the color theme you
just you choose the color tab you say I
want blue or on black white red and so
that will be the aesthetic for it we've
also got two crucial MX 500s SDS or 1
terabytes so I've got 2 terabytes of SSD
storage there and we've got a samsung
960 Evo m2 is our main system drive then
of course the NZXT USB expansion because
there wasn't enough USB ports on this
motherboard and the cool part was the
configurator automatically recognized
that and then tells you like hey we have
to use a USB expansion port because you
don't have enough USB is to run like
your NZXT hue and your Kraken and all
the onboard stuff so it adds that then
of course
we have Microsoft Windows 10 Pro but
it's a flat $50 shipping to the United
States where regardless of where you are
so 50 bucks shipped and this is what you
get before we get into games and we talk
about benchmarks and stuff like that
because there's kind of a neat dynamic
when it comes to building these systems
and fps and all that we'll talk about in
a sec I want to kind of take a look at
cable management and stuff for here so
the back panel just pops off just like
any other 700 I and check it out so
we've got our USB hub kind of chilling
down here we've got our focus power
supply our extensions nothing looks like
it was just thrown together I mean
everything's do its channels so that's a
definite good thing we're good when it
comes to the build quality don't see
anything that really stands out to me
that would be a problem so let's go
ahead close this back up now let's talk
about performance because one of the
things that is kind of unique about the
BLD service from NZXT is it has an FPS
guarantee the when you build the system
the very first question they ask you is
what games are you going to play and
what resolution are you going to play
them and then it shows you what the FPS
will be based on the settings that you
pick so you can kind of give it a target
like I want to play pub G in 1080p at
60fps then it kind of gives you like
okay here are our recommendations and
then you can scale up or down for there
so any changes that you make will
automatically adjust that FPS now the
three titles that I chose for this
system were pub G because that's really
is still a very popular game I also
chose rise of the Tomb Raider just
because it's a benchmark that I use
quite often and I also chose world of
warcraft but at 1440p which is what I
chose that was my target with this build
1440p and I wanted like 90 FPS for pub G
we're going to test that and see if
that's what you actually get so here we
are in pub G we're at 1440p and if we
look at the settings you can see we are
at Ultra on all of our settings right
here 2560 by 1440 and we were promised
91 FPS according to the configurator now
in the starting area can see we have
exceeded that by quite don't you don't
get to hit me and run away good go so
anyway we are at 125 for but 2027 and
540 good point okay
it's much higher than 9
one in the starting zone but we'll see
what happens once we're in the game that
while we're flying through the air we
are in the one 30s and 40s it's the
counter is going so fast I can't
actually stop it
it's another we're on the ground we're
actually having to render all of these
buildings and things you can see our fps
is still over-delivered we're looking
for 91 we're well into the hundreds
hundred and teens or so it's moving so
fast it's kind of hard to see but that's
that's awesome because if you were
expecting 91 and you were getting 80
well that would be a over-promised
under-deliver which is what we're
actually not getting here but the thing
is the FPS and stuff to be honest guys
it doesn't matter if someone else built
it or you built it it's still running
off-the-shelf components in 8700 K at
1080 Ti our screen is tearing really bad
because we're on a 60 Hertz panel but
that brings up the point of you know you
can tailor your system based on your
needs and the games you want to play so
you have an expectation rather than
trying to watch benchmarks and stuff to
figure out well what kind of performance
you're gonna get you actually know with
something like this now as you can see
we're sitting here in this corner and
we're sitting like right about 92 FPS 88
I can't really tell it's fluctuating so
fast the bottom line is we are we are
getting what we were promised and that's
pretty awesome and the same thing with
rise of the Tomb Raider I mean obviously
the performance is there this was a
top-tier system build and I wanted to
see if it came close to the promised FPS
and clearly that's what we're getting
this is how you play pub G you hide in
the bathroom you wait with a shotgun no
cause I'm gonna outside let's talk about
pre-built systems for a second it's it's
obvious that I'm a proponent for DIY or
Do It Yourself and I'm always going to
encourage people to do that but there
are some times when people just are not
comfortable with taking expensive
components and taking the chance or risk
of damaging something or they're just
not confident enough to put together
their own system and if that's the way
you feel then I have failed but that's
okay because that's why system
integrators exist now the nice thing
about the NZXT or B LDR build
services is the fact that everything is
off-the-shelf what you see right here
you could
create 100% on your own if you want to
because there is nothing proprietary or
special about this build other than the
fact that NZXT is doing it for you for a
nominal build fee and keeping the parts
within a like as close to MSRP as they
can get it and we tried to build this on
our own through through Newegg and it
was very very close in terms of pricing
GPU prices are not inflated because
system integrators are actually getting
the graphics cards for the cost that
they would traditionally get them rather
than the terribly inflated prices that
we're dealing with right now so it makes
for the like the first time in history
it's actually cheaper to build this
system or get it through a system
integrator or builder like NZXT then
doing it on your own because when we
tried to do the pricing on our own we
used MSRP for the graphics card which
you all know you cannot get a graphics
card for emissive MSRP but NZXT can so
now you've got this system here that is
cheaper than you can build it for which
is why we're in a really interesting I
want to say exciting and it's good for
people who are not comfortable with
building their own computers they can
get one for a great price if you're
looking at upgrading a system or doing a
complete overhaul don't go into the
pre-built has never made more sense than
it does today now that's an interesting
place on where we are and I don't think
it's a problem though the more gamers we
had the more people we have playing
games and getting excited about their
computers because you're probably gonna
upgrade it on your own when it's time is
that's a good place that's a whole point
of this channel
I think NZXT done a great job at
building a system that you'd be proud to
put on your desk and showcase and show
off to your friends and your family and
with the NZXT hue lighting system in
there you can come up with all sorts of
lighting effects obviously I just chose
red I wanted a simple red theme and
that's exactly how it shipped when we
booted it up it loaded into the profile
that was set after we did a update so
Windows was right there ready and
waiting to make us wait with an update
but once we got through there went
through and tested our games they under
promise and over deliver which was great
we got more FPS than we were expecting
based on the FPS estimator on the
configurator and that right there speaks
volumes so guys tell me what you think
about pre builds do you think we're in a
place now where P builds make sense
we've got new graphics cards on
horizon we know 2018 is gonna bring new
graphics cards hopefully from AMD and
NVIDIA and I'm curious to see what's
gonna happen with pricing as we move
forward but the fact that system
integrators can get cards for MSRP and
not inflating that price and passing it
on to the gamer is obviously a good
thing so guys sound off in the comments
below let me know what you guys think
look in the description below you guys
are gonna find the link you guys can go
and kind of configure your own systems
and check it out and again a huge thank
you for NZXT for sending the system over
for us to borrow and take a look at so
we can make this video for you they kind
of freaked out a little bit because I
went balls to the wall I click the top
tier everything is I wanted to see what
was actually gonna happen in terms of
you know how crazy could we build this
system and obviously it can scale up or
down well not really up from here but it
could scale down to fit your budget and
your games and your FPS requests and
that's a cool thing that that system
alone so it takes out all the guesswork
on how good or my game is gonna run you
know before you get it and based on what
we saw today you probably gonna get more
than you asked for so anyway once again
huge take you to n64 sponsoring today's
video and guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching and as always we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
