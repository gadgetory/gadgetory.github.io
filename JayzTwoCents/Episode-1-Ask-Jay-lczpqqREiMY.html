from the real toad 38 ass or boobs boobs
I've been in boobs since I was a baby
it's kind of a no-brainer both what's
going on youtubers you're watching Jays
to Sansa today we're going to go ahead
and play a game we're gonna play ask jay
this first question comes from twitter
from the real toad 38 he asked one best
gaming mouse to mcdonalds versus burger
king 3 coca-cola versus Pepsi or four
ass or boobs question number one I don't
know I haven't used all the gaming mouse
on the market but I can't tell you that
I like my mx518 the rat 9 is really cool
it's got lots of buttons and stuff
you've got the naga you've got the MMO
you've got a couple of other brands that
are coming up so i can answer that
question you're gonna have to answer
what you think the best gaming mouse
McDonald's or Burger King hmm
chick-fil-a coca-cola or Pepsi I don't
drink soda so neither ass or boobs boobs
I've been in boobs since I was a baby so
kind of a no-brainer both our next
question comes to us from Pottermore fan
he asks what advice would I give to an
inspiring YouTube gamer well seeing as
I'm just starting out on this YouTube
thing myself but it seems to be growing
really fast I don't know if I'd be the
guy you want advice from but if I had to
give you advice I would say play what it
is you like to play because if you like
to play it chances are someone else does
somewhere else and you're just gonna
have to you know grind at it and keep
making videos make them funny make them
entertaining and eventually your
audience will come but the most
important thing is you got to be able to
interact with your audience you've got
to make them feel like they're a part of
the video and you've got to engage them
so do something in your video that gets
them to respond to you whether that be
through Twitter or comments or whatever
it is above all make sure that you're
having fun because if you're having fun
your audience to tell they're having fun
and they'll keep coming back and they'll
hit that subscribe button where'd that
come from our next question comes from
I'll lose not loose loose sorry I can do
the best I can with some of these names
here yes if I could only play one game
for the rest of my life what game would
that be hmmm tough one
minesweeper he goes on to ask another
question and that is if I had any
superpower what would that power be I
would want the power of invisibility
imagine the things you could do if you
were invisible the places you could go
the things you could see in fact maybe
JS too since already has that power
uh-uh-uh-uh he also goes on to ask a
third question he asked if I've ever
played kingdom of hearts and if I
haven't go play it now no I haven't
played it you don't tell me what to do
not the boss of me I don't wanna all
right I'll go play it ok ubuntu addicted
asked a couple of things one he asked
Walter White or Jax teller if you're not
aware who these two superpowers are
where the hell have you been Walter
White is our antagonist / protagonist
not really sure what is becoming these
days on Breaking Bad and Jax teller of
course is the brand new president and
just all around smart guys / family man
/ career criminal in the sons of anarchy
if you guys aren't aware i have been to
the sons of anarchy set and i have been
to teller morrow i have been to that
bike shop i know you're jealous bro
nerdy jealous and I've been thinking
about this one all day and I've got to
tell you I think honestly I would have
to pick Walter White's or as he's better
known Heisenberg I choose Walter White
because uh he's very passive-aggressive
he doesn't come at you in your face he's
not that kind of guy he's all brains see
Jax is all brawn he's got a lot of
brains and he can see the big picture
but he tends to let his emotions get the
best of him but walter walter white man
he'll be running circles around you with
his brand and you didn't even know he
was there that guy oh my god and with
the last season's cliffhanger oh I
cannot wait until it comes back in
February I think februari whatever I
can't wait for it to come back oh my god
he also added a game a little shout out
first channel sure why the hell not it's
Ubuntu addicted the link to his channel
is down below gamers 18 asks HTC DNA or
galaxy s3 hmm have you ever used the DNA
but I can tell you that I've messed
around with some HTC phones in the past
and I've got to say I'm gonna give this
one to the galaxy s3
because Samsung puts a lot less
bloatware on their phones than HTC does
HTC just puts an ungodly amount of
bloatware and all sorts of apps you just
don't want and can't get rid of all over
their phones the galaxy s3 I think hands
down wins my vote of approval so Jake
wants to know via Facebook besides
computers and technology what's my other
favorite hobby well right now I'd have
to say it's probably YouTube you know I
don't do a whole lot outside of the
technology thing I play games i build
computers YouTube's been a whole lot of
fun it's really interesting to see you
know how the trends move and how people
respond to various videos and the trends
and already said that I think but to see
how you know how I can grow and what
works and what doesn't so right now this
is a really interesting hobby and so I'm
having a whole lot of fun with it and
the last question comes to us also via
facebook from Robert he wants to know
what I think the best MMO of all time is
and I'd have to say that with a
hands-down that's got to be the world of
warcraft they've built an MMO that is
eight years old based off of a franchise
and lure that is established long before
that with the Warcraft Series and
they've been able to take it and evolve
with it and just change and keep their
crowds coming back that's it for our
first version of ask j where i answer
any questions that you have if you've
got any questions that you'd like
answered in the next XX j don't ask me i
don't want to die not by an axe maybe a
horrible death but if you've got any
questions that you'd like me to answer
go ahead and put them down in the
comments tweet me facebook mate follow
me on all this you know social media
stuff right here and I'll make sure that
I get your questions answered and you
can get your name in my next video this
can't be right where am i I'm not in
Lansing hey you can't make this up that
