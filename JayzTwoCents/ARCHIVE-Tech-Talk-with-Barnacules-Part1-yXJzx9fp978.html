YouTube and it's five-thirty let's see
if it goes it says we're live the first
time ever on time I think maybe no no we
gotta verify it it still says starting
soon on there and once again it looks
like the comments are loading I
wonder when I really wonder when YouTube
is gonna take off the whole knit what
they call this their new and improved no
no no that's just that that that's just
leet speak for google bought us I mean
it's no good Google broke the out
of YouTube like I swear they just gave
all their developers access to just dump
 on it daily by the way i buy
reviews it's technically just started on
YouTube I used twitch ok it's up on
YouTube now all right guys hey we got
people talking look at that yeah we are
live uh ok let's go ahead and tweet this
out sweet our lives with Tech Talk and
barn you where do you have barnacle
barclays articles at twitch and YouTube
that's the youtube and then let's get
the twitch up there but you more people
going to come to twitch and YouTube oh
do this can be extra nerdy tonight look
I got the 3d printer back there printing
I didn't realize that do you yeah it's
back there making these things they're
like fan shrouds oh okay dude that's
awesome you can print your own fan
shrouds dude I print my own everything
did you see the drink coasters I made I
did I didn't solve the I saw like part
of the video I just didn't get a chance
to watch it all no that's my new thing
I'm just gonna start printing everything
and as soon as they come out with food
filament I'm gonna start eating what
comes out of there I'll they're like
print uh Snickers okay so we only have
like six viewers over here on the
YouTube channel will wait for this to go
out into the sub boxes and stuff but
because this is recorded I'm going to go
ahead and I play the intro or quick oh
and make it legit
okay burial there's a sudden ending in
the music they have time to make fate
outer innings that's funny that aqua
tuning logo of the ice cracking and
forming the aqua tuning thing yeah how
many so many there's a couple of other
people that are not sponsored by aqua
tuning but they do they've done some
videos for them so they're like hey uh
opportunity didn't send me that that
intro where'd you get it I was like I
made it they're like what no you didn't
make that I say they got I did make that
on after effects on one of those guys I
thought for sure that that was something
they gave you cuz that looked way too
high end for somebody as doofy as you to
pull off oh no I made it videocopilot is
an amazing amazing tutorial website by
the way damn as the bone it comes to
after effects I'm writing that down
videocopilot videocopilot net i believe
andrew kramer really awesome guy you
need to ask them to sponsor you mmm
because she wants because your shits
good i mean i like your effects i wish i
could do that stuff but most of what
I've learned I've already learned
through them so that's all the way here
we are guys Tech Talk Live uh looks like
we've got like all of maybe six viewers
so as we got 11 here so yeah we're
working on it well the problem is I
haven't been like live streaming regular
rate I cannot see the word regularly
just want to throw that too many
syllables I have not been doing this a
lot that has that yeah so we got a lot
of things I want to talk about today so
right we're gonna go ahead and do is
we're going to talk topic wise about the
there's a video game article out there
and it's about the 12 best pc mods for
games gaming pc mods out there because
it's let's face it it's kind of on the
subject that i did recently of console
vs pc and one of the the benefits people
always say pc has over console is you
can mod you can do mods and believe it
or not I'm not really much of a piecing
game mater I'd have never really run any
mods it's like if i play garry's mod
with you it'd be the first modded game
I've ever played yeah and that's not
even really a mod because they just put
mod in the title of their game so yeah
it's just made on the half-life engine
which is like open source anybody could
have any games for it so in like modding
is huge now like I've been watching a
lot of modding videos on YouTube lately
the most memorable one that I can think
of in my head
somebody took grand theft auto four and
made it into iron man like the oil in
there they had iron man you could change
out every suit he had he had all the
different weapons in the tax and
everything I mean it was a well-done mod
it literally looked like it was iron man
the game you know what I have to take
that back i did play a mod it was on
source engine which again isn't much of
a mud because it's kind of like an sdk
for everybody to use I guess right it
was back when half-life 2 first came out
and the source engine was like oh my god
it's so awesome yay back in like two
thousand four to three years I'm like
that and it was the matrix mod and if
you remember that did you make Latos
anyways I mean Google bottom so yeah you
and I continue to upload their in a
regular yes oh okay we're coming back up
I know I'll tell everybody what happened
as soon as I'm back up all right I'm I
I'm just like that portray it still says
we're live now all right okay stop we're
still streaming sediments 24 seconds
worth and get back in here even my wife
was ya see my wife was Miss J was just
games down yeah like I didn't know thank
you okay we're back up here looks like
we have nine people still in here the
comments section for whatever reason
guys is not loading is a comment section
loading for you and yeah I'm own on
YouTube sorry yeah which it is what the
 I don't know why it refuses to load
remember we had the same problem last
time that's what made us go to twitch
remember yep I say just just throw it
away this may or may not be and I need
to fix your skype thing here this may or
may not be the last live stream i do on
YouTube just saying until YouTube
honestly gets their figured out um
skype it amber or Google emeroo for some
reason your skype video doesn't want to
come in let me let me have you recall me
okay all right I can do that one second
everybody sorry and I'll explain to you
what happened and you guys can laugh at
me very you guys can laugh trust me okay
this this is all just a big
demonstration of skype fanboyism hey
there I am never will beard is that it
has big black boxes around you now let's
try it one more time skype video nope
now it wants to add your big black boxes
what is why is it doing that you see
that yeah there wasn't doing that before
fine we can cover up the fact that we're
live that's okay i'ma bring this in so
okay this is all this is all
demonstration leading up to a tech talk
of some kind yeah yeah totally all tech
talk really is it's called trouble fix
life if the troubleshoot live there we
go okay let's bring that there we go
look look at that today I you're
actually now your little keyboard and
stuff isn't covering you up thanks Kuip
you made it better okay so here's what
happened I was screwing off my
overclocks last night and I was running
an untested overclock right now and I
got a bsod blue screen of death for the
i blue screened myself during the live
stream ah this is why friends don't let
friends overclock listen to the listen
to the live stream for me real quick if
you can tell me oh yeah Harold on I do
that some people are saying the audios
like way out of sync which it very well
may be all right I'm gonna mute skype
here just for a second okay and it may
be out of sync if it is yeah sorry guys
there there's like major issues between
all of this technology talking to each
other it's actually not bad i mean it
might be off at out of sync by like a
couple of milliseconds it's really not
that noticeable oh really yeah I think
I'm fine all right well what's funny is
I'm probably in sync you're probably not
right is that happening no no even you
look like you were tiny bit out of sync
but I mean it was like so minuscule
you'd never you never really notice
you're fine Jay you're fine it just
looks like you're in a japanese movie
sink ok so yes i blue screened hopefully
won't happen again oh they're saying
it's good now so i think it might have
just been twitch hey Mitch for every
well I think it's because remember when
we started the stream a few minutes ago
I started up twitch a couple of minutes
before YouTube they probably had
balanced
and right now I was sending info to both
like I just said bambam live-streamed on
both instantly yeah okay all right so
kind of sad that there's only 10 people
in YouTube especially since I normally
have like 60 over there but we have more
people in twitch that makes me a little
bit happy it's okay I'm gonna pull out
the big guns I'm gonna just start tweet
and come watch me now and then at the
end I'm going to put or else die I think
I'll get else die do it so did you hear
that Twitter's going I p 0 ah you know
what to be honest I kind of figured they
already were really they're not know
they just filed for the IPO I would
think as big as they were they would
have I peeled a long time ago well I
wonder if it's gonna be like the
Facebook thing r everyone's like yes
facebook facebook facebook in any what
live in like haha nobody wants to buy it
I think the biggest problem with
facebook though is is oh my god did they
over value I mean not only that they
waited way too long yeah yeah I think I
did not want to have that problem I was
kind of wondering if Twitter waited too
long to though oh did they definitely
waited too long but I don't think it's
really gonna be a kick to their teeth
it's just their growth is gonna be kind
of stunted now like you kind of want to
IPO right before you go through the roof
I kind of feel like they've already kind
of plateaued yeah that's true ah guy's
not going anywhere though I don't know
what the deal is right now with the live
stream on YouTube and why I can't see
the comments but I'm sorry guys I cannot
see the comments if you're on YouTube
come to twitch and talk to us I should
probably put the twitch link inside the
youtube description I would do that
because twitch twitch is for live
streams YouTube's for video here's part
of the problem when you go to my channel
it says live now it says you have no
live events happening right now are you
kidding me derp uh really i buy reviews
on twitch just that ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha I YouTube no he said that he says
that yet he watches our videos up there
ya know you YouTube is great for videos
youtube is great for videos every time
you guys watch one of my videos um an
angel an Angels born so it's good just
do it so as long as you know I've ad
blocker on if you have ad blocker on
then then then you should die
oh yeah I want to hit stop streaming
right there real quick are you sure you
want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
