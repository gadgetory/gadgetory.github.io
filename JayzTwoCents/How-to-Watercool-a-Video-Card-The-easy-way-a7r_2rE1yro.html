we're going to talk about water cooling
your graphics card we're going to talk
about doing it the easy way
for easier way and a lot cheaper
obviously they're using you know
complete custom water cooling loop a big
expensive blocks and stuff we're going
to talk about a product here available
from NV XC this is the successor to the
popular g10 and I've been asked to do
something like this for a long time by
the audience so we're finally doing it
and we're going to be taking the X 42
all-in-one 140 millimeter water cooling
loop and attaching that to our GPU
that's essentially all those hybrid
cards on the market are they're just all
the one water cooling loops that are
fixed on to the GPU and then they call
them you know obviously water-cooled
GPUs because they are but today we're
going to talk about this whether or not
it works and is it worth doing
cooler masters master key Pro Series and
keyboards offer sixteen point seven
million color RGB genuine cherry
switches a variety of sizes as well as
surface mounted controls allowing full
customization without the need for
stand-alone software learn more by
following the link down below so this is
what you get with the ex 42 you get the
140 millimeter radiator and pump you get
the USB cable mounting adapters and of
course 140 millimeter fans now the G 12
is a lot more simple it's nothing more
than a bracket just a regular old
bracket that's designed to allow your
pump to mount to the GPU of course we've
got a 92 millimeter fan that blows down
on your power delivery to try and help
keep that cool and of course your
mounting brackets here for both Nvidia
and AMD so this is designed to work with
I think the advertised 30 different all
in water cooling loops you don't have to
actually use theirs
obviously they sent it you know both of
these together the package for me to
check out it also works with a wide
range of GPUs go to their website to see
what they work with but it looked like
it worked with everything from like the
6000 series AMD up to present same thing
with Nvidia all the way back to like I
think it was the 200 series all the way
up till now maybe even older don't hold
me on that look at their website but
here's what I'm going to do I'm going to
install this day on my EVGA for the win
- it's a 1080 it's the first part of the
ICS and the reason why I'm doing that is
I want to see whether or not we are
going to be doing ourselves a disservice
with things like cooling power delivery
and
memory because here's the thing most
graphics cards today and pretty much all
of them actually today have heat sinks
that are contacting the power delivery
as well as the memory allowing active
cooling so as the air blows through the
graphics cards it's also cooling those
components as well when you do something
like this all you have is the pump
touching the GPU core and then you have
this blend this blandest fan that's
blowing down on bare PCB components
which you're not going to be as
effective as allowing to keep the
transfer to something like a heatsink so
allowing me to actually monitor those
temperatures thank goodness the new EVGA
ACX technology has nine sensors we can
see obviously our GPU temperatures our
memory temperatures and our power
deliveries all being able to see if
there's any sort of negative effect by
cooling our GPU but then leaving those
components out by removing the heatsink
so right now I've actually had this test
going for at least a half hour we're
running a heav'n benchmark 1440p 8 X MSA
a tessellation and all that it turned on
our GPU core is at 74 that's actually
pretty good
but our power delivery looks like 69 69
68 72 and 73 so a range of 69 to 73
let's call that an average of 71 right
set math yeah we'll just call 71 as the
average then our memory is ranging from
54 61 and 73 the closer that memory chip
is to the power delivery so the memory
on that side is hotter that's why
there's neighboring component being
warmed up by power delivery so that's
our baseline so we're going to do now is
we're going to take this install it and
compare it cold comparing two tracks
it's science
so far we've got everything installed
but as you can see we were getting into
Windows but then after a few seconds it
would just go into a black screen and
after if you restart to reinstall the
driver this is what I'm getting now so
I'm not sure if maybe it's on there too
tight I don't know so we're going to now
is where I take it apart and let's see
what it looks like in there make sure
thermal compounds good make sure we're
not crushing it yeah
I'm not full when you've got something
that's meant to be Universal I don't
know if that something that could have
happened so let's find out what I want
to check to is see what's happening with
the thermal compound I want to see how
well it's spreading there's actually
another channel out there a smaller
youtuber by the name of Jose tech
actually watched his video on this
before doing this because he did this
and he mentioned that there was a
thermal paste spreading issue with the
pre-applied stuff I don't know if
there's maybe some sort of physical
damage that might have occurred oh well
okay that's a problem we obviously got
zero thermal transfer there now I did
put the faceplate on here because I
wanted to maintain the faceplate cooling
as best I could for the vrm and the
memory it is actually mounted though
against the PCB so the PCB is not
causing an issue here where maybe the
bracket isn't mounted all the way down
it is indeed touching the PCB so if you
get in there real close you can see that
if you look back here there are no gaps
there so it is indeed touching the PCB
and let me go ahead and stop you right
there what's up guys editing J here
haven't been here in a while the smarter
of the two days recording J is dumb
because while reviewing this footage
it's actually pretty damn obvious why it
wasn't working you see these four tabs
right here yeah these four tabs are
actually contacting the bottom of the
pump which is keeping it from making any
contact whatsoever from the GPU died so
if I actually had my Dremel on hand like
a you know self-respecting moderate any
sort would then
and could attack these pork heads off
and everything would have been fine so
anyway disregard what I say moving
forward about not being able to use the
front plate or the back plate you could
but we still got some pretty interesting
results in this video so keep watching
clearly what we were seeing that was the
GPU going please stop trying to murder
me to death but what I'm gonna do right
now with just these two screws which are
tightened all the way down and don't
want to look and see what kind of spread
we're getting now so yeah as you can see
we're still not getting it's not
actually getting any spread on there
well the only the other thing I could
think now let's take the face plate and
the back plate off it is touching the
face plate a little bit if I actually
had a dremel here do I have my Dremel
here now we take a home loan because I
could have Dremel that out slightly so
it it's down there a little bit all
right the good news is I didn't kill it
I was afraid I might have killed it by
forcing it to turn on over and over and
over again when it was clearly not
getting any cooling whatsoever
and then that white line is never a good
thing but check this out we are
overclocked the exact same overclock
settings though that were on the
air-cooled test the difference is it's
staying at 20 114 megahertz because our
core is staying at 47 see well overclock
so there's no complaint there but
obviously my concerns about the vrm and
memory cooling were unfounded even
though we lost the front plate in the
back plate with all these heat pads
spreading up the heat on this face plate
we lost the pin fin design and all the
direct air flow on there even though we
just have a 92 millimeter fan blowing
directly on bare PCB components check
this out our memories at 49 58 and 64 so
that came down quite a bit and I'll put
up what the previous temperatures were
in case you forgot so I came down quite
a bit from where we were on air cooled
and then our power delivery look at 58
60 to 59 65 and sixty so although it
didn't come down a lot it came down
nonetheless we removed cooling
components just added their airflow and
it came down so that's a good thing
anyway here's the point of this if you
have a graphics card that you like and
you want a water cooler and you don't
want to spend the hundreds and hundreds
of dollars it takes to do a custom loop
you can do a solution like this you can
take the G 12 and you can put your
favorite a i/o on there maybe you have
one laying around or buy one of the
competitor
i OS head to their website to make sure
that's compatible for you go there like
30 they're compatible with this and you
can attach it to your graphics card and
get a massive reduction in temperatures
on something that's already performing
really good like the air cooler that you
get with the for the wind to card yeah
you can even improve upon that the
downside is it doesn't look as pretty
because there's no backplate on there
but we could have made that work if I
had my Dremel here we could have
dremeled out the corners and open that
whole lot more and then it would have
interferes with the bracket that's
something I would recommend doing for
yourself if you're comfortable with that
the other thing too is speaking of for
the wind graphics cards this is a 1080
for the win - it's the icx card we took
a look at last year but if you want your
very own graphics card I'm giving away
right now a GTX 1080p eye for the win 3
this is EVGA triple fan solution again
has icx technology we did a review on
that you guys can check it out here I'm
getting one it is away so this make sure
you subscribe to the channel in the
description of the video I'm linking you
will see all of the information on how
to enter and when we're going to be
announcing the winner on both Twitter
and a video but anyway yeah you guys be
at your very own so there is you guys
tell me what you think it's been running
now for about oh about a half hour or so
and I mean it's not the prettiest thing
to look at the perspective you would
look at it in a case to look better than
I'm looking at it here on this upright
test bench but hey it's water-cooled is
performing well and we're still running
at 20 114 megahertz check that look at
look at that Nick it didn't rattle at
all
it's nice steady core speed 20 114 man
can't get those kinds of speeds with the
1080p eye but this is still a faster
card anyway guys time to go thanks for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the next I'm glad I didn't kill it
though seriously I've been sad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
