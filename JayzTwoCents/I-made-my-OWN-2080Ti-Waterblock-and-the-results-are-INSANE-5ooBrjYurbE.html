some experiments that I'm not ashamed to
admit that I'm pretty proud of but you
know none of those really compared to
what I think we're gonna achieve today
MSI brings ultra-thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz 1080p
panel nvidia graphics and 8th gen intel
cpus make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more and by following the link in
the description below so it's obviously
our TX season and I'm trying to think of
ways to make it exciting and interesting
on what is gonna be probably pretty
repetitive content from all of your
favorite tech youtubers we've all got
different perspectives on the cards but
you know what I've never done around
here is actually taking on my own custom
attempt at water blocking or water
cooling whatever you want to call it a
card that wasn't designed for it so what
we have right here is the GeForce art
yet it's almost a GTX RDX the RDX 2080
from EVGA is a reference PCB based on
the exact you know design that is sent
over from Nvidia what we have right here
in front of me is actually a completely
disassembled 20/80 Ti so the same card
I'm just showing you this you can see
what it looked like before hand in case
you've never seen it massive cooler on
there which does a great job at keeping
the the V RMS and the core extremely
cool we've got a heat plate right here
for the V RMS thermal pads on both sides
here's the cooler I mean this thing just
looks like a cruise ship it's so damn
big and then here is the bare PCB of our
TX but you know there's another youtuber
who does similar stuff to these custom
cooling configs that being mr. Steve
from gamers Nexus now Steve has been
known to take a iOS and do custom
cooling and rig those up and very
jerry-rigged just to see what happens
when you get them on water usually
leaves the PCB or another piece of you
but the vrm is exposed with air cooling
which he says is perfectly fine and I
agree because the thermal limits of them
are these are extremely efficient design
that also cools very well by two
blasting them with air we're gonna take
things a step farther today I am going
to be doing a custom loop and if all
goes according to plan we will also have
water-cooled VRMs by the end of this
video now one of the reasons I'm using
the EVGA card is because I can actually
retain this cooling plate which will
give me better heat dissipation from the
VRMs because of all of these thermal
pads
I think they've clearly learned from
their lesson in the past with the prm's
overheating on the 1080 and 1080 TI
cards but there's this just it's kind of
a stroke of luck I think because when
everything is in place here I push this
down and Manas does that stick good I
mean that's I'm picking it up you can
see that the actual adhesion of the
thermal pads is what's holding the what
entire weight of the card this right
here if you don't recall is my like $20
water block I should was like 17 dollars
I got off Amazon it's copper it doesn't
have an inlet or outlet it's pretty much
just a base plate with all of the high
fin densities milled into it these are
the screws right here that the back
plate screws into so the back plate
screws through here through the back
plate and holds everything down against
the PCB sandwich Inge the cooling plate
and the back plate together on the PCB
so that means that this plate is going
to be mounted to the card now I got
really lucky that this fits in here and
it touches the die and is only about a
millimeter off of this backing plate and
all of the screws actually line up with
these four inner screws to where I can
mount this down to the backing plate so
I don't have to use screws passing up
through the PCB I don't have to worry
about measuring and having it be tilted
so the first thing I'm gonna do is
actually I'm gonna put half of this back
together I'm gonna put the back plate
back on here and screw it all down
because doing it this way also means
that I get to retain all of this cooling
from the back plate now the reason why
I'm not using the screws that come with
the block and have the spring load on
there is they're a different diameter
than the ones I'm screwing down onto
right here that would have made things
just so much easier but in the spirit of
modding and thank God EVGA actually
makes this the threading on these these
nuts like all the way through and
just partially otherwise I would be able
to screw in from this side because this
is normally designed to screw in from
the backside but this is actually
starting to look entirely too
professional in my opinion like this
looks like it was almost intended for
this now this doesn't have to be held on
like super tight we just need to keep it
from moving around so as soon as I get
all four in there then I'm gonna I'm
gonna snuggle up now the reason why I'm
not using the EK water blocks or
something like that is because this
plate that comes with this water block
had more adjustment so that's a big
oblong hole instead of a stunt regular
round hole so the EK water blocks was
too far apart and so it didn't allow me
to actually be able to use that and the
EK water block also would have probably
not fit inside the square allowing me to
still use the plate like I wanted so
this is I think we're looking okay here
but look at that so technically that's
now a water-cooled core right there and
I I think this looks pretty damn good if
I don't say so myself
alright now the other thing I really
want to do here and I mentioned it the
start of this video is I want to
actively cool the VRMs so I've got this
right here this was actually for a
gigabyte x99 motherboard and this was
the vrm cooling kit chipset and cooling
but I've still got this block which was
never used for anything and if you
actually look at the diameter of it it
hangs over the side to where I can
actually access those screw holes so I'm
thinking about trying to mount this down
somehow like this but have to come up
with some sort of a mounting mechanism
now that can screw into those holes and
hold this in place alright so this is
actually coming together pretty well so
this is one of the reservoir mounts that
come with the singularity computer's
reservoir kits and they sent me kind of
a bunch of them and this was actually
perfect so it matches it's gonna be my
back strap right here to hold this on
and the hole spacing was actually
perfect between not the outermost holes
or the innermost holes the bottom hole
and then the inner hole there so it's
gonna stick up a little higher on the
top of the card I'm perfectly okay with
that though that should still clear
anything on the motherboard that's my
only concern now is where this hangs
down will it clear the mother
so I guess I should get a motherboard
now okay miss your oh yeah
there's lots of room there normally this
touches the VRMs directly on a
motherboard so it uses a thermal pad but
because we are now going metal to metal
with a heat spreader here that's
conducting heat through a thermal pad
already I am hoping that there will be
enough thermal cover you know
conductivity I mean doing it this way
and I'm gonna pre spread it on here
because I don't want it to squish out
the sides so I'm hoping we'll get enough
thermal conductivity this way so that it
will be beneficial I'm also gonna be
placing it right on top of where the
actual VRMs are now if you look
carefully in here I know if Phil can get
in there you can see the gray thermal
pad although the heat will spread
throughout this whole heat plate
obviously that's the only surface area I
have to deal with so I'm gonna put that
directly on top of it that way it can
get a more direct path of cooling I'm
hoping that that's gonna be enough to
get the job done
suckers on there tight - they ain't
going anywhere so here's our remember
this from one of our other tests I
remember which one we did maybe was loop
order it was still put together so
here's what we're gonna do you can see
we got really lucky here though the vrm
cooler barely clears the motherboard
right there we got super super lucky so
there is that I'm gonna go ahead and
fill this right now without powering on
the system because if we do have any
leaks which I don't anticipate but if we
did have any leaks I don't want this
powered on obviously this is a 79 80 XE
on an X 299 dark motherboard definitely
don't want to have to deal with that so
quick disconnect to the rescue
well would you look at that alright here
we go first boot nothing's dripping
nothing's leaking gonna hooked up to our
ek a 240 radiator here with our ek pump
that's currently running
all right fingers crossed that we get
video need video 92 D 5 we should be
getting video yeah let's see if any of
this matters now because we're keeping
the vrm cooler we are overall seeing
less voltage on here so we're sitting at
1019 millivolt or now or 1 millivolt
exact or 1 volt exactly we seem to spend
more time at exactly 1 volt or slightly
below which is giving us a better
frequency right here because the VRMs
are staying cooler but what we're able
to see here on some of the tests some of
the scenes inside of this test this will
go all the way up to 20 120 115 and even
bounce off 2130 all right so does 2130
we saw it for a minute and the thing is
we couldn't even get close to that on
air and these fans are not even running
a hundred percent right now I've got
them set to 70 percent they are Vardar
fans on a 240 red more than enough
cooling for this GPU so here's the time
spy extreme results we got a 75 89
graphics score my previous best score
was a 75 54 so minute so many of these
are Ryan's us wear so we just gained
another 35 points graphic scorer on time
spy extreme that's a lot for extreme let
me play this a little bit more see if we
can't get to go just a little bit
farther I may or may not hook the air
conditioner up to this I don't think I'm
going to alright so I flipped around the
fans to their pool instead of push and
we're just going to set the radiator
inside of here okay so the ACS hooked up
to it we are currently idling at 15 C
the cooling plate on here that's
touching the VRM that my water block is
attached to this is clearly working it
is cold it is freakishly cold to the
touch the back plate is cold this is now
a chiller unit and yes we are aware that
condensation is the byproduct of going
below ambient temperature but we are not
anywhere near far enough below ambient
temperature for condensation or do or
dew point or any of that scientific
mumbo-jumbo to be a problem so a
this makes you uncomfortable then don't
do it okay clearly it's working because
here we go we got a 7720 to score that's
almost 300 points higher than the the
Paul's hardware gamers Nexus beef that
we were on the phone with on Twitter
8080 for total score I'm think this beat
Linus but you can see we boosted all the
way up to 2190 max temp under load 30 C
under load no idea that V RMS are but
they're cold let's go ahead and compare
it online let's see what we ended up I
might try one more test Oh No eight
points behind Linus no his graphics
score was a seven thousand seven
thirty-one and mine was a seven thousand
seven twenty two I hate you so much
alright one more test okay so we did one
more test just for the heck of it
playing with memory speed just a little
bit max temp on this room was 29 C so
that gave us a 77 24 and an 8089 I'm not
sure if that's better than our last
score let's take a look
oh we're three behind - we were like
eight before now it's three whatever I
think it's safe to say with the
exception of kingpin and a little little
friendly beef going on between Paul and
Steve and I clearly all you needs an AC
and a custom water block made by the
scrap parts laying around on the shelf
alright guys Steve has probably already
put up his video regarding the AI oh he
put on his card make sure you guys check
that out he's planning on doing some
shunt mods I believe so definitely worth
watching head on over to gamers Nexus
again all this is in good fun and why
the heck not so we're gonna go guys
thanks for watching and as always we'll
see you in the next one don't feel a
little sneak peek to add some fall merch
that's gonna be dropping here very soon
new logos - this is just a old logo but
keep an eye on the merch door alright
now we can go right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
