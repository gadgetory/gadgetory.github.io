caravans racks on we are heading to Las
Vegas rather than one keeps calling it
lost wages I don't gamble I like to keep
my money in my pocket anyway Randy Las
Vegas CES 2015 with a lot of in the
guard a trunk full of camera equipment
at backseat full of computers and
monitors and cables and batteries in
some clothes you know it took me like 50
as a strategy of a near new cameraman
I'm now hiring
it took me of what two days to pack all
of the equipment needed to bring media
coverage it took me 15 minutes to pack
my clothes so priorities
anyway we got about a three hour drive
ahead of us and so I guess we'll do some
cool scenery shots or something I don't
know
Oh
bye
alright guys so this is where I go
shooting out here you can see there's
even some people out there shooting
right now this is Hodge road in Barstow
it's about an hour from my house it's
out here in the middle of a desert
private land you can do like a TV and
quad riding out here on some of the
desert riding trails safe shooting
against the mountain yeah this is where
we go shoot its private land it's no fee
the ground is a little bit later just a
tad I wish people would clean up after
themselves but so yeah it's a nice then
I say about where I live is I'm only an
hour from the desert power from the
ocean hour from the mountains and snow
skiing so yeah this is where I go
shooting I just started show you guys
since we're driving by wish I brought my
AR now
for
checking up on all my social media it's
lunchtime we need a break social media
it's lunchtime we need a break great
from lunch I'm driving still sitting
we're not really breaking
and so full everyone i'm going to say
that maybe pro already
you got a purty mouth right okay hey Jay
can we get some some tunes
what California
ladies and gentlemen we are in Baker
California home of the world's tallest
thermometer believe it's only good
enough to 55 in the summer that thing
peeks out at the top and that hits 130
but that is the world's told us the
monitor giving up Baker California on
the map yeah I've been in the car too
long so we're coming into state line and
this right here is one of the coolest
well there's actually technology to talk
about on this trip this is a clean
energy power plant now each one of those
three towers actually has like an oil or
like a fluid on the top of the tower and
what happens is these are mirrors on the
ground so the mirrors superheat that
tower by redirecting sunlight at it kind
of like a magnifying glass with an ant
you know you said an ant on fire don't
tell me you guys ever did that and so
this super heats the top of those towers
on a sunny day those black panels are
actually glowing white they're so bright
and then it actually heats up that tower
and it creates a clean energy through
steam and so this is really really
really cool and instead of having
individual solar panels on the ground
that would have to be fixed and repaired
they're just they're just metal it's
just reflective metal so they're really
cheap and easy to repair this will this
these three towers I've watched these be
built now over the last ten years
create a ton of power when I was flying
back from Chicago in the summer I took a
direct flight over this area it was in
the middle of the day and those glass
panels were actually like reflecting
light back towards the airplane because
it kind of does like a 360 can of the of
the light and at 38,000 feet those is so
I couldn't look out the window that's
how brightening so yeah that's actually
a really cool piece of clean energy
right there if you guys care about that
sort of thing
so why are we taking over today we're
taking everybody we just drove into
vegas and the very first stop we're
making is to fry's electronics so we
just kind of automatically forgot we
were blogging and went to dinner and all
that stuff who's that guy Drax on the
camera man like that beard epic beard
anyway so here's the vlogging it's not
the logging station the rendering
station here it's got the 24 inch acer
the node 304 with i747 90k a 980
classified by an EVGA in there
coolermaster mouse and keyboard and
stuff that's what we edited the videos
this right here is pretty much all of
the gear will be taking whether it's
going to open that up won't put you on
the spot make you put it together yet
what kind of do a gear run down since
you're the cameraman and all its nessa
foot shot pull your can oh wait that was
inappropriate this whole week is gonna
be full of inappropriate so yeah we
pretty much got everything we need in
this bad boy doesn't have enough clothes
it's waterproof man it's got to have all
that in there so there's all the camera
stuff right there I guess we'll we'll do
a run down to the equipment alright so
Drac sounds going to go ahead and put
this together so you guys can see how
the rig
goes together it's pretty painless I
mean most of its already assembled like
as you can see right there was that
you're Vanna White handle with that that
was like see it's it's pretty much
together I see I never do that to me
again so that's the handle the shoulder
pad there it goes into the teeny teeny
goes in the thingy yeah this is a pretty
extravagant rig I guess for a DSLR but
what do you think like without the
counterbalance on there which is a
four-pound weight it's really not that
heavy is it no like it looks heavier
than it would be so it's nice that it
can be set down you don't worry about it
yeah that's why I have such a big camera
man big big guy so you can carry big big
camera you even look like a cameraman
with a hoodie and stuff because those
guys are always under dressed so now
he's putting on the counterweight now I
can do this whole thing in about a
minute but then again I'm the one that
designed this rig he's still getting
used to it because he's not used it too
much yet so I'm really kind of taking a
bit of a chance here no nothing to worry
about move along folks nothing to see
here I like that I cup it was only a
hundred bucks there we go Sabrina closer
show the so we can show them the battery
so this battery right here where I never
remember the brand name what brand is
that on the better xt power xt power
that what's interesting about this XD
power is it actually does nine volt and
12 volt output and it's a 11,500
milliamp battery I believe some of the
one it was at least 10,000 think it's
11,000 and it actually I used a holga
camera upright straight so we can see
the bottom so we can see the bottom
that's the top
funny so I hope you can really see it
under there that cable right there which
is attached to it that's actually going
to a battery adapter that's running to
the cannon so I'm running my camera off
of that battery on top of the shoulder
pad so we are able to get like an entire
day off of one battery and constant
recording than having to switch out a
bunch of batteries which was a pain in
the ass last year so yeah we get that
will get all that off that one battery
and then show them how the eyecup flips
up and stuff so because it's a
touchscreen on the 70d sometimes you
have to make adjustments to the camera
some of the settings of things so that
actually flips up so that you can still
access the touch screen if you need to
and the cool thing about that is that's
not one of those cups that has that
stupid frame that you have to like
sticky tape to your camera it actually
is attached to a quick release plate on
the bottom which is Mac fully magnetic
like go ahead and pull that off so they
can see it it's actually a really strong
magnet you're gonna have to use a little
bit of force there sir there you go so
show on the bottom see it's actually got
a really strong magnet on there that
actually connects to the plate you can
kind of see the plate right there so yep
it's a pretty good pretty decent Reagan
we got that C clamp with that see arm on
there that's actually really only there
for protection for the camera from
bumping and being hit and stuff
especially on the showroom floor there's
a lot of people people always bumping
into you and stuff the front is a the
matte box there is actually a I forget
oh my god it says right in the front
isn't it program pro aim that's right
it's a pro a matte box now the reason
why I had the matte box on here even
though we're going to be indoors most of
the time it's once again it's a lens
protection that's a that's not a cheap
lens on there so go ahead and give that
matte box of smack like with your hand
like anything that hits that is going to
be absorbed into the 15 millimeter rails
by that matte box turn it sideways
they're so you can see I've got like
protection all around this camera i mean
the cameras granted it's not like a see
100 or an fs700 anything like that it's
not a cheap camera and I rely on this
thing for my living so we are protecting
it as best we can so anyway thank you
dragged on for modeling the cameras here
at CES this is what we bring you
coverage on right now this is being
filmed on Jackson's t3i we're using as a
backup I also have my t2i and an
assortment of lenses and chargers and
cables and so all together we've got
three camera bodies five lenses and yeah

like 16 seconds all right guys it's time
