your system but they can certainly wreak
havoc especially if they've been running
for two years like my parts from skunk
works so today I'm going to show you
kind of my tips and tricks on how to
clean the blocks especially clear blocks
like this so that they can look almost
brand new almost also do a reminder that
our new fall line of merch is now
available I'm wearing my new tri-blend
shirt with the digress logo which is
much smaller and a lot less Kapow on
your shirt and more like peeing over
here so you guys can find the link down
in the description below
got hoodies zip ups all that sorts that
pullovers beanies mugs there's even some
lady shirts down there for your lady
friends so part of upgrading your system
usually means you have some old parts
and stuff to deal with now although
these are the first titan x Pascale
version cards that came out and there
was a new tight next after that and then
obviously we've got our TX 2080 TI and
all that stuff these parts are no slouch
and I want to keep them in tip-top shape
and because they are clear blocks and
we've been using pastel this particular
these particular parts have had pastel
running in them for over two years it's
important to keep them clean so as we're
gonna do today I kind of have a method
that I sort of came up with over all the
years of how to clean this out most
companies would have you believe that
just running some sort of a solvent
whether it be like primo gel system prep
or be the Mayhem's blitz kit is enough
to keep it clean but if you get in there
and look tight at the jet flow plate
right there you can see that there is a
little bit of buildup not much it's
actually really really good for two
years you can see that there's not any
discoloration really up the block but
you can see there's some buildup in the
jet plate you can see there's some
buildup on the threads so we're gonna do
today is we're gonna disassemble it I'm
gonna show you some of my best tips and
tricks on how to clean this and keep it
looking new because the longer you wait
and the more this dries out the harder
it's going to be to clean so you could
obviously get blocks in a lot of
different styles this happens to be the
Nichol plexi so you can see through to
the nickel plated copper base you can
also get it with copper and clear you
can get with copper and acetal which is
just a black cover you can get it with
copper and or nickel and acetal so all
these different variations now in the
past you could just undo these
perimeters screw
right here and take the the front off
with a clear plate off but in this case
you can't because you can see there's a
screw there and as a screw there which
is holding the helping hold the block on
to the PCB which means we're gonna have
to take off the back plate as well
obviously you can see my back plate it's
pretty dirty so we're gonna be cleaning
that up as well so for this version we
have to go ahead and take off the back
plate which really kind of sucks I don't
want to have to do that but fortunately
it's just some Phillip head screws so
there we go okay so this screw right
here is the other one that we have to
get off okay so now we can go ahead and
take off our perimeter screws right here
for the block now most block
manufacturers will be ek XSP see bits
power fantex they usually include the
right allen screw or allen key that you
need to undo this obviously I'm using my
iFixit kit because I like this little
this is a screwdriver handle we're also
gonna loosen up these three screws which
I kind of already did on the I don't
they call this piece right here terminal
I guess so yeah I guess it's terminal
there's tiny o-rings in here that are
really kind of a bitch to deal with and
I don't want to take those off if I
don't have to this is technically the
first block from ek I've ever
disassembled where you had to take the
backplate off normally the block cover
itself doesn't share screws with
anything that passes through the PCB so
this is kind of a first there's still a
little bit of fluid in there as you can
see but because the o-ring just goes
around the perimeter and nothing on the
inside you'll see a little bit of
discoloration where it sort of gets in
between the metal and the plexi and as
we take that off and hold it up you can
still see there's a little bit of
buildup a little bit of dirt right there
the funny part is that built up on both
blocks identically that you I don't know
what that is but it's there all right
we'll come back to the plexi we don't
have a looking it did you tell me what
to do I'm gonna lay out some blue towel
right here and we are going to go ahead
gently remove the o-ring as you can see
it is the proper shape so it'll be a lot
easier to put back in when it's time
here's the flow plate right there this
is what sort of forces the fluid down to
the hottest part of the core and then
obviously that is our core and the fluid
feels kind of it's a little bit of that
left over
primo chill system prep which I use
which by the way if you follow on
Twitter you'd see the before and after
it does it did a really good job at
getting the green out but as you can see
now we've got to actually clean the
metal now this is where my super-secret
weapon comes in but again it's not that
secret cause I've already showed it
before but people keep asking me so
apparently the information hasn't gotten
out which means I keep a really good
secret although I'm sharing it with 1.7
million people I digress it is crest 3d
white and a toothbrush this I have used
on different materials including bare
copper abuse' on the nickel and
sometimes the nickel can turn serve a
golden kind of a tarnished color this
removes it very very well and I've used
it on copper and it takes off that
bluing or that bluish kind of a purpley
color that the copper turns when it
starts to oxidize this stuff is amazing
I figure if it's good enough for your
gentle teeth in your enamel it's good
enough for the blocks and I've been
using it ever since and it does a
fantastic job so I just got a little bit
of distilled water here in the container
and we are going to get our toothbrush
in the container of water apparently and
then we are going to take our toothpaste
and we are going to put a little bit
right there there there wherever you
feel like putting it and we are going to
just let the bristles do their job but
you saw it look like beforehand and
you'll see what it looks like after it's
gonna look like a new block this is
gonna slightly polish it the reason for
that is the crest 3d white has these
little crystals in there which are
slightly abrasive not enough to hurt
anything certainly not enough to go
through the nickel plating but certainly
enough to go through anything that sort
of built up on the block
and it smells nice it smells minty fresh
now if you're not comfortable working
around an open PCB like this you can
Vicis you can take it completely off of
the card I just don't feel like doing
that I don't feel like having to reapply
my thermal paste and all that stuff so
after a little bit of elbow grease
distilled water and some crest 3d white
that is what it looks like so not bad
not bad at all now obviously we're not
going to use the crest 3d white and the
toothbrush on the plexi because as I
mentioned slightly abrasive and we don't
want to scratch it up but as you can see
it definitely has some discoloration
kind of where the o-ring grooves are
we're gonna try and get that out we're
just gonna use a blue towel and
distilled water and probably even a
little bit of my green works
multi-surface cleaner if you've ever
talked to a professional of anything a
mechanic carpenter they've all got their
crazy homebrew life hack methods of
doing things that they've just found
work over the years and that's kind of
what this is for me and there's probably
better ways to do this but I haven't
personally found it and I have been
doing this for years and I've had no
adverse effects at least I know of and
I'm happy with the results so just a
little bit of that as you can see has
already taken away the discoloration
that was forming in the edges right
there and it doesn't look like we
actually have any staining up the block
because we were running UV green in this
and this is a UV flashlight and if I
shine it at the table I'm sure we could
find a spot it's glowing green because I
have spilled fluid on this oh look my
finger see because I've because I've
touched the the bottle that got on there
just from the bottle that's what that is
I swear that's it's from it's from that
right there that I want that you want
remember though is that these blocks do
have machine marks in them as well these
covers so as you kind of look through it
on from that perspective you can see it
looks just a little bit dull in there
and a couple of reasons why one there
are machine marks that are in that it's
not perfect to where the fluid
constantly travels
can actually sort of edge a block a
little bit and that's what that could be
but what I'm gonna do now for the front
side is I'm gonna use to use a
microfiber or something soft a cotton
towel something that's not going to
scratch it because we want to clean it
as best we can you don't wanna get any
fingerprints on the underside because
that will show and as as its down on
your block like that obviously you're
not gonna be able to clean it and as
it's against the graphics card I've
decided I'm gonna go ahead and take off
the terminal here because these fittings
or these threads are pretty dirty in
there and I just cleaned this guy so I
don't feel like having it more water run
down it and have to clean that plexi
again we're want to show you here real
quick is just how tiny these o-rings are
right here
that's how thin it's actually squishing
down for the flow so that's why water
blocks can definitely if you stack up a
bunch of water blocks in series why you
reduce pressure on your your entire
water cooling loop because it squishes
down to go through the jet plate squish
this down to go through here it squishes
down to go through the radiators or for
cleaning this I'm gonna do just like I
did with the o-ring actually I'm gonna
go ahead and submerge the entire thing
in there so that it can sort of soak
those rings and then we'll take our
toothbrush and sort of work it in there
so before I put it back together I'm
gonna clean these three thread holes
right here and as you can see they're
just they're just dirty that I don't
know how these get dirty actually fluid
doesn't even go into those because
they're sealed off here but they get
dirty nonetheless and this is where our
3d white comes in handy once again it's
actually pretty interesting how I do
this so I just put a little bit right
there some in there and then we'll put
some in
they're eventually so I take the screw
now this is the screw that goes in it
right there get it wet and then
literally just thread it you can
actually heal it do you hear that do you
hear the abrasive crystals listen and as
you thread it down and then thread it
back out and as you do this back and
forth you actually will clean those
threads off of any dirt and debris
that's sitting in there so after just
one pass that's what it looks like
normally I'll do it two or three times
just to get as much out as possible but
as you can see that method clearly
cleans out the threads because the
crystals fill in the gap and then as you
turn the screw and back it out it pulls
the dirt out of the hole
alright so pretty back together is
pretty simple it's just the reverse
order of what you took it apart I know
that's always kind of a cop-out on the
manuals when they're like oh just put
about together in the reverse orders
like you start going backwards in the
manual but double-check everything don't
over tighten anything these pieces are
plastic and they will crack and break
and that will ruin your day trust me ask
me how I know how do you know because
I've cracked plastic before now when I
put the blocks back together I like to
kind of just do the opposite corners
first to hold it down as I'm doing that
and making sure the o-ring stayed in its
channel it didn't pop out or anything
the o-ring is creating a seal not
necessarily the tightness of the screws
so just finger tight just finger tight
if you have to if you grip on the
screwdriver and then wrench it you are
over tightening its now I'm gonna put my
back plate back on and after the back
plate is on then I'm gonna clean it
otherwise I'd probably get it dirty
again so spray your cleaner directly on
your rag not on the back plate because
there's no reason to spray it directly
on the card and it's gonna take a little
bit to get this this guy clean it's
gonna take a couple passes but you get
the general idea so as you can see
there's a pretty big difference between
before and after and remember that's
after three days worth of a system flush
running which got a majority of it out
anyway but as you can see the heavy
particles can definitely stick and be
stubborn now if you have any sort of
buildup in your blocks you can
definitely start affecting temperatures
you can affect flow rate and whether or
not you can see in your block like
having a clear top like this doesn't
matter because
you drop your card on the table it's
fine I swear they're durable I got the
durable versions when I bought them but
whether or not you're running a clear
see-through block or a solid top doesn't
change the fact that this is happening
inside of your systems you need to clean
it out because it'll affect temperatures
it will affect flow and that is bad for
any system and obviously it's gonna be
disassembling your system and putting
away your parts and storing them or
reselling them this is something you
need to do because the longer it sits
and the more it solidifies the harder
and less like you less likely it is to
come clean so that's how I do it I'm
gonna do it now on this other block and
my cpu block these are parts from
skunkworks and I have plans for these so
we're gonna go ahead an get out of here
finish this up and hopefully you guys
have found this video helpful thanks for
watching guys and as always we'll see
you in the next one and don't forget new
shirts are available just not this one
because I'm wearing it mine I think
anyone wants to buy miss my old sweaty
shirt you hit the table Phil amateur
cameraman this is actually 1 liter of
alien sperm buy my shit because I've got
the Nickelback plate on there sing back
Nickelback please Nickelback plate on
the plexi Bloch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
