I've been working on the 970 SLI versus
980ti
hybrid versus tight next video so we'll
be getting to that shortly but before we
get there today we're talking about some
audio things we're gonna take a look at
two new products here from creative the
first one being there are our von Urbana
or von Arana
the weird name it's our vinyl I've
headphones as well as they're a 1
portable headphone amplifier that runs
off a battery and or USB power first I
didn't think I really would have much
use for that but believe it or not it
actually fixes a problem I had here in
the tech cave today's video is sponsored
by master op the largest community
commerce platform in the world had to
master off today and suggest something
to be dropped I'm like literally drop it
you know where they're gonna price down
the stuff so once again I gotta give a
huge shout out to mass drop for
sponsoring today's video by sending over
this stuff and of course we only look at
stuff that they're doing drops on so if
you guys are interested in these
headphones in this amp come by the end
of this review then you can look down in
the description you'll see a link to the
drop where you can get discounts on this
stuff the more people that sign up for
the purchases the cheaper it gets that's
the way mass drop works if more
companies work that way but then again
if they did then mash up wouldn't exist
and then it wouldn't be such an awesome
thing so yeah other companies don't do
that just let just like mass drop handle
it now taking the are vaana's out of the
package one of the first things that
you'll notice is it's very light weight
and when it comes to headphones and
stuff that can sometimes be a little bit
of a throw off I mean you kind of think
to yourself well our light and there's
that old adage of well weights equals
quality but that's not always the case
with headphones if you have a real heavy
headphone you'll start to get neck
fatigue head fatigue ear fatigue fatigue
fatigue and all those other kinds of
fatigues and stuff so don't let the
weight of them fool you
they do have swivel ear cups you can
actually lay them flat like that and be
like boy no stand Nick you know know who
would actually do that but whatever
now the cans on here are all plastic but
there are polished black with chrome the
I'm not a fan of polished black I've
said this many times it's gonna
eventually look scratched and scuffed so
if it were more of them
at color it would have looked better in
my opinion but this gives it more of
kind of an elegant feel you've got a
chrome creative raised logo on there and
then you do have leather at ear cups now
the ear cups themselves they do feel
like leather they're extremely soft they
create a good seal around your ears when
you put them on I can't hear anything
now that seal actually makes things nice
and isolating the outside noise so your
music is going to sound better the bass
is going to sound better you're not
gonna have as much interruptions from
the outside world how many people put
these things on just for the sake of
shutting up everyone around them right
am i right you don't want to hear
everyone talking when the old point of
this is enjoy your music and not hear
the crap around you and they are fully
adjustable they go about an inch and a
quarter on either side in terms of
adjustability so if you've got a big ol
head like I do then actually I really
don't have a very big head but if you
have a huge head on top of your
shoulders anyway then these things will
fit nice and comfortably now the
headbands actually not all that big
considering the headphones aren't all
that heavy so doesn't need a huge
headband but it is nice and padded again
with that pleather ette material and
other than that there's not a whole lot
to say about the cans and the headband
itself you do have a lead app a wire
lead coming off of each ear so they're
not going into in one ear and then
through the headband so you're not going
to deal with breaking a wire up here
the downside is if a wire coming off of
each ear which sometimes people don't
like I personally don't like that and
then it's a fully rubberized cable so
it's going to tangle up easier because
it's completely rubber now when it comes
to the specs on this these are 40
millimeter drivers they have a 10 Hertz
to 30,000 Hertz which is it's kind of
interesting because it's wider than the
normal 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz that
people advertise because that's kind of
the average hearing age or hearing age
hearing range of the human ear I was
really interested in how that 10 Hertz
was going to respond
so I ran this these things through base
mechanic to see how they sound we'll
talk about that in a moment
now I'm going to verify this on the box
because I actually forgot yeah they are
32 ohms I didn't want to get that wrong
with the r32 ohms and sensitivity at 1
kilohertz is 103 dB you know plus or
minus so you actually have pretty decent
headphones here they're not that
expensive they're very lightweight and
they sounded really
really good and I did run base mechanic
with these things to test out some of
the different Hertz ranges and I want to
say that right around 30 Hertz is where
we started to get drop-off on in terms
of volume you did have some pressure
level you could feel the base but you
couldn't really hear it much below that
because for whatever the of the can
design the thin plastic you know cans on
here I just wasn't able to actually
reproduce ten Hertz it might be making
some sort of SPL or sound pressure level
at that range but you can't really hear
it one technically it's below the
hearing range at least what they say but
to these just didn't have enough oomph
to really do it well of course sound is
always gonna be subjective we all hear a
little bit differently but I will tell
you me being somebody who's into bass
but prefers audio clarity over bass will
tell you that these things sound
extremely lifelike I listen to a lot of
different types of music on these I
listen to dubstep I listen to rap I
listen to rock country jazz vocals
classic or classical and they just
didn't really seem to have anything that
was out of their spectrum usually rock
or heavy metal when it has a lot of
crash cymbals and things going on tends
to get very very just what's the word
I'm looking for here anyone who listens
to heavy metal knows exactly what I'm
talking about all the sounds will just
kind of smash together and it becomes
hard to pick out anything in the audio
it's hard to to hear the the lead guitar
it's hard to hear the bass guitar it
just starts to sound like noise really
but these were able to really give you
good separation of sound so the bass on
these things although not like beats by
dre level or beats by apple or beats by
whoever bought them this month or
whoever dr. dre sold out - it's not that
level of bass but that's good because
that level of bass often will give you
an imbalance sound where the bass is too
heavy this becomes more fatigue for your
brain to listen to after a while I
thought they were very balanced and very
lifelike the the highs were crisp the
mids were clear and then the bass was
just right in my opinion wasn't too much
bass but it wasn't too little but they
have no inline controls no extra frills
or anything like that it's just a nice
lightweight headphone to keep you on the
go and
to give you nice music in the meantime
now included with them it does also have
an extension cable on here as well as a
audio adapter here for different sized
plugs you have your quarter inch plug
here that goes on to your
three-and-a-half millimeter so you could
use these in some sort of a high-end amp
or something like that and then of
course it comes with a little carry bag
now as far as I'm concerned the star of
the show really for today's review is
the Sound Blaster II one HD audio amp
when they asked me if I wanted to do
this review I almost told them just in
the hip bones don't bother sending the
amp first of all if we're gonna consider
weight and size an indicator of quality
then this thing right here would be
absolute garbage because it's tiny and
it feels hollow quite honestly but this
thing actually really surprised me and I
found an alternate use for it here in
the office I'll talk about that in a
second now it comes with this guy in the
box here is a red I'm kind of confusing
why they chose red but they chose red as
a red extension cable here that you can
use to plug this into your phone
remember this is ultimately a mobile amp
it's a battery-powered amp and it can
clip onto your belt or anything else you
want to clip it on to and then it comes
with a USB cable here with a micro USB 2
standard USB so that you can use it as
an audio amp for your computer and I
thought to myself why would anyone do
that
well one this serves as a charger to
charge up the internal battery on this
which is non-replaceable and it also in
it works as an interface with your
computer where this can work as a
headphone amplifier for anything you
plugged into your computer and that's
the part where I was like why would
anyone want that if you look right here
it actually has two headphone outputs on
this so if you're sitting on the bus or
the school bus or the train or whatever
you do when you're traveling or you've
got someone with you and you both want
to listen to music you can plug this
into your phone or your mp3 player and
then you can both listen at the same
time independently with their own
headphones whatever headphones you
prefer whether it be some sort of an
earbud or a full-on headphone on the
side here has your volume slider so you
can control the volume through the amp
you've got your power switch when you
turn that on you get a little LED
indicator white means you're charged and
when it turns red it means you're Diane
and then it does have a phone call
answer button on the side and it plays
play pause button but also has a
built-in microphone so you can use this
thing if it's clipped on to your shirt
or something
your phone and not mess with your phone
calls and stuff because you could answer
the phone directly through this thing so
it also becomes a smart interface for
your phone which I thought was extremely
awesome but for me personally I had a
problem where people especially local
people won't come into the studio here
and join tech talk with me and I had
fractal Josh here once late last year
and I had a problem with getting I
couldn't get two headphones going
because my amplifier that I use for my
preamp for the microphone does not
feedback audio from the system out to
the headphone monitor so we couldn't
both listen to headphones and it was a
terrible terrible arrangement so now I
can use this thing here to get dual
headphones if I have an in-person guest
and this actually solves that problem so
there you go the are vaana's from
creative as well as their II one
portable amplifier I gotta say this
thing was absolutely amazing and I
thought maybe plugging in two headphones
on this thing would have reduced the
audio level to both headphones depending
on the impedance of them and it didn't
they it did not lower the volume at all
it will probably lower the ball or the
battery life obviously but I even went
as far as to test my AKG k7 xx's which
are an audio grade or sorry I just clip
that in here my bed but those are kind
of a mid-level audiophile type of
headphone that do require a bit of power
I plugged them in directly to my phone
and it was not a good listening
experience it wasn't loud enough it
couldn't create enough bass it couldn't
fill out the spectrum of sound for the
driver the phone just doesn't have
enough power the second I plug this
thing in it went up quite a few decibels
in terms of volume but the clarity went
through the roof so there you go I mean
that doesn't say something I don't know
what does so tell me what you guys think
about this what do you what kind of
portable amp DAC are you guys using tell
us in the comments and of course guys
thanks for watching thanks for master
upto sending me this to take a look at
for you guys and if you guys are
interested in this of course at the time
of this video going live because you're
watching from the future I can't really
help you there then look in the
description you will find a link to the
drop and I get no kickbacks from that
this is just you guys saving money if
you're interested in buying this I don't
get anything out of it other than I get
to keep the headphones and damn damn the
AK
the amp DAC probably just call them well
Dax yes I know they're already called
Dax anyway I'm going to get the heck on
out of here guys thanks always for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
