thread Ripper so I actually add a little
bit of free time today and I figured I'm
gonna work on this a little bit you guys
remember the green coolant I showed you
in the video a few videos ago you guys
were like that looks like boogers and
you got me thinking and I felt really
weird about it and I thought it kind of
felt like boogers I was gonna go with
green in this now I can't decide between
this awesome silver color which
unfortunately is not UV or this blue
color which is UV man do you want to be
cooler you want to be more desirable
well you're in luck because right now
you can own your very own Jay's two
cents wag and immediately be the cool
kid on the block max out your sex appeal
by following the link down below so I
think they both equally look good in
here
so the idea between this build here is
we were kind of going for more of like
an alien sort of theme which is why I
was thinking the green the orange is
gonna go I'm gonna be painting this
panel here so there won't be any there
won't be any color if I went with the
silver it gives it a very monochromatic
or like a symbiote look somebody on
Twitter I forget who said it but you get
credit where if I go with the silver
then we'll probably call it symbiosis
symbiote or symbiotic either so that's
the whole idea with this color which is
very monochromatic that'd be very there
would not be a lot of color in that
which would be kind of neat I'm gonna
make some white LEDs in here cuz I do
have UV LEDs right now cannot make up my
mind between the blue and the silver
fortunately I don't worry about that
today because we have accents here black
silver and sort of a gunmetal color
we've got some custom powder coated
parts here that were sent over again by
primo chill so the revolver fittings
here because obviously we're doing card
line I do hardline right these are the
custom powder coated fittings for this
build so check that out
that and look you guys can tell by my
finger yeah I did the finger spreading
technique when it comes to that sounds
dirty the fingers writing technique when
it came to putting on the thermal paste
because I reapplied it but look at this
look at that color alright so then if
you put it on the block so you can kind
of see now there's a there's quite a
color theme for this that accents really
nice and then we've also got radiators
which were also custom powder coated to
match the sort of theme we have going on
right here so this is a gunmetal II I
don't know the exact color of the powder
they use but they specially
powder-coated these for me we're gonna
have a 360 there as well so what I'm
gonna do today is I wanna see how far I
can get on this I'm going to get the
radiators installed the fans installed
and then yeah I've got some decisions to
make because this isn't gonna be like
the craziest build in terms of like how
hard it is to put together I am using
the X 1200 on the power supply but that
I'm gonna be getting rid of some of the
logos and stuff on here by adding some
carbon fiber to it right I probably heat
gun off this sticker and then I think
I'm gonna do carbon fiber accent over
the AF 1200 a logo so you can kind of
see how that's gonna look alright so it
almost that's more of like a racecar
theme doesn't it I also got a bunch of
fittings once again sent over but for
performance pcs man those guys hooked me
up and they keep these videos coming but
so yeah the typical usual suspects here
we've got some bits power fittings
because they are like the best but what
I don't like obviously is bits power
likes to stamp every single fitting with
their gold so I'm thinking that I can I
need to get some acetone I think I can
acetone that off remember how I got the
rest of the reservoir combo thing that
was way too big yeah and like I said in
that video I emailed them and was like
please help because I'm stupid
they got me hooked up here once again
the only problem is they made up they
made a blue or a green LED for me
because I had asked for green because it
lights up in the reservoir but now I'm
not going with green so if I can be able
to use
but anyway here is the smaller one which
is so cool it's got the deef I've
already in there I need to take care of
these stickers that is ugly right I mean
that's gotta go I think I'll probably
wrap the bottom of this in carbon fiber
just like I did back in my 900 e build
remember that yeah I wrapped in a carbon
fiber this will end up fitting now
that's nice
see before it was like gonna go all the
way up here and smash into the red I
also went with this particular one
because we've got three ports on here so
you see how we have these three ports
that allows me to have my in my inlet my
outlet as well as a drain court and it
works perfectly so this is facing this
way which means that I'll be able to
either use it as a return line or
whatever we've got one facing out to the
side a little bit so I could use it to
the GPS or whatever then this one faces
perfectly for me to have a dream port on
there I would have loved to have put a
thicker rad in here I wasn't sure if it
was gonna fit or not but now I see that
I could have gone there like a 45 no
thick red but I think we'll be alright I
think we have more than enough cooling
especially since they're completely open
right there's open air flow the best
cooling scenario you could possibly ask
for when it comes to radiators I was
actually starting to lose some interest
in not this build but the case I think
the more time went on I'll Cali yeah
maybe it is just a really big ugly case
like people think but I think I need to
just see this through because I had a
vision and I think I think it'll I think
it'll work you have to see it through
because it goes through some ugly stages
before it reaches that bad a stage I
don't have custom cables or anything
like that figured out yet either
I was actually think about reaching out
to cable mod but I don't know how long
it will take them to make them my usual
cable guy he's just so dang busy I'm not
gonna bother him and there's something
else I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my
corsair dominator memory and this is 32
gigs worth right here he's still the
white tops on for when I did the cable
mod memory modding kit video but these
are the black ones someone do the black
tops on there which I think will look
really really good mama always said it
had a face for radio gonna be careful
when you're tightening these two into
like acetal or plastic or plexi or
whatever they're easy to strip it's just
plastic so just get it snug remember
those o-rings on there the o-rings are
what's giving you the seal yeah I think
going with the
the powder-coated callers was definitely
the way to go
okay I'm gonna need those fans that were
simply goodbye don't I don't even know
it did that look at that it's an air
brake yeah that yeah and then it's got
these like screws would stop it look at
that well dude I didn't even know it did
that huh
I'd be awesome if I could motorized that
huh yeah tell me that does it look like
see now you know why we were going to
sort of like an alien sort of a
spaceship II theme I did not even know
it did that and still it's wobbly
there's no glass on it with it so bad
ass I could actually like even put this
on top of the power supply and I can
make the wires and stuff look like yeah
like spaceship since in like space
movies always have like exposed wires
and crap yeah oh this is cool so this is
that thing
the dhimmitude they call it so it
actually uses like the memory to
interface with the m-dot tube so we
might use this thing you know we'll see
so the m dot 2 is going here and then
this goes into here like that
so then that becomes our iNDOT to
interview I guess it just depends on
what it looks like it how clean it is at
the end of it I think like the more like
full of PCB we can make this the more
themed it would be what do you think
alright PCBs everywhere so I just want
to make sure that have the expansion
card for the fans which I'm going to
need cuz these these new Bart our Evo
fans from ek are actually zero rpm
capable there's zero rpm fans builds
never go without problems you know that
that's what makes the build the build
normally radiator manufacturers will
supply two different science crews ones
that are long enough to go through the
fans where the fan is 25 millimeters so
I'll give you one that's long enough to
go through the fan and then you have
some thread to match your radiator the
problem is if you have to go through a
case like this which is very common
right so you'll go through the fan
through the case and into the red but
they didn't give you they don't give me
a long ones like that so now I've got
two source screws and I'm not sure I
even have what here's an example what I
was talking about so I believe these
come with alpha cool rads and they give
you a long one and a short one in a
situation I'd just described so there
they are right there alright you see the
difference in length I want to stop
rolling around for the situation in
which I just described the problem is
now I don't have enough of them to do
what I need to do I need four eight
twelve sixteen twenty I need twenty of
them can we add printing decals on my
list of things I suck at okay what I'm
also test fitting here is whether or not
I want the fittings face down or the
fittings face up this is this is what I
love about this case though is it's so
different this is why these types of
projects take so long like when you're
just building like a regular case like
this plug-and-play
Orthodox methods of water cooling and
crap like that it was pretty quick no
it's perfect
Wow so I can do that look at look in the
background there
okay glue exhaust pipes I should we
should do the OCD build we're like
everything that could possibly true like
just trigger like amongst the PC guys
who were just like no no you cannot have
your fan facing that way
no all the labels must go the right way
I just would love to do a bill Patrol
build where it's just like how angry can
we make the audience like more so than
they already are at me hey I love this
shirt thank you that is the coolest
looking radiator set of everything like
the grills because it's like totally
exposed this video sucks
excuse me for being a venturi so I've
got to take off these two screws here
and one two three in order to get the
orange panel off it's this gonna be one
of those screws that like make the whole
thing fall apart or I emphasize pink
eczema hey you got their new eggs Momo
this is one of those times when the ball
comes into play all right we got the
front red on the top red on at the
orange piece off I think we're good
there a lot of clearance I could have
gone with a thick red on the front and I
could have gone thicker with the right
on the top again
I think I'll be okay i disassembled the
reservoir here because I'm pretty sure I
can make this work these like the powder
coating like matches perfectly with the
case
now this is the best part about having a
silver or black sharpie is that you can
actually mark the holes so there's the
two holes we have to drill right there
and then I can just like to wipe it off
of here
little bit alcohol acetone spit whatever
so yeah did you say you Bryan's shy okay
that just puts a dent in it right so the
drill bit doesn't like walk oh that's
good do a couple times like that
a little dent at least we'll always
remember how that got there
well let's just look at it you'll want
to see something like that I said well
would you just look at it like you just
got a look at it
shadow ed Bassmaster if everyone thinks
I suddenly just went stupid or stupider
than normal maybe new custom now look at
this as I cut my vein it has to this is
a really dull blade I think because it
can't cut the tape while holding up and
let that belly tell it
is it Nick carbon-fiber there looks a
lot better I think the system really
starts to look like it comes together
once you get the radiator or the
reservoir in there the reservoir is like
to me is like always the idea it's like
the centerpiece yeah that in graphic
arts I'll have any fucking triggers
suddenly the motherboard doesn't fit in
there anymore guys we have a problem
only doing it right there right there
you know the worst part about this quite
honestly it's going to be the cable
management is going to be super hard
part of me even kind of wants to leave
this whole side piece off you know that
but I won't know until I get like if I
put the glass on and I see this it's
like just open we'd get quite as far
today that we've liked I would like to
have also gotten the GPU blocks in there
you guys know when I'm doing these
builds are usually multi partners anyway
that can't be helped can't rush
perfection but I still think this is one
of the neatest features right here but
at least we got the reservoir in there
the hardest part about this build the
quality is gonna be the wiring
management cuz look at the backside
right this is just the fans just the
pins and the pump front stuff believe
that this is the kind of build that
really deserves someone they'll go in
and measure every single wire and recent
leave and rewire everything but I don't
have the skill for that I still have to
run these down to the bottom the front
panels come up anyway and then the other
part of the SSD mount which I might not
even leave that in there because I'm
thinking I might not even put like SATA
drives in this at all I think I might
just do pure MDOT to storage in this
because then it's even cleaner without
any SSD SATA power or any of that crap
going on although I do have to write at
least one molex power because of this
pump
yeah its molex well you guys tell me the
comments what you're thinking don't
forget votes blue or silver a lot of us
are starting to think blue for just that
really poppy contrast silver has that
whole like symbiote sort of a thing
going on in there hey both
are equally as awesome so that said guys
I'm gonna go thanks for watching I'm
gonna make Nick flip this mess there's
always I'll see you the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
