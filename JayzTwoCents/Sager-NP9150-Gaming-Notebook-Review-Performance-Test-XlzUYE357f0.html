and today I'm gonna bring you a review
of the Sager 9150 gaming laptop this bad
boy weighed in at about three grand so
today we're gonna find out just what
kind of performance can you expect after
shelling out that kind of cash
alright guys so let's get right in it
this Sager comes fully loaded from the
factory with almost every option
available the processor is an Intel i7
38:20 QM graphics are powered by NVIDIA
GTX 680 m 4 gigabyte model the display
isn't gorgeous 15.6 inch LED 1080p with
a 95% color gambit for memory we've got
16 gigabytes of ddr3 1600 megahertz hard
drive we have a huge crucial m4 512
gigabyte solid state drive how much is a
model like this gonna cost you twenty
nine hundred and seventy four dollars
that kind of money you could buy a small
car even some politicians these days so
get ready to melt some plastic buying
this bad boy I'm pretty impressed with
the build quality of this computer the
case is real sturdy for being plastic
it's very strong it doesn't creak or
crack when you hold it the hinges on the
monitor are firm they hold their
position the screen doesn't wobble it's
got an overall very solid feel
size-wise this case is 14 point 8 inches
wide and 10 inches deep the front of the
case is 1.4 inches high and the back of
the case is 1.7 inches high and weighs
six point eight three pounds including
the 8 cell battery the outside of the
case is rubberized which gives it a nice
grip in a nice feel does it feel like
you're gonna drop the thing or carrying
it to them from a land party or to your
car but the problem with that is it
collects dust really bad as you can see
here in this video
dust is flying by I live in the desert
too it's dusty it's windy and it's just
collecting all over the finish of this
computer it's gorgeous but if you live
in a dusty area like I do it's really
gonna get on your nerves and it doesn't
even want to wash off very easily or
wipe off because of the rubberized
material really makes the dust stick to
it for security this model came with a
fingerprint reader it was pretty easy to
set up the software is intuitive it was
very easy to use and testing the
fingerprint reader seemed pretty
accurate the sound in this unit is
provided by Onkyo it sounds wonderful
but we'll get more to that a little bit
later during the demonstration
for connectivity on the left side of the
computer we have an I Triple E 1394 a
firewire port we have a 10 100 1000 Mbps
LAN port we have 2 USB 3.0 s one of
which is a powered USB we have an eSATA
3.0 USB combo port followed by a
standard SD card reader on the right
side we have our blu-ray DVD combo drive
standard analog as well as optical audio
connections a USB 2.0 and a Kensington
lock on the back of the case we have a
display port 1 point 1 we have an HDMI
1.4 a with HDCP and a DVI connection the
keyboard here feels pretty good even for
gaming it's easy to type on even though
the keys lack that reverse dome effect
where you can easily Center your finger
on the key it wasn't so bad I did
fat-finger a couple of times I did bump
the wrong key every now and then wasn't
too bad some people might be a little
thrown off by it the keyboard is LED
backlit and the colors can be changed
through software that's included with
the laptop has some pretty nifty effects
some waves and blink some lights you can
change the color in this video here I
just had the wave effect on and I had
set the three different quadrants of the
three quad quad 3 I need to go back to
math anyway the colors were very
customizable and it's definitely going
to get you noticed if that's your thing
now take a listen of the keyboard clicks
and the fans in this computer
now there is one issue I do have with
this keyboard if you look closely on the
right side of the keypad you'll see that
Enter key plus key and the minus key are
all slightly raised compared to the rest
of the keyboard now not only are they
slightly raised but the right side of
each of those three keys appears to be
higher than the left I'm inclined to
think this is some sort of a assembly
beef echt I don't think it's a factory
defect it feels like it's not securely
attached when you push down on those
keys there's a lot more flex than any
other keys on the keyboard some people
might say this is a little bit of a
nitpick but if somebody were to pay
$3,000 for a laptop they have the right
to nitpick in my opinion the microphone
in this PC is placed in a very strange
location it's located between the keypad
and the spacebar so if you're typing or
you're clicking on the mouse or you're
moving your finger around the trackpad
it's gonna pick up all of those noises
unfortunately my brain completely
crapped out and I did not get a
recording with that I should have I
didn't I know I hear you all saying you
are horrible reviews because I didn't
take a recording with the mic and
unfortunately I also did not take a
video with the webcam at very limited
time with this unit so I wanted to get
as much as the printed details out of
the way as I could but when it comes to
the microphone and you're planning on
using Skype or any other voice chat
system without using a headset or an
external mic expect to have some very
unhappy people on the other end they're
gonna hear every movement you make
they're gonna hear every touch you do on
the keyboard it's just really obnoxious
solid-state driving this thing is really
fast and the moment I push start to the
moment windows is up I don't have time
to get a glass of water
buuut time is right around 25 seconds so
I don't know about you but it's probably
not good to time a potty break around
starting up your computer okay so the
moment we've all been waiting for
how does it actually perform I went
ahead and loaded up the free edition of
3d mark 11 it's in performance mode go
ahead and watch this video I've sped it
up four times to make it not take quite
as long
so no claiming of shenanigans saying I
sped up the video because I'm telling
you right now I sped up the video
all right that's not too bad at 61 63
all factory of settings nothing touched
straight out of the box and I want to
see just how much we could actually do
with this so I went ahead and installed
afterburner and after burner if you're
not aware is a overclock utility for
graphics cards most people use them on
the desktop most laptops don't even have
access to any of the controls for the
GPU and I got a plus 135 megahertz for a
total frequency of just under 900
megahertz and a plus 200 on the memory
and this is what I got broke 7000 with
the laptop that's incredible so let's
see how this actually performs in real
life because synthetic benchmarks are
only good for a number but how does that
actually equate to the gaming experience
so let's take a look at the preset video
options we've got everything is set to
hi aunt isotropic filter is set to 4x
motion blur is on anti aliasing post is
on high that's fxaa for anyone not
familiar with Kepler we are running 60
frames per second or 60 Hertz 1080p on
this laptop the sound is very crisp very
clear they set to headphones and switch
that
I fine and yet stereo mode is on we're
just gonna leave like this see how we do
let's turn on me
we're going to turn on the on screen
they're you so as you can see we run off
the bet camera here a little bit we are
sitting pretty damn close to 60 frames
per second on high settings on a laptop
people there we go I am seeing 60 frames
per second on high settings I don't know
about you guys
close-quarter 64-player map
nobody could pick up the the fan sounds
they're not my first impressions here is
this is extremely smooth I would
actually be very hard-pressed right now
just to tell you any differences I see
between my desktop running a 680 GTX
overclocked or 1.3 vs. this laptop I'm
running a 680 m very smooth there's no
pausing stuttering whatsoever aiming
aiming needs an improvement
alright guys what we've done is we went
ahead and changed all the settings from
high to ultra vsync is on so let's see
how it does still very fluid very smooth
sticking right 60 frames per second here
say we did with explosion now we drop
down into the mid 40s on that explosion
wasn't extremely noticeable though
I definitely have to give this computer
the respect that it deserves this thing
is a beast it's fast it's cool its
efficient it's quiet it can play any
game you can throw at it from today's
standards and probably last you for a
couple of years to come
alright guys that's all I've got for
