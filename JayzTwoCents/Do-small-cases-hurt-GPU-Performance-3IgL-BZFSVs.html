remember this PC I built a couple weeks
ago a little form-factor 1800 X build
just for fun the speed build how fast
could I build it yeah plenty of you guys
were faster whatever I digress guys
we're gonna see what happens when you
take a small form-factor PC like this
put a radiator on the front which a lot
of people think is a no-no and then put
a big powerful graphics card in there
that's almost touching the mid plate and
see what happens with temperatures wet
stock speeds overclock speeds we're
gonna block off some airflow and see
what happens and then we're gonna put in
a Founders card and compare I think
things are improving now in terms of
case design to where you can actually
get away with this and not be stuck with
these you know standard loud blower
coolers so for the sake of science we're
gonna test all this today cooler masters
new master keys m'kay 750 mechanical
gaming keyboard features a minimalistic
distraction-free design Cherry MX
floating key caps magnetic removable
wrist rest USB type-c in an on-the-fly
system with no software making it easier
for you to game smarter and not harder
to learn more check out the links in the
description below now obviously we want
to put as much heat into the graphics
card as we can for this test if I put it
on 1080p medium settings the graphics
cards never gonna be fully loaded and
the test results will be skewed so what
we've done right here we've got a 35
inch 34 40 by 1440 P 100 Hertz panel
that is running heaven benchmark with
eight times MSAA we've also got
tessellation on extreme and the ultra
preset I've also got my overlay here so
you could see what the temperatures are
we've had this test running now for
about 20 minutes and it looks like our
results have settled on 7dc now the
ambient temperature in this room right
now is about 69 degrees Fahrenheit so
it's fairly cold in here
so that's something to keep in mind as
the temperatures of your ambient you
know room temps increase this would
increase to but this is actually quite a
ways below where would start to thermal
throttle on in video which is right
around 94 C now the reason why
temperatures matter is because as the
GPU gets hotter the core speed is going
to slow down which is what we've got
right here so you can see it's GPU boost
3.0 is in full effect we are well over
the base clock on this which is about
sixteen hundred and eighty
megahertz we've got a self overclock
happening because it recognizes we have
a lot of temperature Headroom available
to us now I didn't do any overclocking
on this yet we haven't touched the power
sliders but what's interesting about
this setup right now for our first test
as you can see we've got a EVGA graphics
card in there that has two fans that
bring in air from the front so when you
put it in the small form-factor like
this and you put it near this mid plate
which is kind of common now that you see
in many cases to block off the power
supply in the cables we've only got
about five or well it's slanted a little
bit so we've got less airflow in the
back than the front it's kind of you
know sagging a little bit but it's
actually not able to pull up a whole lot
of air right there now even though we
have a front mounted radiator we're not
going under a lot of CPU load so we're
not putting much heat into that red but
we are obviously decreasing the amount
of intake air and if you look at the
front of this case - it is a solid front
panel right here
that's only pulling in air from these
you know perforations on the side so
we've we've got a pretty good amount of
airflow but this is still not the most
ideal which is obviously a good for this
test we want to see what happens under
the less than ideal situations now the
thing about the NZXT 200 eye is the fact
that it has these in the mid plate it
has these holes that are there now
they're not super dense so it's still a
decent amount of air that is being
blocked off but I kind of want to see
what happens if we now take those holes
and block them off so I got a piece of
tracing paper and I'm just gonna block
off those holes because I think a lot of
case manufacturers have a solid panel
there at least based on what I've seen
so if we take this now and it can't get
any of that air from down into the
shroud I'm curious as to how much the
temperature is going to change now
ideally you wouldn't want to you know
choke off your graphics card but not all
cases have that perforation in fact most
of them it's a solid panel so obviously
we want to see what the worst case is
going to be immediately you can see
we've already shot up almost three see
though is sitting about 71 and in a
matter of about 60 seconds we've come up
to 73 C and our core clock has already
started to drop a little bit so we're
still sitting at the nineteen eleven but
we're dropping down into the higher to
mid 1800s
so we're just gonna let that go for a
little while now maybe we'll let it kind
of equalize for about ten minutes and
we'll come back and see where it's at so
it's been running for about ten more
minutes now and hasn't really changed
that much so we gained about two to
three C which I guess makes sense given
the fact that we blocked off the air
obviously but what we're thinking now is
that the fan curve made up for it you
could see where the temperatures shot up
right here this is where we put the
paper in this is where we came in here
to add our fan curve our max fan speed
was 58% and that's still pretty
inaudible for the EVGA cooler and if you
have an aftermarket graphics card that's
pretty much what you can expect so what
we're gonna do now that we're into the
overclock side of things Before we jump
over to the founders card I'm not gonna
actually add more megahertz to the card
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to remove
the power limit or at least raise that
up really high because that's now going
to allow the graphics card to just
overclock itself even further so if we
come over here you see our power limit
set to 100 our temp limit set to 84 if I
just max this out and I don't touch core
clock or memory clock we will see an
increase in heat but we'll also see an
increase in core clock you'll notice
we're not fluctuating now nearly as much
so until this temperature starts to rise
to wherever it's P states are in its
BIOS this won't start stepping down but
more importantly that's going to stay
more consistent which hopefully now will
create more heat so we're gonna let this
run for another 10 minutes with the
paper in there we're gonna see what the
max temperatures are and then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna take the paper
out and see what it comes back down to
so it's pretty much where we stabilize
it's bouncing between 73 and 74 the fans
been increased slightly though went from
58 to 60 percent I could be wrong but I
believe that's the max fan speed for
factory on this EVGA card so I don't
think it'll go faster than 60 but we
still are locked here at 1911 so we came
down one speed step these temperatures
are actually really good because it's
think about this we've got a small
form-factor case we've got these
perforations on the side sure it's fully
open on the bottom but it's not pulling
in air directly it's coming in through
the sides of the case we've got a front
mounted radiator and we've got a non
blower style cooler sandwiched up
against a mid plate that's blocked off
now literally everything people say
don't do it we're doing it and our
temperatures are actually doing really
really well so I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna pull the paper out and I'm gonna
see if we come back down to 70 and if
our fan speed comes back down I think
the 74 see that we're seeing though is
the fact that the room temp has come up
ever so slightly and I think that that's
what that is because as you bring up the
ambient temperature in the room your
temperature is in your graphics cards in
your system and your CPU are going to
rise incrementally with the ambient
temperatures so I just pulled out the
paper and we're gonna just let this run
now and see if it comes back down I
think it will interesting only enough or
maybe not we stayed at roughly the same
temperature didn't really fluctuate much
but check it out we're staying at a
slightly cooler temper
and we stayed slightly higher on the
core clock and it's not bouncing around
so obviously the perforations in this
particular case are doing something and
blocking them off didn't actually seem
to make much of a difference so I went
ahead and decided I'm not going to run
the founder's card in there because we
already know that this is gonna be less
affected by the case than a card like
that and the air coming out of here is
definitely warm but now the ultimate
test right well J you should take this
card and put it in a big case and see if
you get the same results what I'm gonna
kind of do here is I'm just gonna take
off the side panel open this up so no
longer is the intake or the overall
volume of this chassis going to affect
the temperatures of the GPU we are just
gonna see now what happens as we let it
just sort of have all the air
breathe my friend breathe and I'm gonna
kind of prop this up a little bit here
so that we're not sagging and see if
that makes any difference right oh god
don't go in the fan oh that way
like all the way back there shut up Nick
uh can you give a screwdriver something
for me from the toolbox right there
something long and cylindrical and on
the side but it should work
it's not that far in there well we did
like point seaside up so that would have
gone in here right into the well guys
we've taken the side panel off and
nothing really changed you can see we're
still sitting at 72 see 99% utilize
19:24 core and 57% fans B I thought what
would happen is the fan speed would slow
down to maintain these temps in this in
this utilization but no you can feel the
heat actually pushing off the side of
this custom card I mean remember when
you're doing the blower style card like
this the air gets pulled in an exhaust
every bit of that air out the back and
so this is less impacted by whether or
not you have good chassis cooling
because all of the cooling happens here
as long as it's got air going into it
the rest has happening here these cards
require the chassis to exhaust all of
the hot air so even a small form-factor
case like this with the graphics card
only a few millimeters from the mid
plate even when you block off that mid
plate and have the side panel on we're
pretty much the same as you see right
here with this very ideal open side
chassis and the air is actually pushing
out from this graphics card and the
chassis is no longer affecting the
cooling pacifically we use the h 200 i
from NZXT for this test this test but i
think they did a great job at keeping
this chassis nice and cool I'd like to
revisit more tests like this where we
test other chassis for this sort of
thing so why don't you guys do me a
favor why don't you put in the comments
below a chassis that you think is
notorious for killing off air flow to
graphics cards well test it and if it's
true maybe we'll modify it and see what
it takes to get things breathing again
anyway guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching make sure you comment down
below and let me know what you thought
and as always we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
