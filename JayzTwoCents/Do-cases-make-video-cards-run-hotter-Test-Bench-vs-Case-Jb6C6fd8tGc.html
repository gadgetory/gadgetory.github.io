that's been quite the discussion taking
place on Twitter and in the comments
section on my 1070 video regarding open
air test benches like this guy right
here oh jeez
he doesn't really know how heavy this
thing is versus real-world testing in a
case like you see behind me on graphics
cards and whether or not it makes a
difference it's quite the split decision
with I'd say about half the community
saying the case is not the best way to
do the testing because there's too many
variables and then my position of
allowing the open air test bench to be
the best way to do the testing because
then the only thing limiting the
temperatures of the card is the cooler
itself which is the only way to do a
complete cooler test so what we're gonna
do today we're gonna do a single
graphics card we're use my MSI gaming x
8g a 1080 card we're gonna put it in the
test bench then we're gonna put it in
the s3 forty case here with two intake
fans two exhaust and a front mounted
radiator and see whether or not the
temperatures go up in a closed case it's
not to be good the new z170 classified
motherboard from EVGA features eight
phase PWM four-way SLI support along
with top notch components to offer
gamers and enthusiasts more of what they
want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more now
before we get into today's test video
you guys have to be aware of two
different types of coolers on the market
you've got the reference style cooler
with boat which both AMD and NVIDIA use
where it's got a turbine here that's
gonna pull air in and push it out and
it's not going to rely on the case
whatsoever to exhaust any of the heat it
just relies on the case applying air to
the card so that it has air to basically
suck through right here and blow it it
sucks and it blows and on the flip side
you've got a card like this with
multiple fans pretty much all the board
partners come out with the custom
coolers like this which takes the air it
swirls it around in the heatsink it
sends it off into the atmosphere or in
the case in this instance here where the
case is then responsible for taking the
heat and sending it out into the room so
the argument has been I'm gonna leave
reference cards out of this reference
cards our best case scenario when it
comes to case testing again as I said it
doesn't rely on the case to exhaust the
heat but when it comes to a card light
this are you actually my computers went
to sleep I swear it didn't die so the
argument the community recently has been
whether or not GPU testers like myself
who do testing in an open air test bench
are doing the community a disservice by
not showing what temperatures would be
like inside of a case so what we're
gonna do today is we are gonna take my
MSI gaming x8 G which is a 1080 card
we're gonna put it in the open air test
bench go through 20 minutes of looping
heaven benchmark with settings max and
then we are going to look at the numbers
see what happened with GPU boosted at
thermal throttle what happened to the
temps what was the fan percentage speed
and then we're gonna take it put it in
the S 340 case here which has an front
mounted radiator at H 100 I to intake
fans and then it's got two exhaust fans
and we are going to see with what I
consider to be one of the worst-case
scenarios here with a front mounted
radiator and a closed mid tower case
whether or not the temperatures go up or
they stay the same or they go down in a
case like this some arguments have
actually been that cases Canon crease
the efficiency of cooling in a graphics
card and bring the temperatures down so
I guess we're gonna find out whether or
not that is the case I say the case but
I mean the situation you you get what I
mean
this loop has been running now for
exactly 20 minutes and I want to show
you what you're seeing here it's kind of
hard to see because of the you know the
gray buttons behind there but we'll look
from left to right the graphics card is
currently running at 72 C in the open
test bench with fans blowing directly on
the card even I want to point that out
ninety-eight percent load on the GPU
that's gonna bounce between 98 99 57
percent fan speed eighteen hundred and
thirty-five megahertz core clock that's
kind of a sneak peak for you guys that
are waiting for this msi review I
promise it's coming soon and you'll see
why I was taking so long when I do the
review and the core voltage is running
at a constant one point zero six two
volts so I'm gonna go ahead and whip
seroma I'm go ahead and exit the test
right here and we'll take a look at the
chart we're gonna do this all in one
clean cut here because I don't want
anyone being like out there's J being
all kinds of shenanigans and stuff
no no shenanigans here so here is that
test run right here for 20 minutes now
let's go and start but start at the the
top right here the GP
temperature minimum of 43 doesn't really
matter cuz that card idols without the
fans on but the GPU temperature here set
as you can see as we go across the chart
here 71 72 73 72 71 72 71 72 71 69 71 72
71 so you could see it is between 70 and
72 in fact I'm gonna say between 71 and
72 we saw 70 once and 69 once in the
middle of the test fan speed highest it
went to what's 57 2 % fan speed so you
can see right there 56 57 it's pretty
constant and then our core clock as you
can see again a constant 1835 just all
the way across the test it started out
at 1873 and then 1860 and then 1835 and
that is where it stayed and then voltage
as you can see right here was pretty
much a constant 160 to 1 500 and then
160 to the entire rest of the test once
temperatures and everything equalized so
there you go there's our baseline test
here with the open air test bench we're
gonna go ahead take the exact same
graphics card all factory settings I'm
not touching the damn thing and we are
going to stick it inside of the NZXT
razor case that I've got which has to
120 millimeter intake fans and to 120
millimeter exhaust fans with a
front-mounted radiator on a Corsair h
100 i so i already showed you guys
that's the test rig we're gonna put it
in there and we're gonna see exactly
what happens I don't know maybe it's
gonna be worse maybe it's me better
that's the whole point of this video so
let's find out
so the s340 is set up over there as you
can see and the first thing I want to
show is actually how our idle temps are
lower in the case and then we're in the
open air test bench because remember the
msi cards and the Twin Frozr six do not
turn until the graphics card gets up to
66 degrees Celsius so the fans are off
right now and you can see we're idling
at 39 where we were idling at 46 in the
open air test bench obviously that's
because the case is supplying some extra
cooling to the graphics card which is
actually one of the arguments some
people have cases might actually help
your graphics card perform better and
better temperatures then open air test
benches but anyway as you can see right
now we've got all the settings are
basically stock right now for the
graphics card one thing to bear in mind
is the test bench is the next 99 system
and this is AZ 170 6700 K system I don't
anticipate there being any difference
it's the exact same driver exact same
version of MSI Afterburner so I don't
think anything's gonna change you can
see here the factory core voltage curve
everything is exactly as it ships so I
don't think there's gonna be anything
different but I just want to point all
of this out before the test you guys can
see what the settings all are that way
you can see nothing's gonna change here
but anyway here's what we're gonna do
we're gonna load up heaven benchmark
running all the same settings as the
test bench
it's got tessellation and extreme we
have got anti-aliasing at 8 X and we are
gonna run it at 1080p and we're gonna
let it run for exactly 20 minutes and
then we're gonna compare the results
between open air and it closed mid-tower
s340 that also has a front-mounted h 100
i and fans limited to 60% fan speed
right there and not letting them ramp up
to 100% I'm just trying to kind of
control the environment here to see you
know if it's really gonna have a huge
impact on performance of the card enough
to where people would be really upset
that they put it in their case and it
results were so far different from a
test bench anyway when that said we're
gonna start the test here and I will hey
look my shadow hey I will see you guys
in the in 20 minutes we're back it's
been 20 minutes now I'm going to show
you some numbers up here and just to
show you before I do that because I know
there's some tinfoil hat where is in the
audience they're gonna be like you
switched you're not
running the s340 there it is right there
the test rig is actually down there on
the the floor as you can see so it is
not hooked up but here are the numbers
so here's what we got so far let me lock
the tripod here I'm trying to this all
one shot I really don't want anyone to
be like you're trying to fool us so we
are at 71 see right now and it spent
most of its time bouncing between 70 and
71 hitting 72 a couple of times
fans at 55% that's 2% slower than it was
running inside the testbench 1835
megahertz 1.0 4 3 volts that's a lower
voltage and it was doing on the test
bench I'm not entirely sure why given
this is a z170 like I said so I don't
know why the voltage is a little bit
lower
same exact megahertz though and the
temperatures as you can see is actually
a couple of degrees cooler than we were
seeing with the open air test bench
which hit a max of 73 and was sitting
around 72 constantly this is anywhere
between 70 and 71 so let's do this here
real quick go ahead and end the test and
let's look at the chart okay so here's
the chart going let's go ahead and start
at the top here GPU temperature max
again 73 it hit that I know a couple of
times during the test but if we move our
mouse cursor over here you'll see we sat
most of the time at 71 drop down 67 71
69 71 72 71 68 71 70 71 71 goes all the
way down to 69 right there huh 69 losers
so 71 all the way toe it towards the end
I can't even find where it peaked at 73
I think right there
no that's 72 anyway so the temperature
as you can see let's just go ahead and
for the sake of argument call this dead
even with the open air test bench if we
take a look here at the core clock as
you can see 1835 megahertz all the way
across and then if we come down here to
core voltage 1.0 four three all the way
across the chart that did
not change so I did it with lesser
voltage I can't understand why it would
take 1.0 five O or 1.06 two is we were
seeing in the open air test bench I'm
not entirely too sure what that's all
about
okay so there's one more test I want to
do here real quick because if you recall
I did this with the case fans at 60% now
I've done this test already with the
fans at a hundred percent it made no
difference the temperatures got to the
same right here so if I ramp these fans
up to a hundred the temperatures stayed
exactly the same they did not come down
at all but what if I drop these case
fans down to say 20 percent I'm curious
as to what's gonna happen on the GPU
temperature but I've already shown you
that with the fans running at a
respectable 60 percent not too noisy
real-world situation here without you
know being short of trying to literally
choke the system as I'm doing right now
with the fans at 20% I expect there to
be no difference between test bench and
case as you just saw alright well
there's the graphics card test going
right now with the case fans at 20% so
you can see it's bouncing between
seventy seventy one and it's been
running for fifteen minutes so I I think
it's time that we put this argument to
bed a little bit now is obviously more
that we need to talk about here and we
will we'll talk about that we're gonna
we're gonna close out here but this is
the setup you can see it's still going
atmospheric style card we're colliding
on the case to exhaust all the hot air
with the fans barely running listen stop
making any noise listen I'm gonna unclip
my mic watches in fact for those curious
the fans were only running at 586 rpm
and 639 rpm yeah
the ships barely turned them in so there
you go guys I've actually spent about
the last four hours doing the testing in
this video that you guys just saw I did
it multiple times and then I made sure
that I was having as little
contamination as I could making sure the
room was cooled off before starting the
neck
test I made sure that I had real-world
scenario going here guys were mad when I
said I turned off the AC and I closed
the door because again that could affect
the results so I've got the overhead fan
going you might see the light bouncing a
little bit and I had the air conditioner
and stuff bent and you know open as I
normally would while gaming I tried to
make this situation as realistic as
possible the numbers are what they are
the case did not affect the temperatures
whatsoever but the one number you can't
argue it and I don't know why this is
happening still is why the open air test
bench required more voltage to get the
same numbers when GPU boost was
controlling things then the closed case
so if anything that makes it seem like
my open air test bench results being 1c
hotter and requiring more voltage at
least in the case of the MSI the open
air test bench was actually the worst
case scenario can't figure that one out
you guys also saw that when I slowed
down the s 340 fans all the way to 20%
which the fans barely started at in fact
one of the fans had to flick it with my
finger to get it spinning because it
wasn't enough startup voltage still saw
no difference whatsoever when it came to
the temperatures of the graphics card
and the number to substantiate that is
the fact that the fan speed when the fan
percentage did not increase between
those tests it stayed about 57% when it
came to the max fan speed at keeping the
card cool so obviously at the temps it
stayed the same but the fan speed jumped
up to say 60 65 % then that obviously
could say well the case was introducing
a situation where the fans had to go
faster to stay cooler that wasn't the
case I already showed you guys that
where it wasn't thing see when I say it
wasn't the case on a case video like
this it's always so confusing that
wasn't what happened here
the fans ran the exact same speed gave
us pretty much the exact same
temperatures again the open air test
bench was like 1 to 2 C hotter than the
closed case so people people saying you
know that the closed case would be the
worst case scenario at least in my
testing here wasn't the situation at all
make with that what you will I think the
numbers today have shown that yes I
think my testing is fair I stand by it
and nothing's gonna change the numbers
speak for themselves and obviously as
you know as a fan of reference coolers
these are a lot less
affected by a case than open air coolers
like this guy are gonna be so I don't
understand why why the big ruckus but
anyway I've done my video now this is my
official response to the community
wanting to know open air testbench
versus cases and not only that if I
wanted to do case testing there's not a
single case I could choose right now
that would it be realistic for every
single case that's out there on the
market and no matter what case I chose
and I'm sure someone watching this video
was pissed off that I used in s340 but
hey we used a case a small one and
slowed the fans down to practically
nothing and got no difference whatsoever
on the results so that's it yes I stand
by my numbers it's why I do my testing
and it's the way I'm going to keep doing
my testing share this video with someone
you think it might help most of the time
it's not gonna make any difference but I
feel a little better for making this
video because those that were willing to
listen to the information hopefully
learned something at the end of this
video as always guys thanks for watching
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
