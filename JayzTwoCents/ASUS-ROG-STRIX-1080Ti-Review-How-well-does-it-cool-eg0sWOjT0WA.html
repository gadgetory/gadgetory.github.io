we're going to take a look at another
graphics card and the custom 1080 TI
flavor that being the asus rog Strix
graphics card this is the first time
I've taken a look at an rog grab at the
cards since the 290 matrix holy hell of
a long time ago
bring out the bling in your PC with
Corsairs new Vengeance RGB series ddr4
memory with a hassle free lighting
controls in superior overclocking
performance click the link in the
description to learn more so I'm kind of
excited to look at this one but I've got
a little bit of a spoiler alert I'm not
going to be showing you guys a whole
bunch of benchmarks slides going across
the screen with transitions and stuff
because the reality is all the 1080p is
regardless of their founders Edition or
custom card perform pretty much the same
so what I'm going to do instead is I'm
going to talk about the specific things
you get with this card maybe even do a
teardown and we'll talk a little bit
about overclocking we'll just kind of
see how it does in that arena I asked
you guys on Twitter would you want to
see and that's what you said so that's
what you're getting and you'll like it
this is without a doubt one of the most
requested graphics cards that I have
ever had you guys asked me about because
you guys have noticed I've done a lot of
Asus graphics card reviews but yet here
we are
now here's we're going to do we're going
to go ahead and show obviously there is
a size comparison that needs to be had
here because when you go with a graphics
card like this it's got three fans on it
a custom PCB clearly it is much larger
than the founder's Edition card in fact
it honors edition cards I'm not mistaken
comes in at about 11 inches ladies yeah
it comes in at ten and a half inches
actually and then it's got a height of
about four and a half inches all right
measuring tape slow cards four and a
quarter close enough but if you compare
that to these chicks card right here be
Shroud hangs out over the back of the
PCB so this is 11 and 3/4 inches long by
4 and 3/4 inch high and it's a slot and
a half car or two and a half slot card
so it's gonna be able to but these up
against each other that's ok most
motherboards now we're spacing them out
appropriately so as you can see it is
bigger all around than the founders
Edition
yet now let's talk about the cooler here
the cooler obviously has three fins they
are 0db fans what that means is when
it's under idle the fans are going to
turn have zero acoustics so it's not
gonna make any noise but it's got a very
tasteful LED array and here we'll call
it an array it's got some lights that
shine right through the cooler right
here and on the back we do have the ROG
logo that glows orange and on the face
of the graphics card we have a little
Republic of gamers LED that will light
right there which is a really tasteful
because it's not a lot of lights and in
your faces small it's subtle they do
glow orange out of the box however you
can loot load the GPU tweak software and
the Asus Aurora software so you can
control the lighting on this to make it
match any aesthetic that you want it
does indeed have two eight ten power
plugs so stepping it up from the eight
pin and six pin power found on the
founders edition card but you also on
the back here have two additional fan
headers they are either PWM or DC fan
header so you can actually plug some K
stands all-in-one cooler fans or
whatever you want to this and allow the
graphics card to also ramp up your
chassis fans to try and help with the
additional airflow I like to see that
because here's the thing when you have a
cooler like this that's exhausting all
of its air into the case the case is
responsible for taking that hot air away
but the graphics card is completely
dependent on your chassis airflow for
its cooling efficiency now when you
actually add the fan headers on the back
of the graphics card and allow the fans
to ramp up with the load of the graphics
card then your chassis is more able to
take on the additional heat being put
into the case the problem with letting
your CPU load or or the standard CPU PWM
handle that if the CPUs don't really go
under a massive load when you're gaming
so the fans will stay kind of cool and
quiet as your graphics card is getting
hotter than the hot air isn't being
cooled out of the case as efficiently so
that's something that's really nice to
see so in the gaming mode it's a fifteen
hundred and sixty nine core clock and
then of course it's going to boost under
load up to sixteen hundred and eighty
three you put in OC mode then you get
1594 megahertz core clock and it boosts
up to seventeen hundred and eight now
even in OC mode it's going to boost up
higher than seventeen hundred and eight
because GPU boost 3.0 is going to take
over so it's like two things happening
there
now regardless of which profile you're
in is going to boost up higher than that
though because of GPU boost 3.0 and
those those are kind of like brackets
that shift so as you move it from the
gaming mode to the OC mode has even more
Headroom with GP boost 3 so I saw an
average about nineteen hundred and
twenty five megahertz and before we talk
about overclocking let's go and take a
look at this cooler I've already done
all of my tests I'm gonna tell you right
now that I never saw any hotter than
what we see next sixty five see ya 65 C
in OC mode is the highest temperature
that we actually saw on this so that is
among the coolest we've seen yet but
what I want to do right here is I want
to see how they're achieving that so I'm
kind of curious as to what you get here
I've never taken one apart so I don't
know exactly what's involved but I'm
going to be voiding my warranty so
anyway that's okay
warranties are there to be broken
there's a little sticker right there it
covers up the screw once you punch that
you basically tilt
ASIS that you took the cooler off and
they're going to go no no I don't
warranty that anymore it's kind of a
gray area anyway Linus did a great video
about product warranties and whether or
not you're allowed to take things apart
and if that can hold your warranty but I
digress so once you remove those four
spring-loaded screws around the GPU
perimeter this is what you get we've got
one two three four five six heat pipes
on here a massive heatsink array as you
can see now I would have liked to have
seen these heat sinks run-length rather
than hike like this because we talked
about this actually with the sapphire
card review that when the air can
actually run the length of the card and
come out the backside it's more a little
bit more efficient air flow than having
to hit the the bottom right here against
the motherboard and bounce but then
again you do have some air coming up out
of the top sort of because you have this
little plate right here that kind of
blocks some of that air flow some can
make it out here some can make it out
there but regardless this is actually
one of the easiest cooler than taking
apart because it's just those four
screws you've got two headers right here
one is an LED header and one is a fan
header so on the back here we have our
back plate we've got some cutouts here
to allow some heat to escape the back of
the power delivery and of course you've
got access to your GPU screws without
having to take the back plate off so
that's kind of nice on the face of the
card here you've got the teach spreader
that's touching all the DRM that is
screwed down into the back plate so it
seems
and once together making a good contact
we've got heat pads on those this is our
power delivery right here make lasers
you got one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten phase power
delivery on there and of course a heat
pad as you can see right there look how
thick that heat head is holy cow
now that heat pad makes contact with the
cooler which part of the yeah so it
touches basically right here it just
touches the heatsink fins now what I
would have liked to have seen an EVGA
actually started doing this because it
they kind of learn their lesson was
instead of having it touch the sharp
edge they actually made a 90-degree Bend
on all of the fins where it touches the
heat sink or heat pad just to give a
better contact and it'll transfer of
heat so that would've been nice to see
but you do have at least a heat pad on
the BRM on the heat spreader touching
the heatsink right there yeah that's
kind of nice I'm not gonna bother taking
the fans out no reason to do that and
then back here this is just this is just
a heesu that's two-sided tape I'm not
even sure why that's there to be honest
with you now for those that are
wondering yes I did do my initial
testing with the stock thermal paste
that comes with this graphics card and I
am pleased to report but the hottest we
saw this card get even in 4k is about 65
feet and that's what the stock band
profile if I bump the fan profile up to
about 55% which is where you can just
start to hear the fans and it's at it
like 54 C unfortunately that warranty
sticker basically says if there is a
water block that is developed for this
card you void your warranty you put it
on not many graphics cards that I've
taken apart have a warranty sticker on
the screw to keep you from taking the
cooler off that's a lot of the brands
I've dealt with actually welcome water
cooling say yeah water cool it make it
as fast as it can be bro now it's no
surprise at this date into the mid-60s
on the stock Sam profile and down into
the deep 50s when it comes to messing
with the fan profile and speeding up the
fans a little bit if you don't mind
sacrificing a little bit of acoustics in
terms of better cooling if you're
overclocking you better turn
fans anyway but again that isn't an
open-air testbench so if you're
concerned about cooling then make sure
you guys have adequate chassis cooling
in your case lots of intake lots of
exhaust and maybe even utilize the fan
headers on the back of this so there you
go guys the Asus 1080 TI Strix card a
pretty good performer stays really cool
and overclocked pretty well to almost 20
100 megahertz 2088 seems to kind of be
the middle ground where like 90% of the
cards will hit and only a select few
will actually make it into the 2100 and
above range I think I'm going to focus
more so on moving forward though of
cards of the exact same tier like 10
atti versus 1080i focusing more on the
feature sets the coolers and doing
little tear downs like that than just
sitting there and running eight to ten
hours where the benchmarks and showing
you guys that look it's within two FPS
of this card I mean that's that's cool
and all but yeah I meant you're more
interested in what you get for that
money let me know if there's any other
graphics cards want me to take a look at
moving forward I have the Poseidon card
coming in here in the near future that's
the one that has the built in water
block into the heatsink so you can
actually leave it air cooled if you want
or hook up some tubes to it and water
actually flows through it you don't have
to switch the block on there so that'll
be worth taking a look at here
especially as a water cooler myself I
don't think I'm going to be doing the
the massive amounts of benchmarks when
it comes to comparing 1080p is versus
other 1080p is because I guess that
they're all within like one or two FPS
of each other the frame rates are so
freakin high with this graphics cards
even in in like 1440p you're not going
to notice the difference between them
and that's what really hangs a lot of
people up when it comes to buying these
cards or like I don't know what you want
to get they all seem like they're the
same the little things that come with
the package that that really should be
more important on where you're spending
your money hey guys time to go thanks
for watching let me know what other
things you want me to incorporate in GPU
reviews and I'll try and do it but that
said I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
