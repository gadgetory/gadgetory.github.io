you recall I said that my GPU loop kept
getting hotter and hotter and hotter all
the way up to in the low 60s when not
even overclocked and I started to
suspect that something might have been
happening inside the blocks the GPU loop
to see if maybe they were clogging or
something so I decided today just for
the sake of teaching you guys how to
take the block apart we're going to show
you how to do some block maintenance how
to clean your block and actually see
what's going on in here I I don't think
the block is clogged at all but I still
want to at least open it up and see what
the heck is going on inside of there
with it's specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance free plug and play
operations the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
now the block I'm specifically using
here which is a little bit dusty this is
the ek water blocks full cover block it
is the nickel and acetal the reason why
they call that it's because the block is
made of nickel nickel plated copper
anyway and then we've got an acetal
cover on here as you can see it's not
actually Nick all the way and and which
a lot of people thought that they were
they're not they're actually just this
portion here which is the same as you
know the nickel plexi only they add the
acetal cover here now to take the thing
apart you are going to need an allen key
this is actually included with the
blocks so if you have the block bead you
should already have the key and you're
going to work your way around and undo
all of these screws right here and then
you're also going to undo the three at
the end of the port now one of the
reason why I want to inspect this is if
you take a look here I was getting this
gunk that was actually building up on
all of my fittings and you can actually
see that see I get this to focus here so
you can actually see that there is a
little bit of a kind of a white gunk
that's been building up inside of there
and I'm just curious if that's been
making its way into my block it's a
little bit here on the end of the
fitting and then also put up a picture
here of what was happening to some of
the ends of my rigid tube I don't think
there's going to actually be any buildup
in here but for the sake of this video
and the fact that I changed all the
blocks I at least want to see what the
heck is going on in there
now when you undo the third screw here
that thing might swing away as you can
see you want to be careful because right
here there are two very small o rings
actually more like oval rings something
on there two very small oval rings that
are creating a seal against the actual
block right here so you definitely don't
want to lose that but as you can see we
have a little bit more of that white
it's almost like a powder it's almost
like a salt and I'll explain why I think
that in a minute I found a very
interesting post on overclock forums or
overclock net but anyway you don't want
to lose those o-rings be very mindful of
that now one thing you want to keep in
mind too is this is going to void your
warranty there is a warranty sticker
right here between the two components
when you take it apart it will break
that which is going to violate your
warranty so definitely something you
need to do at your own risk
but yeah maybe we'll just work our way
around and undo all these screws now I
pretty much expect whatever is inside
this block to be the same for all three
all three are going to be clean so I
will end up opening up all three but
like I said this is just more out of
curiosity as to what the inside of the
block looked like considering I was
seeing that build up on some of the
tubes there I don't know why I was
getting this build up a lot of people
don't have this problem few people have
had this problem so it's it's almost
like a 50/50 it just depends on the
components it depends on a lot of
different variables
I don't think color matters you know
because there are there's a lot of dye
that actually creates these different
pigments that is used with the pastel
fluids so I don't know if that has
anything to do with it but technically
the White has no dye because that is the
base coolant it's just a white like
dragon eyes fluid all right so we've got
all of those loose and well you know
it's it's not as bad as I thought it
would be quite honestly you can see here
the o-ring does have pretty much a
coating of that white again it's like a
as you can see it's like a powder it
really is where the hell's will focus it
really is like a powder when you touch
it it's very
tacky the micro channels here don't
appear to be clogged up although now
they don't appear to be clogged up
they've also got this little plate that
goes on there to kind of direct the
water flow through it either direction
but I all I pretty much need to do at
this point is take out the o-ring clean
the o-ring clean off the gunk that's
built up right here on the so you can
see when I rub it it's just kind of like
it's quite a bit of powder built up
right here again I think this is salt
and I'll explain why I think that's the
case in a minute but I don't believe
this to be the reason for my high
coolant temperatures although when I
touch it everything is sticky everything
is sticky right here in the micro
channels so it definitely is going to
need a pretty thorough cleaning to make
sure that you know there's no issues
there but one of the other reasons why I
want to look inside here was to kind of
see how the plating was holding up
against the Nano fluid here there has
been issues in the past where some
coolant can start to eat away at nickel
plating and I want to make sure that
that wasn't the case I didn't think it
would be but yeah the inside really all
in all is not that bad at all I mean you
can see against the black here there's
quite a bit of crud building up you can
see right there that's where it was kind
of collecting obviously okay for
cleaning we're just going to start with
alcohol alcohol is a really good place
to start I just kind of want to see how
this stuff reacts to it we'll just kind
of wipe around the outside here yeah and
as you can see get all these screws out
of there
you obviously don't want to lose any of
these screws either but alcohol is a
pretty good place to start when it comes
to cleaning as you can see it's wiping
right off you definitely want to make
sure the spot where the o-ring seals is
clean this can be that's kind of
important part number one but it doesn't
look like there's any real massive
buildup in here I mean it's a little bit
more buildup than if I was using a
distilled water obviously distilled
water has nothing to build up but again
this does not appear to be the source of
why my GPUs were getting pretty hot
alright so in the end this is what
you're left with here you just take your
small Oh ring here be gentle with this
it's actually very fragile and just kind
of work it into the channel here
definitely have to make sure that this
thing is seated properly otherwise you
are going to end up spring in a leak
it's going to have a little bit of
conformity if that's even a word
probably not a word so you're going to
want to make sure you kind of get this
thing lined up in its original spot
because it's going to kind of want to
take to the shape that it's been out for
a while this might end up being one of
the more frustrating points of you know
this particular process but ultimately
the nickel plating looks very good on
the inside doesn't look like there's any
tarnishing or any sort of flaking which
was one of the reasons I wanted to look
inside of this thing and unfortunately
it also does not look like the block
having any sort of build up is going to
be the culprit for the temperatures that
I had been trying to figure out which is
unfortunate anyway we'll get this thing
back together and we'll talk about what
I think the white stuff might be all
right well here it is put back together
I really didn't think that the pastel
was going to be the problem or I should
say the Nano fluid because really it's
the nanoparticles that I was thinking
might have somehow been getting clogged
I doubted it those since they're
extremely light and people haven't
mentioned pastel clogging before but
anyway when you put this back together
kind of do like the four corner screws
first to hold it in place make sure that
oring doesn't pop out it's kind of
difficult to work in there then put in
the other screws real light and then
work your way around and kind of tighten
it up in a star pattern and then make
sure it's tight but remember it is easy
to strip this even the copper based
copper is still soft metal so you want
to make sure that you don't strip it
especially when you're putting the end
piece back on because this is threading
right into the acetal material and it's
just a plastic so it's going to strip
really really easily doesn't take a lot
of force to make a good seal with that o
ring but anyway I want to talk to you
real quick about that the white stuff
and what it could possibly be
I really don't know I'm not a chemist
now like I said I'm not a chemist you
might be thinking jail then how can I
even talk about this but I would least
want to mention a post that I found on
overclock net where
I guess I'm assuming this guy's a
chemist he really seems to know what
he's talking about at least that on the
surface it sounds like it so the
question was about like I said about the
white almost salty material that appears
to be building up in here and this guy
said that copper does oxidize rather
quickly when exposed to an oxygen
deprivation cell at the same time this
isn't a pH problem so much as
contamination problem the liquid is
either partially or very reactive to
copper salts and the salts have high
solubility I'd say that that is a big
problem in a matter if the radiator is
100% clean prior to use these salts
would eventually build up the question
of whether or not this would be in a
week or six months should not matter now
this guy's name is little Hasselhoff er
he's got 1773 thanks received on the
forum so he seems to be pretty active
apparently the oxygen deprivation cell
again have no idea what that is is a
contamination problem and it has
something to do I guess with the fluid
and it has to do with the way it's
reacting to the copper and considering I
have copper radiators could be that
could be salt building up in the system
I don't know if that has something to do
with why the fluid was changing color
but it wasn't building up inside the
block but as you saw it was kind of
building up on the on the fittings and
stuff already cleaned that one off but
anyway I just kind of want to put that
out there too
it is what it is I'm officially saying I
don't think the pastel has caused any of
the temperature problems I was receiving
with my Titan so I've got to figure that
one out maybe you guys learned something
today from how to take the block apart
make sure you just don't over tighten it
doesn't take a lot of pressure to get
these things sealed back up but the best
thing is no matter what happens in there
you can generally clean it unless the
nickel starts to flake off you can
always get your blocks running like new
again you don't need to buy new blocks I
only went with the nickel plated plexi
blocks so that they they look cool
that's really all it was it came down to
the petty looking awesome anyway guys
thanks for watching today's video I hope
this has helped you learn something
that's it that's all I'm talking about
with the pastels stuff removed forward
I hope the Primeau chill stuff works out
well for me but time will tell these are
these are things that take time to kind
of present themselves anyway the block
wasn't as bad as I thought it was going
to be so that was a pleasant surprise
got to clean the other two and then
and I will find a purpose for these
anyway guys thanks for watching it as
always we will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
