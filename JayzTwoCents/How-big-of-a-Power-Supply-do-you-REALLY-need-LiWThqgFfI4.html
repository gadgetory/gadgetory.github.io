chances are you're either building have
built or plan to build another computer
in the future and you're not quite sure
on what size power supply to use so in
order to try and arm you with the
information you need when choosing the
right power supply today we're going to
take a look at how much wattage your
system really uses under the different
types of tasks that you can possibly
throw at it and hopefully give you the
information it takes to choose the right
power supply now if you take a look
behind me you see I've got my watt meter
it's hooked up only to my tower so
you're only measuring wattage and amp
that come directly from the tower and
anything within it plugged in directly
to the wall so the only readings we're
going to get are the tower and the tower
only and I'm using a webcam here to
capture the wattage and you can see here
this is what the webcam is capturing
it's kind of a bit light so I'm just
going to use this make some shade and as
you can see there is the watt meter and
we'll put that up on the screen and
we'll get some cool little dynamic views
stuff going and as I'm waving my arms
around like crazy now a lot of new
builders tend to really get overzealous
when it comes to their power supply
and tend to get one that's actually too
big it is possible to have too big of a
power supply it's not like other things
in life where there's you know the
bigger the better a power supply if too
big never reads its full efficiency
state which means that you kind of get
fluctuations in some of the power
delivery and at the same time you don't
want to undersized your power supply
because you don't want to hit hit its
maximum output because then you're going
to get blue screens and shutdowns and
other not so good stuff now I just want
to briefly touch on what the 80 plus
rating means I'm not going to go into
depth on it I'm just going to let you
know that the reason why most builders
only recommend a B+ and above when it 80
plus bronze silver gold platinum and
titanium power supplies is because what
that saying is that at 100 percent load
of the power supply unit you're getting
at least eighty percent of that load
turned into energy so what that means is
on a thousand watt power supply you're
getting at least
800 watts of the rated power to that
system so it's very important that you
actually size your power supply
appropriate we're going to go ahead and
look at the parts that are being used in
my system my system has a lot of
peripherals in it which can use and burn
up a lot of power other than the
processor in the motherboard I am using
a 3770k
overclock to four point seven gigahertz
I am using a GTX 680 that's overclocked
to twelve hundred and fifty megahertz I
do have eight gigabytes to dims of 1866
RAM that's overclocked to 2100 I do have
a water cooling loop in here that's
using an MCP six by five variable speed
pump set on speed three I have eleven
eleven right one two three twelve
Corsair fans in this system I have nine
120-millimeter fans and three 140
millimeter fans so there's a lot more
fans in this system than the average
builder would use and it's one of those
things that people tend to throw out
there is oh if you're going to use a lot
of fans you've got to have a big power
supply and we're going to debunk that
myth right here in this video my
motherboard is an as Roxy 77 OC formula
and I do have two LED light strips in
this all crammed into a 900 D case and
the power supply that we're using for
this system is the corsair ax 750 it's a
750 watt gold rated power supply so
let's go ahead and run this thing
through some tests and let's see just
how much wattage we're actually using
okay guys we're back we're taking a look
at my desktop and as you can see we're
idling right around 150 watt mark a
little bit below that high 140 s and we
jump up into the 150 s a little bit it
tends to jump a little bit when you move
your mouse because believe it or not
moving your mouse does use your CPU it's
going to take a look at Intel burn test
it's a program I use to stress the CPU
when I test over clocks we're go ahead
and go from standard to maximum so we'll
do maximum stress on the CPU just to see
what happens with the wattage now as you
can see here it jumped right up to about
212 watts 210 we're not gonna really let
this run very long because it's not
going to get any more strenuous than it
already is in fact if it looks like it's
doing anything let's say it's dropping a
little bit so just a CPU stress test a
hundred percent usage on the CPU we're
looking at about 210 to 215 watts we'll
go ahead and open up vally benchmark
which is just a GPU store
it puts the GPU at a hundred percent and
as you can see we're sitting just over
three hundred watts dropping down as low
as two hundred and eighty but we are
looking right around three hundred is
the the sweet spot
I saw 305 I think for a second there 304
301 and of course it's going to depend
on the load on the CPA or the the GPU
and what it's actually doing what kind
of you know polygons it's rendering in
this net now the CPU load though to keep
in mind is only sitting at 11% 16
percent 14 percent it's junk it's really
really low so what happens now when you
take both CPU and GPU and you stress
them at the same time let's go ahead and
find out together okay now since we know
that valid benchmark on its own doesn't
stress the entire system enough because
the CPU is not really used in the
equation what we're going to do here is
we're going to go ahead and run Valley
benchmark in windowed mode and we're
putting all the settings on maths its
ultra we've got a text anti-aliasing
it's at 1080p this is going to be a
pretty decent stress for the GTX 680
what we're going to do while this is
running is we're going to go ahead and
bring up Cinebench to use the CPU at the
same time so instead of being a stress
test on the CPU it is going to be a load
so we're gonna have a GPU load and a CPU
load and as you can see right now before
I start Cinebench we're at 290 watts all
the way down to the high 270 low 280
Watts marked just with that but now once
we hit run CPU on the Cinebench
we are sitting right around 350 watts
and if we look at the GPU usage on here
somewhere
can't even bring it up because it's
being so stressed but based on the frame
rates that we are getting here on my
benchmark for the GPU we are definitely
running it's running at 1,250 megahertz
so we are stressing the system right now
as hard as it possibly can and we're
sitting right around 365 watts or so
okay so now Cinebench is done and we
drop down below 300 again let's go ahead
and run Cinebench one more time just to
put that stress on and check and see if
we get the same kind of results here the
GPU is currently sitting at 99% usage
and Cinebench is currently running at
340 pernessa no bench percentage is
running or we're sitting right about 345
to 350 watts so we'll go and shut off
all this annoying stuff here there's a
couple of interesting things that we
just learned and we'll go ahead and talk
about that now in the conclusion once I
can get all this crap turned off
actually before we do that why don't we
go ahead and see realistically what
battlefield 3 is using wattage wise okay
so battlefield is currently running
we're in the game here and as you can
see we're only using a little over 300
watts what's interesting about this is
the fact that our graphics card is
overclocked so it's definitely putting
us as much usage as it can to that
graphics card now the voltage is locked
at one point one volts on the graphics
so it's not anything entirely major but
you can see wattage wise here with a
3770k and a GTX 680 and water cooling
and 12 fans and an SSD two hard drives
LED strips the overclocked on everything
we're only using a little over 300 watts
while gaming okay guys so what did we
learn today besides the fact that J has
a big-ass zit on his face what we
learned that for the most part a lot of
people really tend to oversize their
power supply units based on their knee
now it's one thing to be future-proof
and have room to add a second graphics
card or even a third graphics card if
that's the route you want to take you
just have to know that in the meantime
the less power you use of the maximum
output of your power supply is just
wasted money and wasted energy going
into that power supply that's turning in
to nothing a power supply wants to use
as much energy and put out as much
energy as it possibly can that's what's
designed to do so the lower amount of
energy you use in your power supply the
less efficient it's going to be you're
going to pay more to use that power
supply really to do not what it's
designed to do I think most people can
get away with about a 600 to a 650 watt
power supply and still have room in the
future as Hardware progresses and needs
more energy now what's interesting is
most manufacturers when it comes to
graphics cards and CPUs are really
working on reducing the amount of power
consumption in their power supply this
also tells me that my 750 watt is not
being used nearly as much as I thought
it was I had been holding off going with
a second 680 in my system because I
didn't believe that my 750 was enough
output and had enough Headroom left in
it to add a second graphics card but as
you saw we were only using about a
hundred and fifty Watts extra power with
the graphics card under load so that
tells me I'm going to probably end up
throwing a second 680 in this system
somewhere in the near future
now if you have any questions about
power supplies or what the 80 plus
rating means or any of that and plan on
doing a more all-inclusive video with a
cup when it comes to power supplies but
before that I thought it was important
to show you what it really looks like
and how much power you're really truly
using in your system and I think you may
be surprised that even with all the
extra peripherals in my system we're
using a lot less power than even I
thought we were using I hadn't done this
test until now I shocked myself even I
thought I was using some more over 500
watts
not even close our guys have been jace
to sense if you liked this video you
know what to do share it with someone
you think can learn from this
information if you're looking on
building your own computer this will
help you in the future see you guys next
time and as always see you in my next
video
