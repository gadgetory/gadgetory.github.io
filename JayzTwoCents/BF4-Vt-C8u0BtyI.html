cents and if you're a huge fan of the
Battlefield franchise like I am and that
wasn't obvious by my 2142 my battlefield
2i battlefield 3 hard copies here and
you would be excited about battlefield 4
launching and just around the corner and
because of that a very generous
subscriber of mine has donated to hard
copies a battlefield 4 to be given away
to you guys now I'm going to go ahead
and splain to you how you win these hard
copies first off it's a hard copy it
means it's a disc that means it will
likely not be in your hands midnight of
release it's not a code we're not doing
codes this time number two guys and I'm
sincerely apologetic about this but I'm
only opening this up to America and
Canada when it comes to shipping costs
and just some of the other complications
when it comes to shipping
internationally for this giveaway only
I'm opening it to north america and
canada only will be doing more giveaways
in the future where i'm going to be
doing download codes more than likely
battlefield 4 and i'll be opening that
up to everybody else but because it's
hard copies this is just the way it's
going to have to be now this is a
giveaway i'm only going to be doing on
twitter and i apologize about that guys
but twitter it's just so much more
simple and easy to track when it comes
to doing the giveaways so with that said
you have to be following on twitter if
you're not subscribed and you're not
following on twitter there's no way in
hell you're going to win one of these
hard copies because this is a thank you
for being a supporter of my channel now
down in the description you'll find
links to all of my social media and down
there you'll also find a click to tweet
link that you will click and it will
bring up Twitter and it will
automatically tweet me and it will tweet
a hashtag that's going to enter you in
the giveaway and this weekend I will be
choosing two winners from the quick from
the quick to tweets from the click to
tweets and we'll be sending out those
copies to you and I'll be sending you a
DM and we'll be working it all out from
there so if we're excited about
battlefield 4 and you want to win a free
copy go ahead and hit those buttons you
know what to do and guys I'll see you
next time
