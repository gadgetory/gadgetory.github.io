cents and today I'm going to bring you a
video that is well over a month in the
making I can't wait to bring you this
video because I'm really excited about
the product that I'm going to show you
today
now it's no surprise that I've been
doing a lot of CM storm product reviews
over the last couple of months on this
channel and it's a product line that I
definitely believe in I've used it for
years and years the Coolermaster line
and their new CM storm line and I've
really been impressed with their
products and one of my favorite mice or
mouse nice input device that I've been
using on the market for the last like
eight years has been the only not quite
eight years but about six years has been
the Logitech MX eighteen mouse and I've
gone through three of them and I've told
people that I would never change that
Mouse unless something came along that I
liked just that much more
well guys something has come along that
I like just that much more and that is
the CM storm Reaper this is it right
here
you guys have seen some pictures of this
on Twitter if you haven't it's probably
they're not following me now this mouse
right here is just I'm gonna go ahead
and put it out there fits everything I
require in a mouse it's full size it's
economical it has a lot of input up it
has a lot of buttons on it it has on the
fly dpi adjustment nice comfortable
scroll wheel the weight is right even
though it doesn't have adjustable
weights everything about this mouse for
me is right and I can confidently say
that without saying that you know they
didn't pay me to say this this is just
my opinion this mouse has everything
that I'm looking for and on top of that
it's got some really cool things going
on it's got a white LED on the top and
on the Front's got like headlights I got
to cover it up here so you guys can can
see that it's got like headlights on
there made me take a little car but it
just looks really really awesome but
more so than it looks it's comfort is
perfect I mean here it is in my hand
right here everything about this is
absolutely perfect now we're going to be
taking a look at two things today though
because at the same time that I received
this mouse it was coupled with this CM
storm control rx mouse pad and this is
it's extremely flexible this is they
have a bunch of different thicknesses
this is like the thickest one that they
have and I'm okay with that because I
don't really mind it but
the smoothness of this on here it's just
a video can't explain how smooth it is
when you take a pad like this and a
mouse that's got you know a extremely
slick feat on here and you put the two
together it just becomes an absolute
masterpiece for gaming now I do a lot of
first-person shooter type games and for
me having a mouse that drags or it
doesn't slide smoothly or it gets hump
the cord gets hung up that's a problem
for me but this mouse has just addressed
a lot of that now it's going to talk
about just some of the physical
properties of the mouse here it does
have a 102 Oh make sure I get this right
as a 102 8200 dpi adjustment and it is
adjustable by these two buttons right
here on the top there's a positive and a
up and a down button you have three
thumb buttons here you have a giant
thumb button you have two more thumb
buttons of course you have your left
click right click but what's interesting
about this mouse is it has onboard
memory so you have four profiles that
you can set up that are saved to the
mouse that can control up to 60
different macros with this Mouse that
that's a lot so four profiles 60 macros
and the cool thing is it saves all of
your settings on the mouse so if you
take this mouse and hook it up to
another computer all of your settings
for your programs whether it be
battlefield or Warcraft or whatever get
saved on the mouse so it travels with
you which is pretty damn cool now the
scroll wheel is made of metal the only
complaint I think I've been able to come
up with on this mouse is that the scroll
wheel is a little bit stiff so that when
you go to scroll it every now and then
you push down on the click because it's
also a click button and by doing so
sometimes you accidentally you
accidentally activate the you know move
your mouse to scroll around the window
function but that's kind of a minor
thing I would like to see it maybe
adjustable on the stiffness on there but
again that's a minor thing now this is
there it's part of their aluminum series
so this pit this plate right here which
has also an engraved CM Storm logo is
removable and by being removable they
want you to customize it paint it
and it isit do something cool to make
the mouse unique in your own and that's
exactly what this mouse is all about now
they're not going to be selling these
plates individually so you know it's one
of those things that they've kind of a
they thought about it but there's really
not going to be a market there maybe in
the future somebody will come up with
some aftermarket pieces who knows but
for the time being this is the only
plate that's available you can't buy a
replacement so get it right the first
time
that plate is removable by popping up
this little rubber plug here there's a
screw and it comes right off now the
mouse comes with its own software that
allows you to set up those profiles and
those macros now the macros and the
profile function is really neat because
it will be allowed to save macros for
certain games that way you have a lot of
adjustability in this Mouse when it
comes to you know which game it is that
you're playing so this has become very
quickly my new favorite Mouse when it
comes to cost I don't really bring that
stuff up on the channel because cost is
always changing but if it's anything
like the other products available
through CM storm the prices are going to
be very very competitive now a lot of
people when they saw pictures of this
they thought that this would be a direct
competitor to some of the Corsair line
of mice I've not used very many Corsair
mice but I can tell you that this mouse
if this is the best Mouse I have ever
used and once again I just have to say I
was not paid to say that this is my own
opinion after using it for more than a
month every single day just everything
about it you got nice long braided cable
in fact it's plugged in on my
workstation or my gate my second station
my test bench way over there and I've
got how long is the cord on this this
cords got to be at least 7 feet maybe 8
feet long but if you take this Reaper
mouse and you couple it with the control
or the rx series mouse pad you get
something that is just beyond words when
it comes to gaming and you know when it
comes to gaming it's all about comfort
and these two products right here from
Sam storm are definitely a Jays buy if
you're shopping for a new Mouse or a new
pad you have to put these on your list
to at least check out and you won't be
sorry if you do if you in if you're in
to a full-sized mouse one that's
economical adjustable tons of buttons
just looks cool you have to check out
the CM storm Reaper guys has been Jays
two cents I truly like this product and
I hope that you guys have enjoyed this
video if you did you know what you can
do with it if you're new to my channel
hope you stick around maybe you'll learn
something about some PC gaming and
building custom PCs and as always I will
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
