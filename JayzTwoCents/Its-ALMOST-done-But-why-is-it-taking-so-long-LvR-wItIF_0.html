gonna talk about the post Malone build
again because I'm sick of it you're sick
of it and I think you guys are owed an
explanation as to why this is taking so
damn long what are you doing
shopping for a case when you build what
are you looking for I want something
designed for water cooling fractal
design define us all the way check it
out
plenty of airflow plenty of open
interior for water cooling radiator
support it even has mounts for your
wrist wash I don't have enough room for
my hard drives okay
fractal design r5 look at all those hard
drive cages and you can fit your
radiators and water cooling in here no I
got a lot of hard drives but I also have
an e ATX motherboard okay I'm gonna try
something here okay bear with me
you might wanna stand clear I never
actually tried this before
yeah it worth fractal design to find r6
you could fit all your radiators a
crap-ton of hard drives and if it's a
ATX dude this is perfect
nailed it now this video is gonna sound
like a whole lot of excuses and that's
because they kind of sort of are but I
guess it's really besides the point it
really doesn't matter why it's taking so
long I just felt you guys should know
first of all this chassis is based off
of the singularity Specter it is a
custom one-off that they did all the
milling and extra work for and
unfortunately because the timing of this
chassis was right around their prototype
release remember we sort of debuted it
when I showed him the renderings when
post Malone was in studio we showed him
the renderings of what this would look
like that was still during the prototype
phase there was only one in existence
the one we showed him and it was not
finished yet there were obviously some
design changes and then we as you guys
can see we have all the custom stuff
going on here with the custom Bentley
front grille and all that sort of stuff
the other thing was because of all the
custom work and the finalization to the
chassis design and then the custom work
on top of that cuz member the chassis
wasn't finalized yet the length of time
that they said it would take and the
length the time it actually took was two
very different figures the problem is by
the time I received the chassis that put
us into Computex season which also put
us right smack dab in the middle of post
malone's 2018 tour which is still going
on today that is one of the reasons why
the chassis isn't done but the real
reason why this is taking so long is I
had to get another back panel made
remember the panel is actually the
chassis the the waterblock distribution
block is built into this and everything
attaches to this acrylic back piece
which is what one two three four five
six layers of acrylic the only problem
is I damaged it I bought about one of
the screws well two of the screws
actually and correct it so I had to wait
for another one to get made and of
course singularities like you gotta be
kidding me what are you doing over there
you frickin amateur no they didn't
actually say that so this is the
replacement acrylic piece for the back
which means now I've got to unbox this
and transfer all the parts from here to
here so that's what we're doing today I
promise this will be the last video you
guys see before you
him on the channel receiving his
computer which at this point I'm sure
even he forgot he was getting so all
right well that Phil do this thing and
we'll I'll get this transferred over
well obviously it's been a couple of
days since you guys saw the work that I
did on this we are 95% of the way there
we are so close and as you guys can see
I've actually gone with rigid tubing
after all I wanted to do the whole soft
tubing Ben thing concept idea because
it's wobbly that's just the table our
table is not level I want to do the soft
tubing because beer bongs and I wanted
to incorporate the beer bongs somehow
into this bill but I feel like it's
becoming too much now and I instead of
just trying to see what else we can cram
into this build now we're just gonna tie
it all together we're gonna tighten up
the laces and make a knot and we're
gonna ship it and unfortunately post
Malone is still on tour right now as I
started all right at the start of this
video so as soon as our schedules
collide we will go ahead and do the
reveal but I'm gonna talk about a couple
of things and why I made some of the
design choices that I did
obviously the rigid tubing just looks so
much cleaner and I used almost a chrome
nickel-plated fittings because I think
it ties in the front grille part of my
problem with the black fittings which I
originally was going to use is the fact
that black really sort of subdued the
internals I mean we've got the wood
blocks on here although the the grain
does not match perfectly on these two
different you know pieces of curly maple
but that's kind of besides the point I
wanted to find a way to bring the
Bentley grille that was custom made for
this into the rest of the build and
obviously the only thing that was nickel
on here was the plating on the grille in
the front obvious time of its chrome
runic
doesn't matter a shiny metal also - the
reason why you're not seeing caps on the
terminal portion right here we got our
parallel loop it's because I have to
take the graphics cards back out I don't
know if I remember I can't remember I
said in the beginning of this video or
not but I have to modify the wood blocks
because they didn't actually account for
an SLI bridge and so the wood right here
keeps the bridge for me able to push
down on the SLI fingers but that's gonna
be simple just to be simple knock on all
the wood right we just have to file down
the wood just a few millimeters to make
the SLI bridge be able to sit all the
way down I've got one more tube I need
to bend between here in here and
actually I did this all on livestream
yesterday did like a five or six hour
livestream or something like that I
remember exactly how long it was but all
these tubes and the concepts and the
different things we tried and the failed
bends and we change the loop around
quite a bit was all life streamed and
that was actually done over on Twitch so
if you guys are interested in that it's
just jc2 cents over on Twitch and you
could probably watch the vaad or just
check out the next time we do a live
stream I try to do more of those but
that's what I have left to do I have I
have a custom thing going on down here
that I forgot to bring in from home
again and then I've got to get the SLI
bridge figured out that one tube and
then we fill it and show it to him I'm
glad that this one's almost over because
I've got some other folks that want to
do some collaborations with me on
computer building and I want to move on
to those projects because this one took
entirely too long
heck host Malone had time to go around
the world singing for people multiple
times in the time it took me to build
this thing which is terrible this is
terrible anyway that's beside the point
guys I'm gonna go thanks for watching I
don't know what else to say it'll be
done soon literally we're like right
there at the finish line this is kind of
like running a marathon but then
tripping and falling right at the end to
be honest
I've built this computer like five times
now but the amount times have taken it
apart and put it back together and as
you saw in this video
literally took it apart as far as you
possibly could
I'm gonna go guys thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you in the next
one this one doesn't have me feel like a
rockstar
that was bad I sound depressed a little
bit yeah
well I'm a lot a bit depressed because
I'm done talking about it I don't want
to talk about it anymore
I want it to go off to post Malone and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
