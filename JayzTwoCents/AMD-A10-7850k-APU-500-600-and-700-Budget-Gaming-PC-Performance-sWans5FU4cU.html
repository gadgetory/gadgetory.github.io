two-cent here just playing a little bit
about okay before I wanted to find out
what happens when Jay puts aside some of
his hardware snobbery I went ahead and
built a Kaveri
APU system that's right this little guy
right here is for Dan eight ten seventy
eight fifty K and we tried it out a
couple of different configurations and
we're going to see just how well it
performed when I put away that snobbery
and gave it the fair chance that I think
it really deserves it's absolutely no
surprise that I am a little bit of a
snob when it comes to the hardware parts
that I prefer on my gaming PC's so
instead of doing a long drawn-out
benchmark video where I just throw some
numbers up and let you guys figure it
all out I kind of took a unique approach
to this video I'm gonna tell you the
frames per second average that I was
getting here in battlefield 4 sorry guys
I know some of you guys want to see
other games I choose battlefield 4
because it's pretty much one of the most
demanding games on the market next to
Crysis 3 which I don't even own but
anyway I digress so what I did was I
pretended that I'm going to be a
struggling college student working a
minimum-wage part-time going to school
full time with a very limited budget to
see exactly how much performance you can
squeeze out of every single dollar
because I know plenty of you watching
this video right now are shaking your
head going yup that sounds like me going
to school and make a minimum wage and
I've got to go down to the Salvation
Army to buy my clothes because I am just
poor and broke trust me I've been there
so being the poor college student that I
am now hypothetically back in school
again it's kind of nice to be young
found the Fountain of Youth
it's right here on YouTube take the a
1078 50k we use a data XP g v2 1600
megahertz ram overclocked
to 2133 we also also overclocked the
Kaveri
a10
to 4.5 gigahertz we put it on an MSI a
88x
i AC mini ITX motherboard we put it in a
fractal node 304 and we put well I do
have a water cooler on here but you guys
could put a hyper 212 or something
around the $25.00 range it's going to
cool this apu just fine and it actually
does fit in this case you could fit a
hyper 212 or even a taller cooler in
there and then we put just a basic
cheapest 1 terabyte barracuda drive we
could find in there it was about 59
bucks and there you go that is the
entire system coming in at a grand total
of 490 dollars that's less than five
hundred dollars and it's able to play
battlefield 4 at 30 frames per second
pretty much consistent you would think I
had some sort of a frames per second
limiter going because it just said it 30
frames per second the entire time albeit
on low settings I mean on medium we
still were able to get 30 frames per
second but it dipped down into the low
to mid 20s at times which I didn't find
to be unplayable but it definitely was
noticeable a little bit of input lag now
if you bumped up the IGP you allocated
memory to 2 gigs and boosted the clock a
little bit you got a little bit better
performance but you know for less than
$500 you can still play battlefield 4
and lesser demanding games without any
problems whatsoever now what I did next
was I assumed okay I'm a college student
that I got a raise or I got more hours
and I want to get more performance but
did I lock myself into a guaranteed
bottleneck path am I going to be able to
upgrade this system without having to be
concerned with buying a new CPU and
motherboard and all of that
well what I did next was I took a r7 250
and we put it in dual graphics mode in
here and added the GPU now we gained
about 10 frames per second more on
average for about 40 to 45 frames per
second on medium settings if you put it
down to low it could actually go as high
as the 70s now we all know on PC we want
to take advantage of the better graphics
performance of PC so I bumped it up to
medium and got more frames per second at
the same time now it's important to note
that dual graphics is not like doubling
your performance it's
it's allowing your AI GPU and a
standalone GPU and in this case this
cost less than $100 in fact you could
get for $80 different r7 250 s on the
market and you now are still under $600
for a gaming PC that has dual graphics
capability now being the incredibly nice
guy and lovable character that I am I've
decided to go ahead and give all of you
guys raises all of you struggling
college students you just got a raise
and now you went out and you bought
yourself a brand new r9 270 graphics
card now it's a discrete graphics card
it's decent on performance however it
does not work in dual graphics so the
question I asked myself was did we lose
something now but no longer being able
to utilize the internal GPU on our a10
well the answer is absolutely not and
that's the part that surprised me now
I'm sure the word popping in a lot of
our heads right now is bottlenecking god
I can't believe I just said that word
now we all know that that word kind of
makes me really upset so let's go ahead
and try and limit its use in this video
okay you got it looking at you back
there
fourth row second seat in from the left
looking at you now because I am running
the 14.4 beta drivers here for mantle it
seems to be working that it's taken a
lot of the hardware overhead in the API
out of the equation and is allowing the
GPU to be four more fully utilized by
the APU for instance I'm currently got
85 89 87 86 90 frames per second going
with high settings and two times MSAA
running right now on this a10 with the
r9 270 overclocked to eleven hundred and
thirty megahertz so I'm actually getting
better performance right now I on this
APU and this graphics card with this API
right now this mantle API that I was
when I did the last comparison to this
video when mantle first came out on my
i5 from Intel so that goes to show that
mantle is definitely doing something and
by moving to a discrete graphics card we
didn't lose any performance we're not
bottlenecking it whatsoever okay okay I
hear you guys yeah well you know you put
a really strong graphics card in there
what's going to happen well I'm glad you
guys are thinking that
because now we just got promoted to
manager we bought ourselves gtx 780 now
question is is the gtx 780 going to be
held back at all by being put on an a-10
apu from AMD well let's go ahead install
it right now and i'll let you guys see
firsthand what the experience is really
like
now the cool thing about this upgrade
path is the amount of money it took to
get to the next level let's go ahead and
talk about that real quick I know this
is kind of turning into a long video but
I think there's a lot of information
here that's going to help a lot of you
at making these decisions for yourself
and turning you into a prosumer instead
of being a consumer if you were to build
out just the APU system and the same
configuration I did which could also be
cheaper you could go with a cheaper case
and there are cheaper parts that you
could buy it was 490 dollars less than
500 bucks now if you were to put in the
r7 250 for dual graphics you're looking
at about 580 dollars so still less than
600 bucks you're only looking at 90
dollars more and getting a little bit
more performance now building out the r9
270 system allowed us to maintain all
the same parts but we only spent six
hundred and eighty dollars and we got
discrete graphics which was clearly more
powerful allowing us to bump our
settings up to high and getting us into
the 70 frames per second range now if
you wanted to add a little bit extra
like going with the SSD in there you're
still looking at about 750 dollars by
put adding in 128 terabyte SSD so 750
dollars you'd have yourself an amazing
portable build like this power efficient
doesn't get super hot and it can go to
land parties travel with you and have
all of your gaming capability and you're
not even going to notice the difference
between some sort of a higher-end system
man it really blew my mind at just how
capable this is and now I'm
understanding what some of the future is
going to be with AMD and I'm really
hoping that they can come and bring some
competition here to Intel because it's
only going to help the industry as a
whole for everybody to get better parts
to compete with each other and allows us
as consumers to really benefit in the
battles brings prices down it brings
performance up that's what we need in
this market and the a-10 7850 K is
certainly something that you should
really consider looking at if you're on
a very strict budget and you know what a
month ago I wouldn't have said that
because I didn't have the experience
that I have tonight and the truth of the
matter is this mini ITX system that you
see back here not with the 780 when I
put the 270 back in there that is going
to be my permanent portable rig
I'm not taking that apart I'm very very
happy with his performance so guys have
been Jays two cents obviously I can't
cover everything there is to be about
Kaveri there's just too much information
to put into one video but we are going
to be doing an update to this video a
little bit in the future by utilizing
some faster ramps from 24 hundred
megahertz am and see just how much
performance we can squeeze out of the
internal GPU here on this a10 guys been
Jays two cents I hope you've enjoyed
this video share it with someone that
you think it could help and as always I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
