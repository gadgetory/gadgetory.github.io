bye
you need me
hey whats up guys days two cents here at
the Electronic Entertainment Expo here
2015 we're going to check out some of
the latest games latest technologies
that we're going to go get lost and see
what we can find so let's go
I
recently I picked up a Wii U for the
first time it was actually a present for
a little Jay but one of the things that
she really wanted and the wife really
wanted for the daughter was disney's
infinity we picked up disney's infinity
2.0 at the time you'll had all the
Marvel characters guardians of the
galaxy a lot of the disney princesses
and stuff but disney's infinity 3.0 is
coming out and they're actually adding
to the lineup the Star Wars characters
of course they would do that right after
I by 2 point 0 but that's something that
I'm definitely gonna be interested in
checking out later this year because I'm
a bit of a Star Wars fanatic Little J is
a bit of a Star Wars fanatic and it's
something that I think is going to be
really really fun in fact we're here
checking it out right now they've got
three point 0 on display now it's going
to be some backwards compatibility
between the three point 0 characters and
the crystals with Dizzy's infinity 2
point 0 but just like with 2 point 0 and
1 point 0 there's going to be some
things that you lose out on that
backwards compatibility but look for it
later this year Disney's infinity three
point 0 if you've got kids are you just
a kid yourself or you just like to play
fun cartoon mehak and slashes it's
definitely a game we're checking out
bye
bye
you
okay guys so this wasn't like just some
sort of a freaky wardrobe change this is
day two and we were wandering around III
here checking out some of the latest
that's happening with gaming that's a
lot to take in here in fact this is my
first III and I've never seen so many
games in one place I mean every type of
game you could possibly want to play
whether it be something like Dance Dance
Revolution or dance off or whatever it
may be halo 5 was debuted we just got to
check out the new rise of the Tomb
Raider demo I'm actually kind of excited
about that because I really enjoyed the
first Tomb Raider and it looks like
they're using pretty much the same
engine unfortunately we couldn't take
any footage of that they wouldn't let us
bring in any cameras I got to check out
the new EA battlefront my cameraman and
I we got to a prototype by the way we
both got to play it as a co-op kind of a
survival match again super fun and we
were threatened with certain death if we
brought the camera in there and turned
on the camera so once again make it to
bring you any footage of that it seems
like all the best stuff here at e3 is
sorry no cameras allowed which kind of
is like why do I even have a press badge
at that point one thing I do want to
point out though is if you're a PC gamer
like I am all the demos that we're
seeing here especially with titles that
are going to be on PC that I'm excited
about are all being demoed on consoles
either play stations or xboxes so I mean
it's really hard to get a sense of what
the graphics are going to be like if
battle yays battlefront you know dai CA
they're the ones making battlefront
which is kind of like battlefield but
for Star Wars if the graphics actually
look pretty damn good considering their
own console little pixelated a little
blocky but I mean then again look at the
platform that they're running on but if
it's any indicator of what to expect
later on this year when battlefront
launches is something I'm actually
really excited to check out I love Star
Wars you guys know how to feel that
battlefield and it was a great franchise
that looks like it's making its way over
to Star Wars same thing with tomb raider
but tomb raider i don't think there's
going to be any surprise when it comes
to the graphics it really looks like
they're using all the same
engines the same day p is in fact even
the sounds sound like they were
completely recycled from the original
tomb raider that we you know checked out
a couple years ago but with a whole new
gameplay style more customizations it
looks like a whole lot of fun while we
were here we also check out DX racer I'm
going to be checking out their iron
series chair which is a little bit
smaller since I've slimmed down quite a
bit the King series chair which was
great for a big guy it's a bit big for
me now so we'll be checking out that in
the future now there's more things to
check out here there's an awful lot of
square footage here war games so we're
going to get more hands-on today I guess
I'm going to hold a controller I can't
really get around that today so I guess
let's go ahead and see what we find
someone's coming to give you surprise
buttsecks
now I'm used to really big trade shows
like CES that take up an entire week
like monday to friday and millions of
square feet worth of convention space
taking up all of the latest in tech and
it's easy to understand why you would
need a whole week to see it but i was
quickly kind of surprised that EA or III
is technically three days long when it's
just a couple of small convention floor
halls worth of games I'm quickly
realizing that really it's just three
days of waiting in line to play demos
and I want to point out but this is a
Star Fox zero demo and it is one of the
shortest lines that I've seen yet today
so really it should just be waiting
convention okay so we've made our way
over here to the razor booth it's a
little bit different than what they
showcase at CES now the Razer Kraken
headset was one of the most popular
headset that they've ever sold one of
the biggest complaints they had was that
it only came in razor green but this
time this year they're actually they did
a couple of different colors now we've
got white and we've got black now I
think the white su looks the best in my
opinion and it's got a black Razer logo
on top the black headset has a green
inner band as well as green logo on the
top but it still looks good if you're
really proud of the razor brand and you
want to show off the green but other
anyway they're showing off a couple new
headsets here color variants of the very
popular Kraken another thing they're
showing off over here is their new
extended line of promo stuff which is
like they have the new chrome emmaus
which is RGB controllable as well as the
chroma mouse pad which is an RGB lit and
mouse pad which is kind of neat so
here's what's brazzers showing up over
here at e3 and 2015
ok so we've wandered over here now so
probably what is one of the most cutting
edge pieces of technology we're going to
look at here at all of e3 all games are
completely put to shame i don't care
halo 5 Dark Souls 3 or dark souls with
the Dark Souls 3 or 2 I don't even know
three that's why I thought okay it
doesn't matter what you're looking at
here today nothing beats the Atari 800
