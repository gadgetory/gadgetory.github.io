coming at you live from my brand new
revamped home office slash YouTube
studio it looks awesome in here the
color is very comfortable and I love
being in this room but now I'm fighting
a little bit of an echo problem that's
okay we'll figure it all out so bear
with me if you hear some echo otherwise
let's go ahead and take a look at
something nerdy now I promised you guys
that I was going to review some
affordable high quality components here
for your systems and today we're going
to be taking a look at the cooler master
v6 50 now this is actually the VSM 650
now what is the VSM stand for well I
think it stands for very sexy
merchandise well it's probably a lot
more likely that it actually stands for
the V semi modular and it kind of says
it on the box if you read English there
it is right there and there it is now
this is very similar to the V Series
power supply took a look at last year
they goes on November or something there
v series is this is kind of their top
tier power supply line now but the 650
obviously is 650 watts is available in
several different nominal wattages but
the V 650 is semi modular where the
standard V 600 700 800 1000 or even the
1200 which I'm currently using in this
guy behind me those are fully modular
these are semi modular which allows them
to take their try tested and proven gold
rated power supplies here and I'll make
them a little bit more affordable now
let's go ahead and talk about some specs
on this bad boy this thing is featuring
a single 12 volt rail 648 watt peak
output at well peak output and it does
feature a 120 millimeter hybrid ball
bearing fan now what's cool about that
is as you can see the fan doesn't start
to ramp up until loading increases to
about 50% and then the vent the fan will
ramp up from there and what that does is
it keeps a nice quiet fan profiles
you don't have your power supply adding
to the noise of your system now what
really helps in keeping this thing with
that gold standard and a nice low power
curve here nice quiet power curve for
the fan is the fact that this thing is
feature featuring very high quality
components it's got a 100% Japanese
capacitors solid capacitors on here
which really help with the power
delivery and that is what's helping keep
this thing nice and cool now with that
80% or that 80 plus gold rating that
means you're not going to be pulling as
much juice from the wall which makes
this a very efficient power supply
allowing you to get the power that
you're paying for from the plug making
it to the system rather than converting
it to heat and just exhausting it to the
atmosphere which might as well just be
pennies going into nowhere now when it
comes to specs as I mentioned we're
going to kind of move along here we do
have a hundred and forty millimeters by
150 millimeters by eighty six
millimeters so what does that mean that
means this is a very small power supply
now this is designed to be able to fit
in small form-factor builds which is
perfect for ITX micro ATX and as you can
see right here here is your power supply
it's a nice little short guy I'm not
making not saying anything if you're
short out there back you know these do
say great things come in small packages
but as you can see we do have one two
three four modular cables right there
which are clearly going to be your
savior plugs you do get let's say medium
quality wall plug it could be a little
bit heavier then again we're only
dealing with 650 Watts here now when it
comes to the peripheral cables
peripheral a couple rolls they are
featuring all black flat cables and this
makes it a lot easier to route behind
your motherboard tray if you're dealing
with really tight spaces they're not
super heavy density cables or heavy
gauge cable so they're as you can see
they're really easy to kind of maneuver
here which is good but you've got it
looks like a four SATA on there you've
got
another force data right there and then
three molex and three molex with a
floppy drive why do you guys keep
putting floppy drives on these power
supplies and not just Coolermaster I
mean Corsair coolermaster Roswell EVGA I
don't get it why do you guys keep
putting the floppy drive are you guys
really coming across that many 3.5 inch
floppy drives out there a three and a
quarter floppy drives me okay so the
power supply as you can see does feature
a nicely embossed v6 50 on there with
Coolermaster logo nice vented rear plate
here that gives you perfect you know
opening for exhaust you do have a toggle
switch which is which is good I don't
like power supplies that do not have a
toggle switch this is very important if
you need to quickly cut power to your
system 120 millimeter ball bearing fan
with a nice the nice shield on here for
the fan I do like the honeycomb look on
there as with most power supplies I have
a serious gripe and I think you guys may
already know what that is can you figure
out what it is I don't like about this
that's right guys medium density
sleeving rainbow colors now this isn't
the only power supply that I've had this
gripe about EVGA corsair roswell
I hate medium sleeving
that you can see through with
multicolored cables you've got this
gorgeous black cable here continue the
trend through the rest of the build for
the love of God that way you can get
without having to buy any extra sleeping
or extensions you can maintain a
singular color theme how expensive our
black cables that companies are not
doing this that is my only gripe about
this power supply is this leaving so my
master I love you guys I've been
supporting you guys for nearly 20 years
as long as I've been working on
computers from being a kid all the way
up through an adult but this is just
blasphemy alright enough about the
cables
four months of this is what matters if
you're the person that's on a super
budget you need a small form-factor
power supply that gives you high
efficiency high output solid capacitors
you know gold rated efficiency semi
modular so you can use the plugs you
need leave out the ones you want and you
can get past the sleeving on this this
is certainly something that you should
consider for your build I mean really
when it comes to the cost of performance
ratio I can get past the sleeving
especially if it's going in something
that doesn't have a window or you're
going to be using cable extensions to
kind of give yourself a color theme
anyway but this is the perfect size
power supply for a small form-factor
build and the efficiency it's going to
allow for it to be a lot cooler power
supply that's not going to be heating up
your case especially if you're dealing
with small form-factor which this would
really come in handy yet so guys the
cooler master v6 50 gold rated power
supply tell me what you guys think they
showed us this power supply line at CES
back in January and here it is now
definitely take a look at this if you're
looking at building yourself a high
quality system on the inexpensive so
guys been Jays two cents make sure you
follow on Twitter for up-to-date just
ramblings and rantings of mine really
and as always I will see you in my next
video or maybe TED talk or Twitter or
something almost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
