here bringing you kind of a little vlog
video and it's something that I feel is
kind of rare on this channel but I feel
it's entirely warranted and let me tell
you why last August I accepted a
partnership with aqua tuning and aqua
tuning is a brand that I had absolutely
no problems of putting their logo on my
channel because it's a brand that i have
used for many years and they represent
brands that are very very widely used in
the industry especially with water
cooling like alphacool and phobia now
that partnership has turned out to be
very good for my channel and you guys
told me you guys didn't have a problem
with with myself taking a partnership on
my channel as long as I continue to
bring you unbiased and completely
open-minded and fully my opinion when it
comes to reviews think I've done a
pretty good job over the last four or
five months proving you guys that Jays
two cents is not for sale my opinions
will continue to be my own they made it
very clear to aqua tuning that my
opinions will always be my own I will be
reviewing your competitors and there
will be absolutely no censorship
absolutely no censorship on the channel
I think I've proven that now i'm doing
this video tonight because i want to let
you guys know about a brand new
partnership that's going to be happening
here on the channel starting februari
first and depending on where you're
watching this it's already februari
first factor could be februari first by
the time i get this up I don't even know
I have no idea what I'm doing half the
time in this YouTube arena so this
partnership that I have just put into
place is and is this actually been quite
a while in the making by the way is
cooler master now tell me you guys
didn't see that coming right why did Jay
take a partnership with cooler master
cooler master is a company just like
opportunity that I had been using since
I was a kid I mean they've they've come
a long way from making very basic cases
back in the 90s all the way up through
high end you know flat platinum power
supplies you know making amazing coolers
and I feel very confident that they're a
brand that I have absolutely no problems
or reservations with putting their logo
on my channel in my intro now what does
that mean does that mean that if you
guys asked me which is better corsair or
coolermaster between two different cases
or if you guys are asking me to compare
this cooler to a cooler master cooler
does it mean I'm going to automatically
by default go to the cooler master item
that you have listed absolutely not
that's not the way j works that would
kind of be selling out and that is not
what I'm about I'm simply bringing
awareness to the brand saying hey
coolermaster brand that you should check
out and if you like their products go
ahead and buy cooler master and in
exchange for not only that you guys get
to benefit because they've agreed to
give me a ten percent off coupon code
jay is 2k14 it's down in the description
that you can use in the CM store here in
the United States and get ten percent
off anything in the store so you guys
get to benefit in that way other than
that really nothing's going to change
with the channel I mean it's no
different than when i took the Aqua
tuning sponsorship or partnership I
don't like calling it sponsorship
because really they're not they're not
sponsoring what I do except for maybe an
aqua tuning video where I take a look at
a phobia or an optical product the rest
of it is is you know it's not
sponsorship it's a partnership and
that's the way that I look at it so guys
I just want to let you know full
transparency it's the way I believe to
do things here on YouTube letting you
guys know what the channel is doing and
where i'm going with things because a
lot of you really look up to my opinion
when it comes to this you know
do-it-yourself pc market and i just want
you guys to know that everything i'm
doing here is to better the content is
to continue to bring you content and the
highest quality content that I possibly
can so you guys can feel confident that
Jays two cents is going to continue to
bring you the unbiased uncentered 100%
my opinion content here on Jays two
cents you guys have absolutely nothing
to worry about so I'm gonna get out of
here i'm actually going to disneyland
tomorrow morning with the family and
we're gonna have a great time i hope you
guys have a great evening and don't
forget check out the description for
that coupon code if you are looking at
buying anything from coolermaster to
save yourself ten percent other than
that guys i might get on out of here and
i appreciate you guys being followers
and supporters of this channel
regardless of what you made
to do from here on out and as always
guys I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
