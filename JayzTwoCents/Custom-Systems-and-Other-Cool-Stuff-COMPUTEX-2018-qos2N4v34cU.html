sponsored by EVGA EVGA offers a wide
range of products including GPUs cases
power supplies motherboards and more to
learn how to take your rig to the next
level head to EVGA calm a little bit
humid today not too bad it rained last
night though and yes let's go see what
we can find today all right so this is
the inception project right here this is
what it looks like when you get a whole
bunch of experts in modders together to
basically see what kind of a PC display
they can make specifically for Computex
so bass you basically each one of these
is kind of like a different platform
different GPUs different CPUs all
water-cooled I believe it's one massive
loop controlling all of it you can see
at the bottom all the rows of pumps
there yeah this is basically a bunch of
modders came together they built this in
a month just one month the entire
display you can see the wall everything
it's on just to kind of showcase you
know what Computex is all about extreme
pcs both new tech old tech and this is
just sort of a collaborative effort to
show what they can come up with and
there you go so I'm a pretty firm
believer that the AI OS that are
available outside of the US are so much
better than what's available inside the
u.s. because of the ASA tech patent so
this is actually an ID cooling a IO you
can see out here you've got much better
fittings that are on the radiators
sleeve tubing the block and pump design
just look better this is an example of
what can happen we don't have a patent
just sort of destroying an industry as
far as I'm concerned so if you live
outside of the US ID cooling is
definitely an option and this is me this
leaving right here is sort of like a
carbon sort of a clip color but of
course they support all your major
sockets and you know thread river and am
for Intel and 360 cooling 360 rads you
can see they've also got it plumbed into
a Poseidon right here and so this is an
expandable unit and just yeah obviously
you can see what happens when there's no
ASA tech involved all right so here's a
mod that we're taking a look at here
this is over at the gamer storm booth
this is based off of one of the
stellar cases which believe is a deep
cool case but this one as you can see is
more of a stormtrooper sort of a theme I
kind of teased it a little bit yesterday
in my intro but check this out so
they've kind of cut open the top here so
that you can see down inside of it and
it's got this very I'm a sort of an
Imperial look I've also got a
distribution plate built in you can see
this right here so this is a
distribution plate and then down here
where the main components are you can
see you got your CPU block
you've got your it's a narrow cool fan
controller right there and yeah this is
this is pretty neat great nothing too
crazy but definitely a very clean look
but of course completely topped off with
the Stormtrooper on top this is just
another example of what you can do with
a quad stellar this one's called Project
crater again a lot of milling done to
this a lot of cutting to kind of show
you what's you know capable of just
opening this up
typically the quad stellar just has a
lot of compartmentalization part
mentalization where each compartment
basically has different components in it
usually power supply motherboard
graphics card IO but as you can see in
this case fully water-cooled we've got
another AC so we'll get to a C's
Poseidon cards in there and we've got a
horizontally mounted reservoir right on
top so this is the Silverstone LD o 3
and as you can see this kind of has a
very vertical sort of a cube design and
it's tempered glass on all sides it's
got a ventilation on the top so it looks
like with the top cover and the front
panel off so it's definitely a successor
to like the FTO 3 this seems like it'd
be a lot easier to build in for me
though a little bit extra a little bit
more space but once you take all the
side panels off you can get to all sides
it's definitely a lot easier but yeah
it's obviously got a little bit of
heritage there with that particular case
here we've got an 8k mod building one of
the Kate's labs SMA 8 revision 2 cases
so obviously you can see you've got your
LED fans your LED mid plate I know it
comes with a lit mid plate normally I
don't know if it's an add-on anyway
it's RGB is available but you can see
that it's got the glass side the glass
front over here we've got oh I'm just
going to show you his name because I
don't want to absolutely mutilate it for
you but if you look this right here is
based on the Coolermaster see 700 P and
we've got a lot of obviously fabrication
work done on the front got a completely
custom internal here with an ITX
motherboard fully water-cooled with bits
power parts and looks like we also got
some RGB memory going on right here so
this is a sleek-looking build this over
here is a safe disc and panda pc so
we've got a whole bunch of their
hexagonal reservoirs that are kind of
daisy chained together here to make a
real cool sort of a distribution block
and open chassis so this is a completely
custom built by ice freeze you can see a
massive reservoir that has a venturi
effect that's I've you know on purpose
normally you want to avoid victories but
that one's on purpose you can see it's
in this all glass reflective glass box
and then here are all the components on
the inside very different obviously but
this is just some of what they're
showcasing over here at the bits power
booth at Computex okay so I'm over here
at the inner max booth right now and
they're showing kind of a basically it's
a liters per hour demonstration of their
pump versus kind of a typical AIO maybe
something like an ASA Tech and so
they're saying 450 litres per hour with
the EF one pump versus a typical 65
litre per hour or they're going to show
right here is just a head-to-head
demonstration between both pumps and you
can see how quickly their pump is
actually you know moving the fluid
versus a standard a IO
so as you can see the ef-1 pumps
definitely moving more fluid it's
identical setup - it's important to note
same tubing diameters same exact
reservoir same exact tubing lengths so
you can see it's definitely moving more
fluid this right here is probably one of
the largest cases I've personally seen
any long time to give you a reference
that right there in the mid plane that's
a 360 red and that's laying horizontally
480 obviously in the bottom another 480
on the top probably one of the largest
cases I've seen let's see if I can find
anything for reference oh I don't know
that's why I give you a pretty good idea
all right so this is the in whimsy tower
this is actually based off of a mod
there's two of them here there's a
silver one back there as you can see
this looks an awful lot like an art
piece as you can see this is a computer
chassis don't make any mistakes about it
it obviously gets a huge crowd of people
coming and looking at it because it is
just so different in wind is really
known for just trying to one-up
themselves all the time because I mean
we've seen some crazy Chas he's come for
them right the D frame the S frame the H
frame and every single year they find a
way to just make it bigger and badder
and crazier now availability on this
they're telling me they they might have
three available in q3 no idea what the
total quantity is going to be but the
estimated price is looking like it's
gonna be somewhere around five thousand
dollars now obviously all of that is
subject to change this is the first time
this chassis has been shown and you know
you guys obviously got to pay attention
for more information but as you can see
this this definitely gathers a lot of
attention because it is just so
different now each this total chassis
weight is about 90 pounds in fact
they've got some pieces over here on the
table as you can see it's got five five
of these pieces here connect to the
frame to give you this sort of a twisted
look and that's how you access the
actual frame on the inside it's pretty
typical internal construction as you can
see for mounting things like your
motherboard and your power supply grab
fans this does obviously qualify as an
open chassis yeah this is gonna be one
of those things that who knows how many
they make and again that price is
subject to change but a 90-pound chassis
basically handmade hand sanded hand
polished and each one that becomes
available will have that same treatment
all hand polished and sanded that is a
massive amount of human work hours that
go into making these chassis x' so right
Leonie right now we're taking a look at
some desks this one doesn't actually
have a name but the reason why we're
even talking about this is Brion moved
into a new condo in Long Beach which if
you guys have ever had downtown living
life in you know space is a concern so
they've got a fully water-cooled build
on display here again this table has no
name but it is fully height adjustable
you can see you got a control panel
right here on the side we've got some
front side USB connectors audio
connectors there isn't HDMI on the
preview on the current model but this
one doesn't appear to have one but the
reason why we've been talking about this
is we're gonna be doing a built for
Brian in his new condo he's really
interested in these types of desk builds
and I'm really interested in water
cooling one of them and you guys have
been asking me quite a bit to do
something like that and so it looks like
this is gonna be our opportunity I
apologize about the glare that's
obviously it's a glass top but he can
fit a 360 millimetre rad in the front a
240 or 280 red right here on the back
you could also fit a 120 there is a
massive amount of ventilation as you can
kind of see going through to the ground
we got some vents up here underneath
where the reservoirs are there's
actually a horizontal reservoir right
there so the idea is it's pulling air in
from the front the you know technically
your crotch I guess so I mean there's
that but it's pulling an air from the
user side of the case blowing it through
to the back and exhausting out right
here your power supply is right over
there and all of your i/o and
motherboard as you can see goes right
here it's good to see in there a little
better now we have the glass top taken
off pretty easy to work in I guess
everything you would need to access is
right here there's a water pump here
your graphics card they've didn't they
didn't incorporate in their loop but
they just bent around it and then you
can see right here the ventilation is at
an angle so that obviously as you sit at
the desk you bring your knees up you're
not going to bump into the desk but you
still get the depth you need back here
on the rear side
so it's pretty well thought out design
so we can't come to Lee and Lee now talk
about some of their cases this was
actually the 11 dynamic this was a
devourer build their Bower built this
and as you can see it's quite a bit of
water cooling so you got three there's a
radiator on the side here actually this
is a slim 360 you've got to fix 360s on
the top and on the bottom so one the top
one that's bottom you got three 360s in
here a lot of fans obviously stuff room
for your reservoir force your RGB
extension cables that you've seen your a
lot of youtubers really do reviews on
and the typical brushed aluminum real
nice real classy look you'd expect from
Lee and Lee lots of airflow I feel ton
of air coming out at the top you would
you would kind of think that something
like this might be a little bit air
restricted but no absolutely not
something else that Lindley has actually
decided to start selling as a limited
edition kyusyu to be on my videos I
don't volunteer
everyone knows this video what happens
when you start to b-roll the B roller so
what happens when a suits an ASA tech
team up well you get an all new style a
IO cooler that actually has an OLED
screen built into it that is
customizable as you can see so asus is
getting into the ro or the ROG is
actually getting into the a io market
you can see this one right here this is
the on a Maximus X it's very large it's
obviously to accommodate the adjustable
RGB as well as the OLED screen built in
and then we have a smaller version over
here as you can see which looks very
more reminiscent to an ASA tech coolidge
you expect to see but once again an
AMOLED screen built in to the actual top
itself so you can customize that in the
ROG software too well
RGB was the thing and asus is taken to
the next level by obviously putting in a
screen other than that it's just an ASA
tech cooler so it's the RG gaming dream
machine right here this is actually a
two chamber chassis this is a concept of
something that are looking to maybe
produce it's actually both chambers can
actually move
all the cooling is located down here in
the bottom as well as the power supply
and then up on the top we have an ITX
base risin 2700 X system that is
water-cooled you can see here we have
what looks like a Poseidon card or some
sort of a Asus card looks like a
Poseidon to me and then if we come over
here to the side you can actually see
into all the components and on the back
you can see the pass-through fittings
they've made for the water cooler itself
the chassis does move up and down though
I don't know how to do it so I don't my
gonna do it myself but this is something
they're looking at potentially and bring
it to market when I don't know that's
most common thing you're gonna hear in
Computex is that's really cool but when
is it available the answer is well maybe
we don't know so how much you guys think
of this dream machine from ROG
all right so we're looking at here is
these Asus Zenbook throw you know Apple
kind of has the touch bar
well they've taken it a step further and
they've taken the actual touch pad which
you would normally use to control the
device and turned it into a functional
display we've seen something similar to
this from Razer in the past where the
10-key doubled as a screen underneath
the buttons but this is different so be
pulled down right here you can see you
get a menu agree up a calculable so pull
down from the top you get a calculator
you can go to the home screen you can
grandpa so Google Chrome you can
actually make this the full display too
for the computer so this will show up as
a second display right now there are
five apps actually created for this holy
crap ugh I love those five apps created
for this they have more coming online
later on but this is a what's new here
from a suits and the Zen butt bro you
know I had no idea that asrock actually
made graphics cards what were you
looking at right here is actually some
AMD graphics cards from as rocks we got
rx 560 you've got a 550 572 an Rx 56 are
big of 56 but as you know with the Vega
that's just a AMD built deck card and
they give it their own label and stuff
on it but if you guys knew that as well
made graphics cards then you knew
something that I didn't which makes you
smarter than me but do you probably
already knew that I wanted to check out
some stuff at MSI before we left we
actually were sent one of their new thin
laptops before the show so fortunately I
already have that but allow me to show
you one of the reasons why I'm not
really going up there there's a huge sea
of people
alright guys that's gonna wrap up our
day to you oh hey look Microsoft I
wonder if any their pcs need an update
probably anyway guys that's gonna wrap
up day two for us hope you guys have
enjoyed what you've seen so far tomorrow
we're gonna be heading over to some of
the private suites so we'll see what
we're gonna get shown there but check
out all these Microsoft computers here
I'm sure we can find at least one that
is a bricked 18:03 build or maybe even
waiting for an update whatever guys
we're gonna go thanks for watching as
always let us know if there's anything
specifically you'd love for us to check
out otherwise I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
