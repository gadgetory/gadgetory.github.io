and today I have in front of me the
fractal design arc mini r2 this is a
brand-new case and fractal designs
lineup aimed right at micro ATX board
users so we'll go ahead and take a look
at this and see exactly what you get
from fractal design fractal design is a
company that's kind of emerged on the
market over the last couple of years and
they are a Swedish company and they are
really making a name for themselves
they've been pretty much known in the
past for having some really elegant
looking cases with the brushed aluminum
design in fact I've done a review on my
channel here earlier in the year with
one of their fractal our fours and RR to
excel cases and I love the quality but
they've listened to you guys and some of
the things that people have said in
general that they'd like to see changed
with their cases and so that's exactly
what they've done they've taken the arc
MIDI r2 and they've created the arc mini
r2 which is just a smaller compact
version of that case and it's a they fit
a lot of design in this case in a very
small package it's got two five and a
quarter Bay's it's got six three and a
half inch bays and it's also got two two
and a half inch bays dedicated to SSDs
and all of the three and a half inch
bays are compatible with SSDs as well
expansion slots you've got four plus one
PCI slots on there you've got two
frontside USB 3.0 so you've got your ATX
power supplies up to 170 millimeters in
length graphics cards up to 260
millimeters in links so you could fit
pretty decent sized graphics cards in
their support CPU coolers up to 165
millimeters tall and it does have 20
millimeters of space for cable routing
on the back of the case so that gives
you a pretty good amount of depth to be
able to stack cables on top of each
other when doing your cable management
necessary now for cooling that's
included with this case here you have
120 millimeter silent fan in the front
and 120 millimeter fan expandable on the
front
included so you can fit 220 mils in
there you do have 120 millimeter 1200
RPM fan in the rear and you have one
included 120 millimeter thousand RPM fan
on the top so they're very silent
operation fans they are all hydraulic
bearings and then you do have expansion
for either 120 or 140 millimeter in the
top or you can put 3 120 millimeters on
the top of this mini case which is
pretty cool that that much fan space in
such a small case it does have one fan
controller that can control up to 3 fans
5 7 7 9 and 12 volt and which is pretty
much standard for all of their cases and
all of the inputs all on this are dust
filtered now water cooling compatibility
is one of the things that they really
listen to the public on and have put a
lot of radiator support in this case in
fact this one mid tower case is this
fairly small case can fit a front 240
millimeter radiator with using the
removing the harddrive cages in the very
front you can fit a 240 or 360
millimeter in the top and you can use
and that does require removal of the
optical drive cages by the way you can
fit a 120 millimeter in the bottom as
well as a 120 millimeter in the rear so
you could really fit a lot of rads in
here if that's what you want to do now
we're gonna see how well they pack this
because FedEx kind of did a number on
this we've got some caved in on the top
bent in corners all of these are ripped
up the bottom looks a little bit soft
soft we're going to see just how well
they pack this because UPS or FedEx is
did some FedEx this time of year just
does quite a number on these cases so
let's just go ahead and get in here
and it does it is packed with hard foam
and this hard foam on this case is
cracked as you can see right there but
it does look like the foam took the
brunt of the abuse and not the case
which is very loud and annoying no which
is very important so looks to me like
our case is intact I don't see any
damage on here over there so you got a
product manual right here all about the
case check that out later but the design
on this case is very very it's very
elegant but yet it's it's still gamer
one of the things that I like about this
case is that it does include a smoked
side window as you can see right here go
ahead and take that off so when you get
a look at the inside it's a nice very
rigid side panel it is slightly smoked
as you can see right there the
motherboard side will check the depth
and see if they lied or they told the
truth on that 20 mil mic line to believe
they told the truth and yeah it is it's
pretty deep I mean I can get my finger
down in there and I have a snausage
finger so but as you can see right here
these are your SSD supports and what's
nice about this is the way that these
are mounted on there the screws come in
through the back rather than the front
some cases in the past had you had to
screw them in below the motherboard then
put the motherboard on which made
upgrading your hard drives or changing
out your hard drives a lot harder but
this is they change the design you have
two SSD cages right here you can see you
have nice wire management that's already
zip-tied here and ready to go for you
got your box of fractal hardware and on
the front
we've got this nice simulated brushed
metal front panel this is plastic but
it's simulated brush you have your front
grille right here which you just click
comes right off and it is a foamy mesh
material so it's nice and easy to clean
that and here is the 120 millimeter fan
that's included with the expandable slot
right there I really like how easy it is
to get these these off that's really
really quick and easy so you can see
here you do have the one two three four
five six
expandable three-and-a-half inch drives
now what you can do is you can remove
the hard drive cage as mentioned this is
very similar to the other hard drive
cages you can remove this one altogether
if you want for better air flow so you
have direct airflow from that fan
through the case or you can take it and
turn it sideways so if you are having
optical drive our hard drives in their
data storage it flows more smoothly
through the case now what you're also
able to do is you can remove this lower
hard drive cage completely which gives
you access to 240 millimeter radiator
support in the front and then on the top
here this is one of the really cool
designs for the this fractal case and
how they have great radiator support on
such a small design if you slide this
panel off you can see once again it is
all mesh filtered so you're not getting
all kinds of dust in there but look at
this they have an offset design so
instead of centering the fan intakes
here on the center of the case they've
pushed them towards the front which is
where the window is that way you don't
have it interference with the radiator
and the fans hitting the motherboard vrm
heat sinks which is really common when
it comes to small case form-factor
now as mentioned you will have to remove
the optical bay drive cage here if you
want to go with a 360 millimeter
radiator and they are all screwed in
everything is screwed on this it's not
riveted so you have nice easy removable
cages and things giving you full
customized
solutions here for going with a small
form-factor that's also water-cooled so
overall I think the design of this case
is very sturdy it's not flimsy I mean I
can't twist it it's all metal design the
only plastic that I see here appears to
be the lower filter which is right here
for the power supply and the front bezel
right here which also houses on the top
all of your front panel interactions
with the case your USB 3.0 and your fan
controller which is right here is a
little slider switch so there you go oh
and last but not least all of the
cabling that comes included with the
case is all sleeved black so it's nice
and stealthy looking overall it's a very
fantastic design I'm very pleased with
it it doesn't appear that there was any
damage on this and shipping it's a great
case go and check it out at fractal
designs website I'll put it down in the
description if you're looking at
building a small form-factor that uses a
micro ATX or maybe a mini ITX this is
definitely a great solution large
motherboard cut out couldn't ask for a
better case for the money at this size
so there you go guys fractal designs
mini r2 the arc minute r2 check it out
thanks for watching as always if you
enjoyed this video you know what to do
you know which button to mash if you
didn't you also know what you can do
with the video and hope to see you guys
next time on J sees us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
