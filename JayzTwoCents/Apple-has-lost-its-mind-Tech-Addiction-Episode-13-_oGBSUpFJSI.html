December 23rd 2012 you're watching tech
addiction with James two cents we've got
some things to cover today we're going
to make it a quick one I've got very
little time because of the holidays but
I did not want to skip on this week's
tech addiction because this will be this
year's last tech addiction until after
the new year because I've just got too
much going on and so let's just get
right down to it whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa stop the music stop stop I almost
forgot to tell you guys about my brand
new channel i started it's my second
channel it's a vlog channel it's about
all the things I want to talk about and
bring to you that aren't related to
technology like my weight loss and just
some of the things I'm doing a lot of
you wanted to see a little bit more
about me so I decided to go ahead and
start a second channel I'd like you guys
go ahead and check it out you can see as
a button it's gonna appear like right
about there there click that button
right there and you can be taken my
second channel hit the subscribe button
check it out if you like it stick around
if not we'll always see here right here
on Jays two cents the NRA is at it again
the NRA stands for the National Rifle
Association which is a gun club here in
the United States of America because of
the recent shooting in Connecticut the
NRA as well as other gun enthusiasts in
the united states have been under fire
to tighten up the laws when it comes to
gun control in the united states but
because they need somewhere else to
focus that attention it needs someone
else to take the blame for violence they
decided to lash out against the video
game industry and here is what they
officially had to say there exists in
this country sadly a callous corrupt and
corrupting industry that sells and so is
violence against its own people through
vicious violent video games with names
like bulletstorm grand theft auto Mortal
Kombat and splatter house some people
have asked for my two cents regarding
this matter on stricter gun control and
whether or not guns should be allowed in
the United States and here's my answer I
am very pro-second amendment I come from
a military family but I also feel that
you have to be able to respect the
weapon I have a rifle I have a handgun
and I plan on buying more but my
official political view on this is this
is never going to kill anybody this is
going to kill somebody this is gonna
kill somebody not this this is simply a
tool to carry out somebody's will and
whether or not you respect such a weapon
like this or you have any respect
whatsoever when it comes to firearms is
not
going to change whether or not tragedies
like this happen anywhere in the world I
find it very interesting though that the
NRA is attacking the video game industry
because there is a longer history of
violence when it comes to moviemaking
there are billions of dollars made every
single year when it comes to the movie
industry and violence they seem to be
choosing video games as their catalyst
of what is causing these types of issues
in the United States because they feel
that it's something that you control in
it it desensitizes kids to the idea of
death and the fact that you can respond
or you don't die I think that's a really
stupid stance to take and in my opinion
the NRA on this one is entirely wrong
and they need to just they seriously
need to disassociate themselves when it
comes to politics because bro you're
doing it wrong lap was at it again
they're up to their shenanigans now what
they're doing is they're blocking a
particular small startup company from
developing any sort of accessory or plug
that utilizes the lightning adapter in
the new iphone 5 and the new iPad or the
ipad mini this company happened to raise
over a hundred and thirty-nine thousand
dollars on Kickstarter towards their
cause to bring a universal device and
charging station that could charge your
iphone 5s ipad mini's your android your
other tablets all by interfacing with
various types of connectors to give you
a single simple micro USB output so you
could take any single device that you
have plug it into a mini USB and you're
good to go the problem here is that
Apple's decided that they're going to go
ahead and incorporate new rules when it
comes to what's allowed to be integrated
into their I devices it has ruled that
it is forbidding any sort of third party
adapters whatsoever to be used with
their brand new I devices using the
lightning adapter which means that third
parties also are not allowed to
incorporate the 30 pin to lightning port
adapter in an effort to bring you a
cheaper adapter than the $29 cost of the
current apple branded lightning to
30-pin adapter the scene that has just
released its list of the top 25 most
anticipated games of 2013 I'm going to
go ahead and give you the top 10 games
on their list because I just don't

okay lastly gizmodo has given some of
the top tech companies in the world a
report card and let's go ahead here
gizmodo's had to say about some of the
tech giants in 2012 first up we've got
facebook who got a B+ overall it says
Facebook shines is a social darling with
some social issues looking forward to
another great year some of the notes
that they have here under social skills
it says universally loved facebook won't
listen to what anyone else says darn it
but we just love it too much and we use
it every single day so they got a B+
next up is Google who also got a B+ this
was a good year for Google's growth they
grown quite a bit it says social skills
are a little bit awkward they mean well
but they don't click very well with
their peers they keep trying to show off
their social network Google+ which is
just really not taking off whatsoever
next up we've got Apple Apple came in
with a b-minus as you can see being
beaten out by facebook and google says
apple's teachers pit it's a post avoid
it seems like it's in a little bit of a
rut inner turmoil fights with classmates
and won't talk about it at all which is
making for a very frustrating year for
Apple social skills that says apple
doesn't make it easy to get along I
message breaks all the time the company
is suing everyone it can and it pushed
away its BFF Google and had to draw its
own mats which was mocked by the rest of
its class and sent a lot of people in
Australia to the Outback to die
apparently an apple felt that people
should die in the outback
and it says Apple for the first time in
its life gave an earnest apology for
something using words that made it sound
like a real human well guys
unfortunately I don't have a technology
dumbass of the Week this week because I
just didn't have time to go out and
research something but what I am going
to bring you this week is the top list
of technologies that people threaten to
quit in 2012 topping out the list is
Facebook and as you know in 2012
Facebook forced everyone to use its new
timeline format a lot of people bitched
and complained store that they would
never use Facebook again oh this is the
end of Facebook we don't care blah blah
blah you're stupid we don't want to use
Facebook anymore because we don't like
the looks of it well guess what all of
you are still using facebook facebook is
still growing when it comes to its users
every single day and its brand new
registered users so all of you who
threatened to quit I adventure to say
that most of you are still using it and
I would be one of them Spotify came in
at number two apparently people quit it
because of the fact that it required you
to use facebook and then everyone would
know that you were listening to Taylor
Swift come in at number three we've got
google people threaten to quit using
anything Google because of the fact that
they can spy on you they know where you
are they're in cahoots with the
government they do the maps they are
just if you look at the terms and
agreements of a lot of their location
services they are constantly spying on
you so a lot of people have threatened
to quit google for the simple fact that
they just simply don't like the amount
of privacy that google is taking away
from its users but then again no one's
forcing you to use it so if you don't
like it quit coming in at number four we
have a list of games diablo 3 Mass
Effect 3 battlefield 3 basically
anything any in 23 and the reasons given
for that we're all three of these games
have crapped storylines they had crap
endings they all require internet
connections and there's no real offline
mode see battlefield 2 used to have like
a bot mode where you could go in there
and and go into the multiplayer maps and
you could go in and play multiplayer
style gaming by yourself but none of
that exists anymore so a lot of people
are really learning that once a game
hits the end of the trilogy that's
pretty much where you should honestly
just quit it coming and last on the list
this just this actually made me lol
laugh out loud blah blah blah all that
stuff because people apparently have
threatened to quit ATT comcast district
v's brand t-mobile Time Warner verizon
this just quit everything just
put your head in the sand the reasons
for why you dropped a very important
call with your bestie once an installer
showed up late nobody will give you a
discount your phone costs more than two
hundred dollars if you lose it you're
building was wired when Jesus was still
alive so your internet access is slow
sometimes you get slammed for sending
more than a thousand text messages and
all eight companies are secretly in
cahoots with the government to spy on
you that was good alright guys that's
all I've got today I hope you've enjoyed
december twenty third version of tech
edition i hope you guys all have a very
Merry Christmas if you don't celebrate
Christmas I hope that you have a great

hope that whatever it is you have a good
