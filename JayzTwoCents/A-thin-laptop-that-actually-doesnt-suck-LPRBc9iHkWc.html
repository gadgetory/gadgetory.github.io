extremely thin well when this is the box
that it comes in this is the box for the
MSI gs5 slim a6 core 12 thread 8th gen
processor laptop that's capable of
gaming productivity and pretty much
anything you can throw at it and the
best part is it doesn't look like crap
Squarespace makes it easy to build a
professional-looking website or
e-commerce site without having to have
any programming knowledge with their
huge template library you can find the
right look and feel that you want for
your website Squarespace also makes it
easy to handle domain registration and
transfer with their built in domain
management tools there are literally
millions of websites right now being
powered by Squarespace for people like
you and me in fact I used it to sell my
custom cycling jerseys because I don't
know how to build an e-commerce site so
I just used one of their templates to
find out how easy it is to build your
next website just head on over to
squarespace.com and when you're ready to
launch go to Squarespace comm / JS 2
cents and save 10% on your next website
or domain or better yet just click the
link in the description below now I've
looked at quite a few MSI laptop since
I've started this channel and they've
always kind of had a three-tier system
with their laptops like the Titan which
is the big really big no-holds-barred
you got a pretty much lift lates feel to
carry it around but it can do anything
you throw at it
then there's also like the old Apache
and then there's the what they call it
the Raider now and then they always had
their stealth series well this is
actually kind of new for them to bring
out a 15-inch ultra slim but powerful
gaming laptop I'm gonna call it a gaming
laptop and let me tell you what gaming
laptops are very capable of doing
productivity in fact the amount of power
that you typically need to be able to
run a game with the amount of offloading
a lot of productivity programs do now
with the GPU means that as long as
you're running any sort of a discrete
GPU in your laptop for gaming obviously
it means you're gonna be able to do
great productivity as well I've never
had a gaming laptop not be able to churn
through videos for me without an issue
but I've definitely had thin portable
laptops that had Intel iris graphics
definitely not be able to play games and
barely be able to handle some my
productivity so this is what you get
when msi actually tries to build you a
thin portable laptop that's capable of
everything now in terms of specs it's
4.14 pounds which is extremely light I
mean the only time you find anything
that light tends to be stuff like
Microsoft Surface notebooks or something
that typically is not going to give you
very good gaming performance because it
often omits the discrete GPU to keep
weight and size down but this is a 15.6
inch eff HD 1080p 144 Hertz seven
millisecond IPS display so it's going to
be perfect for productivity color
accuracy if you're doing photo editing
or you're doing video rendering on the
go because it has an Intel 8 June I 7 6
Core 12 thread CPU in here with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 2666 now it's
configurable up to 32 gigabytes but it
only has 2 slots or two sodium's slots
so the European limited to obviously be
able to run a mex
of to 16 gigabytes sodium's which is how
you get your max of 32 but it has a gtx
1066 gigabyte in here which is a you
know i would have liked to have seen a
max cube 1070 but this particular model
has a gtx 1060 in it but in terms of
size it's also only seventeen point nine
millimeters thick at its thickest point
so it's extremely light it's extremely
thin and extremely capable now with
regards to connectivity we've got a full
size Ethernet jack on the side two USB
3.0 s mic and headphone jack on the
other side we have another USB 3.0 a USB
type-c a mini DisplayPort and a
full-sized HDMI and of course our port
for our power the aesthetics on this are
fantastic in the past MSI has been
really notorious for putting a lot of
red accents and a lot of things on there
gaming laptops that really scream gamer
but this one here is very elegant it is
a it is a matte black anodized finish
with gold trim which looks extremely
classy it doesn't even have a little oh
go on the back anywhere the only thing
that lights up on this obviously is the
perky RGB backlit steelseries keyboard
built into this but that obviously is
configurable if you don't want that to
be dancing around and doing remote puke
then you can just set it to off or any
static color that you would like but
obviously we are here to talk about
performance so that's what we're gonna
do next alright something I wanna get
out of the way here before we get into
games is obviously this is a thin form
factor all
light ultra-slim gaming / productivity
laptop it still uses a 180 watt power
brick back there now although the power
brick may be slim and also lightweight
it still uses 180 watts so this is not
going to get powered off of your AC plug
on an airplane if you're traveling just
want to kind of throw that out there
because it was one of the things I did
test and that is a no-go most planes
cannot provide even half of that so
you're gonna be stuck on the 4 cell 82
watt hour battery on this for gaming
which will give you a less than
desirable gaming experience and/or
battery life so when I do my test I test
with plugged in obviously because that
is the max performance of this and when
I was a traveling professional I never
gamed on battery so that's kind of a use
case I tend to go with and in typical
MSI fashion we still have a bajillion
control panels here that are just
completely unnecessary so I'm gonna go
ahead and turn all that crap off and one
of the things the system will do to to
try and conserve battery life is when
you're not gaming it will use the Intel
graphics the HD graphics it won't use
the discrete unless you're you need it
then it will actually switch into 3d
mode to use to discrete graphics which
will then give you better performance at
obviously a cost of power draw or
battery life now I can tell you in terms
of fan acoustics they are much smaller
fans so they're a bit higher pitched it
is definitely noticeable but the
speakers on this also don't sound that
great they're only 2 watt speakers
they're very low-profile they're right
here and they fire up at the screen but
the problem with that is it just sounds
very tinny and not full so obviously if
you want a good audio experience it's
heavily recommended to wear headphones
or Bluetooth headphones or whatever so
refresh rate set to 144 display
resolutions at 1080 and if we're going
to advance our preset quality as high I
don't think we want Ultra let's just go
high remember it is GTX 1060 using 2.6 6
gigabytes of our 6 gigabytes of vram so
we'll see where our average FPS works
out to be
so here's our FPS chart and here's our
mid line right here this green line was
obviously our average so you can see our
min and Max is not too far deviated from
that mid line but we are sitting at a
minimum FPS of 60 average of 69 and a
maximum of 84 so as you can see we're
not getting any crazy frame dips on even
a demanding game like Far Cry 5 but
that's also a CPU intensive game when
you're out in the world which I can't
technically show you here because I
don't have a game saved yet ok so GTA 5
is know when those games I like to test
because it uses a good balance of CPU
and GPU the world is huge and the
textures and all that stuff are very
sharp and there's lots of
post-processing and all sorts of
features on this like soft shadows and
NVIDIA PC SS and all that sort of stuff
FXAA is on we're on to XM SAV sneaks off
population density is max that's for CPU
population Verity a variety is maxed
again for CPU very high I'm pretty much
all the settings that matter while I
look at that with all those settings
cranked we're still getting anywhere in
the 60s to the 90s Oh down to the 50s
right there we definitely would like to
see it stay above 60 but I mean I'm
asking a lot of this laptop right now
one of the reasons why I like to crank
the settings when I do these tests is
because I kind of want to show you guys
what a worst case scenario would be so
knowing if you turn some of those
functions down and went from very high
to high and turned off the max density
and all that sort of stuff you know your
FPS would go up but right now with the
FPS even sitting in the 60s which is
less than half of the refresh rate of
the panel it still looks buttery smooth
because it's a it's still a very
consistent frame rate if that makes
sense the thing is since were definitely
above 60 and many of these tests were
still not seeing tearing so that's what
the benefit of having a high refresh
rate panel is is because when you do
exceed that magic 60 it just stays
smooth and you don't see any of the
tearing image on the screen because of
you know obviously the way it draws the
image but even in this fast scene right
here is zero tearing sitting in the 80s
on the FPS as the jet is just flying by
the desert right here fairly consistent
to sitting right around the low 80s and
not moving around
much Metro last light the title that a
lot of people thought was just a
benchmark it's actually a game if you
didn't know that it's fairly fun to play
but most people use it just for the
benchmark cuz it's still fairly
demanding and it's a good test with a
lot of different functionality in it so
running 1080p quality at very high no
ssa a texture filtering zat 16x motion
blur at normal and tessellation at
normal so we're going to see how that
does and then we'll check out the
average and all that stuff
so here's the FPS chart you can see as
it went through the different scenes we
have a max of 166 an average of 90 point
2 4 in a minimum of 20 point 5 4 you can
see that minimums right there that
little that little black line that went
all the way down you can see that that's
only one frame so definitely take that
with a grain of salt that's just the
benchmark there's one scene wearing it
we're in the transitions it just
stutters every single time no matter
what your GPU is so you can see it's
just right there but that is pretty damn
consistent because you can see our
averages are looking pretty good so that
is that's impressive
now what benchmarking wouldn't be
complete without a Cinebench r15 run now
this is a free benchmark you can go and
download it yourself and compare your
results to this system if you want to
get a good idea of how fast or slow the
system is compared to yours so that's
one of the reasons who I like to include
Cinebench r15 we're gonna go ahead and
run the CPU test it's important to
remember there is no overclocking on
this laptop you cannot go into the BIOS
and overclock it and there's no
overclock settings inside of the MSI
dragon dashboard and you know that ten
thousand or with ten thousand I wish one
thousand forty nine so about fifty
points below the i7 3930k so this laptop
is giving us at least in Cinebench a
very similar score to a stock clocked
extreme CPU that ran on the x79 platform
so at the end of the day what you're
left with here is a lightweight ultra
thin portable laptop while all laptops
are portable but it's more powerful than
many modern quad core desktops we're
talking desktops built fairly recently
this is more powerful than many of those
and ones that I have built myself so
that kind of makes this a no-brainer for
college students traveling professionals
or anyone that just doesn't want to be
far from their games and wants a
kick-ass laptop this is definitely one
to take a look at I'll put a link to it
in the description below obviously a
huge thank you to MSI for let me borrow
this laptop to test it out and give you
guys my opinion on it so we're gonna go
guys thanks for watching if you've got
any other laptop you think I should take
a look at this is the summer months many
of you are going to college or you just
want a good laptop I'm willing to test
them out and give you guys my opinions
so we're gonna go thanks for watching
guys and as always I'll see you in the
next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
