well we did a video recently of
timelines whatever we did a video about
the corsair 1i 160 the 9900 k small
form-factor that's water cooled with a
20 80 TI that's also water cooled and
all crammed into this itty-bitty little
package and i said in that video we
weren't gonna do a teardown or anything
i talked about maybe mentioning alright
auch about maybe changing a fan on the
top because I thought temps could
improve even though they were good and a
lot of you guys were like Luigi he
didn't know but he didn't tear it down
you should gonna tear down even though I
said we looked at what the insides look
like at CES here's we're gonna do today
I'm gonna go ahead and tear it down I'm
gonna show you how to upgrade things
like the RAM the hard drive which I
mentioned I'll probably change with an
SSD and we're gonna change out the fan
on top to see whether or not changing
that out to something a little higher
rpm and more static pressure will
improve temperatures in this and we're
gonna overclock it things I usually
wouldn't recommend on a small
form-factor PC if she breaks she breaks
EVGA offers a full range of components
including video cards motherboards power
supplies cases and peripherals
regardless of your needs EVGA sure to
have you covered to see what EVGA can do
for your next build head to EVGA comm so
the fan I'm gonna be using on here is
one of our 140 millimeter Maglev fans
from Corsair it's kind of beat up on the
edges it was the ones we painted for
skunkworks and ended up not using if you
haven't seen our review video of what
the performance and temperatures and
stuff was like at stock without touching
anything in this then please go and
watch that video first but if you have
already seen that or you just like to
watch things out of order then by all
means continue watching so to open it up
basically everything comes apart from
the top so there's this button back here
in the back this one was not very easy
to get off at first so you push this
button to make the top come off and it's
one of those things where I had to push
really hard on this button harder than I
thought I needed to but then the more I
took it on and off the easier it got so
just give that button a nice firm push
as you can see that popped up a little
bit and there's a little bit of a snap
in the front that
there we go so it is attached right here
it's a little bit of a gap
there's the cable and it came right off
just like that now the fan that's in
here we're pretty sure is actually a
maglev fan this one is a 2,000 rpm fan
so obviously we're gonna be going for
more so performance rather than
acoustics this one was very very silent
at 1500 rpm so this one allowing us to
go a little bit higher should give us a
little bit better performance but both
our pwm now you can use any family want
in here like I'm probably gonna try a
few different fans as we as I kind of
play around with this system moving
forward I've got some Vardar 140 s as
the Furious Vardar psych there's even a
3000 rpm not to a fan just for lols we
might try out so yeah so we'll be taking
that off but in terms of opening up the
sides there are some things that you can
change in this system to make it a
future-proof upgradability whatever now
in terms of opening up the sides of
these four screws right here so two per
side and then the sides basically just
open up basically like butterfly wings
or something I don't know why so when we
open it up you're gonna see both of the
independent loops that are in there this
side right here being for the GPU and
this side right here for the CPU you can
also see if you look the GPU radiators a
little larger than the CPU rat
so this is the GPU right here though
this is basically I want to say it's an
Nvidia reference card but I'm not so
positive anymore because this IO IO is
not an Nvidia i/o shield it could be a
reference PCB which I'm pretty convinced
it is but it's not an actual Nvidia card
because the IO shield is much different
if you take a look at the way the cooler
is on the GPU we've got this fan that
pushes down through a heatsink that's
touching the VRMs we've got our H 100 I
style or even H 150 Pro style pump on
here non RGB actually looks like I might
be RGB but to have the lighting turned
off that's running to the radiator right
here this makes me feel like I could
potentially put like a Titan RTX in here
or something
but I'm concerned that the SFX 600 watt
power supply from Corsair
might not be up to the task I'm also
thinking about doing a mod to this case
that Phil thought would be neat about
stripping all the anodizing off and
polishing all of the metal parts and
making it just a big shiny like almost
like a monolithic but polished
monolithic deal but anyway so the
graphics card is separate from the CPU
because it has that chamber divide plus
it's just got a PCIe riser card which is
connecting it and all the wires are just
running along the side right there so
nothing special on this side I'm gonna
go ahead and put this side back together
before I screwed up if we go ahead and
look at the inside of our system now you
can see everything that is just crammed
in here so we have got right here is
where our hard drive is this is the two
terabyte hard drive that I was
mentioning that I would probably change
out to an SSD I'm considering taking
this out and just putting in a one
terabyte maybe a two terabyte that Mansa
but it's gonna be about a $300 upgrade
to go the two terabyte SSD for now I
think the hard drive would probably be
fine but it's basically just a notebook
drive now if you want to upgrade this
your first inclination or thought might
be to undo those screws don't do that
there's two screws on the side right
here that you undo and when you do that
then that slides out as a whole tray and
then you can change out the drive
creating easily now it's not gonna be a
lot of room on that as you can see so
make sure once it comes out you rotate
it and then you can get to the SATA
cable and the power cable so this is the
corsair power supply it's a 600 watt and
as you can see it's a very standard size
it's not the extended sfx basically just
regular modular cables that are twisted
and tied up off to the side you got USB
3 right here so this power supply could
be switched out to something like say my
EVGA 650 GM if I wanted so this is a
higher wattage higher everything power
supply and it basically retains that
same form factor so I could upgrade that
the cables unfortunately they don't use
the same om so the cables I would have
to change out all the cables in this and
trust me when I say they are routed and
tied down in a very specific manner
that would make this quite the job so
the motherboards nothing proprietary
either this is a Z 317 Ozzie 390 we
talked about in our review they kind of
cheap down on the motherboard and didn't
go the the full chipset feature that you
would want with 9900 k ninth gen i nine
cpu but i'm not sure why they made that
decision but if you wanted to change
this out you could again it's fully
serviceable nothing proprietary nothing
custom at all in fact I even took the
box for my RG Strix Z 390 I gaming which
in my opinion this is the motherboard
they should have used in this the
concern though is if the ITX layout is
very complicated where things go and not
all manufacturers tend to use the same
logic in that which you have to make
sure in the chest like this if you want
to upgrade it is where's the USB 3.0
going to land where the power plug is
going to land because the routing in
this chassis is very specific this was
the better board this is the one Corsair
should have used can't imagine there
being enough of a cost difference about
$3,600 for this thing for this not to
have made sense there's still profit in
there so a little bit of a tangent there
but I digress at all I guess they have
their reasons maybe they'll make a
revision change in the future in terms
of ram this is corsair ddr4 2666 LPS
it's low profile memory you do have
enough height technically to go with
higher profile Ram if you wanted to let
something RGB or whatever it won't
hardly show anyway but I think the
reason why they did this is once you
fold these tubes down they sort of
occupy that space on top of the ramp so
I think if you go tall Ram them there
won't be clearance for the tubes which
is probably why they did that so I'm
gonna go ahead and do this so I'm gonna
switch out this fan with the Maglev fan
we're gonna overclock this a bit and see
how much of an improvement we get so if
you can't figure out how to upgrade the
fan then you probably shouldn't be
upgrading anything in this system it's
literally these four screws make sure
the orientation is you know pulling air
out the top so in terms of acoustics
with the new fan can you hear it
good I mean it's not another
fingerprints all over it's not the
quietest system in the world it's
quieter than skunkworks it's choir to
them on the gold build I built because
it's just one fan alright so the fan set
to default now so it's going to use the
same logic and curve which is just a
percentage so now because of let's say
60% of 2000 is clearly higher than 60%
of 50
hundred over all we're gonna be moving
more air through this with the exact
same fan curve all right so we've been
running now for probably 20 minutes or
so we're pretty much dancing back and
forth right now between 56 57 that's
where it's staying you see our core
speed is at 17 55 1740 bouncing back and
forth if we look at the IQ software
we're only at 1,500 rpm so now what
we're gonna do right now is we're gonna
go ahead and see what the temperatures
do if we put the fan curve at a hundred
percent and run the same test I want to
see how much farther down those
temperatures will come which will kind
of show us how far we can go in the
overclock okay so with the fan of 100%
which is only about 500 more rpm all the
factory clocks were dancing between 50
and 51 earlier when we did this we saw
49 but the ambient temp in the room has
come up two or three degrees Fahrenheit
so that makes sense for the the
difference there so we're seeing about a
six to seven seed drop that's why I want
to put a 3,000 rpm fan in here one day
because maybe we'll get it down into the
40s now with a custom loop yeah this
would be down into the the more mid 40s
no problem because we're going to do we
are going to now overclock this and see
how far we can actually get out of it
so with about another 20 minutes worth
of looping here and our overclock that
we realize this is wrong and we'll show
you an msi afterburner once we're done
this is this is showing lower clocks
than sexual yet we pushed the memory
over a thousand megahertz overclock and
we're gonna be running around 2050
maybe 2100 on the actual core max temp
at 53 C with the fan at 100% so we've
obviously traded some acoustics because
it's not completely silent but with the
hum of the air conditioner running in
here it kind of blends into the sound
floor of the actual room environment so
it's really not intrusive and our clock
speed oh no it did actually stick right
around 1985 it started at 20 145 that
came down from there that's obviously
because of the temperatures but we're
sitting just under 2,000 megahertz in
this small form-factor that's what makes
this absolutely insane is that you can
get this level of overclock and these
temperatures in this form factor so
we've been spending a while now trying
to overclock the CPU and it's
interesting like no matter what we set
the BIOS to on our turbo clock like we
have it set to 5 gigahertz right now or
4.8 I mean you can see it hits it for a
second that drops down to 45 on all
cores we've changed the turbo mode we've
changed the logic we
changed we put it to a fixed ratio which
it boots at 4.8 we've played with the
AVX instructions offsets all that sort
of stuff and we can't get it to stay at
where we're telling it we've even
increased the theoretical power limit
capability to a thousand watts so it
won't power draw a limit unfortunately
this is in my opinion having dealt with
MSI motherboards MSI has these second
worst BIOS in the industry as far as I'm
concerned second only to gigabyte being
the worst
so I hate MSI's BIOS that's why I think
I'm gonna probably end up changing out
this motherboard quite honestly ii like
the asus because it's better in every
way as far as I'm concerned okay so line
load calibration is now set to mode
three which is adding a slight amount of
voltage bump so we saw up here that V ID
is drooping slightly B core one point
two four eight so I mean one point two
five that would four point eight should
be no problem whatsoever so see what the
cores do four point and right back down
to four point five instantly so I have
no idea why it's doing that if you know
put it in the comments below I'll screw
around with it but again this is why I
absolutely positively hate MSI's BIOS
now if we go over to Cinebench Cinebench
will just gross
those CPUs so if we run that you can see
the clock stay at 4.8 4.8 one and our
temps are sitting in the 60s and our
hottest core hitting 172 so obviously we
have a lot of overclocking Headroom if
you remember our score previous to this
was in the other video was a nineteen
hundred and fifty I think and I just got
us a 2017 that's simply because they
locked in our previous tests with all
the factory BIOS settings it was
fluctuating the cores as it should all
right so we're locked at 5 gigahertz
let's see what happens
2160 every type of five one four though
what do we have to lose
man we're gonna call five gigahertz the
feasible overclock on this at least on
this particular silicon this could be a
silicon dud - it could just lost lost
the lottery okay so some of you guys had
asked in the review about upgradability
and widen to a dare to tear down and
stuff so yeah there we go I went ahead
and torque down replace the fan and
check it out now we got that if the
white LED going on in there which we
didn't have before you guys can sound
off on what mod you think I should do on
this chest he'd be pretty simple you
just tear it all down take the skins off
the side which would just screwed on
there and then you can strip the
anodizing pretty easily with a chemical
bath or paint it pretty pretty easily as
well so you guys tell me what you think
I should do ultimately I'm gonna make
the choice myself though to this it's my
computer to look at but that's what
makes these little things fun these old
projects because you can just kind of go
balls to the wall with them and at the
end of the day it's whatever makes you
happy
speaking of what makes me happy if you
click like you like you'd be way happier
- I love the way you can just like
there's like a way uncorrectable error
