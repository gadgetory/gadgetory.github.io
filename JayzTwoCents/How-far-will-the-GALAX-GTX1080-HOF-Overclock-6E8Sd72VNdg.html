just when you thought it was safe to not
have to see another GT X 1080 review
especially when everyone is just
constantly waiting for the highly
rumored yet none confirmed 1080 TI
we are going to take a look at another
GT X 1080 but this one's interesting
because this guy here speaking directly
to my international followers so what
you think you know I'll be honest I'm a
kind of impressed by its proportions I
know right
alright let me show you something here I
kind of like the thin ones but this one
is about form factor yeah but mine can
fit in tight spaces with girth you could
open tight spaces it's like a master key
whether you like thick or thin the ITX
lineup from fractal design is sure to
have something that tickles your fancy
remember it's not the size that matters
it's all about how you use it not its
deadly the girl no thinness garrett
david scary is no contest though there's
contents obscure today we were taking a
look at galaxy's new GT X 1080 Hall of
Fame card it's not the first Hall of
Fame car to take a look at but I did not
take a look at the 980ti stuff to my
finger oh wow I did not take a look at
the 980ti Hall of Fame but I did take a
look at the 980 and one of the first
things I noticed while taking a look at
this card is aesthetically it is pretty
much identical
nice long box here because it is a nice
long card you get a bunch of stuff in
here you get go-go-go Hall of Fame game
in progress donot sturb put that on your
door installation guide and of course
the card itself what is this guy Oh
check this out that's neat that's
something I have not seen actually
included with a graphics card before
this is an anti sag Pole no it's not for
your grandma actually designed to
support the weight of your cards you put
that in your case and you can put this
underneath the card and help support it
and then you can I guess it helps I
don't find out I'm not putting this in a
regular case though but anyway it that
way your card doesn't sag because it is
pretty darn heavy other things that you
get in here it
is yes well we'll be right back
here we go that make sense so it's
almost identical to the other Hall of
Fame cards we've take a look at in the
past here but this one here it's got
this little bracket that you actually
attach to the back of the graphics card
so you're not just like pushing up on
the cooler shroud this actually attaches
to the back of the card right here with
the included screws like so just like
that and then when this is attached to
it this guy here just pushes up into
that little rubber spot and then this is
how you support the back of your card
that's actually a pretty neat idea
because something people have complained
about quite a bit with big heavy
graphics cards like this is the amount
of sag and stress it puts on the
motherboard socket so anyway here it is
right here it is still got the bare kind
of a brushed aluminium backplate on
there it's got two eight pin PCI Express
power plugs and of course the massive
PCB on this thing which is white that's
one of the things that people have
always loved at the Hall of Fame cards
is they are perfect for white builds
they have a white face white fans people
think they should have gone with a white
backplate I tend to agree but an
aluminum backplate in and of course the
white PCB something else that's cool
about this little adapter too though is
it looks like you don't have to mount it
just on the back you can mount it right
here on the side as well if you want to
do it that way there are also some
mounting points there now looking at the
cooling pads on this thing I can say
that this does appear to be cooling the
vrm as well as the RAM as well as of
course the GPU itself that's something I
know people are going to ask because of
the whole recent fiasco thing with EVGA
so yeah I can say that we do have
thermal pads touching the VRMs and are
going to their own heat sink right here
this this is a plate I just showed you
on the side is not only an adapter for
it mounting that little bracket but it's
also a heatsink itself as well now I'm
not going to go into all the specs and
stuff of a GTX ten eighty this has been
out since May this is now going into
December almost December we have heard
these specs over and over and over so
I'm sorry if you've never heard of that
before
but I'm not going to go into it I want
to spend more time doing some real-life
overclocking and benchmarking of this
guy right here because I'm curious as to
what the overclock sir like this has a
pretty beefy cooling shroud underneath
the heatsink not only does it have all
of its heatsink fins or pipes here one
two three four five heat pipes on here
we also have this huge shroud that is
touching things like the VRM and the RAM
and the MOSFETs and all that stuff which
is going to give you some good active
cooling as the air blows down through
the cooler to cool those components as
well so now that's my Steam library has
finished updating let's go ahead and
install this guy today's video is not
going to be a complete over claw or
excuse me a complete review I'm not
going through all my benchmarks I'm not
going to be putting up all the FPS
numbers and a card like this I'm curious
as to how far it overclock so that's
going to be the main focus of my video
today this is my desktop running Windows
10 on my test bench I kind of have to if
I want to take advantage of all of the
dx12 stuff when I'm doing these tests
but whatever anyway we have all stock
settings going right here I do not have
the eber mode fan button pushed I don't
know exactly what it's called but when I
push that button the fans basically go
to 100% we're not doing that right now
we're just going to be checking out here
my own settings we're going to play with
so we need a baseline we're gonna go
ahead and run time spy here to give
ourselves a baseline number so that we
can actually monitor how far we actually
came otherwise we don't know how much
you've improvement there was that's kind
of the point today's video how far it is
this graphics card overclocked and is it
good I don't know let's find out
so while the test is wrapping up here it
looks like our core is settled at about
1987 and just dropped down to 1974 temp
so as you can see 62 C and yeah GPU load
100% and we have a lot of power limit
available to us this is only at set 69
70 percent it's bouncing in the low 70s
high sixties that tells us we have a lot
of power limit available I don't know
how much core limit we're going to have
though I have not personally had a card
come in here that can achieve a 2200
number 2162 are the highest numbers I
have seen yet come through this office
and only two graphics cards have done
that so I'm curious to see what this
one's going to do and then this is just
the CPU test right here so this has
nothing to do the GPU at all okay so we
started out here with a graphics core of
a 76 34 that's not too bad we'll have to
see how far that comes up now series
we're going to do we are going to go
ahead and we're going to bump the power
limit all the way up to 116 I'm gonna do
the core voltage percentage all the way
up to 100 what basically what that does
is it moves where the voltage slider is
going to go to 100% core clock we're
going to add 100 memory clock we're
going to add 500 and then for fans we're
just going to go ahead and kind of bump
the curve up a little bit because we are
overclocking it in fact those fans are
very quiet we barely even barely even
heard it so these are the settings we're
going to try now everything is applied
let's go ahead and go and run this again
see what happens
so that time we went up to 20 88 and
that's where it so I should bumped up to
2112 but then it settled back down at 20
88 our 21 14 excuse me that was its Mex
that gave us an improvement up to 81 53
so that's actually a bit of an
improvement right there but I do think
we have a little bit more in this let's
go ahead and go 150 let's apply that do
this again now with a one hundred and
fifty megahertz offset that should put
us right around 20 160 before it steps
down but we have to see if it even
starts to pass that 2100 and 60
megahertz mark as you can see we're
getting a lot of artifacts right here at
2177 a lot of artifacts but no crashing
that's weird so let's go ahead and
cancel that test okay so it's apply our
overclock again here so I'm gonna do 130
I'm gonna go back to 500 on the memory
and I'm gonna put this back to 85% we're
going to apply all that let's try it
again
now same artifacts so I guess we will
try 125 and then that'll be our final
test because I don't think we're going
to get much higher than the plus 100 we
saw and we'll talk about that here at
the end of the video why that is and we
still a little bit of artifacting here
happening at 21:52 so unfortunately this
graphics card is not going to be one of
my top overclocking cards that I have
had come through here yeah and at 21:39
we're still getting all the artifacts so
we're going to call it at plus 100 being
as far as it would go it's not bad I
mean that got us a 2114 that stepped
down slightly to a 2088
one other thing to show you real quickly
too is the button on the back here what
it does to the fan speeds what you're
hearing right now is 100% automatic it's
how it is out of the box but if you push
this button on the back it literally
overrides everything it puts the fan at
100% but be warned
it's noisy
unfortunately the hall-of-fame car did
not break any overclocking records here
in fact it's pretty run-of-the-mill
1080s
are just there they're so cookie cutter
all of them go to about twenty fifty to
twenty eighty eight some of them go
farther up to about twenty one sixty two
some of them don't even pass two
thousand but they're all I'd say 80% of
them are right around the middle of
about twenty eighty eight this one being
no exception regardless of how much you
give it extra power
how much cool a thing it's all comes
down to Silicon Lottery for the core now
let's talk about why these cards are so
damn similar when it comes to where they
perform the court the main core on this
the Pascal core for the 1080 is rated at
sixteen hundred and seven megahertz with
a seventeen hundred and thirty three
mega Hertz boost clock this card as you
saw automatically on its own without
touching anything and using GPU boost
3.0 overclocked itself to over 2000
megahertz and then once it started to
warm up a little bit it slowed down to
about nineteen eighty eight so if you
compare where this card is sitting now
compared to where the founders edition
card is which is where Nvidia you know
it specs the card is actually
overclocking itself approximately two
hundred and fifty megahertz that's
that's actually really good we're only
able to achieve about an extra 120 ish
megahertz by going in and playing with
settings of doing stability testing so
unless you're the kind of person that
just really loves to tinker and play
around the settings just to get the that
met that last little millimeter of
performance then this is the kind of
card that you would just put in leave it
and know that you're getting really good
performance I know it's rare to hear me
say a card doesn't need to be
overclocked but you kind of don't have
to with a card like this it's over built
it's over cooled it's got everything you
need when I say over that's good
we want more cooling than we need we
want more power delivery cleanliness
than we need because that's going to
give us a really good gaming experience
now the weird thing about this card is
if you live in the United States it's
it's kind of a unicorn it's very hard to
get your hands on them they are not sold
by retailers in the United States this
is an internationally available card
which means that for once I had a video
here that really was aimed 100% at my
international follower base which is
kind of unique and kind of rare around
here anyway guys that's it for today
sound off in the comments if you have
one
these cards let me know how far'd
overclocked what your temperatures are
like and what kind of system you're
running it in it helps everyone to kind
of make an informed decision rather than
just taking my word for it which I would
never recommend don't take only my word
listen to kind of form your own opinions
by listening to everybody alright thanks
for watching guys as always I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
