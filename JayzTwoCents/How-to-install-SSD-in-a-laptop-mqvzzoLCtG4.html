yourself a very serious question uh Jay
why is there a macbook pro on your desk
well I'm glad us I have just converted
to Apple and 10,000 of you just
unsubscribe
stop stop it stop it stop it I'm just
kidding
no what you see behind me here is
actually my wife's June 2009 Edition
13-inch MacBook Pro that she has had for
almost seven years we've had this since
it was brand-new and it was a heck of a
trooper and it's lasted all these years
but it's really starting to feel slow
and antiquated and trust me I am not
about to drop some money on updating a
MacBook Pro in fact the wife even asked
me if I would buy her a new MacBook Pro
and it kind of went something like this
Adam honey you know my computer's
getting kind of old now and I'd really
like a new computer and I was really
hoping that maybe you could buy me like
like a new MacBook Pro maybe girl you
crazy okay so maybe it didn't exactly go
down that way because after all I do
want to stay married but I really did
have a hard time buying a new MacBook
Pro considering how expensive they are
and the fact that even the twenty $199
model of the MacBook Pro didn't even
have wireless AC I mean what the
Apple so anyway we made a compromise and
we decided that this old thing doesn't
need to be here anymore it really felt
it it uh it really just fell out of the
chair I threw it in the dxracer like
literally took it and threw it back on
the floor I am not even kidding like I
had the dxracer set up over there I'm
like I'll toss this would be kind of
funny it bounced off the dxracer and
back onto the floor I sure hope she
doesn't watch this video well nothing's
shaking and the screen didn't break okay

that way they know that I'm the one that
sent you so instead I bought my wife a
bread yes but my wife why not she buy my
wife I bought her the compute you you
know what I'm saying she's not
mail-order but I bought the wife and MSI
Apache ge 72 with a 960m and a core i7
and 16 gigabytes of RAM 1600 megahertz
16 gigabytes of RAM and a one terabyte
7200 rpm hard drive that's ok though
because it's usually cheaper to buy a
bigger SSD and put it in your machine
later than buying a machine that's
already Specht out with a one terabyte
or bigger SSD because often that will
come with bigger GPUs and maybe you're
willing to pay for even higher int CPU
which is going to make the price go way
up so of course you can do what I did
which is buy the laptop that's within
your budget and then do a lesser
expensive SSD upgrade later on if the
hard drive turned out to be a little bit
too slow for you now I thought it was
going to be fine I thought there'd be no
problems with the hard
I've in there but considering all the
systems around here even little J's has
an SSD in it yeah it's a little bit
slower than I thought now what we're
going to do here is we're just going to
kind of go ahead and time a restart and
this is on Windows 10 with its advanced
hibernate where it's supposed to be a
quicker shutdown and a quicker restart
let's go ahead and find out if that
holds true or not
BAM I got to way through this just like
you guys yep restarting so splash
screens a good sign
bio splash screen windows booting the
logo tee
still on screen just turns black as you
can see and there's nothing on this
laptop the only thing that's been
installed on this laptop is minecraft
she plays minecraft oh look now we got a
Windows image what is it about notebook
hard drives that makes them so much
slower another platter smaller but you
would think if the platter was smaller
then there would be lesser search area
right you think you can find something
faster because it's not as big of a
platter I'll be honest I'm I'm not a
really an expert on the way the platters
work on each hdds or hard disk drives I
don't know what makes the smaller ones
so much slower than the bigger ones mmm
still spinning at the same rpm same
amount of cash that was painful
so let's go ahead and do this let's take
this 960 gigabyte savage upgrade kit
let's put it in the machine let's see
how much faster it actually gets now one
thing you've got to keep in mind is that
this could void your warranty this
laptop does not have the quick access
panels like found on the bottom of my
Asus here this massive oh there goes the
SSD this massive massive laptop here
does have access panels that pop off
without the need of one screw right
there but there's no warranty sticker on
there saying warranty void if removed
unfortunately the MSI does have one of
those stickers but that's okay because
warranties are for poor people don't get
mad at me I'm not the one that came up
with that saying it's actually barnacle
you get mad at him tweet him and tell
him hey that I find that poor people
comment very offensive very offensive to
poor people and rich people alike
alright enough let's go ahead and
upgrade this bitch
well the hard drive is installed and the
clone is complete because of easy used
software like a Cronus HD which kingston
includes with the SSD so thank goodness
for that and i'm also really happy that
they included this external enclosure
because one of the things you have to do
when you install a new SSD or hard drive
that you're going to clone into a laptop
is you have to take the original drive
out first put the new drive in second
and then plug this into the system and
create a bootable media source like this
one here which is actually a Cronus has
its own bootable media but it's done in
a linux environment and then you can as
you saw run the cloning utility which
takes about 10 minutes or so and then
once you reboot the system with all that
crap unplugged here you go
you've got everything left off right
where you were as if you'd never change
anything but hopefully with much faster
speeds now that's it let's go ahead and
do a restart test so that we can see if
we do actually have faster speeds we're
going to start that right now I would
assume it's going to be faster because
it's an SSD and if it wasn't faster then
what's the point of doing any of this it
has to be faster now SSDs on average are
about seven times faster or so than hard
drives hard enough a laptop hard drive
is usually right around a hundred to a
hundred and forty megabytes per second
read/write and these drives are
exceeding 500 megabytes per second so I
guess my math is a bit off it's me at
least four times faster we'll do that
math is hard so we have Windows 10
splash screen I'm kind of surprised it
still sets on the the login welcome
screen for a little bit longer than I
where thought I don't use Windows 10 on
my main machine so I'm not too
experienced but I don't know what it's
doing but anyway there we are right
desktop everything is done loading well
except for the SteelSeries keyboard
there to kind of load the lighting
profile that mrs. J's to senses setup
now of course this didn't go without
some sort of a surprise and I think
the biggest surprise obviously is the
fact that Jay likes to wear women's wigs
when no one's looking now because the
savage upgrade kit comes with this
external enclosure you can take your old
old hard drive and put it in here which
you have to do during the upgrade
process using the Cronus anyway and in
the end at the end of the day you've got
an external drive
I mean why take that hard drive out and
let it just float around and do nothing
at least it's good for mass storage of
music and media files you pictures maybe
program archives whatever it may be
project archives now you have an
external drive here kind of a bonus
two-for-one that's awesome that they
include that so obviously I saved a
little bit of money on the front end
because the model that included a one
terabyte SSD pre-installed from MSI was
way out of the price range I was willing
to pay because it came with other things
that just weren't important to my wife
for instance a 970 m or 980 m with the
one terabyte or multiple hard drives
that were just causing a lot of price
bump for things that we weren't
interested in and for about 300 bucks
you can get a nice high-quality SSD to
put in here for much less than the price
jump would have been to go with a model
that already had a one terabyte SSD in
there so that's always an option when
doing PC upgrades especially for laptops
so hope you guys have enjoyed today's
video hit the subscribe button if you're
new here and you learn something share
it with someone maybe you are just
having a conversation with like you know
you were having coffee with Joe and you
were like hey Joe you know they wanted
to put an SSD in my laptop but it seems
kind of hard and difficult but you know
what Jay showed me it was really easy so
maybe you can do it too and something
like that I think that's it's typically
how the sharing goes otherwise if you
guys don't want to do any of that you
don't want to follow in the social media
then we will just see each other in the
next video until then thanks for
