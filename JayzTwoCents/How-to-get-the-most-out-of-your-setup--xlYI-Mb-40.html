never done any sort of setup video
I mean I've showed my setup before but
I've never done any sort of like tips or
tricks or how to how to trick out your
setup or whatever I don't want to I
don't want to say pimp my setup and I
don't want and I want Matt filly to sue
me but I've never thought my setup was
anything great so I never really thought
about really doing any sort of tips or
tricks but i'ma go ahead and try that
today we're gonna see how it goes I'm
not gonna start any like setup series or
any of that crap I'm not into that stuff
but a lot of people have asked me about
my setup and ways that they can maybe
improve there so I figured we'd go ahead
and give that a shot I mean who knows
we'll see how it goes hey I guess I can
rap maybe I should go ahead and just use
jay-z the lik max to 120 and 240 from
enter max is another awesome choice of
AIO liquid coolers for gamers and
enthusiasts without breaking the bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more obviously when it comes to
setups there are like an infinite amount
of things that you could talk about but
today I'm going to just focus on a few
things that I think are what kind of
make or break various setups now
obviously budget is going to be a huge
thing so I'm not choosing like a price
point everyone's around the country
everyone's around the world different
prices different availabilities so I'm
just going to kind of speak in
generalities here gin generalities
generalities I don't know if that's even
a word would you get what I'm trying to
say I think now I think where the bulk
of your budget should honestly go is the
desk the desk itself can either make or
break a setup and one of the most common
brands people use when it comes to desks
is IKEA IKEA is generally pretty decent
quality depending on the desk you get
fairly inexpensive and you can do some
pretty custom things with it now my desk
setup here that I get asked all the time
Jay what desk
are you using is the IKEA Galant system
with the birch tops I also started the
channel with a black Galant system is
there actually all the same frames I
just changed the top kind of showing one
of the cool things about IKEA is the
fact that they are modular at least some
of them with various other desks you
can't but like the Galant system you
could unfortunately the Galant system
has been phased out and it's not
available at IKEA anymore at least here
in the US I don't know if it's
still available in Europe it is a
European brand it might be but they did
change the system with something else
called the beckoned yeah if you guys
have you guys have seen Deadpool you
know how they always make fun of the
name the names and stuff you know
anything's better than urine but anyway
you know I'm trying to say here
unfortunately the Galant system is not
available anymore what made the Galant
system nice was you could put different
pieces together hook them together in
the frame and make a giant desk if you
want my desk actually consists of three
different parts of desks put together
it's how I got such a massive system
here and then I use another Galant table
on the other side for the test bench
that way everything matches now it kind
of sucks about the new desks system from
Ikea is the fact that they no longer
lock together they've got these kind of
angular corners which means they don't
match up anymore which is very
unfortunate in fact I don't think that
there's ever been an out crying amongst
the gaming community or even the PC
enthusiasts community like there was
when IKEA discontinued the Galant and it
was no longer available people actually
got really mad now the main reason why I
still recommend IKEA desks even if you
can't hook multiple together like I have
shown with my desk is the fact that they
are adjustable you can adjust the height
you can get different kinds of legs a
legs T legs you can get different color
tops of the same style and that's a big
deal because if you don't want a black
desk and the desk you like only comes in
black well that kind of sucks right but
you can get these in birch white black
grey all sorts of different colors which
is really cool
that way you can customize the look to
the feel of your room and the overall
setup you're going for nothing makes a
setup look more cheesy than wire strewn
everywhere now fortunately you can get
different types of wire racks and such
again I mentioned IKEA a lot this is not
an IKEA sponsored video by any means
it's just my stuff is all IKEA I live
near one and so I go there when I want
all of my stuff but they have different
wire racks available they're very very
cheap the one that I'm using under here
is actually no longer available it was
part of the Galant system unfortunately
it's no longer available but I liked it
because it was big enough to not just
put excess wire up there but also was
big enough for me to even put my switch
under there a modem under there
powerstrips
it just goes on and on so wire
management is a big deal even if you
don't have a
system available you can modify a lot of
things to hold your cables and that's
what I would highly recommend in making
your setup look better is find a way to
hide your cables even if it means zip
tying them to screws that you screw
under the table something to keep them
out of the way and get extensions if you
need them because trust me trying to
deal with just the factory three meter
cables that you get with a lot of your
products or is not long enough
especially if your desk or the tower is
on the floor but why would you put your
tower on the floor you want to make your
setup look awesome you need your tower
up on the desk because you want it to
show especially if your content creator
makes really good backdrops for some
youtubers but now that we've moved onto
hardware let's go ahead and talk about
monitors because nothing makes a setup
pop more than multi monitor
configurations and if you look at any of
the popular set up shows on YouTube guys
that are just sitting there critiquing
people setups you'll plan to find a
common denominator where most people
with the best systems are using multi
panel configurations but it's not just
because it looks cool but in cases like
mine where I'm actually using all that
real estate when I'm editing depending
on what you do if you're a programmer if
you're photographer if you're a video
editor doesn't matter all that extra
screen real estate actually helps and if
you're a live streamer obviously helps
have extra panels so you can monitor
your live stream have your game have
your chat so its function and form which
is really important because some setups
depending if you go if you go form over
function then you kind of like the ricer
of PC which it's really kind of sucks
because we don't want any of those
racing race-inspired
cosmetic enhancements we don't want any
that we want function and form that's
the point of making your setup really
pop but if you do choose to go with a
multi panel configuration consider going
with some sort of a monitor stand that
can hold all three of your panels that
way you only have one stand because it
does look kind of cheesy when you have
multiple bases on your desks they take
up real estate not only do they make
your desk a little bit more cluttered
with the basis sitting there you can
also use the space underneath your desk
kind of like I've done with my mix amp
here from my podcast Mike where I can
slide stuff underneath the monitor and
use up some of the space which would
have otherwise been blocked by the basis
of the monitor so I'm using the ergo
tech widescreen form Edition here I've
done a review on this you guys can find
that on my channel and it can hold it
advertises up to three 27-inch monitors
but it barely fits my
34-inch ultra-wide in the middle and to
24 inch 1080p s on the side so it barely
fit but I got it on the desk and it
works and it looks pretty good but it's
adjustable on the sides it's adjustable
on the height then you can even add a
three plus one pole so that you can put
them on it or up on top if you want
actually ran that config for a while but
I kind of got tired of having the extra
monitor up top so I just ended up going
simple with the three monitors rather
than the plus one now the next thing I
think is something people often overlook
and I was actually accused of that for
quite a bit when I first moved into this
house and that is the walls having bare
walls is unfortunately a way to make
your room look old kind of empty and
just echoey for one but it just takes
away from the overall setup you want to
tie your wall decor into your setup as
best as you can now in here just
recently I put up all of these foam base
traps in all the corners of my room and
then used alternating orientation of one
foot squared foam pieces on the wall to
deal with a lot of echo if you guys have
noticed over the last several weeks my
audio has improved in this channel and
there's a lot less echo it's because I'm
using a better mic I'm also no longer
using a lav mic as you can see but I
also made a pattern on the wall which is
very common a lot of YouTube channels
are doing that now where again it's
function and form you can take something
that's necessary and could have
otherwise been ugly and make it look
better by kind of doing different shapes
and stuff now I might consider filling
in the blank space is there with another
color so it kind of is like a checker
pattern also a very common thing that
people do so I'm sort of searching for a
way to make mine look a little more
unique a little bit more separated from
the crowd not sure yet how I'm going to
do that but regardless if you guys are
not content creators and you don't need
to deal with the echo and stuff then all
you've got to do is put pictures on the
wall go down to your nearest Hobby Lobby
or something get some nice pictures if
you're into cars or whatever they've got
all sorts of different stuff there that
you can hang on the wall that's going to
fit your hobbies and just tie it all in
if you've got dark colored desk go with
dark coloured frames you've got a
light-colored desk with light-colored
frames but tie it all in because you
want to make it inviting and just
awesome it doesn't matter if you're
making videos if you walk into the room
you want to walk in and just kind of
feel like ah this
my space because that's what setups are
all about now the last thing I'm going
to talk about here is actually the most
important thing and that being lighting
you guys know that all the best set up
winners and all these set up shows have
custom RGB lighting now I head down to
low CS low is not home depot but I think
home people carry these as well and got
for 40 bucks you can get these LED
strips that are adhesive you can stick
them to the back of corners of the desk
you can stick them to the back of the
monitors and you can customize the
lighting but RGB is important because
let's say like right now I've got the
blue going on the desk I've got white
going behind the monitors because I used
strips and extensions so I probably have
about a hundred dollars worth of LED
lights here where I can control
different colors behind the monitors and
different colors on the desk so for
instance one switch to desk to red
actually the desk things over there I
can switch it to red as you can see or I
can switch it to white or green whatever
I want to be you can do you know girly
colors pink whatever but that's what's
cool you can change your colors in your
mood based on what you want again
lighting is a huge deal especially if
you you're going to do a lot of stuff in
the dark yeah that there's just kind of
an endless amount of things that you can
do when it comes to lighting but
lighting is really what makes your setup
pop you can do a lot of this for under a
hundred bucks depending on the size of
your setup because I've got a huge desk
I needed two of the lighting kits so I
got one lighting kit and an extension
piece so I had four extra feet of LED
strips for the desk and I've got one kit
for the monitors themselves now the foam
can be kind of expensive if you're a
content creator the foam can add up I've
got about 400 dollars worth of sound
film in here most of that being the base
straps the base traps in the corners
like like that guy right there are
actually what cut down the echo the most
the other bits on there are just a
little bit of extra echo grab and they
also help with some of the reverb those
are just four or five of my favorite
things to do when it comes to making
your system really look good if you
think I missed something put it down in
the comments what would you do or what
have you done to your setup so others
can read and get ideas most people base
their setups on some sort of influence
they saw someone else's that that look
really cool so they kind of took it and
twisted it to be their own kind of a
design
so let me know guys sound off in the
comments head on over to Twitter and let
other people know what you think would
make an awesome setup anyway guys time
to get out of here
I haven't touched on the whole set up
being a whole lot let me know what you
guys think if you thought the setup
looks alright I think it's kind of hit
and miss some people like the foam on
the wall some people don't I'm kind of
stuck I'm a content creator in a small
room I've got to deal with the echo so
yeah I want to play around a little bit
more but that's what's kind of cool
about the setups is just making it just
tweaking it until it's just right also
one other thing is going to be kind of
an interesting week considering by the
time you guys see this video Gerry will
already be here visiting me until the
weekend we are hoping to do a fan meetup
in the LA area this Saturday July 9th I
think it is and we'll put out
information on Twitter so make sure you
guys are following over there if you
want to come meet up again Twitter is
the best place to get ahold of us so you
should be following anyway guys thanks
for watching it as always I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
