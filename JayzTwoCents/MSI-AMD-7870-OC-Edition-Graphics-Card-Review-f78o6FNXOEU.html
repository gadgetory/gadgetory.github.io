been asking J's to sense what my opinion
is on the best mid-range graphics card
today we're going to take a look at the
7870 from AMD in my humble opinion one
of the most important things you want
when buying a graphics card is that all
solid capacitor nothing's more American
I'm also a big fan of the msi brand of
graphics cards because they come pre
bundled with the afterburner software
and many of them give you over voltage
control if you want to do some extreme
overclock the specs on this graphics
card are pretty impressive with a 2
gigabyte gddr5 a 256-bit memory bus and
plenty of ports for different types of
monitors including mini DisplayPort two
of them and in HDMI plus a DVI inside
the box is nothing spectacular we'll go
ahead and set this aside
underneath this cardboard flap you have
a couple of your accessories
you've got the driver disk that comes
with the graphics card I recommend
downloading a fresh one you've got your
user guide your operating manual your
warranty card and they also include a
DisplayPort to HDMI adapter Bravo
MSI for including this in the Box many
manufacturers are not including this
cable now let's be honest you guys
aren't here to hear me talk about specs
you're here to see some computer porn so
with that said let's go ahead and
undress this beauty and see exactly what
she's flaunting so if pretty hardware is
what you're after msi is certainly not
going to disappoint now don't confuse
this with the twin frozer even though it
looks a lot like it it may have two fans
and it may have some heat pipes in there
but this is not the twin frozer one
thing to keep in mind though is that hot
air is going to be exhausted into the
case as well as the atmosphere through
the grille something that I do find a
little bit unattractive on this graphics
card though is that it does have brown
traces on a black PCB so it may be
unappealing if you've got a case with a
window or a specific color theme and top
it off the aesthetics you get an msi
imprinted right on the rear exhaust
grill oK you've seen what's in the box
you see what the card looks like and you
want to feel up on it let's go ahead and
throw it inside of our build here and
see just how this thing performs with
our AMD 80 350
Mira gives you the chills doesn't it
this is a bad little card from MSI the
7870 let's go ahead and talk about what
we know the card requires a 500 watt
power supply with two 6-pin PCI Express
connectors that supplies 75 watts each
the core clock is 1050 megahertz and the
effective memory is 4800 megahertz and
cooling is provided by MSI's dual fan
setup but remember this is not the twin
frozer it's similar but it's not the
twin frozer performance is right in line
with a mid-range card we got a 73 45
piece core putting us right in the
average for this graphics card and a
score was with all settings at factory
there was no overclocking applied
whatsoever
using the MSI Afterburner utility
included with the graphics card I was
able to overclock to twelve hundred and
sixty-five megahertz and thirteen
hundred megahertz on the RAM yielding us
an eight thousand one hundred and sixty
P score and moving us up an entire
bracket on the performance chart now one
thing that is almost as important is how
well it performs is how noisy is the
card the stock fan profile is pretty
quiet the fan never really got over 40
percent and the graphics card never got
any hotter than 60 degrees now let's go
ahead and take a listen to these fans
when they're manually ramped up to get
an idea of just how loud the fans can be
but remember when gaming they never got
any louder than what you're gonna hear
on the very first clip
so there you have it ladies and
gentlemen the AMD 7870 graphics card by
MSI this thing is quiet and it performs
much better than I thought it would this
thing was pulling nearly 60 frames per
second in the unit valley benchmark on
extreme HD with anti-aliasing as high as
it would go and tessellation maxed out
and on 3d mark 11 we were seeing ranges
from 45 frames per second up to 65
frames per second in performance mode so
if you're looking for a graphics card
that's going to perform and not break
the bank
check out AMD 7870 this thing is a
monster I'd like to thank you for
watching the 7870 review by J's two
cents how many of you guys didn't know
that I do Tech Talk every single week
it's a live show
where I talk about anything you guys
want to talk about bring your questions
ask them I'll answer them and do the
best that I can sometimes I have a guest
sometimes I'm alone but it's always a
lot of fun and check out all my other
videos if you want to know why I'm
smashing the hell out of a processor on
the left or if you want to know exactly
what I'm talking about in the video on
the right how to choose our graphics
card go ahead and click on those videos
I'll see you guys in my next video and
again put it down in the comments what
is it you guys want to talk about I'll
go ahead and do a video on just about
anything cuz I'm just that kind of guy
I'm I'm I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna get on
out of here but go ahead and check it
out so many of the videos guys thanks
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
