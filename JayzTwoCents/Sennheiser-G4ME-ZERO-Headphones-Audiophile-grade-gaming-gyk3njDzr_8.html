Technology addicts Jay here with Jays
two cents today we are going to take a
look at a product that I've already
looked at briefly back at CES but
they've made a couple of changes too and
I finally got my hand on a pair I'm
really excited to take a look today at
the Sennheiser game zero gaming headset
and we're gonna have a little help today
from my friend Charlotte I'm pretty sure
it's a girl because well I'm the one
that cut the head off I know it's a girl
I probably shouldn't have had admitted
that I decided to go ahead and use the
old mannequin head as a headphone stand
now I could choose to copy another
youtuber who we all know and love and
just start putting all the headphones on
my head a copying other people is wrong
you should come up with your own content
because even though they say that
copying is the highest form of flattery
I think we'd all have to agree that
copying is just for poor people so it's
really heavy okay guys the Sennheiser
game zero headphones uh
from well Sennheiser that you probably
already figured that one out though I'm
sure and if not well now you know
packaging is pretty nice I mean it looks
like a sanitizer box at the Sennheiser
logo it's got some information on there
it's got a exploded view and on the
inside it has a hard pouch carrying case
we'll just kind of get in there real
quick I've obviously already taken them
out of the box in fact I've been using
them for over a week now because I
wanted to get really intimate with them
because I wanted to kind of figure out
what it is that you're getting from a
company that is all about audiophile
grade equipment if you happen to believe
in the audiophile religion yeah I kind
of just went there but anyway I digress
but they're making game headsets now so
while they've been making them for a
while but they obviously are evolving
into what is now the game zero in the
game one headset line before we get
there it's go and talk about the
packaging they do come in a hard dipper
pouch this is nice I like to see this we
might notice and it's actually very flat
and the reason for that is they do fold
flat makes it much easier to transport
you're not going to break them
and you can put them in your backpack
and look nice and flat I really like
that when I first took them out of the
package and this is where Jerry's review
in my review are going to differ a
little bit I immediately thought that
these were extremely light
he tends to feel they're a little bit on
the heavy side I thought they were light
and I thought they were light enough to
the point to where I was a little
concerned about maybe build quality
because it may have felt like there was
some cheap plastic material or something
and don't get me wrong they are plastic
but they've got metal reinforcement
where it matters for instance the hinge
is metal where it folds up like this I
mean you can fold it flat like this if
you want or you can rotate them and fold
them in like that but it's a metal hinge
you have to worry about breaking that
now there are plastic pieces right here
as you can see that are kind of
supporting the ear cans but I've
intentionally not been super polite with
these in the week that I've had them no
offence Sennheiser I've kind of toss
these around a little bit because you
guys know I like to use and test the
product not just unbox it and talk about
it now let's go ahead and talk about the
comfort level first then we'll talk
about the sound quality in the
microphone they do feature a memory foam
ear pad extremely extremely soft leather
thank God for that we've ever picked up
headphones that are worn out and old and
the leathers all hard and crusty I don't
think this is going to happen to these
they do have memory foam on the inside
but I'm starting to get a little bit of
a gripe and I'm not sure if you can see
that on the camera do you see how the
top is a little bit more squished
already than the bottom doesn't seem to
be holding its memory as long as I had
hoped so what's happening now is over
time on long gaming sessions they're
pushing in on my head slightly because
it's collapsing and my ear starts to
touch the inside of where the red felt
or cloth cover for the driver is now
it's not entire it's uncomfortable they
do get a little bit hot because they are
closed back this kind of looks like a
vent but it's not these are closed back
headphones so I don't know if the
cushion on the inside is just breaking
down already but it seems to be
happening a bit sooner than I would have
hoped and you can kind of see right
there they are quite a bit thinner on
the top and they are on the bottom
because when I put them on as you can
see there is more pressure right here
than there is down on my cheek I'm not
going to go ahead and ding them a whole
lot of
it's on that because they don't really
seem to have started to squish any
farther than this but then they tended
to do that kind of right away and then
sort of stayed there maybe they're
holding shape to my head I don't know
that could be the case they do have a
volume knob right here on the side which
is nice because sometimes when I'm in a
game it's really loud I don't want to
reach over and turn down my amp or
something I can just turn this knob
which is really really comfortable or
easy to access sort of fuddling and
fiddling around with knobs somewhere the
cool thing is you may notice that the
ear can is actually an oval it's not
round because let's face it as much as I
love my munitia Pro 40s they are round
ear cans now this isn't a headset but we
use this as an example they're round
which means they sit on the ear they
sound amazing but they start to get a
little bit tiring pushing in on my my my
ear flaps my my wings right here my
Dumbo's these fit 100% over it and if
you notice when they're on if I turn my
head they also at the right angle like
your ear your ears tend to angle back
they match that angle so they're
extremely comfortable they are
completely around the ear they're making
a seal all the way around my ear which
gives them really good sound we'll get
into that too a minute in a minute not
into a minute I don't know if you can go
in to a minute but whatever I tend to
get on these little rants every now and
then now when it comes to the looks of
them they're not sticking out on my head
looking all silly I don't look like I'm
you know fly in some airplanes even
though these do share heritage for some
of their aviation headsets in fact this
kind of a design from the ear cans is
actually taken from their line of their
aviation headphones they're nice and
low-profile they have a nice contour
curve to the top of your head the hinge
doesn't stick out all wide that the
coarse layers looked really really
stupid I hated those and they're nice
and narrow so you can see they're pretty
low profile
unfortunately the cable when I turn my
head it gets caught up on my shoulder
and since I have a three monitor
surround system when I'm turning my head
that tends to bother me because when
this cord hits my shoulder the sound
travels up and makes a reverb sound in
the can you can hear the cable much like
cans on a string you can talk into a can
on a string and hear it on the other end
yeah
sound travels up the cable and into your
head and it's really annoying
not really sure how they could come back
though because the court has to come off
somewhere so I'm really negative happens
to almost every headphone I've owned
just saying that these are no exception
okay sound quality you're just going to
have to do the best you can to
understand what it is I'm telling you
because there's no way you can hear it
obviously now the bass on these I'm
going to be honest when I first plug
these into my computer and my iPhone I
wasn't very thrilled in fact I thought
that the sound kind of sounded flat the
highs were crisp the mids were good but
they didn't draw have any real bass to
them tried it out my iphone tried it out
my ipad tried it out in the computer and
then I wouldn't looked at the specs
these are a hundred and fifty ohm
impedance if you don't understand what
that means it means there's a lot of
resistance in these drivers so that
means they're your power-hungry
that means little devices like iPhones
and iPads and tablets and things they're
not going to have the oomph to push
these like you need and my motherboard
because I use onboard sound on my asrock
z77 OC formula motherboard does not have
a headphone amplifier built in so that's
why the sound was really flat so I went
out and I picked myself up a Mayflower o
DAC amp combo plugged it in and holy
shit did these things come alive the
bass was booming but it wasn't
overbearing it was tight you could feel
the drivers moving back and forth in
fact it really started to feel like it
was creating a vacuum inside the can
because I make such a good seal and
because of that seal you get amazing
sound quality it's just unfortunate that
I really can't use these with my if I
want to travel on an airplane or
something now because they're just not
going to have the umph that I want now
if you are just plugging this in and
doing gaming on your computer yeah it's
not bad in fact I did a bunch of iRacing
with these did a bunch of battlfield
with these without the amp and it was
just fine the only place I really
noticed it was lacking a lot of that
just that drive behind it was when
listening to music specifically bass
heavy music
pump punk no not Punk Punk doesn't
usually have dubstep pop rap a lot of
music that has bass or any sort of even
rock or metal that has a nice heavy bass
line you're not going to feel these as
much unless you're getting the power to
them and that's
150 ohm impedance on these is a little
bit of a disappointment I would have
liked to have seen these be more
universally capable and compatible with
the systems that these going to be
hooked up to chances are you may be
hooking these up to a motherboard that
does not have a powered amplifier for
the headphone jack now at the time of
filming this these are MSRP for two
hundred and seventy nine dollars so
they're not on the cheap if you've got
to go out and buy an amp on top of that
you know it makes them a little bit more
expensive but I am going to say that the
sound quality of these are absolutely
superb
I really really found what I feel are
the headphones that are going to be
staying on my computer for gaming
because the sound quality is great
now there's stereo they're not 7.1 or
5.1 but using the Razer surround
simulate they actually did really well
and I'm very impressed with these I
truly am now being that they are a
headset clearly they have a microphone
as well now what I like about the
microphone is it does have a mute when
you push it up and there is a very
distinct click right about there you can
kind of see where it stops and pushes
against the button watch right there see
how it stops and there's a switch right
there so from there forward it is muted
now what I like is that when the mic is
up it is completely I cannot in my
peripheral at all see that microphone
know where it is way out of sight and I
like that because some headphone mics
tend to just kind of stick around
slightly in your peripheral and it can
be very distracting these don't do that
and very very happy about that
now let's going to talk about the
microphone the microphone does have rear
rejection and noise canceling built-in
so if you use these in a very noisy
noisy environment which gaming
environments tend to be if you're
talking on some sort of a VoIP you're
not going to be having a whole bunch of
background noise and they actually work
really really well and Gerry's video was
proof of that considering just how loud
his room is with the air conditioner and
all the fans and all the computers and
3d printing going on my room is pretty
quiet so you know it's not gonna be a
whole lot of noise cancellation to be
able to show you but I'm going to go
ahead and plug my microphone directly
into the camera right now and we're
going to see just how these sound
completely raw taking the computer and
the motherboard interference out of it
and seeing how the mic sounds when it's
hooked up directly to the camera okay so
now we have the microphone hooked
directly to my camera my Canon t2i and I
have a fan actually turn the fan on I
have a fan blowing directly on me I have
no idea what this sounds like we're
going to find out when we do the
playback
maybe it's garbled maybe it's not I
don't know what I did notice though is I
had to turn my mic gain way up in the
camera because this microphone does seem
to want a little bit of power with it as
well but on the computer I've been
talking to people on skype with it
they've said it's very very clear and I
have no complaints about it so guys this
has been Jay since bringing you the game
