remember where we kind of last left off
I had done some benchmarking of the GTX
780 the vanilla version here from EVGA I
talked about taking it to the next level
because I'm a water cooler so we're
gonna be sticking ek water block on this
thing this is their EK f c7 ATG t-- xti
water block now i know some of you are
going uh TI what the hell you said you
weren't getting a TI it's not a TI it's
of vanilla they use the exact same PCB
and the GTX TI base model also has three
gigabytes which this card does as well
so we're gonna go ahead and take a look
at this block that's a pretty big box
for a full cover water block PK also
sent me the ek fc7 eighty g t-- xti
backplate in black so we're gonna put a
back plate on there as well which is
kind of new for me because I've never
even put a back plate on any of my
water-cooled graphics cards ever so
that's gonna be kind of fun so we're
gonna go ahead and do an unboxing here
of the block and take a look at that and
we're install it we'll see how the
temperatures look before and after and
then we will give some final thoughts
when you flip it open here you're met
with your instructions this is one of
the few times I certainly recommend
reading the instructions have to read
the instructions you're dealing with an
expensive piece of componentry you don't
want to up and I mean that with
every sense of the F word ek started
including their own thermal paste which
i think is really good you get your
thermal pads here for your VRMs and your
chips or your memory chips you have the
tool the o-rings and all of the screws
that go along to melting it to your cart
inside here we have well foam high tech
foam we all know I like to eat that and
then here is the block right here so as
you can see on the card cooler here it's
just single piece of machined as our
acetal I guess is the type of plastic
they're using there it's got a little ek
logo and it
right here for a GTX Ti so I can pretend
to have a 780ti I guess the machining on
here is very very very smooth I mean you
can see some machining marks in there
but don't let that fool you this is
extremely smooth I mean this is very
polished and it looks like an awful lot
of quality and craftsmanship went into
this I mean even the acetal is polished
on the bottom side now the backplate
it's designed to do two things it's
designed one to add a little bit of
passive cooling to the back of the card
and it also allow it gives more rigidity
to the card as a whole so here's the
back plate you can kind of see in the
camera there it's got some really neat
like the intentionally left perfect
machine marks in there I don't know how
else to explain it it is there are
machine marks in it but it's actually
part of the aesthetics of the card and
it looks very cool so there's not really
any hardware or anything that goes along
with the backplate really because well I
guess there is there are screws on here
it looks like these are just longer
screws that might replace the screws
that you use to install just the block
so I'll make sure I read the manual and
check up on that so there it is guys
there is the block and the backplate
we're gonna go ahead and install this
see how the temperatures look and we'll
come back and give you guys my final
thoughts there she is guys installed
into my main system here the
temperatures on this are fantastic at
stock clocks before I over volted and
overclocked this graphics card
I was kidding a max temperature of 35
degrees Celsius now a little bit of a
disclaimer because you guys know I'm a
little bit outside the norm in more ways
than one
I do have some massive cooling going to
this I mean I have a 45 millimeter thick
480 millimeter rad and a 45 millimeter
that's hard to say and a 45 millimeter
thick 360 red so I have seven times 120
millimeter worth of radiator so it does
have a lot of cooling but I just want to
point out that I passed the point of
diminishing returns on radiator surface
area a long time ago so you could get
very similar results with a single 360
with the CPU
Loup with no problems now when I
overclocked this thing and unblocked the
voltage and move the voltage all the way
up on the GTX 780 I got a max
temperature of 41 degrees Celsius
ambient temperature in this room right
now is about 73 degrees Fahrenheit you
have to do the conversion into Celsius
I'm sorry guys I'm American we just
again that thing about being different
so there you go guys the ek full cover
waterblock here for the GTX 780 you can
expect similar performance for any
graphics card that they carry water
blocks for whether it be the r9 series
that 700 series whatever it may be
ek water blocks I've been using them
guys for about eight years in fact the
graphics card hanging on the wall that
you guys have asked about in the past is
an 8800 Ultra 8800 GT X ultra from
Nvidia back in 2006 I believe that I use
an ek waterblock on was fantastic so
guys there you go if you're looking at
water cooling your graphics card
consider ek water blocks the performance
is great the style is there and hope you
guys have enjoyed this video and hope it
taught you something when it comes to
water cooling or GPU and kind of what to
expect when you do put your graphics
card under water and as a added benefit
to the temperatures it is 100% silent
the graphics card makes absolutely no
noise so there you go guys
spin J's two cents showing you the ek
water block and back plate as always I
will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
