graphics cards what is going on guys
James - sent here bringing you another
affordable graphics card review
unfortunately I'm not wearing the
brightly colored blue shirt that I tend
to wear when I do an affordable product
review because it's dirty and I don't
wear dirty clothes on camera at least
not that you can see I'm not talking
about my pants cuz reviewers don't wear
pants
so recently AMD launched the r9 285 and
- a lot of people including myself this
card was a little bit confusing I didn't
really quite understand why it existed I
mean we already have the 280 and the 280
was already beating the 760 and pretty
much every single test but then when you
start to dig a little deeper in what the
card is you start to realize it truly is
a successor to the r9 280 now the reason
for that is the r9 280 is pretty much a
rebranded 7950 graphics card it does not
GCN architecture doesn't have true audio
don't have any of that stuff and that's
exactly what the r9 285 is bringing to
the table what I have sitting right here
actually is the r9 280 from XFX now why
do I even have this out here when this
is actually a video about the visiontek
radeon Radeon r9 285 well it's to show
you how far they've actually come with
the design now this right here as I
mentioned is the r9 280 and as you can
see there is quite the size difference
between the r9 285 what if I told you
the card on top is actually stronger
than this card in every single way yeah
that's why you take it and you pretty
much just toss it aside
don't worry guys no cards were actually
harmed in the making of this video well
with the exception of maybe the ego of
the r9 280 and the GTX 760 now one of
the things that makes this card actually
superior to the 280 is it's not just a
rebranded 7950 graphics card like v2 80
is this is a true GCN or graphics core
next the architecture which AMD launched
with this hawaii-based GPUs this thing's
got true audio it's got HD media
accelerator power play technology power
tune technology zero core power Dolby
true HD I think I already mentioned that
AMD HD 3d technology AMD crossfire aim
aim D app acceleration I affinity
technology the list goes on and on yeah
I'm reading the box because there's no
way I could have ever said that without
miss speaking we all know I'm full of
miss speaks sometimes now one of the
things I think is a little bit
interesting though is the fact that it
only has two gigabytes of gddr5 versus
the three gigabytes which are actually
available on the r9 280 but when it came
to benchmarking this beast that actually
didn't really seem to make any sort of
difference so this graphics card is
featuring two DVI is a DVID DVI is got
dual link hdmi and displayport natively
now the cooler on this thing I'll be
honest with you when I saw the pictures
of this I expected this to be kind of a
cheap plastic u shroud that's not what
you get here you get a full metal design
on this it's very very sturdy in fact it
doesn't flex it doesn't creak and when
it's mounted because it's so short the
card the card so short it doesn't droop
so the card is very very sturdy and
stiff now it's got true PCI Express 3.0
16x slot and it is capable of running
crossfire without a crossfire bridge and
that's a telltale sign of this being a
hawaii-based GPU there is no crossfire
bridge on there that's cool because it's
actually handled through the PCI Express
slot now I'm not going to talk a whole
lot about the actual specs of the card
you guys can find out all that
information online this is a a reference
based PCB but it's actually built by
visiontek it is not a is not a PCB
supplied by AMD it's actually they're
built reference based PCB with
non-reference cooler as you can see okay
let's go ahead and see how the thing is
actually performing when it comes to
games you may be surprised because I
kind of was be honest I mean after all
size matters right bigger is better
it's all about how big it is
now I spent a lot of time with this car
doing lots and lots of benchmarking and
benchmarking it again and benchmarking
again and again and again and she spent
quite a few hours with this card because
I really wanted to figure out why it
exists because I'll be honest in the
beginning I wasn't quite sure now I'm
going to actually be referencing my
notes here because again I don't want to
mess up any of these numbers my goodness
alright so the vision Tec r9 285 has a
base clock of 945 megahertz now it
because it has its built-in overclocking
technology sort of like the GPU boost
that nvidia is using it can dynamically
control the clock all the way up to 1077
megahertz when it comes to auto
overclocking now I used MSI Afterburner
and I checked the extended overclocking
features where it will allow me to take
the card well beyond what is actually
deemed safe because I like to see how
much these cards really have in them so
the benchmarks that you are about to see
are at the eleven hundred and fifty
megahertz core and fifteen hundred
megahertz memory November that's 1,500
times four or six gigahertz effective
memory clock speed so 1150 and 6,000
that is a pretty good overclock if you
ask me especially considering we went
about another 74 megahertz above where
they actually felt that we should stop
alright now I ran kind of a gambit of
tests and here's my methodology in case
you guys are wondering I for battlefield
4 guys I have to say right now mantle
14.4 or whatever it is we're on I
remember the exact whatever the latest
driver is I went and updated and
downloaded that for Battlefield 4 I'm
going to tell you right now the frames
per second averages were about seven FPS
higher than what you're about to see but
the only way I can actually measure
frames per second and benchmark them is
by using the direct
eleven driver so if you're using mantle
which is available to you you should be
using it you're going to get a few more
FPS average that's kind of a big deal
make sure you're doing that but these
tests I'm showing you are with DirectX
11 just want to put that out there
before people start saying yeah you
didn't use that although I did but then
for the benchmarking because all the
other tests I did with other graphics
cards it's such word the DX 11 that's
what we use for this test all right now
the max temperatures with this cooler
it's very very quiet it actually never
went higher than about 50% on the fans
and with the stock max overclocked the
max temperature was 65 degrees Celsius
and that's a few degrees hotter than
they advertised but then again I live in
the desert and it gets really really hot
here in fact it was 105 degrees
Fahrenheit today I know those places
that are hotter guys I'm not bragging
about the heat trust me it chances are
the 4 or 5 degrees hotter than they
showed in their testing is entirely due
to ambient temperature remember it is an
air cooled card now the max temperatures
with my overclock all the way up to 1150
actually reached 74 degrees Celsius now
that's not very hot but it's also not as
cold as they advertised but it still was
very manageable in terms of temperatures
so it just goes to show you push this
card even farther way farther than what
they recommend in terms of overclocking
and the cooler can still handle it with
lots of headroom so kudos visiontek on
that one that's a very beefy cooler that
you've got there all right so now when
it comes to valley benchmark i was
actually getting a 1652 score with the
extreme HD that's actually what's
running behind me right here now what's
interesting about that that's actually
lower than my 280 and my 760 scored so I
don't know what's up with that but
that's the only test that it was beaten
out by those two cards I'm gonna take
Valley with a grain of salt it's been
acting very very weird lately in fact
when I went to a 3-way SLI system I get
a lower score than I did with two-way so
valleys just finicky I'm going to throw
that test out the window now 3d marked
fire strike I was getting a seven
thousand seven hundred and thirty nine
in the non extreme test I didn't run the
extreme test but the non extreme test
seven thousand seven hundred thirty-nine
which is actually up there with the 280x
in terms of performance through
mark 1111 thousand five hundred seventy
seven total score and that's what the
4770k which I've been using for my test
bench for quite a while now that beat
out my GTX 680 that beat out the 280 it
beat out the two of the 760 overclocked
that eleven thousand 577 that is a
massive score all right now battlefield
4 we were getting an average frames per
second of 65 frames per second now
here's the way that I come up with this
test remember DirectX 11 for this test
we were actually seeing well over 70 FPS
averages based on what I was watching
the counter do with mantle going but
because mantle is not a DirectX API the
frames per second counters can't detect
the frames when mantle is being used
that's why I have to use the x11 to do
apples-to-apples comparisons now when it
comes to my tip my test ology or
methodology I will run the fraps
benchmark for 60 seconds and I do it 10
times per match and then I play another
match it's partial storm 64 player I
play another match I do another 10 60
second runs and then I do it for a third
time and then I'll take the averages of
the averages if that makes any sense
well average those 10 get a number
average the next 10 get a number so I
end up with 3 numbers I'm gonna take the
average of the three that's how I get my
overall frames per second averages
that's my methodology it's probably
different than everyone else's
just take that for what it is so
battlefield 4 was 65 frames per second
average now tomb raider tomb raider i
went ahead and put this at the the
extreme preset or all truckin or what
they call it but the highest preset with
you know tessellated tessellation going
and tress effects and all that stuff we
were at getting a 72 frames per second
average at 1080p with everything maxed
out it was very playable no choppy no
choppiness whatsoever actually had a
good time playing in fact I've kind of
forgot that I was doing the bench test
and I kind of kept playing and I was
like oh yeah I forgot I never beat this
game and I kind of got into it so I
played that one for about an hour
turning all this bench testing dirt3 an
average of 129 frames per second with
all settings maxed out at 1080p that was
10 frames per second higher than I was
actually getting with the r9 280 so this
card is a freaking beast now why does it
exist
pretty simple guys but all the GCN
architecture all the true audio
everything you would expect on the GCN
architecture graphics core next aim
these latest and greatest when it comes
to technologies all crammed into this
tiny tiny little card it I like giant
long cards and this thing is just burst
in my bubble with bigger and longer is
better and it comes in at two hundred
and fifty dollars and it's given you all
this types of these types of performance
now there's another reason why you guys
should really consider this particular
card is it has a lifetime warranty
there's only two companies on the market
that are doing that XFX and vision tech
guys I stand by their products you can't
argue with the warranty I rarely ever
talk about warranty but that's because
it's rarely ever worth talking about but
a lifetime warranty is a big deal now
this card is only available directly
through vision Tech's so you guys are
going to have to head over to their
website they only do business right now
in the United States they are based out
of the Chicago area so you guys are
dealing with a us-based company here in
the United States all their tech support
all our warranty stuff it's all handled
in the US so I'll put a link down to
their storefront you guys can go and
check out their card there it was
certainly worth taking a look at small
package huge performance that's what she
said guys follow on Twitter I'm gonna go
ahead and get the heck on out of here
the r9 285 pretty damn cool all these
cards are just
turning everything topsy-turvy see you
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
