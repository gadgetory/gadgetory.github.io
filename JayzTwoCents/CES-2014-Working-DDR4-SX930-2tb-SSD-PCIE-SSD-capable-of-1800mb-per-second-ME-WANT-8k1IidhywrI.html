insider coverage of CES 2014 archeron
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you hey
guys Jays two cents here in the a data
suite at CES 2014 now earlier this year
I took a look at the SX 900 SSD and a
lot of people don't realize that a data
is actually the manufacturer of the SSD
modules that go inside these different
hard drives now a data has really been
revolutionary when it comes to advancing
the technology of the chip manufacturing
and what that means is by getting more
and more information in a smaller and
smaller package now what we're looking
at right here is the Xu 41 this little
chip this little module right here is
the entire SSD this is the future of
SSDs this is what allows us to get very
small and thin smartphones very small
laptops and tablets because I mean I
don't know if you can even see how thin
that chip is I mean that is what may be
one millimeter at best it's 16 by 20
millimeters in size now to kind of give
you a perspective of what this does the
overall size of the SSD they've got an
essex 900 right here basically ripped
open where they have just one of those
chips right here in the middle now this
little bitty chip right here is actually
a hundred and twenty eight gigabyte just
in this tiny little chip so if you were
to get an array of these inside of an
SSD it allows you to make a very large
capacity SSD in this very small form
factor which is what we have right here
the sx 930 xpg from a DA now you may
notice on there it says two terabytes
this is a two terabyte sada SX SX SSD
now when you have expansion of SSD
capacity like that you need to have a
controller that's capable of that so
what we're looking at right here is a
little test bed they have set up that's
doing a constant read/write with the
same technology that is in this this
actual SSD right here through sada in a
pci express slot running the brand-new
sandforce LSI 3700 controller which
allows
to use a giant capacity like this
without sacrificing any speed now the
pci express version obviously is going
to be a bit faster than the SSD itself
running through sadek aceites sort of a
bottleneck and in that communication
line but with direct lanes to the cpu
through the pci express slot with the
same technology that's in this SSD hard
drive right here they're getting an
eighteen hundred megabyte per second
read speed eighteen hundred megabytes
per second guys could you imagine the
boot speeds or just how fast you can
index a hard drive with that type of
read speed so that is the sx 932
terabyte SSD is gonna be available up to
two terabytes starting at 128 now now
you guys are going to wanna know about
availability and when you can buy that
it's going to be sometime around the
middle of this year because they're
still continuing to refine the lsi 3700
sandforce controller because the worst
thing you could have as a controller
that's no good karups your data and you
don't want that so once the controller
is completely matured you can expect to
see that in the market sometime middle
of this year now we all know ddr4 is not
that far away in fact we know that
because I am holding a ddr4 20 133
megahertz CL 15 ram module right here
now what's the benefit of ddr4 well you
know speed wise it may not be an
incredible increase in fact I'm not even
sure because this is a working dim
slaughtered in stick right here but we
don't have a demo here to be able to
actually show any of its speed but let
me tell you this is a 16 gigabyte dim
right here 16 gigabytes on one stick so
it's going to allow you to be able to
run 32 megabytes if you need to on a
major rendering station or something
like that without having to occupy a
whole lot of slots inside of your side
of your motherboard but according to the
little label right here we do have 8
gigabyte and 16 gigabyte capabilities on
these single dims so when it comes to
memory a data has certainly got you
covered with your SSDs an upcoming ddr4
that's going to be launching at some
point later this year so guys has been
JS two cents here in the a data suite at
CES 2014 make sure you follow us on
Twitter so you'll miss any of our
coverage I'm sure you guys are sick of
hearing that
and I'm sick of saying that but anyways
I will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
