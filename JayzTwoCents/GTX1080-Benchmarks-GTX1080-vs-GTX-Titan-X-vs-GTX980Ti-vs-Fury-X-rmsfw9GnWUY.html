today is an exciting day it's May 17th
around 6 a.m. my time apparently and the
NDA has lifted regarding nvidia gtx 1080
i've got it right here in the Nifty cool
little box it comes in
but we've already done a video about
what the founders edition card is so you
guys should already know now that this
is the founders edition card aka the
reference card there's a lot we could
talk about today there's a whole
ecosystem that is being shipped with
this card and a lot of changes that come
with that architecture we're going to
touch on that a little bit we're going
to focus on what everyone really wants
to know and that being FPS and is it
really the new king as they advertised
the new z170 classified motherboard from
EVGA features eight phase PWM 4 Way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more all
right so obviously there is a new cooler
shroud they've got some custom angles
and stuff it is a vapor chamber in there
but as you can see the overall main
aesthetics look an awful lot like a
reference card but it's not it's the
founders card it has a backplate so I'm
super happy about that backplate to make
everybody happy and it just looks better
doesn't that look better than a plain
PCB chill in there I know maybe you
prefer the PCB whatever that is
subjective that's up to you to decide if
you like the idea of a backplate or not
but anyway a couple of specs here we
want to run down real quick it is a 16
nanometer FinFET architecture which is
Pascal it's got 8 gigabytes of gddr5 X
memory which is a new architecture for
the memory so that can actually get
above that 7 gigahertz kind of a cap
they've been dealing with in the past
with standard gddr5 so it's now running
an effective 10 gigahertz of memory
that's that's pretty fast actually
considering it's still gee ddr thats
actually pretty impressive 20 560 cuda
cores on that pascal architecture one
thing to keep in mind when it comes to
cuda court CUDA core count though is
between architecture you can't directly
relate the number of cuda cores to
meaning one's better than the other for
instance the Titan X has over three
thousand 72 CUDA cores that doesn't mean
it's better than this one because that
number is higher
you really can't compare the two so I
just want to put that out there I saw a
lot of comments on the internet going
but it only has twenty five hundred and
sixty cuda cores that doesn't make sense
that's less than the last one yeah it
doesn't work that way just point that
out but nine teraflops actually eight
point nine but I guess they round it up
eight point nine teraflops of compute
power when overclocked or at least to
the boost clock now this is going to be
featuring GPU boost three which is
something I actually don't have access
to at the time of this review but my
card did go above the 1700 I think it's
17:33 I'll annotate it if I'm wrong
but the base clock is 1607 it will boost
over 1700 on its own mine actually
pushed all the way up to about eighteen
hundred and twenty megahertz
out of the box without touching a damn
thing now there is a negative I want to
talk about immediately before we get
into the benchmarks and that being we
saw the demo that Jenson was showing
with a 3d model walk around it was using
GPU for rendering that 20 114 megahertz
and 67 see first of all I can't
overclock this because at the time of
doing this video the sliders are locked
on afterburner and precision the new
builds aren't out yet to support this
card because again GPU boost 3.0 and all
of that as I said I had no overclock
ability of this card which is really
disappointing which only means I'm gonna
have to make another video about
overclocking you guys are gonna be like
come on fanboy would you stop talking
about 1080 I kind of have a choice
overclocking is a main aspect of this
card and I couldn't even test it at the
time of recording this but anyway well
circle back and we'll check that out so
that means I am letting the GPU boost do
its own thing and I didn't touch it
so I know it went over 280 over 1800
megahertz about 1820 ish and I think
1810 it bounces around you know how GPU
boost works so to make things fair when
I tested this compared to my 980ti I
also left this manual overclocking out
of the equation and just let this thing
boost up on its own I want the
architecture doing all of the thinking
so that we can do direct comparisons so
that's my 980ti
and of course we compared it to the
X because you know we've heard that 1080
is better than Titan X in terms of
performance two times better is that
really true
we'll remember guys that chart says VR
two times better in VR and I'm not doing
VR testing today I'm doing Direct X
testing which obviously is not going to
be two times better than the Titan X
otherwise they would have never sold it
for $5.99 and $6.99 and then of course
not to leave out my team red fanboys I
have got my r9 fury X right here we've
got to check this out because it is in
the same price point so that's the setup
here GT X 1080 with factory boost
against 980ti
against Titan X against fury X in a
gambit of benchmarks to see who is the
new GPU King around the six hundred
dollar range - tight necks you know
that's kind of the black sheep literally
it's black let's go ahead and see who
performed best right now
so there you go guys that is absolutely
the undisputed king at least of the
games that I tested I can't test every
game on the freaky market that would
take forever it would never end this is
outperforming GTX Titan ex 980ti
had fury ex buy a lot in DirectX 11
obviously we'll talk about 12 in a
second here but DX 11 it was absolutely
besting every card on the market for
single GPU solution anywhere so it's
definitely performing one thing I want
to note though is I did deal with
thermal throttling that 67c we saw on
stage was not in DirectX performance
that was in GPU render and so it's a
kind of a little bit misleading to be
like it's only running 67c yeah in that
program but not in games because games
put this thing all the way up to 83 C
which is where the factory thermal
throttling mark is so unless you raise
the power target and raise the
temperature limit and GPU boost you're
not going to be able to see this thing's
full potential it will pull all the way
back down to the base clock which is
what happened to me so I had to start
all over by putting this thing up to the
120 percent power limit which is a 20%
extra power draw and then setting the
fan to a TC so we didn't see those
temperatures get up there then it stayed
around the mid 70s and was a lot quieter
believe it or not than the 980ti and the
tight necks at 80% then these were at
50% so this fan is quieter than those in
fact these were very noticeable coconut
monkey was in the room going wow those
fans are loud but we didn't even hear
these over the system fans or this one
over the system fan running at 80% so
it's definitely an improvement to the
cooler design that also means when the
board partners come out with their cards
and their custom coolers and over
overclocking enabled which I didn't have
at the time of this review which I'll
have to do later we're going to see a
benefit with this with with higher power
limits and temperatures definitely kept
in check all right let's go and take a
second here to talk about my r9 fury X
from AMD this is the highest end GPU AMD
currently makes that has a single GPU
this is was touted as the Titan killer
unfortunately it fell short of that but
one of the things people always point
out
is AMD is better in dx12 when it comes
to async now there are some async
improvements that have taken place with
the Pascal architecture and I wanted to
go ahead and try and point that out by
using the dx12 benchmark inside of rise
of the Tomb Raider now before you start
throwing things at your screen going J
you should have used ashes and
singularity ashes of singularity I'm not
very familiar with that benchmark yet
and I'm going to add it to the suite
later it's just there are a metric ton
of settings in there that I don't quite
understand how they all correlate yet
and rather than really put out a flawed
benchmark result I decided to go ahead
and you just use rise of the Tomb Raider
because it's actually pretty demanding
more demanding than I thought it would
be and let's go ahead and take a look at
this guy versus those in dx12 because
that's always been the question so how
exactly did these all compare alright
listen hold up I know you're probably
going what the actual fuck just happened
yeah the fury X fell on its face like
like it was trying to run with a cast on
its leg and I was really surprised by
that enough to where I wiped the drivers
reinstalled them I believe 16.5 point to
whatever the latest driver is from
crimson it came out on May 10th
literally just the other day and saw
that the performance on this was
absolutely terrible I had no idea what
was going on so I always started
checking out the performance logs and
noticed something that even though this
is overclocked by the way guys this is
overclocked to 1120 from 1050 70
megahertz overclock against stock speeds
or GPU boost on the Nvidia cards what I
noticed was I was looking for thought of
some sort of throttling nope 4 gigabytes
of HBM one completely just used up there
was it was completely pegged on a 1080p
benchmark with SMA a turned on not to X
not for X just SMA a one time one time
sample and it just completely used up
all that memory to where the memory in
this graphics card actually held it back
on that benchmark now guys that's one
benchmark and I want to point out that
used up pretty
much all 8 gigabytes on the 1080 and all
six on the 980ti
and it used over nine gigabytes on the G
of the type next remember the 10x has 12
so that benchmark is literally wanting
to use every bit of memory available to
it so I'm going to be looking for some
more dx12 benchmarks so I can get a
better sampling of what's happening here
but it does look like the four gigabytes
of HBM on the fury X was holding back
the entire architecture of this card
unfortunately all right so that just
about concludes today's video there's a
lot of things we can talk about and I'm
going to talk about some other things
I'm excited about one of the things that
1080 really brings with it is a whole
new ecosystem it's got some amazing
advancements in VR it's got virtual
sound in there now which is built into
the Pascal architecture it's even got
surround core multi-panel Corrections so
that you're no longer dealing with the
skewed sides and all of that 1080 is an
amazing card when it comes to
performance which really has me
wondering knowing what 980ti and tight
Nicks did to the 980 considering 980 was
like a really good jump over the 784
being a small GPU what the hell does Big
Pascal hold for us holy shit
all right guys it's time to get out of
here thanks for watching today's video I
just kept it simple today I want to show
you the benchmarks I want to show you
the numbers and if there's any other
benchmarks you think I should be
including in the future let me know
obviously I can't include all of them
games like csgo I really don't see the
point of benchmarking they're not that
demanding than they are but they're not
that demanding I don't know we'll see
anyway guys tell me what you think about
GT X 1080 all the information is out
there now there's no more secrets so
