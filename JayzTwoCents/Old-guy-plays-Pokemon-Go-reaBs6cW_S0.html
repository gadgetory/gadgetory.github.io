been kind of given that whole pokeyman
go thing like a really hard time on
Twitter and I'll be honest I still don't
get it but why do you guys were like you
should try it you should try it so I
figured okay I'll go ahead and give it a
shot so we went down to the park over
here and yeah I'll be on assignment with
the hell I'm doing so there's a bunch of
screen and a blue thing the blue thing
is a pokey stuff and you get items for
there get to flip the coin yeah
there you go see you'll find the growl
up again I don't know I'll be honest I
don't know what I'm doing
you're gonna walk up to those creatures
on the screen okay tap them I think that
keeps like a little being little green
explosions there did you find something
I keep seeing this like tiger thing but
see like I can't get it hey how come you
haven't shaven well I wanted to get into
character for the because most pokeyman
people have beards see this keeps
disappearing or a moves around so we
have to move with it really yeah I don't
know what's happening here like it
popped up and it's like right here but
when I touch it nothing happens
see you know maybe someone else caught
it how it's supposed to be like it was
said it was right here like the next of
the road thing is the bushes around
still why are all these stupid kids out
here trying to play this game I'm trying
to do a video dang it well they're all
right go over here he's moving I mean I
can see why I can see why this game has
caused fights amongst people Oh see it
popped up over here now I had to go back
this way but if it's all the time really
is did you wretch you got it
I don't know like it's right there right
uh-huh how do I get it see it just
disappeared again what the heck why I
feel like this thing is being super
evasive and that's why that people are
like running right now yeah I am not
running for a stupid polka Megan okay
here it is again oh wait wait wait oh
where is he I can't see him oh there he
is you got him I don't know did I oh
yeah he's on the screen just tell your
pokeball at it I did it's right next to
him and nothing happens okay fright
again there you go
is that good yeah yeah he caught him
well it's in the pokeball what's he
could break out but yeah you got him
he's good
Congrats he caught a Pokemon now what
you keep collecting them that's really
yeah that's that's got to be like one of
the stupidest things I think I've seen
yet
if the bushes rustling that way we
should follow the business remember the
bushes could disappear see just to keep
looking for them and if they're good I
wish this this thing did was accurately
like track the way I'm walking can't
even focus on the screen but see it
shows I'm facing towards the street
that's behind me and I'm not I'm facing
up opposite direction gotcha
see like it's way off like it's
backwards oh that's the problem I think
I need more pokeyman balls their
pok√©balls not poking man balls whatever
I got an egg and three pokeballs with
the egg do the egg in the gameboy
version you could hatch them they become
a Pokemon but I don't know who you
hatched in this game I'm pretty sure you
have to walk around I'm level three
nice Congrats about is that a high level
no no it's still like white belt really
yeah there appear to be rustling bushes
in the middle of the field okay so the
rustling bushes are supposed to be like
their lures right they're supposed to
lure players to that area I believe so
did the GPS fix itself something popped
up over here somebody popped up we have
to go this way hey wild something or
another has appeared
I'm really bad at flicking these balls I
just missed with three of them how many
one you have I don't know how far is it
you walk go straight right oh wait I
think I got it let me cheat no I'd like
this appear right Oh what what is that
thing it's Paris
you have to like actually land the ball
on it your foot game is weak son there
you go oh yeah hit him
yeah I have to hit him wide it just took
like six balls to do that yeah if they
break out that you know they're powerful
this thing is a para para RS yeah dumb
that right I think I need to replenish
my balls after that one is there one at
the the monument place that we went to
last time yeah there is
let's go alright okay so this is the row
that blue squirt things what you do the
square you flip the coin Oh what what we
could go all right sorry man all right
