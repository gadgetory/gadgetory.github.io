all I believe in green except it's
springtime I like to be able to see it I
just don't wanna be in it what's up guys
jsq cents here and coconut monkey we're
going to do more studio stuff you know
we moved in here why moved in here March
10th and where does this now May 18th
today we have a lot of stuff to do stuff
to do more boxes everywhere we are going
to finally try and tackle some of the
echo issue I'm sure you guys can hear it
right now obviously because I'm using on
camera mic well it's a shotgun mic the
still we are going to just do a little
behind the scenes today two idiots try
and sound proof of studio it's not going
to work but I tried anyway it has the
two idiots series ever been full of
success remember we're not going to work
remember we call it two idiots because
it basically removes the ability for you
guys to call us an idiot if we do it
first sick and tired of all the RGB
craze well don't worry because the EVGA
z2 70 classified K is full of all the
things that matter like Intel obtained
memory ready you to nvme SSD support 11
phase PWM for stable overclocking and a
sleek monochromatic design that is
perfect for any build learn more by
visiting EVGA comm so I should we follow
the suit with every other tech youtuber
we bought a wardrobe but not like a big
old fancy one with sliding glass doors
and stuff it's still an ikea one it's
got some pullout drawers and things that
we're going to finally get all of our
equipment into let's see what else we
got here there's more like a
behind-the-scenes to because I'm done
anything here for a while this of course
is my fs5 this is where this is what you
guys see all of our videos shot on it's
got small HD monitor on there shotgun
mic yeah that's our FS 5 way overkill
for youtube yes here is my Rhino slider
our janky little mic boom here yeah we
need better equipment we definitely need
better lights to like I'm using some of
the really cheap like I got these on
Amazon like two and a half years ago
almost three years ago and they still
work
they're the same mold as they shipped
with it was like 180 bucks for the kit
got this light from Austin - yeah I
bought this off him awhile ago I got
another one but I see another power cord
for it these are really good fill lights
they're like stupid bright buses oh but
it's got adjustable brightness of course
couple the LEDs have burned out but it's
okay it was cheap its own I mean well
yeah that camera over there is cheap
compared to what I could spend I mean if
I were to get like a like a Canon c500
that's like 15,000 just for the body
maybe that one was like 6,000 bill body
so some of the all Scratchy - is we're
going to hang curtains right here so we
can kind of block out the kitchen and
then we kind of make ourselves like
another set over here you set kind of so
you've been working on building sort of
a set here we got the giant picks our
lamps hue bulbs in there I hate the hue
bowls when we trying out some new bulbs
like the the lifx
you ever heard the lifx no yeah my
effects are just like life ex LIF ex ex
they're a lot bright like 1,100 lumens
but we're also going to be hanging
drapes blackout curtains acoustic
curtains on the walls to see how much
that'll help because I don't want to do
a lot of drilling into the walls I want
to do adhesive like sound foam sound
acoustic treatment on the walls I'm
really limited to what I can do in here
so anyway he's going to start building
the Wardrobe and I'm going to start
drilling holes always just gonna play in
his phone you know I literally pay you
to play on your phone half a day yes I
do
yes I do
at only because I pay my friends to be
my friend and you had to clean up messes
here in the studio to get to work it's
one of the other cameras I use right
here - this is my sony a7s - it's kind
of fun we use it mostly for b-roll and
slider chops and whatnot a lot of people
got one oh really inquisitive as to why
I went with a7s2 and not the a7r - mark
- there's actually a really good video
can you make any more noise over there
it's actually a really good video over
on B&amp;amp;H photo where they talk about the
difference between a7s2 and a7r - and
the esta - had more video features that
we cared about there's a really good
video though about the differences for
video use and why you want one or the
other so instead of asking me go check
out that video we also bought some new
lights - printing these corners I'm
going to be moving the plants maybe two
upstairs from getting rid of the plants
and we got these really cool like I
guess they're almost like kind of
Chinese like climb
Japanese looking up lanterns there
stands light that's really tall take it
all of this but it's lots of lights in
it and I think it'll look better than
these plants that's it right there it's
the roots so from Ikea yeah I know it's
wrong IKEA they were yes the roots boat
also have my LG g6 I have not even taken
out a little clock I still have to do a
video just to do a video on this guy
you guys even interested in my take on
the LG G 6 I want to give you rabies
are you going to label oh the label good
yes you forgot it it's a label that
blade rabies yeah and that's somebody
that raised these kids something else
had to deal with all the time or the
siren they're gonna make noise again
there they go
I would like to point out I'm actually
wearing my band shirt because the last
time I yelled olace is like you couldn't
even cut like it doesn't cut the plastic
it's hair success like summer I like to
point out I'm wearing my band shirt
because the last time I wore my van sure
everyone's like you're too old you can't
wear vans so now I'm literally doing it
just to trigger you guys again so you're
going to measure before you drill right
I'll measure with my I know I mean you
should really measure for you go I
measure with Matt please don't
it was good I can only imagine that's
gonna be like tilted on one side every
time to try to like do stuff it's just a
slide yeah that's what that's a tape
included for Oh James I'm a certified
safety technician up curtains
he said have them tightly I know what
I'm doing
okay thanks he did the curtains ish kind
of kind of did he did and then I did
have your like horrible feeling it was
like 18 corner we're putting one curtain
on beside it I think one set like where
that table is right there because we
have to the flatness of the wall is what
makes the echoes well it's reflecting
like sound and light work very similarly
similarly nothing I can do with that
corrugated ceiling though that's
pointing right back I'm going to do
about that fake drop ceiling and stole
up the entire thing yeah I know I would
love to hang stuff from this and I might
just do it get some of the sound clouds
but I don't have a lighter tall enough
to get up there cuz I could just hang it
up wire up there I think I do so it's
like the six foot we have but there's
like it expand out in your climb in it
not me okay okay well so shout out to
our mondo Ferreira he's got a channel
check it out we I've been putting off
buying
beadboard I think hashtag or quotations
beadboard because that's what places
like film stock and and all these other
like film supply shops now
just thick-ass styrofoam that they want
like $300 for and what you do is use a
clamp and you can move it around you can
bounce light off I'm sure you've seen
like awesome videos and stuff that's
like that but I've always been like why
they charge you 300 bucks for styrofoam
it just doesn't make any sense anyway so
Armando was like now you just go to
Lowe's and get it they got it there
it's just insulating it's just
insulation into a inch and a half thick
insulation high-density styrofoam so we
had them cut it we're going to gas tape
up the edges so that it doesn't flake
and it costs $16 one six $16 we bought a
whole saw a hammer the styrofoam and
some blades for the exacto knives I
showed you guys earlier that is like
completely dull as for 56 bucks I
know you know you can probably like text
telling news that we make it ourselves
and then crop it up this I know right
sort of ni perpetuating the problem it's
not fractal Josh is going to probably
meet up with us I stopped to hang the
curtains in the studio on the wall
because we're going to hang curtains on
the wall to one it's somewhat decorative
and two it's going to help reduce some
of the reflection of audio I'm trying
this out first because it's a lot
cheaper to try this out with like the
blackout curtains and the heavy heavy
density our heavy material curtain which
is actually why you see these in like
movie theaters and like live stage
theaters and even like concert halls
churches use drapes hanging they did it
on purpose one not just because it's
pretty but it I guess Hiro was thinking
I had like a cool idea like hey we could
use curtains and turns out that's kind
of like an industry standard they even
sell like acoustic curtains I was like
well damn I thought I had an original
idea y'all haven't had an original idea
but someday at least you tried
so we're going to try this first oh this
is a lot cheaper than going out and
buying like all the foam it would take
to actually put up true acoustic
treatment I've got to try the cheaper
methods first guys I make my living on
YouTube yeah baby work it work that
styrofoam yeah work it
this thing's app so much harder than
normal Center program it is lined with
metal polish other things lined with
metal aah oh you baby big baby just
rented it welcome to idiot hey what's up
everybody
Josh would look like he had friends like
can I come hang out connector can I come
play with you guys
that's me earlier today about free visa
was about Jay in case anybody secure
tweet alert I don't know Twitter would
you say way to say about me I just go to
my buddy DMX we're titling that I can't
repeat what I just said on camera that's
a good thing
that's good look at this look at the
thing behind you Wow Wow this one yeah
and then the back side just like a
dollar day you know this is a really
good deal is the sandpaper off like look
at the ink stick okay and they will camp
here for tonight
wow that's pretty well lit so there it
is right there
bouncing off and it's funny this is why
I forgot I forgot this guy in here of
course it's gonna be like all adjusting
right now because of the light
I forget like this is not a very bright
light right here the one I showed
earlier this is that what Jenner a light
let's I bought that off of Austin a long
time ago I'm here was do this there we
go
you can see it really fills nicely I
guess not harsh at all if I stand like
right here maybe a little bit of
backlight from there backlight from
there still light from there I like it
I even have C stands and a sandbag for
it I'm all I feel all professional a
prefilled sandbag that's worth even more
can they put my own dirt in it we got
Nick over here still trying to figure
out how to do this stuff with the
shelves in there for all the gear we got
this curtain up blocking off some of the
space so now we have kind of like almost
like another set right here and that's
blocked off right so if we were doing
something like this we turn a little bit
you can see the curtain that's another
year this place certain looked like a
studio and that's scary
did you look like Gigantor from this
angle I am Gigantor come in here I know
if I said three oranges when I was New
Year's rockin on private time pre-rolls
please keep watching the choir stuff so
Jay can do more things that people are
okay with or at least tolerate the funny
thing is actually have to edit a
pre-roll and finish filming part of it
tonight
when we started filming that you were
tweeting out the other day what else I'd
love to do I mentioned might as well
mount some curtains on the walls so I
feel like I got something done besides I
bought something and stood it up
something we put it together and well
let's go home I did I bought something I
made NIC put it together and it was
video ok the curtains are up you see I
got some curtains on the wall over there
I got a random ginger walking around
over there more curtains on the wall
over there and I guess the question is
at this point does it sound any better I
don't know does it to you over there
yeah especially like you can actually
feel when you hear the reverb in person
your ears hear like a tinny sound right
more so than you hear in a mic but here
it just feels a lot less like dull which
is kind of what you want want some flat
sound we won't know until we do the next
video anyway that was two idiots and a
really tall idiot
work on the studio we still have those
lights but you guys can go get pizza I
got to edit this video now I promised
they'd have it today no one get a lot I
know no one's going to watch it it's
going to make me sad I'm going over here
you guys suck
anyway yeah so here's my view from the
couch that's that I I know that I know
some of you guys like blogs and some of
you don't but really it's just a way for
me to get work done while doing work I
guess that makes I mean two idiots do
things as this video right now and put
it up so what you saw was everything we
did today I've got to steam these
curtains because they are definitely
wrinkled actually all we need is Josh to
stand next to them and they'll just kind
of like he's so hot that he's just
steaming them up himself
anyway the EVGA GTX 1080p I for the win
