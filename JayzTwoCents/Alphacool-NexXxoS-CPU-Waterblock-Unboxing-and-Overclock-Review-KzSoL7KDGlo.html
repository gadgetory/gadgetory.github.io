Jays two cents and if you've been
following me for any length of time you
know that I am an avid water-cooler
which is why I'm really excited to bring
you this unboxing of the Alpha cool
Nexus CPU waterblock this is a high-end
copper water block and let's go ahead
and dive inside the package here and see
exactly what you get the box itself is
not very exciting it's just got sub the
company logo on there it's got some
barcodes and the name of the product
obviously and then you know kind of an
electronic little design there on the
back it says RoHS compliant it's got the
website for alpha cool on there as well
as the name of the cooler once again so
the box isn't incredibly exciting but
it's what's inside that we're all
looking forward to right off the bat
when you open it up you see you've got
your manual here for installing the
bracket to hold the block on to the
motherboard
you've got your general assembly
instructions right here in English if
you open it up you get basically the
same thing here in a few different
languages you've got French English and
German you also have some of your
security notice here and your warranty
information listed right on here you can
find out more about that on their
website you also have the list of the
parts that are included here inside the
package and those parts are listed right
here you've got your retaining screws as
well as your wing nuts and your Springs
and it also comes with it looks like
thermal paste but I'm not entirely too
sure what compound this is because you
see it's not labeled as you can see
right here the the compound it comes
with is not labeled so I'm not entirely
sure of what the compound is on this I
will be sure to use it in the
installation of this block because this
is what it comes with so I'm going to
assume that this is what they recommend
you use with their water block these are
all the retaining brackets it does come
with an allen key right here which you
need to tighten down obviously the
screws and springs right here you get
your retaining bracket looks like it's
both for AMD and Intel I'm really
excited to see this because a lot of
manufacturers are now making you choose
whether or not you have to select AMD or
Intel and they're doing that to cut back
on costs and materials but unfortunately
if you find yourself in the position I
am where you're considering moving over
to Intel from AMD you don't want to have
to buy a replacement bracket you'd like
to already have it contained in the
package so alpha cool does that Bravo to
you guys for including that in the
package makes people like me who are
very fickle with their hardware very
happy let's go ahead and get over to the
meat of the contents here and that is of
course the water block this thing is
very heavy looks like it's got a very
looks like it's a possibly a brass and a
copper here
it could be solid copper I'm not
entirely sure the base right here
appears to be machined very very smooth
there is a sticker right now covering
the surface of the block itself I'm not
going to take this off until I'm ready
to install it you've got four screws
here that obviously are holding the top
piece on right here this is a black
chrome this is a solid metal top based
on the screw threads on the inside you
can see it's copper on the top as well
so it is a full copper block both top
and bottom you can see the channels in
there both for the inlet and the outlet
it does look like it's got quite a bit
of surface area in there alpha cool has
always been near the top if not on top
of all of the cooling charts when it
comes to their blocks so I'm really
excited to see how this performs
compared to my excess PC R a storm block
lately my race storm just hasn't been
cutting it when it comes to my overclock
so this is something that I'm really
looking forward to to testing this is a
very neat design though that it's it's
very very basic but again it's elegant
at the same time so if you like to show
off your system like I do this is
definitely going to be a good addition
to your system so that's everything that
comes in the package just go ahead and
get my system torn apart let's go ahead
and get some of the old parts out of
there
let's get this CPU block in there let's
put it to the test and see just how this
thing performs
Oh
now I do have one gripe about this water
blog and that's that the inlet and the
outlet are awfully close together which
is kind of strange considering the size
of the block you would think they could
have moved them a few millimeters apart
which would allow me to be able to use
both compression fittings on this block
I'm using monsoon fittings and I can
only get one to fit so if just be
mindful of that if you're using
compression fittings but now we've come
to the part that we've all been waiting
for
the temperatures now I am using this
water blocking my AMD system I'm using
an AMD FX 8350 at stock speeds right now
for the initial test so let's go ahead
and take a look at how cooling performed
at stock speeds on the AMD now at stock
speeds it was an impressive 32 degrees
core temperature maximum for the FX
that's really really good considering
it's 125 watt chip now considering its
stock speeds it's nothing entirely too
impressive so let's see how well this
thing performs at nearly 1 gigahertz
overclock now once again I am using my
FX 8350 but it's important to note I'm
at one point four eight eight volts and
I'm running at four point nine three six
gigahertz that is almost a 1 gigahertz
lot from stock speeds now using prime95
with all cores maxed out at 100% you can
see right here that the CPU socket temp
is at 49 degrees Celsius and our core
temps maxed out at 49 degrees Celsius
that's less than 50 degrees Celsius on
the cores with nearly a 1 gigahertz
overclock so far my experiences with
this block have shown that if you're an
avid water cooler then you're definitely
going to want to consider using the
Alpha cooled Nexus water block for your
CPU whether you're AMD or Intel the
temperatures are great the quality of
the block is outstanding it's very solid
it comes with plenty of surface area to
give you maximum cooling regardless of
the chip or the amount of overclocking
that you're doing but as is always the
case with water cooling you want to make
sure that you have adequate radiator
surface area as well as the matching
components in order to complement the
block as best as possible
so there you have it guys this has been
Jays two cents on the alpha cool Nexus
CPU waterblock used with my am
FX 8350 this block is a winner in my I
definitely consider if you're building a
water cooling system and as always
follow me on Twitter subscribe and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
