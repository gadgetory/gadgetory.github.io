today we're going to go ahead and
discuss a topic that's probably a little
close to home for a lot of people I have
a special guest today we have holiday
doc here say hello duck it is me holiday
doc joining my good friend here jst
cents and he didn't even give me like a
countdown or nothing before you started
you just you just went balls deep right
in there off the start without any
warning hey you know that's the way i
roll just jump right in stick it all the
way in and what's my best that's how I
got my daughter oh okay good to know
good no that was a one-take good so what
do we talk about today today I want to
discuss a little bit about how we came
to meet and how there was a barrier that
many people could say would be between
someone like me and someone like you and
I want to discuss what it was that made
you say hey I'm gonna talk to this guy
who is in absolutely nobody when it
comes to youtube or any community
whatsoever and discuss why you gave me
the time of day because i'm finding
right now as i'm trying to break through
some barriers on youtube and trying to
expose myself a little bit i'm trying to
collaborate with other people that are
within you know my subscriber range and
i'm getting a lot of no's from people
and getting people who are not wanting
to talk to me and was even told by one
guy and we'll leave it nameless I don't
want to start any drama that he thinks
my channels better than his and has more
potential so he doesn't want to
collaborate with me and that right there
just kind of one sent me into a little
bit of a rage with within myself I
didn't go public with it but it really
made me think to myself what is YouTube
doing to people to where it's creating a
form of narcissism where it's all about
them so I notice that probably actually
a right there that probably would have
often done like eight different
directions in that one sentence but it
did it's on my mind and let's talk about
it so this is a blogad e / rant / dual
commentary I get I guess hey it's a it's
a print it's a brand I like it we could
probably market the
idea sell it off make some money and
stop talking with everybody that has
helped us get to this point so far but
then that would just put us right in the
status quo and then we blend in with
everybody else but that's that's the
endgame that's the end goal right
everybody wants to be the next
woodysgamertag FPSRussia whiteboy 7
Street everybody wants a hundred
thousand dollar a month paycheck for
doing YouTube videos right nobody wants
to talk to the next guy who but could
potentially I'll do him in the battle
but but it is your bid you help somebody
out in this world but isn't that the
wrong intentional ready for a new guy
like myself to even think i'm in this
for a paycheck because i'm not let so
many people are right hey I that's where
they fail yeah I agree if you don't do
YouTube for what it is as a starter
which is YouTube just having fun and
creating content that you enjoy and love
or sharing content that you enjoy and
love then you essentially have set
yourself up for failure already because
you will grow slowly you will get
discouraged you will not make a lot of
money in your first while unless you are
super lucky or you have a big budget on
your channel and you spend lots of
advertising dollars with big-name
youtubers yeah I mean right off the bat
you were very approachable in fact you
approach me a lot of people don't
understand how holiday doc and I became
you know friends is he found me on
twitch I was live streaming to like
three people and I and the reason why i
started live streaming was i had a
friend who went on vacation and he was
going through battlefield withdrawals so
i said how do i stream how do i can i
get my game content up there so he can
watch and i came across twitch and
within a couple of weeks was just
streaming one night and then you popped
in and you said hey this guy is kind of
cool you sent out a Twitter and next day
i know i had like thirty five people in
there and that was like you know when in
terms of streaming that is tiny but to
somebody who's never had more than five
Watchers at one time to all of a sudden
see 35 people in there and then you know
follow after follow after follow was
just blown away by it
uh yeah I know I hang out in twitch
streams all the time and I like to go to
the streams that have the least amount
of viewers because they're trying harder
to impress the audience they interact
with their audience they don't have
anything but up to go I'm reminded of
where father and son gaming with that
you know father and son gaming who
started off really small and you know
got the attention of a couple of big
people and they send out some tweets and
then they had what 1,200 viewers yeah
you know 90 1,500 viewers in one night
and these guys basically had a rostrum
audience of 12 so yeah so these big guys
could have you know if they hadn't
exposed them and been kind enough to say
I'm going to use my you know many use my
big subscriber base to promote these
guys and hey give him some viewership
you know if they weren't willing to do
that these guys probably would still
remain unknown today and they're growing
from that one night that one night of
streaming and the stars aligned when the
right guy came in the channel you know
boom there they were I would think I was
the second or third known person I
thought oh yeah I hate saying that word
but I was the third person to get in
there and start tweeting it out and when
I got in there they had 12 years 13
beers yeah I was just like a phenomenon
one person after another just tweeted
about helped him out and I thought it
was good I try to do that often often
you'll see me tweeting out just no name
streams and I mean lots of very cool
people very humble people that way and
you expose yourself to the people in the
community that are all trying to better
themselves or better their own content
so they try harder and you might learn
something or take something away from it
I think that's where i find myself today
is I'm trying really hard to give
content to people that they want to see
not to grow myself but to give them you
know they came to my channel they
watched a video they walked away with
something you know it's so a raging
hard-on that's that's the nest that's my
next goal if you are leaving with a
raging hard-on
then I'm not doing my job right so okay
so what what do you think makes it makes
you different then the other big guys
out there who are who are all
egotistical assholes just bluntly put it
out there they're assholes I wouldn't
say everybody is an egotistical asshole
because they definitely won't show you
that side of them publicly like you have
to realize everybody who goes on camera
and presents a persona that's exactly
what it is and that's all it is every
once in a while they slip up though and
they show who they really are exactly
and if you ever meet them in real person
it's it comes out so what makes me
different I couldn't really tell you I
just enjoy the community I don't do it
as a full-time job I think that helps
and I just never got a big head ever
everybody just kept putting me down I
guess or pop in the bubble I guess you
could say but you kept coming back right
yeah i mean i've yet to get a hater but
i'm not really exposed and that's gonna
happen someday someone's gonna come in
and flame the shit out of me somewhere
and i'm already prepared for that
because i'm new to youtube but i'm not
i'm not new to communities and I've been
flamed in other communities and gotten
through it and laughed it off because
hey it's you know it's really funny shit
but you know how what would what advice
would you have to someone like me and
somebody watching who's contemplating
hey I want to make a youtube channel or
something but I'm afraid to put myself
out there right so I've done it I've
taken that leap I put myself out there
and in less than a month I've got 117
subs and I think that's good I think
it's good I think it's really good
you're also partnered that's true but
you know again I have never have that
connection to thank for that partnership
yeah I think anybody's gonna start a
YouTube channel has to fully realize
that you're not gonna do it for the
money the money is not gonna come until
you do it for a passion of you know
gaming or creating content something
so I think that's the first step second
step would be to try to get yourself out
there you know you gotta you gotta
network yourself at least a little bit
you can't be the lone wolf and plan to
grow leaps and bounds so you're gonna
have to get out there use social media
talk to people and kind of something
that you said you have to remember that
you need to be a viewer as much as a
producer like you can't just expect to
just make content but not watch anybody
else's yeah and anybody watching this
video right now we're listening i should
say i sent out a tweet about a maybe a
little less than a week ago and I
basically said one of the large youtuber
is going to remember that they have to
be a viewer as well as a director
because I I mean that's what some of the
most common responses i'm getting from
people and reaching out to also they say
oh I don't watch youtube videos I just
make them well that's like saying I make
TV shows but I'm in TV shows but I don't
want to hold up a level so I have to
interject here because I was that guy I
and the reason was because I was in such
a niche market of videos I didn't ever
want to risk watching somebody else's
video thinking it's a good idea and then
having that idea but not being able to
release it because it wasn't my own so
if I was creating competitive content I
absolutely refuse to watch anybody
else's competitive contact and I guess
looking at it now kind of makes me a big
fucking asshole but it helped me you
know I never stole anybody else's ideas
i never took anybody else's ideas i was
always the innovator that's you knew a
trendsetter right i mean it's impossible
to be original on youtube today oh yes
everything is reloaded yes and it and
that seems to be trending right now
everyone's putting the word reloaded in
their title and they're getting a shit
ton of news because of it so I guess
that's the challenge is to break
barriers get yourself known try and
collaborate and make recycled content
interesting
because I I I tweeted out my channel to
till a particular guy who's got a lot
more subs than me but a lot less than
you so he's right in the middle and the
first thing he said is that a good topic
but it's recycled and I told them well
no shit everything on youtubes recycled
so what are you expecting you know I
guess that's a bit of a ran itself but
so yeah that's that's my challenge today
and I just wanted to kind of vent to
somebody who I knew would listen and get
a little bit of advice for myself and
other people because I every time
somebody subs to me first thing I do is
I go and look at their channel and I've
noticed maybe only three or four people
actually have any subscriber base and
that's ranged from a thousand subs to
30,000 subs yeah and you know it there's
also pull out there and you know I want
to give a shout out to redneck because
his really cool guy and he's only
following me because you told him to
yeah I'm he said it he said all right
doc I'm only gonna follow this guy
because you said so but I had content
and opinions that he was interested in
whether they were you know only useful
for a moment or you know in the future
it doesn't matter he's somebody now who
is watching me and I whether he's
lurking or he's not watching hawks it
doesn't that's another thing like a lot
of youtubers will learn will subscribe
to you on like a ghost account but if
you want to keep this commentary any
sort of decent length i think you should
kind of tapper off agree to continue now
I see that mind sitting at twelve and a
half minutes right now there you go so
this can be cut out so how we can know
no one take mr. one take sir you lose
none of this editing you'll see this
this probably won't be in the channel
because it doesn't we'll be okay well I
appreciate it thanks for having me on
thanks for getting up Rick maybe this
will maybe we'll do this again at a
thousand subs and we'll see how a
thousand let's do that like 200
okay well you know and this is be kind
of a neat series because we can see how
things change as I grow and see if I eat
my words or I maintain that humble you
know opinion yeah all right well thanks
