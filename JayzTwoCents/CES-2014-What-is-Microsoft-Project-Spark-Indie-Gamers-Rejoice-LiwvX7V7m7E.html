insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strapped in with Jays two cents as he
takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys Jays two cents here and i
am here at the AMD booth or the AMD tent
here at CES 2014 and i'm joined here
with james from project spark microsoft
studios we know what we're looking at
here you kind of gave me a demo already
is a user based gaming GUI basically
where you can create your own games any
type of game that you want so I kind of
caught a little bit of this i'ma let you
talk about this because this is really
interesting so we like to refer to a
project spark as I open the world
digital canvas where you can create your
own games your own rose and your own
story just kind of get in here and
showing some of the basic tools we have
a tool set over here where you can kind
of get in you can owe this all right
expand tool so one of the one of the
ways you can sculpt terrain and start to
get in here to make something cool now
you're doing hand based gestures here
but I mean obviously this works with
mouse and stuff on 8.1 absolutely so
this is our windows 8.1 bill and what
you're saying but uh but it's gonna be
on xbox one it's gonna be an xbox 360
and you can use mouse and keyboard you
can use controller so whatever's
comfortable for you comfortable for you
it's kind of cool to show it off on you
know with the ppi it's a lot of fun but
I equally as fun on the other plant
device as well so it's just kind of like
a paint program but you're telling it
what to create based on the type of
brush you're selecting yeah so it's um I
think it's more of a kind of a you know
world editing too so I mean I'm in here
I can I can play around my world I can
set it to look exactly how I wanted to
look and then once I feel like I have a
you know you know it scoped it out the
way I wanted to scope I can use my
smarts paint brushes to kind of go in
here and quickly paint my terrain where
I can use my biome brush which is
actually going to give me some props and
other objects that are going to spawn
into my world so as you can see I have
some trees things like that are going to
drop in and opinion on the size of this
brush I'm going to get some different
objects but it's just one of them one of
the aspects of project spark so not only
kind of make something that looks really
cool I can actually get into the game
start to add some other stuff to it so
I'm just going to before I happen to
play i'm going to add a couple enemies
in here and just like hitting just like
that hitting play grab my controller
here i'm in the game and i can start to
fight these goblins are just just set
you can see my water plane you can see
my cave just like that we've actually
created a dynamic experience in a short
amount of time now if i want to change
this if i don't want to have goblins
that are attacking me if i want to
change that's what's up my game i can
easily do that and just for the record
guys in about 30 seconds he made a small
little RPG interactive game with goblins
and stuff and I mean okay so what kind
of games can you create oh man it's
limitless i really wish i could put it
in a box and say hey you can make just
this kind of game with this kind of game
but but I'll because we're curling in
beta right now we have a few thousand
people that are in our beta and seemed
the games that they're creating it's
really impressive so this is just ranges
from me you know you can puzzle games
shooters you know just driving games you
know whatever kind of blackjack you know
those type of games whatever kind of
game you want to make this up there's a
way you can make it in projects part
okay now show us how you kind of create
some of the dynamic of the character and
whatnot so this this how we control the
brain this our brain so a lot of our
objects have what we call default brains
this is one of them here so right now
you can kind of follow our logic so when
do logic so when a espresso do jump when
you know excess press or the left mouse
button is pressed to attack when Weiss
press to shoe so you can kind of follow
the logic power creating here okay now
you're showing controller-based
interactions is it same thing at the
right click left click in keyboard
mapping absolutely and you can you can
completely change that all yourself so
you can change how your controls are set
up you can also change your controls to
be just touch only you can make a touch
on your game if you like so this is our
this our goblin brain so I can change
this all line by line if i want to
change his behavior or i can go into my
brain gallery we're just gonna give me a
lot of different options this is kind of
a really kind of a easy way to kind of
get in and learn about our brains and
start to do some really cool stuff so
just gonna put a bird brain on that one
who was he was just attacking me your
second ago put a bread brain on him in
for this honor make him friendly by
going over to our follow a healer brain
what i did follow a normal so see here
do the healer i like the healer brain so
that's it so I'm use our following
healer brain and just like this will go
back into play we're going to see how
this is just changed our game so right
now I'm going to go over to this when
you just trying to help me out and this
one I said a bird brain too so when I go
over to him is flying away so just like
that
it's kind of just a small example of all
of the way you can customize your own
game and change the game to make
whatever you want to make okay James
couple of questions one sounds and
things can you record and put your own
sound so so so you can edit your own
sounds in your games right now using the
options that we have in game but
something else that we have coming us
really cool on the Xbox one is we use
the Kinect to do performance capture so
with this tool you can actually go into
full body animations records your your
voice record your facial animation your
hands opening closing you can actually
map those animations to a character in
the game so just imagine the
possibilities of a you know attacks or
just special moments that you can add to
your game using the Kinect ok now
another question here obviously you're
demoing this on 8.1 right now ok you
mentioned Xbox one so how do they
interact so it's a cross platform game
so you can start creating on one device
and finish creating on another device or
you can create on one device and your
friend can play it on the difference of
I so i can create on 8.1 my friend can
grab my game play it on his xbox one he
can also remix it on his xbox one and
shared back up and i can pick it up back
on my 8.1 device ok so it's all done
through the mites it through the
marketplace you upload to the
marketplace and then you can bring it
down to your console sure absolutely
yeah well James thank you very much for
showing me that guy's you you know I'm
gonna give this guy my card I want to
get into this closed beta if i can
because like i mentioned to you before
we did the video i've kind of mentioned
gaming as stale and for me anyway i mean
i've been gaming for 25 years and i have
it really liked a lot of the direction
some of the games are going so this is
the kind of thing where you know maybe
it'd be fun to see what i could come up
with because it's really putting your
money where your mouth is gaming stay
let's see what you can come up with guys
it's been js2 since James thank you very
much project spark here from Microsoft
Studios giving you the ability to create
your own games first-person shooters
RPGs and and and multiplayer as well
yeah so there will be multiplayer we
haven't talked too much about it just
yet but we're excited to talk more about
it but all the information you want is a
joint project spark calm love to have
people sign up for our beta get in there
make some cool stuff and if everything
goes well you should be seeing it in
2014 guys make sure you're following on
Twitter for all of our CES 2014 coverage
