merch it's available now crowd me calm
/jc sense we got zip up hoodies we got
tri-blend we got a new logo I digress
since 2012 but the rest logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys
little bit uh we all kinda stuff zip up
hoodies beanies polos don't take my word
for it cuz obviously I can't do this
edie so just look in the description
below and you guys will find the link
Thanks part two of the gold build went
live and you guys had a lot of
construction constructional criticisms
constructed construction and you guys
made some pretty good points and and I
said in that video I was not happy with
the way things were turning out with
this build in fact I've spent the whole
morning so far do you know what time is
right now what time is right now
oh yeah it's noon I spent the whole
morning again focusing and hyper
palpable how purple light had
verbalizing hyperbole focusing very hard
I've added by the boy I had a boy above
it a boy but as you can see I moved
those fittings that were on the top to
the bottom of the radiator and move them
on the back side closest to the
motherboard tray so this is where the
back of the case is right here and you
can see it's a lot more hidden your
focal attention is sort of brought to
the reservoir and the gold coupler right
here that's holding it to the radiator
speaking of radiator you can see I
switched it this is instead of being the
60 millimeter thick three hundred and
sixty millimeter radiator from ek water
blocks this is the cool stream cee that
was it XE which stands for 60 mil thick
this is the see II was like 45 mil thick
or 40 mils somewhere around there and
then the se is a slim which is the 30
mil thick so I've known with the 280 and
we're gonna be using 140 millimeter fans
on that we've got four or no five of
these that are actually going in this
case so we're gonna see how far we can
get on this today maybe get some pipes
bent and I also want to paint the shroud
on this radiator this one's got a very
rough texture to it which is why these
aren't really scratches as much as it's
picked up just well scratches but I
digress
so we can paint this and make it match
and then it will definitely bring a lot
more attention to
the the gold aspects of the case a lot
of you guys also commented on why
there's so many different shades of gold
happening
well that's because for whatever reason
every single brand that we've had a gold
product sent to us has used a different
tint of gold whatever as long as it's
mostly gold I'm cool with it so yeah
let's see how far we can actually get
today we're gonna start by painting the
radiator so a lot of people don't know
this about ek water blocks is this is
just a shroud on the core of the
radiators alright so here's what it
looks like obviously without the gold
paint on there that's gold it was a new
so I'm trying to figure out my tubing
run now like I said this is my outlet
from the pump and it doesn't necessarily
need to have the double 90s on there I
just stuck those on there for an idea
but I've got to get from there to here
on this side and what really would have
made more sense is if I had flipped the
block over 180 so if I come straight up
from this fitting right here it's going
to it the the tube will impact on the
side here it's not offset enough so I'm
gonna put this 45 on there with this 90
up like this
so it sort of offsets that's why I keep
a lot of these various angles on hand
45s 90s so with the 45 coming off of
there and then using the double rotary
90 we can offset it from that and now we
can come up and and do our thing as we
need so I'm thinking this is just going
to come straight out and go over and
down
you know if I don't say so myself so we
gotta somehow figure out to get from all
the way back there I lined it all up in
the wrong fitting this one was supposed
to go in that way so I think I'm gonna
have to I think I'm gonna have to flip
the block Hey
it just went it just went yeah see it's
okay
barely cleared right there it's like 1 2
3 4 90 degree fittings but hey it works
so I touched up the scratches it on that
gold panel it goes in the back which
means I have to take this all out now
including the radiator to get it in
there which means plenty of opportunity
for me to screw this up in some way and
one of the most common things I get
comment wise when people see this
anything it crosses over the RAM is well
Jay how are you gonna change your RAM
you don't need a lot of room to get RAM
in and out I mean it's not it's not
really that hard don't be afraid to run
things over the top of your RAM as long
as you have a few millimeters there to
be able to lift it out of the socket you
can then turn it and take it out so some
people might be wondering chill why are
you going with a 1600 watt power supply
that's such overkill well the Titans are
pretty power-hungry when you overclock
them you're gonna get about 330 to 350
watts of power draw we also have a 79 80
X to the XE and here we plan on doing a
little bit of overclocking with that
will pull eight hundred seven hundred
eight hundred by itself so if you do the
math on that we're gonna be pulling
under load over a thousand watts and
it's also the reason why I say over a
thousand watts you can't just add those
numbers together because the CPU under
100 percent load the GPUs won't be
because the CPU can't handle a GPU load
if it's doing stuff the other reason is
just the efficiency curve power supplies
are most efficient around 50 60 percent
and I want to just keep it as efficient
as possible and let's be honest the next
step down corn Odyssey is around the
1200
whattt mark and that's one make sure I
have more than I need because the power
supply is not gonna supply more than
it's being drawn I've had a lot of
people say gee you can't force 1,600
Watson now you're gonna blow it up like
you can tell who's definitely never
really played around with high-end
hardware or understands how the
electricity draw works it's only gonna
pull what it needs so yeah but this is
the EVGA 1600 t2 this is a titanium and
all the cables that we used from cable
wad are sleeved to this because it is a
full modular they're just gonna plug in
back here I do have to get out one molex
cable though because I knew that the
pump that I had got was a say two pump
but if you remember at the start of this
build I showed you guys how I end up
having to switch to the DVC which is a
molex means they'll use one ugly cable
okay so we're officially at the point of
well not really no return but definitely
inconvenient return because I've taken
the drives out of my workstation now
upstairs this is just a 4 gigabyte I
think yeah so it's a 4 terabyte drive at
Seagate Barracuda Barracuda it's a
Barracuda the storage that goes into
this machine is going to matter as much
this is a 960 gigabyte HyperX savage
drive
apparently I'm smarter than I thought
because I thought I didn't order a molex
but I did so once we get the power
supply in here and then get the wiring
all handled then we can fire it up I
know the parts individually work the
graphics cards we've tested the CPU
we've used the RAM we've used in other
builds the only thing I have not
actually tested and did a boot test with
on this is the motherboard and as much
as I love Asus I've had some motherboard
issues with them in the past that have
caused me to literally pull hair out so
my fingers are crossed on that so okay
let's just get this all done and we'll
come back when it's working
I don't want to talk about it I got my
flow backwards you have my flow
backwards so you guys remember when I
was like oh wait I did this tube long oh
I'm an idiot no I was an idiot the
second time not the first time the first
time I thought I was an idiot I wasn't
the idiot I'm the idiot now not the
first time because I forgot we went out
of the pump into the rad which means
this needed to go into the in on the
pump exactly as we thought it should and
then I was like women I thought that was
the out and so we filled it right now
we're started to feel like we realized
it's flowing backwards alright I fixed
it now we can do the fill montage get it
filled so we've got our 18 core 79 80 XE
this is a 99 but it's the first gen 18
core and it is not soldered but it is
deleted as you saw and we we've got a
weird mix of thermal paste we've got kpx
underneath the IHS and we've got MX 4 on
top which is definitely not the way it
should be but considering how many times
we've had to take the block off I use
the last of my kpx that I hadn't that
too but anyway open anyone so whatever I
have got hardware monitor up right now
we are running at 4.5 on all cores and
we're only running at 1.21 volts so it's
not a whole lot of voltage but it is
stable in fact we will go ahead and show
you right now is cinnamon running point
here your scores something to keep in
mind - and look at this the package hits
81 82 but the chorus and then nothing
ramps up it turns into a tornado sitting
in the 60s and 70s on the core and our
score 4438 but let's go ahead and do
this so i'm gonna save that score let's
load up some 3dmark and let's see what
our 3d mark times by extreme score is
okay so I keep getting crashes in the
CPU part of 3d mark so I lowered it down
to like 4/4 and anyway I didn't run the
test again we've got to get this video
edited and up for you guys I did did it
I did it I want to show you something
here these Titans are freaking hot low
that we're idling up 44 degrees the top
cards I'd only got 50 I mean there's
plenty of air gap here for you no air to
make it in there for it to pool and cool
itself off it's just there's a lot of
heat coming off the back plate of this
card being picked up by that one the
other thing too is these fans I'm going
to change out these these 140s although
they match the build perfectly because
they are fractal design fans they're
only 100 or 1000 rpm fans and they don't
move a ton of air especially through the
radiator and stuff on the front with the
door closed and all of that just had
some dialing in to do on the RAM
overclock and obviously CPU voltages
which takes longer than just clicking a
couple buttons in a video like this and
calling it done but what do you guys
think of the build I think I'm gonna
call this one gold digger because it
would cost nearly ten thousand US
dollars to build this on your own right
now we've got five thousand and one
hundred dollars because that's like $90
or $80 for the bridge so about 50 $100
worth of graphics cards two thousand
dollars with the CPU we got the latest
one anyway I think the motherboards like
five hundred dollars another like five
hundred dollars for the RAM and then all
the water cooling gear and yeah it got
expensive quick so anyway this is many
workstation and I shall always be
reminded of how much time it stole for
me is why I'm calling gold digger I
guess so there's a good tie into the
name okay guys thanks for watching and
as always we'll see you in the next one
where did they it's a radiator you ever
seen a guy have a stroke on life a
live-video dude that I am NOT an example
to be used in terms of life as an expert
did you imagine marrying this and then
having babies stupid hey MA there's a
gator in the house again
damn it Jay just build the computer and
stop having fun at work
jump having fun these videos that I want
to see shut up Phil actually do a
crossfire bill hmm that was a close call
sleep well my friends I forgot to put my
hot pockets in the freezer they've been
out for like two hours all right so all
we had to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
