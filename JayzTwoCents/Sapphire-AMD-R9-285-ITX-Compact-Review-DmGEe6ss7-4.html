and I promised this video was coming
even though it's not new to market its
new to me anyway we're gonna talk about
it because it's still worth talking
about damn it and that being set fires
r9 285 ITX compact graphics card now
this is the only r9 285 ITX 4 factor
graphics card you are going to find
except for this one this one exists and
then there's other ones that they made
that exist but you know what I'm you
know what I'm saying I think it's not
like this was the only card made and
then they shut down the assembly line
and I'm the one that has it that's not
the case although that would be kind of
cool the octane gaming gear combo from
Coolermaster features seven backlighting
colors turbo mode a vago 3050 optical
sensor along with four levels of dpi
adjustment now you can po noobs without
boning your wallet click the link in the
description to learn more okay so the r9
285 ITX compact is with our two doubt
compact it lives up to its name in fact
it's only a little bit longer than the
PCI Express slot on the bottom of the
card okay we'll just kind of do a quick
gloss over of the specs since I'm sure
somebody out there is never seen an R 9
285 or maybe you're even considering
buying this card it is the 28 nanometer
processor from AMD
it has 1792 stream processors in it and
a nine hundred and twenty eight
megahertz GPU core now that magic 1
gigahertz number is kind of nice to see
of course we did overclock this thing
and we'll talk about how that thing went
or how that went a little bit later in
the video now if we're cooling this tiny
little guy you can see we've got a
single fan that fills up most of the top
of the card followed by a heatsink that
runs the entire length tons and tons of
fins very heavy coupled with a four heat
pipe copper heat pipe design so you've
got a lot of thermal transfer happening
here in this block when it comes to
power it does require a single 8 pin PCI
Express power and then it does have a
PCI Express 3.0 interface now on the top
here you'll find the Sapphire button
which is for going between legacy BIOS
and UEFI BIOS and then on the back for
IO this is a little bit interesting we
do have a dual
DVI and HDMI 1.4 a I don't believe this
is hdmi 2.0 and if I'm wrong I will
definitely stand corrected but all I
could find was that it's hdmi 1.4 a and
it's got too many display ports and if
you don't have a mini DisplayPort
adapter or a mini DisplayPort monitor it
does include an adapter to a
standard-sized of DisplayPort on the
back of the card there is no backplate I
really wouldn't expect to see one at
this card's price point and you know
where it sits in the market and where
it's placed it does have a nice matte
PCB and everything about the card is
very attractive the black with the
aluminium on here looks very very nice
but of course let's just go ahead and
see how it stacks up just a quick note
before we roll that transition is that
all of these benchmarks were done at
1080p considering this fact the fact
that this is a 2 gigabyte card this card
is designed for 1080p gaming and so all
the benchmarks you're going to see are
at 1080p and whatever the settings were
at a settings were what the type of AAA
used I made sure I noted that in the
benchmarks but you're not going to see
this card put it up against any other
cards either AMD or Nvidia because the
benchmarks that I'm using this time
around are brand-new titles their titles
I haven't benchmarked any other card in
this office with yet well with the
exception of Grand Theft Auto 5 and in
the future we're gonna start doing a
complete list of where cards line up
with my benchmark suite we'll start
doing a complete list of graphics cards
and then placing them in performance
order so before you guys start telling
me I should do comparative saying why
how does it stack up against such and
such you got to give me time it takes
hours upon hours to do these benchmarks
and overclocks and stuff so anyway I
just wanted to save you guys the time of
typing that but probably you guys have
probably already typed it even though
the benchmarks aren't up yet anyway roll
the transition
all right so as you saw this thing packs
a hell of a punch you know it becomes a
little bit of kind of a mind play when
you see such a tiny card and you start
to judge the card by its size and and I
know not everybody does that I think a
lot of people do that I think a lot of
people like to see a nice big beefy
graphics card with tons of fans and it
just got pipes everywhere and cables
everywhere and lights everywhere because
that's what you think gives you the
power it's like adding horsepower to a
car by having body kits and stickers and
spoilers and all the things that really
don't make it faster sapphire has done a
hell of a job of designing this card
from the ground up
really the only thing AMD about this
card is the GPU core which they're
utilizing everything else about this
card is completely designed in-house by
sapphire and I think they've done a
fantastic job especially since so many
builders these days are going more
towards portability efficiency
temperature or low temperatures and
small form factors like especially the
ITX being such a a popular thing over
the last couple of years
temperature-wise I expected the same to
get hotter but it only got 273 degrees
Celsius in the most demanding tests now
what's cool about that is it was still
practically silent I say practically
silent because the fan did ramp up too I
think
was 52% I don't remember exactly what
was it move it was 52% and it barely got
louder than the slow spinning fans that
I have on the test bench now those
temperatures of course are in an open
air test bench and the reason why I do
that is because that means the only
thing limiting the cooling of the card
is the card itself if I put it into an
enclosure or a closed case and I don't
provide adequate air flow to it then
it's going to make the cards seem like
it's performing worse because the case
environment is performing worse so we do
open-air test benches because that gives
us the only bottleneck for cooling would
be the cooler itself so as you can see
73 degrees Celsius in open air in a
vertical format rather than horizontal
which horizontal bleeder not actually
gives sometimes some better cooling
performance this thing that a fantastic
job
I think sapphires got a hell of a card
on their hands here especially to anyone
who's looking at building a powerful
1080p portable small form-factor gaming
rig now this thing probably could play
mini titles at 1440p not 4k just not
enough vram but 1440p would be possible
on medium to low settings depending on
what you do but you're going to start
hitting sort of a VRAM limit especially
in modern titles with the two gigabytes
of vram now we did overclock the vram
from its effective 5500 from 1375 which
is technically where it's at remember
AMD is that number times 4 where in
videos that number times 2 some people
get confused about that so we were able
to take it up to 14 hundred megahertz
times 4 so that was where my overclock
was on that and it did a pretty
fantastic job no coil whine whatsoever
zero coil whine on this thing and really
I can't say enough good about it
small form-factor graphics cards are not
very common in fact the only other ITX
card that's on the market is by MSI and
it's an Nvidia brand and it's not an AMD
I think a lot of people were afraid to
take AMD GPUs and try and squish them
down like this because a lot of times
you need the massive cooler to keep the
GCN architecture or the Tahiti or Hawaii
GPUs extremely hot GPUs to cool them
down you need a massive cooler
but sapphire took the efficiency of the
285 which was one of the really major
selling points of AMD's 285 GPU and was
able to build a small form factor that
doesn't overheat doesn't get loud and
performs very very well really I can't
think of any cons for this card
whatsoever and that's pretty rare maybe
having the power plug point up instead
of out the back I don't know I mean this
kind of makes sense although when you
have the power plug coming out the back
it does add a little bit of link that
you might not be considering this
thing's only 171 millimeters long 110
millimeters high 35 millimeters thick so
it's extremely tiny I mean look look at
look at it compared to my hand I mean I
don't even have that big of a hand so I
think maybe having the plug point up
might have made a little more sense but
I don't know so then you have the
additional length of the plug you have
to consider if you're looking at doing a
really small form-factor
that's really the only thing I can come
up with to say that I might have
considered differently with this card
but again that's just me so what do you
guys think about this card I know it's
been out for a while we finally got
around to doing this review and I'm
interested to see how you guys feel
about these small form-factor ITX cards
would you like to see more cards and
small like TX form factor you know rumor
has it that this might be the size of
some of the newer 300 series cards
coming out from AMD that are featuring
the HBM or 3d stacked memory and we
don't have confirmation on any of that
and even if I had information on and I
wouldn't be talking about it but since
you don't have to have the RAM flanking
the GPU the RAM is on the GPU which
means you can save a lot of space you
could end up having top-tier high-end
you know top-of-the-line cards from AMD
that are no bigger than this which then
kind of circles back to the mental game
of thinking I want a giant GPU because
big GPUs mean more power and if it's
small it can't possibly be good right
alright guys there you go Jase do sense
thanks for watching we really hope you
guys have enjoyed today's video make
sure you guys tune in on Thursdays at 5
p.m. Pacific time where Jerry aka
barnacle ease and I we do our Tech Talk
not always about tech usually it's just
us hanging out
and I having fun with a bunch of you
guys watching and we really enjoy doing
that show so we'd like to get you guys
to come on over and watch us live on
Thursdays 5 p.m. Pacific time here
California that's - think 8 GMT here's a
problem Pacific Time Pacific time is
always changing - 7 - 8 minutes 7 - 8
and I always forget which one's 7 and
which one's 8 is it daylight saving is
it non daylight saving idly I don't know
see this is this is kind of how tech
talk goes we're already having a Tech
Talk of our own just you and me or like
monologuing here I'm monologuing and
you're listening this just got really
weird I'm gonna go ahead and end it now
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
