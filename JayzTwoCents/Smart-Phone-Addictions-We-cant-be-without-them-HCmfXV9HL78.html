at you with a live-action film here no
commentary over gameplay just my face in
your computer and today I want to talk
to you about something that I think is a
real issue in the world and that is we
are marrying our smartphones our
smartphones are taking over our lives
and we just can't get away from them no
matter what we do and no matter how hard
you try in the communications age you
just can't get away from your smartphone
it is taking over I I gotta take this
I'll be right back so if you think
you're not married to your smartphone
there's a couple of questions I can ask
you and find out whether or not that's
actually true question number one when
you wake up in the morning what's do you
do first check your smartphone or brush
your teeth that's gross your hygiene is
appalling and so is mine question number
two when you go to the bathroom what do
you take with you I bet more of you
check to make sure you have your cell
phone with you whether or not there's
actually toilet paper in your bathroom
speaking of which I gotta go see a man
about a wallaby ok what's your article
but not only is our life being invaded
by this little guy we are actually
becoming more lazy because of this
little guy for instance have you ever
called or text message someone in the
other room because you didn't want to
get up and walk 10 feet but seriously
man the things you can do on your phones
today it's just why wouldn't you want it
in your pocket constantly or in your
hand or in your ear or in your butt sick
why would you go why would you go there
but look at all the things you can do on
your cell phone you can email text
message send pictures take YouTube
videos and vlogs and upload them order
pizza oh man I'm fighting a little bit
of a cold sorry my voice sounds a little
bit raspy here but you know you're just
gonna have to deal with it cuz it's not
gonna get any better but you can check
sports scores you can check your stocks
and see how much you know Facebook's
falling or you can see how much apples
gone up and down and Google's gone up
and down blah blah blah blah blah you
can check all the stocks you can check
and see how many people committed
suicide at Foxconn today there's
definitely an app for that but you can
play games you can surf the web pay your
bills get turn-by-turn navigation spy on
your wife or girlfriend check the
weather scan some bar codes
the cheapest price buy something at ebay
amazon find a date on craigslist her
adult friend finder every once in a
while actually make a phone call but
having so much information at the tip of
your fingers can create a couple of
problems in your life and I'm completely
a victim of the smartphone addiction you
can do anything under smartphone
practically and that leads to a lot of
distractions and we all know that friend
or that family member who never puts
down their phone it's like no matter
what they do the phones just glued to
their hand put down your phone already
seriously get a life bro but all
seriousness folks there's just those
people out there you just want to take
their phone use you want to smash it
because you know their world will come
crashing down you become addicted to
this technology you can't put it down
you're distracted you're in the movies
and you're texting and you're getting
elbows by the wife because you won't
stop checking your subscribers in your
messages on YouTube and stuff you mad
bro a couple of other negative things
when it comes to smartphone technology
is you just have this overwhelming
desire to have the newest hottest phone
on the market right you buy the galaxy
s2 yeah yes this thing is top of the
line and then the bastards come out with
the galaxy s3 and then Apple has the
iphone 4s and then they come out with
the iphone 5 and now there's already
rumors about the iphone 5s and the
iphone 6 and the iphone over 9000 how do
you deal with that you just buy them all
that's what i do but you feel like you
have to have the latest phone out for
whatever it is that you like whether
that be Android or Apple or Windows
Phone 8 or blackberry blackberry sorry I
just threw up a little in my mouth
oh but you know you you got your brand
new iphone 4s right and you come home
and you're like yeah I've got this
badass phone and then you see that
facebook message from Billy Bob who says
just scored an iphone 5 you mad bro and
you're like why yes make a cat just got
murdered
but you're like yeah bro I am mad cuz I
just bought this one and then then you
have you have that one I don't know go
kill myself no disclaimer suicide is not
cool it is not accepted it is not a way
out if you feel like you have to commit
suicide because you don't have the
latest various technology please seek
help or email me and then you go and you
are you go to buy your brand new phone
and you're like yeah made up my mind I'm
gonna get the galaxy or I'm gonna get
the iphone 5 but what what size do i get
what do you mean there's there's
multiple sizes i thought i had this all
figured out you always do this to me I'm
sweating now loses you get your phone
and you're like okay I'm gonna get a 16
gig is that enough well I run out of
space experts did actually determine
that you could free up a lot of space on
your phone if you just deleted any
images you had a videl oh oh my god she
just sit there mind her own business and
all of a sudden is just like where Jays
two cents comes in just sucker punches
it's not nice smartphones have made us
so connected with each other that you
expect an instant response most of the
time right you receive a text from from
from the house where is my phone oh my
god ever scare me like that again I
can't stay mad at you you get that text
message you're like oh yeah do I want to
go to the movies tonight ok cool you
text back and you go send then you wait
you wait and you text again hey did you
get my text anyway so then you call why
the hell isn't she texting me back and
by she i mean my wife because I would
never have any other she in my life I
bit my for 13 years I am a happily
married man and that would nothing can
change that not even the smartphone but
then you go there she not actually text
me back so then you call one ringing two
and a half rings voicemail well she just
pushed you in a voicemail how many of
you done that how many you have received
a call and you're like oh I don't talk
to that person so you go Boop voicemail
well the person on the other end knows
oh it didn't ring seven times it rings 7
x on verizon before it goes to voicemail
it rang three so you sent me to
voicemail how many of you could put down
your phone for one whole day and not
touch it not look at it not check
voicemails emails text messages YouTube
nothing I don't even know if I could do
that I work in IT it's impossible for me
to do that but I don't even think I
could go from the moment I came home to
the moment I go to bed without checking
my email on stuff there's times during
the
I may hear the phone vibrate on the
nightstand and I've gotta roll over a
check it was it YouTube was it work was
it there's no one else too early ever
messages me see technology just made me
realize how incredibly unpopular I am so
what do you guys think I want to hear
from you what do you think cell phones
are smartphones in general are doing to
your lives are they doing you a lot of
good are they doing you a disservice by
making you feel like you were just
attached it is it's a part of you you
can't get rid of it and just to show how
committed I am to the whole concept of
marrying your smartphone I practice
polygamy alright guys so that's my
challenge to you to see how long you can
go without actually using your
smartphone in one particular hello be
right there buddy oh uh the pizza of my
wife ordered on her smartphone just got
here so I'm gonna go get that and eat
some dinner you uh check out my other
