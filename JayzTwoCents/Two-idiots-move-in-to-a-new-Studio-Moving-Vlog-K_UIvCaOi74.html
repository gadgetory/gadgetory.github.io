studio if you can hear me over the
engine we're sitting I'm getting loud
alright just my random cameo in Jays
video so you'd want to shoot it all down
here I don't think I need you figure
this is Isaac

hey Isaac you guys wears pajama pieces
it was our mind trying tonight this it's
by this how are they gonna fit I'll be
all front-heavy
this videos the cameras then turn on and
off like I don't know a handful of times
in the last five days or so since Jerry
was here and Jerry's long gone and then
Nick and I have already started moving
into the studio here's we're under with
this video we have very piece together
weird kind of a vlog which is funny
because this isn't the intro of applause
it's an abstract I feel I want to do I'm
going to put this in the beginning of
the video so you guys are going to see
the studio today we already started
putting together furniture we put
together some of the couches a little
conference table slash eating area
haven't moved any of the equipment for
upstairs yet
but we're going to show you guys that
today we're going to go buy a TV for the
living room set you guys haven't I don't
even know if you've seen it yet I don't
even know if you guys have seen this is
so out of order
that's through it on Instagram yeah I
read you guys should be following the
social meteors anyway we'll see you when
we get there what what funny positive
thank you or maybe under that's close
okay then load it like ammunition I
thought really low that he'll fall in
there
I figure if account a lot this is the
way I dismiss yeah you go very good oh
thank god it I receive hope you get to
take your setup little birdie look at
that that cabinet just loaded - that was
his idea
looks pretty and you know how many times
since we have it's definitely gradual
Betty okay obviously this is the kitchen
I apologize for the echo obviously we
need to do some sound treatment in this
room this is the kitchen area we have no
fridge yet this over here this
conference area make it a seating area
and meeting area whatever we're going to
power here so that when putting your
laptop something this over here is going
to be like the main set I wanted to feel
kind of like I don't know like a living
room home feeling setting not Jade porn
casting couch because everyone keeps
calling it I would have thought with
black leather if that was the whole idea
with that but I wanted it to be like I
don't know behind me was kind of a very
nice home feel I have a cyst in I have
an autonomous desk one of the big ones
that's going to be going right here
doctor I'm doing my reviews up standing
behind me will be the sex we have a lot
of our furnitures together still we just
put together some glass display cases
where I put like graphics cards and
things than that
we also need to go to the coffee table
which we're having motherboards and that
has got like a little glass display area
you'll see it when it's done
entertainment center and TV I think of
it look like a 50 or 55 inch I was
making big ass TV like a 70-inch but
that's not a big space for a big eyes TV
projector
no the windows are right there true
we're going to put the projector mmm man
it's like a beam okay you should do a
double-decker sofa up here is going to
be like the computers like gaming area
editing area and another like lounge so
up here is obviously where I'm going to
have my desk right here so I can
overlook I can overlook the headquarters
this is right jhq yeah probably have
another desk over here which will be
your area when you go full time a lot
people realize you're not full-time yet
like during the week your underwear is
coconut monkey where's Nick that's cool
or like the video edits to like Nick
this was a great edit yes you like I
didn't know how to do anything yet
this is where I'm gonna hide you'd be
like well some people come up milk I'm
thinkin server right here the problem
yeah because I can run a cable around
over there for the fiber because we have
fiber internet going in tomorrow I'll
take it like another couch here like
table I got a lotion a piano to this
account you know there's like a really
like a regular couch because I would
like this area to stay open enough to
where we can maybe have BRF here but we
have ceiling fans as a problem we'll
figure it out we have one that's also to
be like a gaming area two zippers we do
another live stream we need to set it up
I was thinking like the couch and lamps
and stuff here is good the livestream
area has a camera point there and then
streaming over there then like a laptop
see chat yes I like it
like the few rappers
like it's so industrial looking that's
going to be really good for be role and
such yeah it's very office you if you're
down there I could be like hey what you
doing in your work looking at porn hub
the idea won't my desk right here I can
I cannot see over and that way through
if I do a video like facing my desk you
can kind of see like I'm in the
background or even you'll just do that
feeling behind with a lighting like that
downloaded that's cool
yes cue so much natural light here
so what's natural rest they did they
like cleared so do this
it's like clear-coated but it's not I
don't think this is real rough this
looks like it's intentionally patina to
give it yeah that one right there oh
yeah that one yeah so we got more to do
today we got more furniture put together
nice I need to go buy TV and probably
have that delivered also if I get a
50-inch or like a 55 - in the car the
one that we never know is going to start
it already like salt on me coming here
it's my keeping it real car that's what
that's what Nick Halden it's the car
that like I'll never yes you never know
when you turn the keep it's going to
start yeah that's my that's my my
grounded vehicle keeps me real so what
would you call my friends when your cars
more reliable than this one you thought
awkward all right we need to get some
vinegar some food in our bodies we need
to measure to get a bigger over there
obviously part of the sound treatment is
going to be getting we need to break up
the wall so that's the problem too much
bouncing so take a while to get this all
set up but I'm hoping to be able start
shooting video in here primarily
tomorrow a few moments late I'll check
out Nick's creation he put together in
entertainment center for IKEA actually
took him like three hours to do it was
hard like it hasn't fallen over yet like
it did on Deadpool though check this out
ok so this is my on Thomas desk this is
going to be like my review area I'm not
going to say in terms of white wall it's
going to be more you know sideways with
the living room in the background but
check this out it is one of those sit
stand desk because always the fifty
inches high and it goes really low this
is a really good trying to do like Kate
now they claim 300-pound weight limit so
I think we should test that right now by
having mixed it on it he's not 300
pounds
nowhere near but with the table top and
stuff I just figured it's going to break
I want to break with him on it
oh the way I see it so they're gonna do
it okay so you need to come sit on this
side and then push the UP button and see
if it goes up with you sitting on it
hold it
oh okay stop okay
it sounded like it was struggling but it
was moving all right go down whoo she
goes down that I mean it went up yes and
that's a really heavy heavy table top
and the frame and all that I'm gonna say
a plane confirmed you only like 240
right yeah man
all right so we got these no ish it's
maybe like q7 d with the top on there
let's top it very very heavy so now we
have to go back to loads learning it's
an area rug for this area here I've got
the autonomous chair to put together and
then I picked this up at Best Buy today
went and bought this guy the sony bravia
X 850 D it's an LED HDR Ultra HD 4k TV -
55 inch fully $1,099 I say only a
thousand 99 I know that sounds very like
1% kind of thing to say but that's
because like HDR TVs and I first came
out were like thousands of dollars we
came down they came down a lot it's not
OLED or anything but then again it's
just for over there so we don't mean
think that extravagant unless you're
watching this video and you happen to be
Samsung or LG or Sony or whatever you
want to spend one then hey TV setup
coffee table the autonomous debt as we
already showed this is going to be kind
of an ankle I'll be doing videos and
stuff from like this I figured before I
end this video I just do kind of a quick
demonstration of what this set sort of
looks like so far obviously it's a work
in progress about multiple sets so that
time you started the upstairs yet but
we'll have the computer backgrounds and
stuff
on up there but this is sort of just
more of my laid-back kind of a living
room setting with this really awesome
autonomous desk I really like this desk
this desk is so cool anyway obviously I
need to do some sound treatment on the
walls as well got like a huge echo
chamber here I'm working on it and my
audio technica shotgun mic does a pretty
good job at rejecting a lot of it we
need to do sound treatment on the walls
and whatnot but it's been a long weekend
and I'm tired I just want to kind of
give you guys a quick little sneak peek
of what to expect here now I hear some
of you trust me I am with you when you
say I don't like the new set I like the
old set what was wrong with the bedroom
setting what was wrong with the shop guy
this is about being productive this is
about getting me out of the house in a
work environment where I can be much
more efficient and have a space that's
dedicated to only videography and doing
videos for you guys which hopefully
you'll find entertaining and you'll see
the benefit of doing this all in the
future so stick it out stick with me I
think you'll be pleasantly surprised at
what I have kind of planned moving
forward for this channel but I needed
something big and I need a huge change
as a route to cross that 1 million
subscriber milestone anyway time to go
guys thanks for watching this vlog where
we start showing you the studio here
trust me bigger and better things are
coming as always I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
