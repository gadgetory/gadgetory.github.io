sponsored by EVGA EVGA offers a wide
range of products including GPUs cases
power supplies motherboards and more to
learn how to take your rig to the next
level head to EVGA calm what's up guys
Jesse sense here we're gonna do things a
little bit differently today I'm gonna
kind of give you guys sort of a
first-person view I'm actually holding
the camera and talking right now as we
do this when you first walk in the
nanjing exhibition hall or the
conference centre this is what you're
greeted with and obviously if you guys
can't tell this is a very PC centric
conference show so let's go ahead and
walk and see if we can find oh hey
there's Brian I'm not too crowded yet I
mean this is literally the first day of
the show this is the first floor and
there are about five or six stories to
this convention center so we're gonna go
ahead and start making our way up here's
a list of all of the keynotes and things
that are happening the events here at
Computex so if you guys want to you know
go and see something there's a list if
you don't have it on your phone
here is the regular check-in for
attendees and Industry affiliates we are
press so we checked in through a
different thing we know we're in the
right place because we found security so
this is the second floor you're greeted
with the thermaltake booth one of the
largest here regardless you're a
position on Thermaltake and past issues
they definitely have a huge presence
here at Computex yes i'ma show you guys
one of the coolest mods here I've seen
so far and I'm showing you the plate of
his name because I guarantee I would
mutilate it but look at that
that is pretty intense Wow
yeah that's cool radiator built-in or
the GPU looks like it's part of the
engines and stuff it is really big -
it's gonna check out somewhat ZOTAC test
off
okay so let's call my attention right
here this is GC box VI 2 to 5 it's
running on the Gemini Intel Gemini Lake
P 4,000 CPU it is actually a fully the
full functioning PC it's about the size
of a two and a half inch v SD it is all
passively cooled the scene view is
pretty much similar like a Celeron it's
got two USB type-c and that's how they
micro micro power but this is capable
actually running to 4k displays at 60
Hertz and I asked what the use case for
this was they said digital signage but
they said you can actually do a 4k
playback at 60 Hertz something like
Netflix or movies or whatever with it
one forecast is here so I can't do in do
a 4k at 16 but it can do a single
display that is crazy so I'm starting to
look at this as like I don't I mean I
don't have cool specs on this like in
terms of storage and all that yet but
the use cases that come to mind on this
now or just kind of making my head go
crazy cuz I'm looking about car PCs and
movie playback for cars and
the NGO computing I was here under
rendering videos or playing games or
anything on it but the fact that you can
do I mean you see these signs and stuff
they're all over the place
that one's not moving but there's a lot
of a lot of moving signs around here
there's one back over there at the isus
booth so this is the kind of stuff that
you should actually do with this type of
form diagram something else they have on
display here is a bunch of old color
designs old and new actually just to
kind of show like some of the innovation
that they've gone through when they're
designing their coolers so these are
actually both current and past designs
they've come up with when they're
designing their GPUs so they went ahead
and did this because I wanted to show
you how even though there's no new GPUs
coming out right now they just want to
kind of show some of the design concepts
that they've come up with in the past
when it comes to GPU design so they've
test things like different types of fan
design different types of heat seek
design different types of you know
orientations of the fans this one on the
top right here if you look at it you can
see they're all actually kind of angled
towards the back which definitely you
know they're trying to zine open-air
cooling like this to push it out the
back of the case these actually have two
more fans underneath the grills that are
focusing the air inward towards the
hottest part of the GPU so so cool
designs they've tried in the past you
may or may not see it in the future they
said but they just wanted to display
this so that you can see their current
GPU designs they've come up with you
know what what the road looked like to
get there you know I know GPU designs
keep getting bigger and bigger but this
is just getting a little bit ridiculous
so Jack no just kidding this is just a
big display they're showing some of the
new RGB technology they're integrating
into their GPUs I think that should make
one that big what do you guys say that's
huge
bambam man that man that man oh man
bam bam bam an event around a Bam Bam
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam
wow wow wow Ryan's trying out this it's
like a lazy boy with a computer screen
everything built into it
oh its motion oh how does it fit for a
big guy now we got to move
did you break it you broke it this is
kind of the ultimate just I want to
relax hang out in a chair right feet
he's got feet what do you think it's
good all right
it's about the coolermaster booth and
they're showing off the C 700 M this is
a basically an evolutionary upgrade to
the 700 and he that I'm currently using
as my editing great studio you can see
your hair the emigres much stands for
modular they've got the GPR into right
now into sort of a chimney format where
you can see it actually is on a hinge
but it puts it right in front and
because we rotated this is rotated a
rotatable motherboard tray so that's how
you want it we are basically putting the
GPU right in front of the intake fans
giving the hottest component inside your
system more adequate cooling you can see
there's actually some RGB that is built
into the case the cool thing about the
front
I'm not gonna try and do it because I
camera this piece right here comes off
and they say so you do want take the
trial for me so there's actually a
contact at the bottom that is providing
power and control to the RGB so you can
see right there on the bottom so as soon
as you take it off to clean your filter
or access your front pans the RGB is all
a part of you know the front panel and
as soon as you put it back in makes
contact and the light turns back on you
see we also have a brushed aluminum
finish to on where the buttons is too
far on the front
definitely very sleek bring them to the
my easel 700p that I'm currently using
but you can see that this design on the
top for your exhaust fans because that
is where you're exhausting all of your
hot air from your system the motherboard
tray is fully rotatable though so if you
want to go with this sort of format you
can you can put it upright and the back
panel changes to accommodate that you
have your standard split plate here like
you use to your PSU shroud to block all
your cables riser card is not included
those that's one thing and worth
pointing out but what they wanted to
kind of accommodate here is those folks
that sort of want to customize their
case and make it their own but they're
not modders can actually do this now
with you know this
was called it a peek at so I've been
using by see 700m fully modular
customizable and I like the idea of this
chimney they call it a chimney there's
nothing to take pants on the front
obvious avenues and take baths but they
call it the chimney mount for the GPU
very interesting and unique they also
have a mount right here for the SSD but
that can also be a reservoir mount and
that's what they're showing me you can
actually move it to different parts of
the shroud on where you actually want to
imagine so that's pretty cool this is
the master case SL 600 M case this is
actually a prototype of something that
they're working on right here what
you're going to notice it's got to to
pay you see my legs got to 200
millimeter fans on the bottom pulling
air up through the chassis into the top
and then out through the rear van let me
show you the backside of this is my
first thought on this this is the
prototype where they're asking for
feedback on you can see we have a rear
fence right here you go see there's a
block off for no fan right there and
you'll notice this tray down here giving
you a very different orientation for
your motherboard alright now your
motherboard graphics card and the reason
for that is they're promoting this
airflow from the bottom to the top now
they were asking for feedback and I
basically suggested that this they're
gonna have another H 500 Fiasco on their
hands if they go with this super tiny
super fine hole type of mesh yes it is
venting out the rear right here but as
you know anytime air has to make a
90-degree Bend it becomes extremely the
velocity of the air becomes extremely
limited and it becomes reduced
significantly so that's why there's also
no fan right here because they won't
promote all the air to go through the
top one thing I'll suggest is maybe lift
this up and raise it a little bit so
that it's set being flat it's sitting
here like this maybe just a little bit
raised and then they open up the mesh in
the middle right here so that was one of
my suggestions but what you're noticing
right here on the bottom this tray is
rotatable they want the graphics cards
to be up and down to promote a nice
smooth airflow to the top if you have
this going sideways then it becomes like
a block off plate for the airflow
so it does also accommodate SLI through
riser cards so here obviously Reza cards
to do that but if you don't want to do
that and you want to say screw it I want
my cards in there the normal way you
just rotate it the other way back to
normal by those screws around the for
perimeter screws and then you can rotate
the whole way to the GPUs mount that's
one of the reasons why you also don't
see any fans on the front here because
it's not bringing in any air from the
front whatsoever this where that that
come from what happened there
Oh someone get pissed cause they lost
welcome to eSports so on the front here
there's absolutely no air intakes
because the air as I mentioned is coming
in through the bottom of the case
now one thing they also have right here
you can see we've got some maybe we
should focus here you can see we've got
lit RGB or not RGB but just LED lit USB
fan controller on the left and then a
fan Charlotte on the right but this is
actually motion sensitive so if you wave
your hand in front of it that's what
makes the lights and stuff turn on this
is a concept they're working on I asked
them at how expensive this was to
incorporate they're like this is a
little bit pricey
I asked if maybe they would consider not
doing this to save price and they were
like no we want to do this so I just
thought I would show that but as you can
see this is what cruel masters kind of
working on and I guess we are looking at
a potential October release date on this
guy this is the SL 600 mm we got here so
we are at Acer and this right here is
the predator X 20 set a lot of glare the
X 27 144 Hertz refresh rate for
millisecond response time
HDR for Cape and alito reconnaissance
aka a $2,000 pound forgive me and stuff
I know what you guys think would you pay
$2,000 for this and I mean you could
technically buy TV but yeah I guess
obviously the consumers choice you make
your own choices I wouldn't buy it
alright guys we are at Jessica right now
we're going to talk about a new
stick they've got her here this is their
tried NZ RGB royal so it is actually
like a polished aluminum which is very
classy as you can see but it also has
this sort of a crystal top where the RGB
is actually inside of the module
refracting off of all of those different
angles that are kind of cut into the
plastic top right there so it's got kind
of a very crystalline look to it it's
not a direct our GV lit piece like
you're used to seeing with their top
it's not available yet so I'm available
until well later this year I guess this
is only like been confirmed a thing two
days ago but they also are showing off
some other things I got here we got some
low profile Ares X ddr4 they admit that
they've been lacking low profile with a
lot of their memory this is the flare X
something we're used to seeing obviously
with the rise and stuff here's the
Ripjaws feed all of this is taller
profile memory which can impact a lot of
air coolers but this is obviously their
crown jewel for this year be royal it's
tell me what you think about that it's
obviously quite a bit different cuz it's
what you used to seeing with Ripjaws
this is this sort of a lips top panel
that it's translucent plastic and the
RGB is directly underneath that don't
get me wrong it looks good but it's
definitely different so you guys tell me
what you think about the Royal alright
guys that's gonna wrap up our first day
here at Computex 2018 do me a favor head
on over to EVGA calm thanks to EVGA for
sponsoring our trip this year and what I
need from you guys is to tell me what
you would like for us to go and cover if
you've already seen some things and how
you like this first person format it's
different obviously I don't a cameraman
here with meets it this year it's just
me and Brian and I thought this would be
a neat kind of first-person perspective
so we're gonna go ahead on out the door
we're gonna find coffee thanks for
watching guys I will see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
