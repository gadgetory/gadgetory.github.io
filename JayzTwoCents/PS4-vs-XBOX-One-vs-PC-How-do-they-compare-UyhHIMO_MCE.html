Jays two cents bringing you another
traditional commentary over the top of
some really bad mediocre gameplay
brought to you by yours truly today
we're playing some bf3 which is some
scavenger mode where you have to pick up
guns off the ground and choose a sidearm
limited ammunition forcing you to play
with guns you may not ever ever have
used before or even care to use and have
very defensive play styles because of
limited ammunition and today's topic pcs
vs the brand new consoles coming out at
the end of this year and how to choose
which one is right for you
okay guys so as I mentioned here we're
going to go ahead and talk about PCs and
whether or not how they stack up to the
new consoles that are coming out because
there's a lot of fanboys out there on
both sides of the fence honestly both
sides of the fence PC gamers are
definitely guilty of this to talking
about whether or not the new consoles
really are going to stack up against
gaming PC's and that there's a douchebag
over at EA I don't even remember his
name made the stupid asinine comment of
the consoles that are getting the new
CPUs that are going into consoles or
entire generation ahead of highest and
gaming PC right now now that was my best
you know like you know rich guy whatever
that okay whatever I digress so we're
gonna go ahead and talk about right now
before we get into some specs I'm gonna
put out there the specs for both
consoles and then we're going to
virtually build a computer that has the
same specs and compare the costs and
compare the power and see whether or not
the new consoles really do stack up
against some of the high-end gaming pcs
that are out there and taking that
information you can decide whether or
not it's the right thing for you whether
or not you want to go with a new gaming
console if you have to make the choice
between a PC or a gaming console and you
can't have both because let's face it
there's a lot of people that do not have
that luxury
okay so pros and cons of consoles from
the way that I see it my two cents pros
flick consoles are they're easy to set
up there's no installation required
they're easy to update usually they have
a nice little interface you pop up you
click a button you pop a pill you go to
sleep no you look a button and it starts
updating all by itself nothing that you
really have to worry about there's a lot
of online features now with consoles
with Netflix and YouTube and all that
stuff you can trade games with your
friends that something believe it or not
PC gamers have not been able to do for a
long long time
once you install a game on your PC and
you activate it with your code it's DRM
to you and it's been like that for over
ten years so that's why a lot of us PC
gamers really just stop whining with all
the DM stuff around but I was definitely
advocate for open DRM for consoles
because that was always a benefit to
consoles and it is faster for you to
start up and play a game you turn on the
power button and usually in less than a
minute you're already playing now some
of the cons that I see is you're stuck
with whatever Hardware you Hardware they
put in it at the time
you buy it you can upgrade it a lot of
the console is out there you know
we--you and are not shadow of Wii U has
it but definitely Xbox and PlayStation
have their networks where there's a
subscription and the ps4 is going to
have a risk subscription required they
tend to wear out faster because they run
so much hotter I mean just look at the
yellow light and red ring issues so you
tend to have to buy more of the consoles
over the same amount of time you would
have a PC the games cost more for
console they have limited harddrive
space they're not expandable anymore and
there's no productivity apps you can't
do anything on it other than play games
or watch movies or Facebook or something
so it's really expensive very limited PC
speaking of PCs pros on PCs the way that
I see it is it's a Productivity machine
with my PC I can do the gaming that
you're watching I can edit this video I
can go online we can look at you know
stuff all around the world Maps
pornography really you know actually I
take back that last one cuz there's
there's kids on this channel so yeah you
know anyway it's more powerful and
faster than consoles the games are
cheaper especially when you take into
account the Steam sale they're
upgradeable as things progress and as
the technology and the coding the
gaming's progress you can upgrade your
machine over time so that you're never
left behind and there's virtually no
game subscriptions of course you have to
have the Internet but you have to have
the Internet to play console online to's
thats really not something to throw
around saying we're going to help your
internet anyway yes I've seen console
fanboys say where you've got to have the
Internet to play games on PC - yeah yeah
no shit Sherlock you have to have it no
matter where you are the cons to PC is
that the initial cost can be more
expensive depending on how high the end
of a PC that you want to build but you
can build a lower end PC and upgrade it
later over time which is always an
option
building it can be scary if you're going
to build it yourself I definitely
definitely if you haven't noticed by now
advocate building it yourself
they're bigger they take up more space
even home theater pcs can be much bigger
than your console they require more
peripherals you know keyboard mouse
speakers and all that stuff but then
again you need to have a monitor and
speakers for your consoles anyway but
they're more prone to crash it OS
crashes and viruses and stuff but you
just don't generally have to deal with
on console and that can be a little bit
nitpicky and really make you angry but
then again it keeps guys like me
employed so for all please continue
doing tour
and getting viruses and stuff it keeps
food on my table all right so let's go
ahead and take a look at some specs here
the ps4 is toting that it has a single
chip custom processor hahaha
basically they're saying we have an APU
which is something that's been around
for a decade more than a decade for PCs
so yeah bite me on that one but it's an
8 quart a 64 bit Jaguar processor now
here's what's interesting about the
Jaguar I looked it up and the only
information I could find is that it's
basically it's basically a detuned
Trinity and the equivalent a Trinity
that I could find because it's an AMD a4
5000 is what the Jaguar is and a for
guys and the cheapest the cheapest
APU I could find that was toting the
same kind of graphics was the AMD a5
5300 which comes in at 3.8 gigahertz
which is twice as fast as APU going into
the new consoles so that's why that
statement that that jerk over a TAS
making the comment that you know the new
consoles have a whole generation newer
processor than the highest gaming PC on
the market today dumb stupid idiot I
don't even know how you can get away of
saying that I mean you just literally
have your head so far up your ass that
it's popping back out your shoulders
makes no sense to me how you can say
that anyway they have you know GPU is
included in the CPU the power supply
obviously is built-in and the
motherboard doesn't really you know we
can't compare that to PC it's all built
in one unit but Ram ps4 is going with
eight gigabytes of ddr4 and to be honest
this is the first device it's going to
be using pure ddr5 system Ram so I'm
excited to see how well it performs
because PC is moving up to ddr4 very
soon I've got a 500 gigabyte hard drive
and a 6x blu-ray drive now when you talk
about the Xbox one specs they keep
changing from day to day every time they
wake up they're like maybe room go ahead
and go with this one because the ps4
seems to be beating us and me you know
we're going to go ahead and bump things
up a little bit like they just recently
increased a GPU on their APU from 800
megahertz to 853 which again looks like
it's going to be the same custom 8 core
custom vpu by AMD so I'm just going to
go ahead and call it the a 4 or 5,000
because that's basically what the PSU is
using I'm assuming AMD is going to sell
them the same
you or APU whatever the system Ram is 8
gigabytes of ddr3 with 32 megabytes of
East yes Ram have no idea what that is
8 gigabytes flash 500 gigabyte hard
drive and again a blu-ray drive doesn't
even mention what speed is now the ps4
comes in at 399 and the Xbox comes in at
499 now to build in the comp to build a
comparable PC you would go with an AMD a
550 300 which is 3.8 gigahertz and twice
as fast as the chip that's going into
consoles as I've already mentioned I
would recommend using a 400 watt cougar
80 plus bronze power supply an msi f FM
2 a 75 m AE 35 motherboard that has all
the stuff that's comparable to the PSU
or the CP consoles which are you know
USB 3 SATA 6 dry or 6 gigs per second
geez I came to talking now 6 gigabits
per second hard drive SATA drives Jesus
I couldn't say that and you know it's
got all the stuff that you would want
you've also got a hyper I say going with
the 8 gigabyte of kingston hyperx 1600
ram is comparable 500 gigabyte 7200
western digital black which is one of
the fastest mechanical drives that you
can buy and an LG blu-ray drive what's
interesting about the blu-ray drive is
the LG is a 12x versus the ps4 6x so the
read speed on the blu-ray drive for
computer is already twice as fast and
then I would say allocate about 40 bucks
to a case and then 30 bucks to a cheap
keyboard and mouse bringing you to a
grand total on PC of 413 dollars now
obvious I didn't include an operating
system in there because you have options
when it comes to the operating system so
you know you're going to want to kind of
keep that in mind that you know you may
you can go with Windows Home you could
go with Linux if you want it but then
your gaming is limited so operating
dries are a whole other thing so you
know go ahead and and you can say and
even five hundred dollars if you wanted
for a PC but even at five hundred
dollars it's much more powerful than
these consoles if you want to just
compare spec for spec now what I want to
talk about lastly before we end here is
the statement of a lot of the console
gamers that are super excited about the
new consoles coming out toting that the
graphics on these new consoles
is going to be better than what you can
get on TV yes granted you guys are no
longer going to be stuck to 30 frames
per second at 720p you're going to get
1080p gaming and you're going to get 60
frames per second which is awesome
because I think everybody should gain at
60 frames per second it's just an
enjoyable experience it's better on your
eyes but all we know about the graphics
card for the ps4 is we know it's faster
than Xbox one so I'm going to use the
ps4 in comparison here to the PC and
they're advertising it as a 1.8 for
teraflop powerful GPU so it can do 1.8
teraflops on on real processing power ok
fine I get that so what is 1.8 for
teraflops equate to well a lot of people
are saying well that's equal to the 7870
gigahertz some people say oh it's
equivalent to a 7950 well here's how it
breaks down guys the 7850 standard
edition the non gigahertz the standard
edition is 1.7 6 teraflops at 860
megahertz so what does that mean it
means that the ps4s console is really
equivalent to more or less a 7815 on
gigahertz edition not a 78 79 a 79 50
now what's the difference in between the
78 50 and the 7870 well the 7870 came in
at 2.5 6 teraflops yeah we're talking
about another 70 % faster than what's in
the ps4 and the 79 70 which is just
right now you know taking into account
the single GPU flagship for AMD comes
enough over for teraflops at 1 Meg 1,000
megahertz which is not even their
fastest card so there you go when it
comes to GPU please for the love of God
if you're a ps4 fanboy or just a console
fanboy in general stop saying that your
graphics cards are just as powerful as
pcs because they honestly are not and
that's really truly just super annoying
that you keep saying that but anyway I'm
gonna get on out of here guys there it
is this information here is hope it is
just nothing more to try to arm you with
information on what to go with if you
feel like you have to choose a platform
if you're scared to build a PC by all
means go with a ps4 or an Xbox one they
definitely do bring the strength of
consoles up to about a year ago when it
comes to pcs and they're going to
probably continue to get
more evolved at sensor using eight core
processors and hopefully we don't have
to wait another seven or eight years
before you get something new in the
console world as I've mentioned I am
going to be buying a ps4 I am NOT a
console or PC fanboy I'm I am a gaming
advocate I love gaming it doesn't matter
where you play it you can even be
playing it on your iPhone or your tablet
and your gamer in my eyes so you know
take this information share it with a
friend if you know someone that's really
struggling with where to go with this
