you know what to look for when buying
your next computer what's up everybody
you're watching J's two cents and today
we're going to be discussing buying or
building your own gaming PC and things
you need to know for starters I'd like
to say I am an advocate for building
your own computer it creates a sense of
pride a sense of joy to put together
something you know you are going to be
spending hours on and you are going to
have a high level of respect for a piece
of equipment that you yourself have
built with that if you don't think you
can build a PC I've got news for you you
can build a PC PCs these days are very
simple
everything is very straightforward you
no longer have the old days of dealing
with IDE and slave drives and master
drives and having to have the jumper in
the right location or the hard drive or
the DVD drive on the right slot on the
cable now everything's done through
software you've got SATA cables you
simply plug it in to the motherboard you
plug it into the DVD boom
you're good you're golden so I just want
to say right now if you think you can't
build yourself a computer I've got news
for you you can and the flavor of this
video if you will is going to be a
little bit more geared towards those
people who are building their own pcs I
get asked on a regular basis what Parts
I feel they should buy and what parts
they should stay away from and before
you can answer that the first thing you
have to ask yourself is what am I going
to be doing with this computer am I
going to be primarily gaming am I going
to be doing video encoding or
rafi rendering i'm going to be doing
graphics design animation or am i going
to be simply playing video games if i'm
only going to be playing video games i
don't want the fastest or the most
expensive processor on the market games
simply do not use more than four cores
and you'll notice on the market today
you've got AMD bulldozer which has eight
cores and you've got the intel i7 s
which have eight cores and you are not
going to see much if any gaming
improvement whatsoever what you will
notice with a higher core count are the
programs that actually make use of those
cores like your video editing software
or your photo editing software will run
much much quicker so I wouldn't actually
recommend one of those fame bangles
eight core or even six core processors
unless you know for a fact you are going
to be doing more with your computer than
just gaming the next common question
that I'm regularly asked is how much RAM
do I need in my computer do I need eight
gigs 16 gigs 32 gigs well as you may
have guessed the question honestly once
again what am I going to be doing with
my computer if I'm going to be playing
simply games and games only eight
gigabytes of RAM is all I'm going to
need I will never use more than 8
gigabytes of RAM playing video games now
if I am once again going to be doing
video editing photo editing or anything
that puts a heavy CPU load on the
computer then I am going to probably
want to recommend 16 gigabytes as the
sweet slot 32 gigabytes in most
instances unless you're running some
sort of a server and I don't mean a file
server I don't mean a music server I
mean a server you do not need 32
gigabytes it is bragging points and it
gets you nothing performance wise I'm
also regularly asked about video cards
the video card is the single most
important part of your computer
the video card takes the brunt of the
force when it comes to rendering video
games so you want to go with something
that's the best that you can afford
there are many options and many many
different price brackets when it comes
to video cards on top of having to
decide on the brand whether it be AMD or
Nvidia either brand you decide to go
with your gaming experience will
probably be just fine so when it comes
to video card and if your gaming don't
be cheap put your money into your video
card and you will notice a better
smoother gameplay experience
motherboards are an interesting piece of
equipment when it comes to the computer
you will very rarely ever see any sort
of gaming or speed improvement of your
computer overall by going with a
high-end motherboard versus a mid-range
or even a low-end motherboard what you
gain by going with the higher ed
motherboards are bells and whistles BIOS
functions and usually overclocking if
you plan to overclock or you're not
afraid to overclock I would definitely
recommend going with a motherboard that
has a UEFI BIOS fortunately these UEFI
BIOS are becoming more common even on
the lower end motherboard if you're not
familiar with what a UEFI BIOS is
basically it is a new type of format
that the BIOS is displayed in that
allows you to use your mouse and
keyboard rather than just having the old
blue screen with the yellow font and
having to use your keyboard to click
around it also allows you to save
various profiles and can give you all
sorts of information about your computer
in real time
generally the higher-end motherboards
are expensive due to their overclocking
abilities so if you don't think you're
going to overclock or you are too afraid
to overclock then you can save some
money on the motherboard you won't see
any real improvements especially when it
comes to gaming another thing i'm
commonly asked is about solid-state
drives and whether or not they improve
the gaming experience the answer is both
yes and no
I'll start with the no first you are not
going to see any sort of
frames-per-second improvement or a
smoothness of gameplay improvement with
a solid-state drive however what you
will notice is that the loading time of
the game is much much faster but that's
not true for even just games that's true
for windows booting any program that you
open that's actually stored on the
solid-state drive or any files that
you're trying to access I defragmented
my solid-state drive the other day and
it took approximately four minutes to
read the entire drive so that's very
very fast the last topic I'd like to
cover is kind of an important one it's
regarding case and cooling options for
your gaming computer you definitely have
to have adequate cooling the video card
alone depending on the model can get up
to 90 degrees Celsius or hotter and
that's a lot of heat that's getting
dumped into the air and your computer
will be recycling this air so it's
important that you have adequate air
flow I would recommend a case that has
at minimum front rear and top fans the
front would obviously be pulling air
into the computer and the rear and the
top would be expelling or exhausting air
out of the computer those of you who
have seen my PC setup have noticed that
I am water cooling my computer I have
been water cooling any computer that I
have owned since about 2001 every
computer I own from here on out will
also be water-cooled and I do this
because I do a lot of heavy overclocking
with my equipment and I have to keep the
temperatures as low as possible so water
cooling is something that would be an
entirely different topic maybe look for
that in the future but when it comes to
PC cooling you want to make sure that
you have a large heat sink fan on the
CPU because the stock fans that come
with the computer are just simply not
adequate enough I prefer something
that's either a heat pipe design or has
large fans on the CPU dissipating the
heat
having a large CPU cooler will keep the
temperatures overall fairly low which
will then increase the lifespan of your
processor okay so what did we learn
today you need to pick your processor
based on the tasks you're going to be
doing with your computer if you're going
to be doing nothing but gaming if you
thought that new Intel i7 looked really
appetizing and you're not going to do
anything else
you might be surprised at how much money
you can save and how comparable the
performance of an i5 can be you also
could save a lot of money by scrimping
on the video card a little bit if you're
not planning on doing gaming and when it
comes to memory remember more memory
never hurts however it very rarely
actually helps so stick to that sixteen
gigabyte sweet spot you'll find that
it's more than enough for almost
anything you can do at it
I personally run sixteen gigabytes and I
do a lot of video editing with my
computer these tips apply whether you're
building your own computer or buying a
computer however I would suggest giving
a shot at building your own computer
because you can save a lot of money in
the long run and a lot of headache and
you were in complete control over what
ends up inside your computer I hope
