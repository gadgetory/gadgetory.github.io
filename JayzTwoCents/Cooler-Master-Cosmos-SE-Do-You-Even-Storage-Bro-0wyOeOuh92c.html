here and today we're going to take a
look at the annoying little brother of
the amazing cosmos - case that being the
cosmos se from Coolermaster we're going
to see how this guy stacks up to the big
brother because we all know little
brothers are just annoying and they suck
I know this because I'm I'm actually the
little brother in my family okay let's
go and take a quick tour around the box
I don't care much about unboxings and
stuff we're going to talk about quick
specs this is a black case here with a
side window it fits an ATX micro ATX and
mini ITX motherboards it does not fit
e-atx guys unfortunately if you have an
e ATX motherboard like I do it's not
going to fit in this bad boy so small
brother annoyance number one I wish it'd
fit e-atx but that's besides the point
it's got three five and a quarter drive
bays it's got eight three and a half
inch drive bays and it's got up to 18
SSD support 18 SSDs holy crap I think
that's the most SSDs I've ever seen that
can fit into a single case that I've
reviewed yet anyway it's got USB 3.0 two
of them two USB 2.0 and audio in and out
on the front I oh and it does have seven
expansion slots now when it comes to
cooling you can fit to 120 or to 140
millimeter fans up top that includes
radiator supports you can fit dual 120
or dual 140 coolers up there like the
Neptune 180 the H 110 things like that
in the front it does fit two times 120
millimeter fans it also can be converted
to 1 140 millimeter fan it comes with
the 1 pre-installed 120 millimeter fan
in the back it's a 1200 RPM 17 DBA fan
and on the side if you have the optional
mesh side panel it can fit a 120 or 140
millimeter fan the hard drive cage
itself can also mount to 120 millimeter
fans which are optional and I highly
recommend and you'll see why in just a
little bit here now when it comes to VG
support it can fit up to ten point nine
inch cards with the hard drive bracket
installed if you remove that hard drive
bracket if you're gonna do front
radiator or something like that you can
fit much longer graphics cards in there
and lastly when it comes to CPU cooler
height compatibility 175 millimeters or
6.9 inch high coolers are supported in
this case here so let's go and get the
scene out of the box and let's talk
about it a little bit closer now because
a lot of people do get kind of caught up
on the packing materials it does come
with and I've already opened this up
obviously I took a look at it and played
around with it a little bit alright so
here is the case right here and the
first thing you may or may not be able
to really tell on camera is just how
small it really is it's really not that
big and I think that's pretty evident
once we take a look at the inside here
and you see the motherboard tray area in
fact it becomes very very clear from the
moment you look at it that this bad boy
is not going to fit that EI TX
motherboard which I'm a little
disappointed about
here's your side panel here with your
window flex test is pretty good a lot of
people like to do the flex test once
it's mounted though and it's got the
screws in there even if it flexed a lot
it wouldn't matter but flex is all right
on there here is the inside of the case
right there and as you can see you've
got this massive hard drive cage right
there that gets in the way when it comes
to the actual motherboard installation
now before we talk about this massive
massive hard drive cage right there
let's go and talk about the rest of the
case here is your 120 millimeter fan
pre-installed in the back and one of the
things I do like about this case though
as you can see here is it's kind of got
this little cutout here that really cut
out what's more of a pop-out where it it
extends a little bit from the side
giving you more room for your cable
management there and that's actually
really really important to a guy like me
because that's where you're going to get
all of your cable management because if
you have more room behind the
motherboard tray you can get a lot more
accomplished in terms of your cable
management and we actually had to grab a
screwdriver here to get the top screw
off the threads on that one we're really
really tight even though it's a thumb
screw they seem to have installed it
with the you know then they had the Hulk
screw it in I guess because it was
really tight so there's that side panel
I mentioned you can see how it's got
extra room in there if your cable
management and that's a big deal I
really like that now one other thing
that this case doesn't hear it from its
bigger brothers are these handles both
on the top and the bottom I mean they
are actually very very very strong they
are part of the structure of the case
and as you can see I can actually hold
the entire case out by those handles and
there's no no creaking well what you're
hearing is the cables flop it around but
there's no creaking or anything in there
they're actually very very very strong
so that's kind of neat it gives you a
way to transport your case and move it
around first thing you may notice on the
back here is there is a lot of cables
sitting here though these are these are
your front fan cables they've also got
molex pass-through adapters on there and
then they come through to a fan
controller which are why you've got
these loose cables kind of flopping
around here same with the back so they
give you the option of being a three pin
cable or three pin fin but they also
because they give you the molex
pass-through this is nice because if you
don't have as I get messages all the
time from people saying I don't have
enough three pin headers on my
motherboard but how am I going to plug
in all my fans so you don't have to
actually go out and buy a splitter they
include three of these all reactivity
four of these already are included with
the case so chances are you're gonna
have plenty of fan support got nice rub
it rubber grommets here for all your
cable pastors all the internal cabling
is black that's a huge plus it makes it
much easier to stealth your all of your
cables when they're black especially in
the black case and then moving around to
the front here remove these cables out
of the way so break them off I don't
want to I want to break off a piece to
be norm saying so here's the front here
you've got nice mesh grille coolermaster
logo right there
now this is a little bit disappointing I
thought that these were going to be hot
swap bays just by the way they look with
these little latches right here but they
are just little pop outs for the the
front there
now one thing I want to point out is you
do have your what does it pop right up
there don't you know so here's your
filtered front mesh it pops off really
easy in fact a little bit easier than I
hoped right there I guess so you can get
this off for easy cleaning which exposes
your front 200 or 120 millimeter fans
now the only thing I don't like is you
can see right here is a good third of
the top fan is actually blocked by the
top or the five and a quarter Bay covers
and these are not vented so if these
have been vented then it could have
still pulled air through unfortunately a
good portion of this top fan is actually
being blocked by that cover so that's a
downside I'm not too happy about that if
you look at the bottom here you can see
the it's got dual filters one for the
power supply on the back as well as the
front right here if you have well I
guess you can actually mount a fan on
the front there if you wanted to have a
bottom mounted fan by taking out the
radiator cages looks like that's
possible and then on the top there's
another thumb screw here which is on
there much tighter than boom strength
makes me wonder why some of these
companies will still don't put thumb
screws everywhere but then they crank
them down with a tool and you can't
actually thumb screw it off but anyway
the top piece as you can see comes off
right here which is once again filtered
and mesh vented for your PC's pleasure I
guess and then you can expose the top
fan mounts right there and as you can
see one dual 120 and dual 140
compatibility now the thing about this
case that I think a lot of people have a
love-hate relationship with is this guy
right here the actual hard drive cages
as you can see you've got one two three
four five six LEDs on there now the
thing about these sleds is each sled
actually has support for two SSDs one
can mount on the top part of the sled
and it's actually got these little hooks
on the bottom there so you can put an
SSD on the bottom and put them on the
top and bottom so you can have a massive
SSD raid array on here if you wanted
multiples of them or you can have one
two three four five six hard drives on
there expansion for two more on the
bottom as you can see
right here they actually slide out the
front and you just have tons and tons
and tons of radiator or excuse me
harddrive support we'll get two
radiators in a second because this thing
does actually support radiators on the
front as well now all of these cages
actually have screws on here and these
screws can be taken out all of these
drive sleds will be taken out as well as
you can see there's quite a few of them
and you can take out all these screws
right here and you can actually have
then some support for mounting radiators
so it actually takes takes a lot of work
to get to where the radiators are now
you might be asking yourself how do you
actually mount the radiators well they
come with these brackets right here
inside the hardware case and they end up
mounting right on the front and then you
can mount your radiators the radiator to
this bracket right there so it'll fit a
240 millimeter radiator in the front
with no issues and you can still use the
bottom portion right here for your
standard hard drives if you wanted to go
that route so this case right here
overall it feels like an awful lot
crammed into a small package now I kind
of have to wonder why they have so many
hard drives right here
I get it I mean I get why they did it
that they wanted to be able to have it
be a no compromise maybe an ass solution
or because of the craze of
cryptocurrency mining and stuff you know
a lot of people run through hard drives
really really fast and so you want to
have just kind of a no compromise hard
drive solution I mean not only could you
fit the 12 SSDs on the front but you can
also fit more SSDs down in the bottom
cage and there is also two hidden SSDs
on the back right here one right here
and one right there so if this were me
building in this case which I'm actually
not because as I mentioned the
motherboard that I would be putting in
here is an e ATX unfortunately I would
be putting my hard drives in the bottom
my SSDs in the back and then I would
have taken out all of these hard drive
sleds and cages and then I would have
ended up putting some water cooling in
here at least that's the way that I
would have done it now this case I think
would appeal to many people one because
of its price point you can check out
pricing in the description there I'll
have some links to go and check that out
but the fact that you can mount so many
hard drives in here you can still get
plenty of airflow because you can have
the front fans as well as more fans on
the cage here moving the air through so
you have good static pressure because
initially I thought man there's no way
you can actually get air through this
case but the more I took a look at this
you actually could it's very very
perforated lots and lots of air volt
events and holes and as long as you have
fans on both sides of the cage it
shouldn't be too much of a problem so
this case probably would appeal to
someone that's just looking for one case
that could kind of meet any situation
that it could possibly need to be used
for I kind of wish it was a little bit
bigger I wish supported EI TX as well
because then it would have been the
ultimate case that could have fit any
solution but most people are not using
EI TX motherboards like I am anyway so
that's kind of a moot point well guys
this has been the cosmos se from
Coolermaster tell me what you guys think
definitely has a crap ton of storage
capability this I mean this has got the
most storage capability so far any case
I've taken a look at with the exception
of the 900 d but then again the 900 d
cannot fit 18 18 SSDs nor does it come
in anywhere close to this price point so
guys with Jays two cents following
Twitter if you have any questions as
always I'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
