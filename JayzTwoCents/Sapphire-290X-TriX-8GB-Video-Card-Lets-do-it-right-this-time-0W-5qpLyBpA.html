and as a reviewer I've got the
responsibility of making sure that I get
it right there's a lot of people looking
at this channel and watching these
videos for opinions to help make proper
decisions when it comes to spending
their money on various PC components and
hardware now a couple weeks ago I did a
video on the Sapphire 290x try x8
gigabyte AMD graphics card and a lot of
you felt that I did a very terrible job
at giving that card a thorough review
and you know what the more I thought
about it the more I thought you guys
were right which is why we're gonna do
the responsible thing and go back and do
a take two of the Sapphire try x8
gigabyte 290x I mean after all this card
really does deserve it
the fractal design r5 is so amazing it
fits all kinds of cool hardware in there
water cooling air cooling and on top of
that it's silent it's awesome like
explosion early now cards like this kind
of make it a little bit difficult on the
consumer to try and figure out whether
or not they need a card with eight
gigabytes and that really is the star of
today's show now I do want to apologize
for getting the previous video a bit
rushed and a bit just lackluster because
I think I was a bit excited and pressed
for time to get skunkworks
completed as well as the parvum build
which you guys have recently seen go up
so now we are circling back and giving
this card the thorough investigation
that it really deserves now sapphire is
one of two brands that actually offer an
8 gigabyte variant of the 290 and 290 X
now you might be asking yourself why
does the 8 gigabytes exist now I've
already kind of said it the 8 gigabytes
really is the star of the show when it
comes to this graphics card I mean the
hawaii-based GPU is nothing new it's
actually been out since October of 2013
and it's really starting to become dated
when it comes to refresh cycles of GPUs
we all know the 300 series is literally
right around the corner and that tends
to be the time when prices are
constantly fluctuating and dropping even
this card right here is continuing to
drop in price over time
and when the new cards drop people are
gonna find themselves wondering well do
I need a 300 series card or can I get
away with going something like the 290 X
or 298 gigabyte versions we won't spend
a lot of time going over the specs
considering not nothing has really
changed
especially since two weeks ago and
certainly nothing's changed on this card
because I've had it the entire time it
is based on the Hawaii GPU does have a
turbo clock of 1020 megahertz I was able
to overclock it to eleven hundred and
twenty five higher than any other 290 or
to 90 X so far that I've taken a look at
on this channel I was able to overclock
the RAM to fourteen hundred and twenty
five megahertz
remember that number is times four when
it comes to AMD GPUs and it does have
eight gigabytes of gddr5 running a 512
bit memory bus so the specs on this
thing are really impressive but how does
it perform when it comes to games
well gaming is not the entire story when
it comes to this card in fact I'm kind
of glad I got a chance to really take a
look at this card again and look at it
from a different perspective if you guys
remember a couple of weeks ago I talked
about leap Computing's cloud base gaming
and how there's two options at launch it
you can go with one is a Titan X and the
other is a 298 gigabyte now when you
talk about a client base system that's
sitting right here in front of you you
would think okay well Titan X is
probably going to be the fastest GPU so
why wouldn't you want it and I kind of
said that same thing to leap I said why
would anyone go with older architecture
rather than cutting edge when the price
is the same and we basically said well
the reality and the fact remains that
AMD's computational power on the GPU is
far superior to invidious and I kind of
thought you know I think that might be
true considering the fire pros have
always been so powerful and definitely
for productive needs very cost to
performance ratio and they said that if
you are doing a lot of rendering or lots
of GPU based computational workflows
then you're definitely going to want to
go with AMD where it's going to give you
better stream quality so that got me
thinking
lots of GPU vram lots of people aspiring
to either be famous youtubers or famous
twitch streamers which means rendering
videos or alive rendering gameplay up to
a server and streaming it you're gonna
be offloading a lot of GPU power a lot
of computational power onto the GPU so
the eight gigabyte buffer really does
come in handy it's not just about high
resolutions but it's also about high
performance for the GPU when tasks are
offloaded onto the GPU and with modern
api's like mantle and DX 12 coming in
the future this is a bit of future
proofing yeah I know you guys know I
don't like the word future proofing but
there is a bit of future proofing
involved with higher frame buffers when
it comes to GPUs so let's go ahead and
take a look at some of the benchmark
numbers here I did a couple of games we
did some Far Cry 4 GTA 5 battlefield 4
not hardline I'm gonna have hardline
installed on the test bench yet and then
some Metro last light
so let's go ahead look at those
benchmarks and then we're gonna do a
live demo actually of premiere with one
of my workflows we're gonna show you
where this card really shines
I'm not using a capture card on this
because the screen tears really bad when
he's a capture card so you're just gonna
have to deal with it but you can see
right here this section that's going up
and down is the core clock and this
section up here on the very top is the
GPU usage so as I scrub you can see the
GPU starts to immediately do something
now the other thing I want to point out
here is that there is absolutely no lag
in the scrubbing or the playback and
that's because we're offloading all of
the playback instead of to the CPU Ram
we're offloading everything to the GPU
so the GPU is taking over the workload
here for the entire playback now no
matter where we play it it's instant
seeking I mean have you guys ever tried
to do any sort of editing and the moment
you start skipping around the timeline
it takes a second to load or the
playback here is in half resolution
we're in full resolution right here so
you guys can see that it just does an
amazing job at keeping things very very
responsive now the more layers and
things that you add the more that you'll
start offloading into some of that GPU
Ram we're only using six hundred and
thirty megabytes right now GPU but if we
start let's just start adding some
things to this and see what happens here
so let's add whoops so let's add a
YouTube logo let's add some vignette
just making layers here I know it looks
like crap but we're just making layers
here let's add a troll face haha Twitter
bird another transparent overlay let's
do it that's what she said bubble
jerry's bobblehead that i made him my
bobblehead well that's huge oh let's see
do some more transparencies mmm let's do
this let's do the circuit background boy
let's bring back down the opacity on
that one so watch some transparency on
there and let's go ahead and cut this
clip like that let's add some sharpness
because you know sharpening is very
intensive and let's just crank the
sharpness amount all the way to the top
and look at you see the way it continues
to scrub anyway so you can see it didn't
matter it just did not care now this is
all 1080p footage it would be you know
if it was a 4k video workflow it would
be probably more into the GPU Ram but
we're just basic premiere like this you
can see it's doing a fantastic job at
just giving us some decent workflow but
for those of you who are using things
like you know 3d studio Max or After
Effects or just doing any sort of
high-end motion graphics then that 8
gigabyte buffer is definitely gonna be
something you're interested in but I
just wanted to give a quick demo here of
how things look in Premiere and how
playback and everything is just
completely instant and let you actually
see how it is LOF loading onto the GPU
right here you can see the GPU usage
going up and I think it goes up when we
start playing all of these
portions right here let's see too much
all right well there you go there's that
little demo now before getting out of
here it's worth noting that the eight
gigabyte buffer is not only beneficial
to productivity workflows you guys know
that there's been definitely a push
towards more and more V RAM and graphics
cards and being utilized by games where
developers are really starting to tap
into massive amounts of VRAM in terms of
texture packs pc mods and things like
that
shadow of Mordor requires six gigabytes
of vram if you're gonna be running the
high resolution texture pack and we all
know that I've been berated for saying
that sky mod modding is only you know
beneficial to a small amount of people
apparently an awful lot of you do Skyrim
modding which really can eat up into the
vram as well and then of course
minecraft even though this GPU die is
nearly two years old still remains very
relevant even in the 1440p resolution 4k
one of these cards
even with a gigabyte V RAM is or buffer
is not going to be enough for 4k as you
can see by the FPS on the charts but
1440p is still massively playable even
at highest presets on all of these
graphics settings and it's going to
remain more relevant into the future as
resolution gets more you know vram
intensive you're gonna have a card
that's gonna last a lot longer in fact
for gigabyte cards are gonna start
seeing their age a lot sooner than
slower GPU cards with more gigabytes of
vram so this is going to remain relevant
well into the future here at least for
the next several years so it's
definitely a card worth consider picking
up if you're looking at stepping up
above 1080p resolutions or you just want
to have a longer-lasting card even at
1080p resolutions ultra settings and
getting into some PC modding or PC
gaming modding and still have enough
power to do workflow with a single card
live-streaming editing and all of that
stuff so really the card is a jack of
all trades so guys there you go I wanted
to circle back and take a look at this
card once again this sapphire didn't ask
me to do this I did this entirely on my
own in fact I asked sapphire if I could
borrowed the card for longer so that I
could do this video I have tied up and
utilized this card for
well more than my than my welcome I have
overstayed my welcome with this card so
it's time to send it back but I at least
wanted to make the previous shitty video
that I did right by doing more
traditional tests that it definitely
deserved so if you guys were considering
buying a graphics card and you weren't
sure if the new 300 series was gonna
make these things obsolete absolutely
not
they're gonna last well into the future
plenty of GPU power lots of VRAM huge
memory bandwidth and it's still relevant
and is gonna be relevant for quite a
while now of course pricing on these
cards is always fluctuating so I don't
really talk about pricing in the videos
unless it really warrants it especially
with graphics cards are always going up
and down especially as new things are
released so if you want to see the
current pricing just look in the
description to find a link down there
where you can see what the current
Amazon pricing is anyway as well as
other links to Amazon affiliate codes if
you guys want to support the channel if
not go ahead and support your favorite
youtuber we all are a community so we're

couldn't do this videos without you so
every single time I'm always gonna say
it thanks for watching
