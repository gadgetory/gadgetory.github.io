PC product reviewer means that I get to
check out a lot of really cool and
interesting things that I would have
probably otherwise never gotten a chance
to take a look at but unfortunately that
can also be a downside where you take a
look at so many things it takes a lot to
get you excited anymore so envision tech
asked me if I want to check out there
are nine to ninety cryo Venom oh yeah
what the heck go ahead and send it on
over I wasn't expecting it to come in a
damn wood great this is going to be good
with the new Silencio performance
optimized fans the cooler master Neptune
240 M delivers the perfect balance of
noise and performance click the link in
the description to find out more there's
a lot of different r9 290 graphics cards
on the market so you going to be asking
yourself why the hell is this income in
a wood crate what makes this so
different from other graphics cards on
the market well unlike the r9 290x
matrix Platinum Edition which we took a
look at it left a lot to be desired when
it came to the coolie market now it's no
lie that it's a very very hot graphics
card I mean from the factory they were
designed to run 95 degrees Celsius and
that's enough to melt most gamers hearts
if you will and their and their wallets
and their egos because you're going to
spend a lot of time trying to keep that
sucker cool now unfortunately the cooler
on that r9 290x matrix platinum doesn't
even touch the memory chips and it
doesn't even touch the VRMs erm has its
own little dinky heatsink that doesn't
even make contact with any of the heat
pipes or any of that so unfortunately
it's overclocking potential is extremely
limited and that was my major gripe with
that card now visiontek last year at CES
announced that they were partnering up
with ek where ek was going to be their
block supplier and they were going to be
offering a consumer water-cooled version
of the r9 290 and 290x today we are
going to take a look at the 290 now this
comes in a crate because it has a hole
water cooling loop in there but that's
not where the enthusiasm stops you see I
care about companies that care about the
consumer experience not the bottom
dollar
basically they care about the bottom
dollar their business or the business to
make money but not just how much money
they make but the overall consumer
experience and when you spend the kind
of money that comes with a custom
water-cooled graphics card that has a
complete loop with it available in
either 240 or 360 millimetre radiator
variants once again supplied by ek water
blocks you get an extra level of support
that even I wasn't expecting when I
opened up this crate I've already looked
inside of this because the excitement
was just too damn much to control and I
had to open it up and take a look inside
it was just like a schoolgirl when it
came I was like ripping the box open
because I had never seen that graphics
card box come while big enough to fit a
small computer tower in but guys I got
the 360 version here it's got a three
sixty millimeter rad that's the cool
stream PE I've already done review of
this radiator independently on it
actually earlier in the year when this
radiator first launched but as I
mentioned is available in the 240 and a
360 variant basically it's an entire
custom loop that normally you'd have to
buy a GPU water block for it comes with
the GPU block pre-installed and the
entire loop to go with it all you've got
to do is buy a CPU block whatever block
you want in fact they do also sell water
blocks on their website makes perfect
sense throw it in your loop and you've
got a complete water-cooled loop
including the graphics card with very
very little fuss now when you take the
top off the box there is quite a few
things inside now it's a pine box
in fact when when my wife saw this she
walked by the room she did a double-take
Kim right back in the room notice there
was a wood crate on my box and she said
my desk and she says can I have the box
yeah it's pretty frickin awesome now
right here on the side it says vision
tech liquid-cooled series cryo Venom
squeaky chair it doesn't actually say
squeaky chair that's just my chair so
cryo venom injected specimen handle with
care if container is breached contact
your local PC gaming Authority by that
they mean Jays two cents that would be
mean come on to YouTube check out my
channel it'll tell you what's going on
it says contents have been shown to
cause lower temperatures increased GPU
performance and further gaming addiction
I mean this already tells you right here
they're having some fun with this
product and I love that now right on the
top we've got some of our flex tube
right here a basic stuff
but here's the part that I found
extremely interesting when it comes to
this it says classified information
enclosed and this got me thinking what
is this we'll get back to this in a
minute you've got an awful lot of bubble
wrap protecting your GPU a lot of it in
fact we'll get back to that we have got
a bay reservoir this is a single five
and a quarter bay reservoir with a
built-in laying DD seat pump so it's a
pump res combo that goes into single
slot five and a quarter drive if you've
got enough room for a CD drive you've
got enough room for the pump and the
reservoir and it's already preset up for
you it's black it's quiet it's
adjustable and you know it's got the
same kind of quality that comes along
with Ek as you come to inspect in fact
it even has a little like beaker that
you can use to fill it it's so freakin
adorable I'd love everything about this
kit so far in this a little package here
we've got more stuff that goes along
with the custom loop as you would come
to expect you have got some LED lights
here if you want to make the reservoir
light up a jumper to start your power
supply to be bleed your system you've
got some echo echo echo lint Evo
blood-red concentrate you mix that with
distilled water and then of course you
have got all of your fittings now these
are 3/8 inch inner diameter number I
don't recall exactly what the outer
diameter is but I'm going to probably be
sitting here popping this for the next
two hours
you've got some of the knowing normal
jumpers that would come with your
graphics cards for four pin to eight pin
and 6 pin whatever I really hope you
don't need these if you need these get a
new power supply to yourself a favor and
then you have of course got the three ek
222 1600 rpm fans same fans at come in
the complete kit I should do the review
on a couple months ago so yeah
definitely need the fans and then
there's nothing else in the box it's
just a wood crate no but like I said the
wife is already after this help me guys
she wants to steal my crate but this
this right here I have not seen any
other graphics card companies include
this even review models now usually
review models they'll kind of do some of
the overclocking work for you and tell
you kind of what to expect as a reviewer
so you know what you're getting yourself
into before you even load up the card it
kind of takes out some of the fun of it
but it really doesn't happen too often
every now and then I get one of those
but what you find inside here is the
normal paperwork that would come with
your graphics card like the vision tech
installation guide drivers you know all
that sort of stuff warranty information
we'll just throw that wherever visiontek
paperwork some of the extended fittings
and oring 's and stuff if you need to
use a fitting extender so if you have a
long fitting so the threads don't go too
far in there chances are you won't need
that but if you do instructions are
right there this right here visiontek
radeon r9 liquid-cooled series checklist
and registration this is a handwritten
card with the graphics card serial
number the waterblock serial number the
sticker for it complete stability test
that's already been performed tells you
how far this thing is going to overclock
what percentage they even pressure test
and vacuum test the block to make sure
is not going to be any leaks in it stamp
of approval and even the name of the
builder justin hey bro thanks for
checking out my card so I now know
Justin W over a vision Tech is the guy
who said this car is ready to rock
there's no questions if you ever ever
probably call them up you say this
serial number hey Justin's the guy that
said it was good to go and if you've got
any problems the warranty information is
all right here including the warranty
card you fill it out
and there you go vision Tech is not
responsible for any further gaming
addiction caused by the addiction of
cryo venom to your machine now that
leads us to the card if you guys haven't
noticed this is going to be a little bit
longer review than I normally spend on
graphics cards because let's face it
fish and Tech has spent more more time
on this card for you the consumer than
any other company as far as I'm
concerned so I'm going to spend a little
bit more time on this review because I
have not been this excited about a
product in a long long time now you guys
know I'm an avid water cooler so a
water-cooled graphics card from the
factory from a company I like like ek UK
is cooling my system back there you guys
can imagine my excitement of taking a
look at this card now I have not
actually opened it as you guys can see
the seal is intact I wanted to save
opening this up for the camera go ahead
and tear that go ahead and get inside
does come in an electrostatic
anti-static bag and there she is
now like I mentioned earlier overclocks
are affected by stability with vrm
temperatures as well as memory
temperatures and guess what this thing
is cooling the vrm back here the chips
the memory chips which are surrounding
the GPU and of course the GPU it's got a
sexy-ass back plate that goes with it I
personally think it's very very sexy
because it's the same exact model of
back plate that is on my my skunk works
rig over there with 3 9 80s but what's
interesting is it's custom made back
plate for vision Texas has vision Tech
itched right into it and it says radeon
r9 liquid-cooled series yes this thing
is freaking amazing even has the
fingerprints on the back so I know
somebody has personally handled this
graphics card thereby making their
registration card and overclocking
claims a little more valid of course
we're not going to just take the cards
word for it the overclocking cheat card
there of course we're going to go ahead
and do our own benchmarks on this so at
this point I'm going to stop the video
I'm going to take some time probably a
few days to play around with this and
see what numbers I can get out of it
then we'll come back circle back and see
exactly how well this thing performed so
for me it's going to probably be a few
days for you guys it's going to be just
like
well I got to say that I'm not really
all that surprised when it comes to the
performance of the r9 290 I mean really
it's not a custom PCB or anything in
fact it's really just a reference card
that they have in-house Bend into their
top tier cryo Venom line before putting
the water blocks on and then they do all
the custom work for you determining what
a safe overclock range is now the cards
been out for over a year the the r9 290
platform so it's really not all that
surprising when it comes to performance
I've got to say that but what I think is
really awesome is that they do the
guests they take the guesswork out of it
now they had put on this card here that
it was good for 1150 I got 1150 in fact
I was able to get all the way up to
eleven seventy-five on the megahertz now
what they did tell me is that they tend
to pull it back about five percent from
what they find to be stable that way the
customer can get a very good
overclocking experience without getting
any artifacting and whatnot so they do
take a little bit of headroom into
consideration but what really makes this
card stand out which we've already taken
a look at is the fact that it's got the
EK water block and backplate
pre-installed so you guys have to worry
about voiding any warranties by doing
that they've gone ahead and installed it
for you and it comes with all the tubing
and all of the pump and the integrated
pump combo and the fittings and the
radiator and it's actually a very good
performer in fact this card with my
5820k overclocked in the loop never went
harder than 52 degrees Celsius that's
about 40 degrees lower than the factory
settings when it comes to the r9 290
that's amazing now we already took a
look at the benchmarks which shows that
it's pretty much in line with other
overclocked r9 290 s but really the
benefit here is the temperatures I mean
the temperatures of these cards are just
damn hot when it comes to the
hawaii-based GPUs I mean they are
massively hot but not in this system in
fact the cooling loop kept it well well
under that 95 degree threshold which AMD
says is safe now one of the downsides of
going to a water-cooled card like this
though that I have to say there's
definitely cons involved with this is
the coil whine there actually was a
decent amount of coil whine on this card
but coil whine is a lot like the silicon
lottery
are some cards or noisy SIM cards aren't
it really is luck of the draw
in fact sometimes it was noticeable
sometimes it wasn't and the farther you
overclock the core the card the louder
the coil wine gets so you can find some
easy medium there where you're okay with
noise to performance ratio now this card
happened to be a little bit noisier than
I think would be normal but at the same
time it's an open test bench most of the
time my cards are in the close to a
closed case we're not going to notice it
nearly as much it's sitting on an open
test bench it was very noticeable so it
really isn't something that I think
you're going to notice nearly as much
especially if you're going with
something like an R an R 5 or something
to define R 5 or define R 4 or something
that's really well sealed up when it
comes to the acoustics so guys this has
been my two cents about the r9 290 cryo
venom from visiontek fantastic card it's
definitely worth considering if you're
looking at building a nice gaming rig
especially at AMD based gaming rig it's
a very very worthy card of a gaming
platform I mean everything about this
card is pretty fantastic that's why it's
been such a great performing card in
both sales and performance for the last
year that the r9 290 has been around
because it's just an amazing bargain for
what you get for the money especially
with the price drops recently so if
you're building a gaming PC you highly
want to consider this card and if you
guys are looking at doing water cooling
really this card just takes all the
guesswork out of it does everything for
you so I highly recommend taking a look
at this over at the vision tech website
I don't know if it's available anywhere
else I know visiontext sells it
obviously so there you go guys let me
know what you guys want me to do on this
channel give me some content ideas I'd
love to do some crowdsourcing when it
comes to topic ideas as always guys
follow on Twitter or Facebook write
Facebook is that what it's called yeah I
was never into the whole Facebook thing
a whole lot but I do like to go up there
and see what you guys are recommending
that I do on this channel as always guys
I'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
