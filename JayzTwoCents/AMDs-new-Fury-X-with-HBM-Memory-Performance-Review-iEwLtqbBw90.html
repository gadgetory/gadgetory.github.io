video that I think that AMD fans have
been waiting for for a long time and too
long in fact it's been nearly two years
since AMD launched a new flagship card
and just to put that into perspective
you could have had two babies and then
I'm out of time but is it too little too
late I guess you're just gonna have to
watch to find out the built in resin
water pump mounting locations improve
the airflow and massive radiator support
make the define s from fractal design
the obvious choice for water cooling
enthusiasts the S doesn't stand for sexy
but it should now before I get started
there are a few things that I want to
get out of the way first I need to give
a huge shout out to my friends over at
vision tech they're the guys who
actually sent me this card not AMD so
without their support I would not have
been able to get this review out to you
guys and gals in a timely manner and
it's also important to note that just
like the Titan cards from Nvidia vision
Tech does not actually make these cards
they pretty much only repackage and sell
them for AMD so they took a much larger
financial hit to send me this keeper
unit than AMD would have so thank you
vision Tech and by the way I hope we get
to see a cryo Benham version of the Fury
in the future and just you know putting
that out there a second yes it's true
that I do have a preference of using
Nvidia cards in my personal systems
however that does not mean that I treat
these benchmarks with any sense of
biased I run the test and I let the
numbers do what they do because after
all numbers don't lie
well you know unless you make them up
but I think you get what I mean another
thing I want to point out is that I'm
highly rootin for AMD in this release it
I am a strong believer that we need
competition in the marketplace without
competition it would be like watching
old Kimbo Slice videos on YouTube or
it's just one big guy beating the
out of the smaller guy who never stood a
chance to begin with and then bragging
about it afterwards it's just boring and
we need the competition lastly as you
guys know I am an overclocker everything
I do involves overclocking water cooling
or something like that so I was a little
bit conflicted on whether or not I
wanted to do these benchmarks at stock
beads or just put them balls to the wall
from the start so obviously being true
to myself I decided to go ahead and just
overclock it from the get-go and let the
test land where they fall so if you were
looking for stock speed tests you won't
find them here not today but if you are
interested in those numbers go and check
out my friends over at Hardware Canucks
who did an absolutely fantastic job of
showing how Fiji compares to Maxwell GM
200 at stock speeds now when it comes to
specs this thing is pretty impressive on
paper and AMD can certainly claim that
they have the very first HB m or high
bandwidth memory GPU on the market and
according to their press conference they
have been working on this tech for five
years now I don't want to spend a lot of
time talking about what you guys already
know especially since I'm already late
to this party you know especially
regarding Fiji videos so forgive me for
not going to in depth regarding the
specifics now the base clock for Fiji is
1050 megahertz with 4096 dream
processors 64 ROPS 256 texture units 4
gigabytes of HBM high bandwidth memory
on a massively wide 4096 bit memory bus
while maintaining a somewhat impressive
275 watt TDP now for video output this
thing has 3 DisplayPort 1.2 and 180 mi
1.3 unfortunately there are no HDMI 2.0
so this means no 60 FPS 4k playback for
HDMI for home theater and xxx
enthusiasts who may be considering this
card for that use scenario it's kind of
sad to see considering it's something
that NVIDIA has had on their cards SEP
September of 2014 I'm also a little
surprised to see that there is no DVI
dual link on here but I guess that plug
is starting to see its end of days
now pictures of the card don't really do
it justice to be honest I thought the
card looked quite cheap and plasticky
looking in the photos that I saw and the
live stream from e3 but getting my hands
on the card in person was a whole
different story there's a nice mix of
nickel plating and soft material and of
course the read Radeon logo on top as
well as the LED indicator lights on the
back acting sort of like an RPM meter in
a car where the more the LEDs light up
the more load the card is feeling last
but not least AMD is continuing its
Yussef all-in-one cooling units to keep
the Fury ex nice and cool under load by
way of a cooler master designed pump and
radiator unit a part of the cooler
actually features a copper coolant pipe
that directly context the VRM so power
delivery is being actively cooled as
well now this is nice to see because
BRMS can typically reach temperatures of
a hundred C if not properly cooled and
will ultimately lead to death of the
power delivery on the card and be spared
no expense by using a gentle typhoon fan
on the radiator which is highly
respected amongst water coolers the
radiator is 45 millimeters thick by 120
millimeters for a fan and the fan is
also controlled by the card so if you
set up a custom fan profile in MSI
Afterburner
you will be able to control the fan on
the radiator this is nice to see because
the EVGA hybrid unit doesn't actually do
that the radiator fan spins at a
constant speed where the only fan
control you have through afterburner or
precision is controlling the fan found
on the cart obviously here there's no
fan on the card so other than the fact
that it's extremely small that the card
I mean there isn't much left to talk
about so let's go ahead roll the
transition and let the numbers do all
the talking
now obviously my numbers are a little
bit different than the ones posted by
AMD and pretty much every other reviewer
on the internet and if you follow me on
Twitter you guys may have seen some
frustrated tweets trying to figure out
why the hell my fury X was scoring so
much lower than my 980ti reference card
I mean overclock the fury to eleven
hundred and twenty eight megahertz and
with the massively hyped HBM memory
something seemed incredibly out of place
and then it freakin dawned on me my
980ti results are all overclocked even
my reference card was overclocked to
fourteen hundred megahertz so I figured
I would see what happens when I leave
the fury X overclocked
and let GPU boost 2.0 do the work on the
980ti
and this is what we got as you can see
here in fire strike the fury X takes a
slight lead when it's overclocked
and no manual overclocking is performed
on the 980ti
and the same could be said for Metro
last light but as you can see the fury X
does extend its lead percentage a tad
more when compared to 1440p and 4k so
it's definitely worth mentioning that
when stock speeds are compared the fury
X does a nice job holding its own
against the 980ti
now before I move to my final thoughts
on this card there is something that I
want to mention this card is amongst the
loudest most annoying cards I have ever
heard and I'm not talking about decibel
levels here and I'm not talking about
the fan on the radiator I am talking
about the loud high-pitched pump in this
unit it sounds to me like the pump has
no speed control and is running 100% at
all times and if you've ever heard the
pump in an all-in-one water cooling unit
especially running at 100% it can be
extremely loud and annoying just listen
now obviously this was recorded in an
open test bench and putting it in a case
would help but it would not drown out
the noise entirely so if you were
sitting in a quiet room watching a movie
doing homework maybe watching you know
porn you would definitely hear it but
that's not the worst part the coil line
on this card is louder than anything I
have ever heard and I have heard some
extremely loud cards before you now
remind anyone about the coil whine in
many of the nine 70s here just take a
listen and if you hate coil whine
prepare to cringe
now AMD states that they have made
changes to retail samples of the cart
but it's also important to note that my
sample did not come from AMD and it did
come from a retail partner which is
packaged for retail so it may take some
time before we see if they managed to
make that high-pitched noise good it
will go away but the coil wine on the
other hand yeah that's just not
acceptable and I don't see it going away
all of my 980ti custom cooler samples I
have or more quiet than this card
overall alright so does the card deliver
yes it gives you 980ti performance at
the same price point if you don't
overclock the 980ti but you do overclock
the fury X which is kind of a weird
condition if you think about it but
should you buy this card I really don't
see why not
I mean yes it's overclocking is
extremely limited you can't even
consider overclocking the memory but it
is giving AMD fans their first high end
GPU option in nearly two years now the
best card for someone isn't always the
fastest card when it comes to gaming or
max FPS this card would also serve as a
great rendering station card or live
streaming solution it's small its
powerful it's much more efficient than
previous highway highway hawaii-based
GPUs and is giving AMD fans what they
asked for but I don't think I'm alone
when I say that we I think we were
hoping for a little bit more when it
comes to this card because after all
it's HP freaking em now for whatever
reason this HBM and the new core from
AMD is still trailing behind traditional
PCB layout found on Maxwell but to be
fair Maxwell is a freaking beast and
when the overclocking potential is taken
into account it really does become a
complete beatdown where NVIDIA is still
on top this is why I'm a bit let down I
wanted it to be like 2012 again when the
7970 gigahertz edition card was beating
all the best 680 s on the market and
companies had a reason to duke it out
but if you're looking for the absolute
best when it comes to game performance
and you're willing to overclock then the
980 TI would really be a better solution
and better performance per dollar ratio
which is kind of odd considering AMD has
always dominated that space so you may
have noticed that this card is actually
located in the benchmarks I showed you
guys earlier if you guys have a sharp
eye you might have noticed that
but I will do a complete review of the
300 series coming up when we look at the
390x the 380 the 390 the 370 possibly
the Nitro series maybe some other 300
stuff I don't know I mean I want to give
it full coverage so we will be looking
at this but I'm actually a bit more
excited about this considering the 390
is giving me better performance than any
290x I took a look at by a lot at least
in my test scenarios so we'll talk more
about this in the future so there you go
guys I'm sorry my fury X video was a
little bit late but as I mentioned I had
to wait for a retail sample to get here
again vision tech guys thank you
hugely for that I would not have been
able to give you guys giving you guys a
fury X video if it wasn't for vision
tech so make sure you guys go to their
website check out some of the cards and
stuff that they have to offer again it
wouldn't be possible without them so I'm
gonna go ahead and get the heck on out
of here guys make sure you follow on
social media Twitter subscribe if you're
not subscribed to the channel if you
guys want to see more videos like this I
do plan on also doing performance or
professional tests on the fury X where I
compare it to something like Titan X and
980ti
and a rendering solution will reek
impair both those cards render times and
see you know if your ex really is a
better solution when it comes to desktop
Pro applications that's something that
really should be considered with these
cards I didn't include it today because
I think it deserves its own video on
that so anyway guys I'm going to get the
heck out of here I know this video was a
little bit longer but I want it to be as
thorough as possible so with that I'm
gonna get out of here thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
