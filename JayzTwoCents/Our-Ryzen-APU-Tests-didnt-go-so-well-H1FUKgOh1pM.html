and not harder to learn more check out
the links in the description below so
what happens when Rison and Vega make
love and have a baby while you get the
rise in 320 200 G and the rise in 5 2400
G both of these are rise in CPUs with
Vega graphics integrated into them this
is a big deal because we have not seen
an integrated GPU into a mainstream CPU
from AMD in quite a while sure we've had
the FM sockets and ap use and all that
stuff but this this is literally going
to be a godsend to people trying to
build a system in 2018 and get around
the god-awful pricing of video cards so
today's video is gonna be more based on
trying to put together a system that's
based on no GPU whatsoever and seeing
how well you can actually game in 2018
without actually having a video card now
I did a video on something similar all
the way back in 2013 looking at AMD's AP
which was a Kaveri based CPU so if you
guys want to go and watch that video
first or after this whatever you can
kind of see how far we've come since
2013 or the last five years so this is
pretty this is pretty awesome to see
what is coming out of AMD's corner and
this isn't even rise n2 don't do not
confuse this for Rison second gen this
is just a progression of an already
amazing platform giving price to
performance for buyers and right now
when it comes to graphic card pricing I
don't think this could have been
launched at a better time so for the
build today because we're not buying a
video card I kind of decide to put that
money into some other things that would
allow you to have a pre kick-ass system
out of the box and then you can add a
graphics card to it later and we will do
a follow-up where we add a graphics card
to this to see just how much your
experience can improve if graphics card
pricing improves so we're gonna be
putting
the risin three for now we're gonna be
using the risin five 2400 G now I may be
pairing this with an MSI B 350m gaming
micro ATX motherboard and here's the
best part about the 2400 GT the 2200 G
whichever models you get I hope does it
arise in seven version coming is the
fact that you don't have to change your
motherboard to upgrade in the future
where before you'd use the FM sockets to
take advantage of the Kaveri APU or the
FX socket if you want to take advantage
of their mainstream CPUs but now you
have them in one platform giving you
some mix a lot of future compatibility
so I'm also gonna be pairing this with
some Flair X ddr4 probably the most
expensive piece in the system is going
to be memory in terms of like cost per
whatever it cost per 4 gigabyte ram is
still kind of high but remember we're
not spending these stupid two and a half
times inflated pricing and video cards
so we've got 16 gigabytes of 3,200
memory now the reason why we want a
decent amount of memory and decently
decent fast memories one as you know the
Infinity fabric and the entire
architecture of Rison takes advantage of
memory speed and because we're dealing
with an APU we're gonna see gains with
fast memory as well so that's why you
don't want to scrimp on your memory I
want to keep things fairly reasonable
though in terms of pricing so we've got
a cooler master master what 550 semi
modular power supplied more than enough
power to power an APU like overkill for
an APU but future compatibility once
again with graphics cards so that we can
put a discrete graphics card in here and
not worry about having not enough power
if we went with something like a 400
watt and we've got the master box light
T G this is a tempered glass case for
right around the $50 price range that's
one of the reasons why I want this you
it's a mini 8 or mini a or micro ATX
motherboard compatible case so that's
why we're using an M ATX motherboard
there are other cases out there
obviously in this price range or cheaper
if you want to use a full ATX so just
something to keep in mind if you're kind
of mimicking this build this is a micro
ATX only we've got ourselves here a 250
gigabyte Samsung SATA SSD and then I've
got a 2 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda Drive 7200 rpm Drive
we are gonna be using the cooling that
comes with the Vega APU here so we're
gonna be using the the in box cooler and
then what else we got right here we got
are we missing anything I keep it feels
like we're missing some things we don't
have a graphics card right I also decide
to up the cooling this only comes with
one exhaust fan on the back I am adding
two Corsair AF 140 fans on the front
these are not the cheapest fans but you
can obviously adjust your pricing and
the parts you pick based on your budget
so with all that said let's go ahead and
start building and see exactly how well
this performs I have not tested any of
this yet I'm gonna be finding out with
you guys in real time 328 am a lot of
time has passed since the intro of this
video and I am just okay fine so we
switched to vlog modes and kinda show
you what's going on as you can see the
system is a little different than we
first showed I've got a different cooler
on there this is the Noctua cooler that
was sent with the original risin pieces
last year when dries in first lunch it's
a different motherboard too as you can
see it's the ITX motherboard
it was the ITX motherboard that they
sent with the unit I didn't want to do
an ITX bill I they're really pushing the
whole ITX thing right now because it's
newer stuff for them but I don't think
most people will be running out and
buying an overpriced ITX board so I
didn't want to really do that the thing
is that they didn't have official
supported BIOS yet for Raven Ridge
even though the msi website has a Raven
Ridge BIOS AMD was very adamant that I
don't use that and that motherboard the
irony is it actually worked because I'm
gonna show you right now is what I'm
dealing with and why I've now switched
to vlog mode and not gonna actually be
able to give you any numbers on this on
today's video we'll be doing a follow up
anyway the way ap use work is they share
system memory because it's not a
graphics card member a graphics card is
just another computer inside of a
computer it's got a GPU process is that
processing in it it's got its own memory
it's got some power delivery and it's
basically a computer inside of the
computer that handles all of the video
processing ap use when they are stacked
inside of a CPU they have to share
resources with the system so if we go
over here to settings and we look at
advanced when we go here to integrated
graphics
figuration you can see we're set to IgD
our integrated graphics we're set to
force and 2g of video memory so 2g or 2
gigabytes of video memory is allocated
to the APU by default 512 megabytes is
what is set to the APU because all its
kind of set to do from the factory is
just turn on and give you an image
desktop stuff like that if you want to
go into this gaming mode you need more
memory now what I got through my
benchmarks at least with the 512 because
I was gonna do 3 different settings for
this benchmark I was gonna do straight
up out of the box with the slow memory
the 512 megabytes of memory allocated to
the APU and no overclocking on the CPU
whatsoever and the average frame rates
for that was Metro last light was giving
us a nineteen point five nine frames per
second in 1080p medium I was getting
twelve point three nine frames per
second average and Tomb Raider or rise
of the Tomb Raider medium settings in DX
twelve times pi gave me a graphic score
522 firestrike gave me a graphic score
fifteen hundred and thirty five dirt
rally and medium settings an average of
twenty three point three six frames per
second so terrible absolutely terrible
that's not anything anyone would want to
you know actually write home about and
say I've got a good gaming computer but
that's because it's being limited by its
vram obviously 512 megabytes of VRAM is
not enough for 1080p obviously so that's
why two gigs is important now that's the
most that you can get it and we've got
sixteen gigabytes of RAM actually in the
system you can see right there now if we
go ahead and save that it's two G so we
have two gigs of video RAM set to the
APU let me show you what we're
experiencing alright so while we're
loading up I'm gonna do rise of the Tomb
Raider it's got a pretty consistent
benchmark one that I use quite often
when I'm doing my graphics cards and
stuff go to graphics set to medium all
the medium defaults so that is something
that is not too hard for a system to run
now if we go ahead and go in here and
just kind of launch the benchmark
what I'm experiencing here is the frames
per second increase big-time by going
from 512 to two gigabytes as expected
because we're not choking it
- where it can't actually render
textures because it doesn't have enough
buffer but what I'm experiencing here is
and keep in mind this is still with
these stock settings for the CPU and the
memory so if I go in here to the
benchmark look at the delay first of all
there's this huge input delay on when
the menu reacts so that's something I've
noticed but what you're gonna see is the
benchmark is gonna run how far it gets
is is it differentiates randomly it's
kind of random on when it crashes but it
will crash and give me just a solid
black screen we'll call it the black
screen of death frames per second right
here is actually not terrible it's
probably in the 30s or 40s keep in mind
I have not sped up system memory which
affects apu i've not sped up the cpu
this is just adding more vram to the apu
so it increased quite a bit this is
obviously thin there goes there it is it
doesn't matter what I do it doesn't
matter what game I'm running I have
reset factory defaults I have
reinstalled the BIOS I have reinstalled
the graphics driver I've been on the
phone with AMD the problem is it's it's
a weekend so there's not really anybody
in the engineering side that can help me
and it's frustrating because it wasn't I
wasn't getting these problems when I was
using my be 350 gaming board which is
this guy right here when I was using
this guy so I'm gonna kind of leave it
to Nick real quick you think I should
install this motherboard back in there
and see if our problems go away
let's Friendly's narrow it down to a
motherboard yeah yeah okay we'll do that
real quick there we go as the build
progressively gets more and more ugly
and unless cable managed because I
honestly don't care anymore at this
point let's see if it only at least make
it through a test with the unsupported
motherboard which as you can see is
indeed giving us a picture there we go
see the difference - is it doesn't have
that forced in auto mode and yes I tried
the force and auto and blah blah blah
but whatever we're set to 2g and we even
have an overclock on this one right now
we are set to 3.8 XMP profile we're set
to 3200 with our graphics Corsa to will
set it to 1250 No
there we go 12:50 because that is what
the factory speed is on that 1250 is
like what the turbo clock is supposed to
be my eyes red can I feel red looking at
this all day alright so I'm basically
doing now is I'm ruling out the
possibility of a bad CPU by changing out
the motherboard and I I honestly think
it's the motherboard look at the FPS
already up in the 50s as it's moving so
quickly but it's badly at 55 this is way
better than we were seeing on the ITX
board isn't it okay I'm gonna let this
run I'm gonna see if it gets through the
test if it gets through the test maybe I
will just continue my testing with this
motherboard nobody asterisk that it's
not the board that AMD sent me I kind of
like doing tests on boron product that's
not sent to me direct by the
manufacturer because of the idea of
cherry-picking and stuff but based on
the experience I've been having so far I
don't think we can call this one
cherry-picked
so I got through all the tests with an
asterisk because this is not the
motherboard they sent me and they did
tell me that this motherboard does not
have the latest BIOS which is gonna give
a little more of an advantage to the APU
there's some maturity that's gonna have
to happen here but we saw some pretty
solid gains I mean you got it was nearly
double when we went from the 512 to the
2 gigs without changing any clock speeds
and then I overclocked it to one
thousand three hundred and seventy-five
megahertz on the APU 3.8 gigahertz on
the CPU and the memory from the base 21
33 I think it was up to 3200 so we saw
some pretty solid gains you guys might
have noticed there was a blank spot
there on rise of the Tomb Raider and if
I show you here it refuses to actually
launch see I get this error so with it
overclocked that game refuses to lunch
but what I want to do here is I want to
kind of show you some live gameplay at
least real quick with something like
doom something has the Vulcan API which
is actually really good with lower end
hardware just to kind of see what where
things actually go
I love dooms simply because it's one of
those titles that will literally run on
anything okay so in 1920 by 1080
anti-aliasing we're gonna turn that to
like fxaa
motion blur medium that's fine I guess
vertical sync is on FPS is not looking
too solid right here though that's for
sure what are the presets okay well
we're set to ultra
first of all hey wait we don't want to
ultra this why is it an ultra maybe
that's we played on last time okay
medium settings it's gonna restart the
game ultra why no no no no okay so looks
like if we just we just went for low
settings here I mean what we explored
right I mean let's see what happens here
we just go low settings no graphics card
it's locked too kind of 60fps but I
think that's a menu thing so let's just
see what happens we get into the game
remember there's no graphics card that's
important to remember here 50 FPS 1080p
low settings
Oh at the end of the level you want to
try something here what if I go to like
720p settings and if we turn off
anti-aliasing like altogether I mean
it's about as low as it can go
we can't uh they lock up they locked up
on us guys I'm just gonna go ahead and
end it right there because that's
unfortunate I mean this is unfortunate
been our experience now we're gonna
circle back here I've been in contact
with AMD I've told them that I'm gonna
show the experiences here and they're
like okay that's fair
this is what I'm experiencing I mean
it's completely locked up right now now
there's a little bit of an overclock on
there remember we're not running oh and
there it goes right there video failure
okay well this it kind of figured out
what went wrong hunk so anyway we're
gonna circle back on this this has been
my experience here but I can tell you
this if you if you just look at
Cinebench as well this this CPU the 2400
G is designed specifically to replace
the 1400 the Rison 5 1400 and it's doing
a good job of it it's faster in
Cinebench by a significant amount and as
we overclock it it just pulls way ahead
obviously so would I recommend this this
apu given the experiences i'm having so
far the answer is yes and let me explain
why again you're getting better cpu
performance even just from the cpu spot
side of things where now you were
talking about the graphics card then you
would get with a risin 5 1400 for the
same price that's the biggest thing this
this is advertised it being a hundred
and $69 CPU the $99 part we'll look at
in another video the 2200 g the Rison 3
4 cores 4 threads this is a four core
eight thread with a built-in apu that
can actually play games I mean it's not
gonna play them you know like like a
discreet graphics card it's not gonna be
able to crank the settings just because
it says Vega don't think it's like they
took a Vega you know stacked 3d Ram and
stuck it inside this no it's it's much
better than anything you get on the
intel part that's for sure intel has
never been known for
APU graphics but I want to circle back
here and see what kind of maturity we
get this feels a lot like when the rise
and launch first happened how there was
a lot of weird things going on I know
this has been kind of a fragmented
incomplete video but my experience has
been fragmented and incomplete and I've
been at this today for like 12 hours
today alone it is what it is guys will
circle back tell me what you guys think
below if you're looking at trying to get
into games but you don't want to buy a
graphics card right now you can actually
do that with this part and then as the
GPU market hopefully stabilizes and the
prices come back down to normal you can
throw a GPU in here and have a very good
experience just as if it was another
Rison part without the integrated
graphics so it's not like you have to
change your platform like I said the
start of this video it's not like you
have a different socket for an APU and a
different socket for your CPU this is a
part that can grow with you so that's
kind of where this really is going to
shine not necessarily this standalone
replacement for graphics cards but
definitely something that can grow with
you and at least get you started
while this pricing for graphics cards is
completely upside-down anyway I'm gonna
go there will be a follow-up to this
again I'm sorry that I've had all these
problems but I can't help it it is what
it is and that's been my experience it's
unfortunate but I think all in all at
the end of the day with a motherboard
that was not fully supported it's
actually performing pretty well all
right guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching and tell me what you think down
below and I will see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
