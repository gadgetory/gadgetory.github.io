got a guest with me today Maybelle J
you're not really that little anymore
you're kind of big now I'm almost nine
but I know where she gets her stunning
good looks her mom know so we are I have
been teasing this how long we've been
talking about building a new computer
like a year yeah least a year I told her
I would not build her her new computer
until she brought me home a truck doing
the backup Bieber outside the cooler
masters new master keys m'kay 750
mechanical gaming keyboard features a
minimalistic distraction-free design
Cherry MX floating key caps magnetic
removable wrist rest USB type-c in an
on-the-fly system with no software
making it easier for you to game smarter
and not harder
learn more and check out the links in
the description below okay so what I
said all along was I was not gonna build
her a new computer until she brought me
home a straight-a report card because
you've been chasing that though straight
A's for a long time and I got straight
A's so here we are we're gonna build her
new computer now before we get all of
the like I was a kid need a new computer
type of comments I was three when I got
my first computer and I was five when I
built my first one exactly like you you
were three when you got your first
little computer was like an old laptop
that barely worked and you were five
when you built this one over here and we
are keeping with the tradition of
prepping the kids at a young age for
tech and look where it ended up so who
knows where this could go so this is her
old bill this is an AMD a10 78 50 K so
it's a Kaveri APU it's nothing terrible
and it's also got in there a380s so it's
definitely no slouch but the CPU is
starting to show its age she wants to
start playing more high end games like
even playing battlefront of course
minecraft and stuff like that and I
started yeah she started playing World
of Warcraft but there's other games you
want to try out that are you she wants
to do mods she likes doing PC or not PC
mods but like game mods and stuff which
are very intensive so especially
minecraft mods anyone's done minecraft
mods knows but that's intensive so we
are stepping her up today to a whole new
rig from scratch just a quick overview
of some of the main parts I'll put a
list obviously in the description below
of all the parts we are using this is my
i7 No
five eighty four hundred so this is a
six core processor doesn't have hyper
threading and it's not overclockable but
it's gonna have six cores that is more
than enough power we're putting it in
our NZXT n7z 370 motherboard
specifically because of the white cover
obviously we're sticking with the white
and pink theme she has not even seen her
case or her new case in person yet but
we will obviously be showing all of that
we're gonna cool it with a Celsius s24
I'm not actually putting 32 gigabytes of
RAM in her system this is just the quad
channel pack where me putting two of
these white RGB sticks in there
obviously we've got our cable extensions
here from cable mod they made these
specifically for you so they are pink
and white what does make yep and cuz she
knows she has a pink a white case but
she hasn't actually seen it in person
yet and the graphics card I have not
picked the card yet I know I said I was
gonna do a Titan XP just to trigger
people but honestly I'm not putting a
Titan XP in there because it won't match
the theme because it's a black card with
green lights and that's obviously not
gonna work but we will figure out the
card as we go so what do you say you
ready to build this yeah what do you
think we should do with this computer
maybe we should give it to my sister
because how old is she
three and I was three when I got my
first one see it's kind of a theme going
here
alright let's build this
[Laughter]
you
okay we're done and you guys might have
noticed we had to switch out some parts
most the way through the build because
at first I thought man zxt board was bad
which was really strange because we had
I'd used it in the past and it worked
fine so I switched out the board for
another board and it also didn't work so
it looks like the 8,400 I five we were
gonna put in there is it's dead and you
know what that means
it means you got an upgrade because we
ended up putting in a 1600 X Rhys n five
which has more cores and it's a faster
processor we also tried to do the GTX
1080 Galax Edition card which is the
white card but unfortunately it was too
long and it hit on the fans which it's
an interesting location where you mount
the radiator on this she ended up with a
EVGA 1080 TI superclocked so yeah I was
hoping this computer will last you for a
long time I don't think you have any
idea how special this computer is right
now at this time okay so what was your
favorite part of the bill my favorite
part of the build was using the
screwdriver I mean okay it's easy enough
you got to do the motherboard three
times in this but you got lots and lots
of practice on this one what was the
hardest part the hardest part was
putting the screws through the fans
because they they were cutting the
rubber and it was hard to screw oh she's
time up she's time at the bottom mounted
fans where you have to like tap the
threads as you're going through the
plastic yeah you're kind of good to use
a lot of strength for that but you know
what you did better this time obviously
wouldn't then when you were five she did
all of this by herself she plugged in
the front panel header the the front
panel pins into the little tiny pins she
located the position all on her own I
was trying to tell her where they go
she's like oh it says reset that's where
it goes and says hard drive light the so
that's where that goes and you did it
all by yourself she plugged in all the
fan headers
well like I didn't do anything except
kind of guide you where normally I would
have to get like when she was five I had
to get really kind of hands-on but this
you built this all by yourself I put the
lights on here at the last minute though
because we were gonna use the NZ
to hue lights which works with that
motherboard but since that motherboard
wasn't able to be used I couldn't use
those lights so now we have the cable
mod RGB UV lights in there what she is
like super excited about because has a
remote and now you can just push the
buttons to change a color if you want
hey guys we're gonna go huge thank you
to those that donated parts for this
build in Wynne sent us in win 101 pink
edition which I saw that Computex are no
CES sounds like I have to have that for
my daughter so here it is and they also
sent over the fans Corsair sent over the
white RGB memory we set to set up the
RGB she wants all the RGB stuff and
these are RGB fans and the rest of the
parts we pretty much had sitting here
kid you're not getting a new computer
for a while you have no idea how much
this computer behind you costs right now
so anyway a what even Nick's eyes are
like what yeah no it's a lot more than
that so you keep getting good grades and
stuff and I will keep spoiling you but
this computer's gonna last you a long
long time or anything you want to say
before we go thank you for watching and
have a good day
she's nicer than me you forgot to tell
him to subscribe and like and all that
stuff
yes great and like the video cuz it
would make my dad super happy
oh no scissor we're gonna go we gotta go
now
hook it up give it a lesson stuff on
there and I gotta go to the gym obvious
I gotta work off this dad bod alright
guys we'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
