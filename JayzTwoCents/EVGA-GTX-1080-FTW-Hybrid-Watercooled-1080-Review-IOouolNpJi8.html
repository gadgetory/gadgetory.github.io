excited because I have got a chance to
check out the brand new GT X 1080 hybrid
from EVGA you guys know the EVGA has
been pretty big on making hybrid classes
for the 970 the 980 980 TI and all of
that but this one's a little bit
different than what they've done in the
past we're going to talk about that
today we're talking about what makes
this different than previous hybrid
models and then of course we're going to
put it through the paces yeah so strap
in guys this is going to be a pretty
epic graphics card if it holds up at
least to the to the expectations because
you know gamers they've got some high
expectations
you
are you sick and tired of trying to find
a gaming headset with a mic works it see
what I did there well you're in luck
because math drop has a drop going on
the highly popular antlion mod mic the
mod mic offers amazing voice clarity and
with its magnetic mount allows you to
attach the mic to your favorite pair of
cans turning any pair of headphones into
a high-end gaming headset instantly want
to learn more then follow the link down
below so let's start this video off by
talking about what makes this a
quote-unquote hybrid card no it's not a
Prius it's obviously it's electric so it
doesn't run on gasoline or anything like
that but it's the fact that it has an
air cooler built onto the card to cool
things like vrm and memory but it also
has obviously a all-in-one water cooling
loop on there in this case a 120
millimeter self-contained water cooling
unit to keep the core cool so it's kind
of two independent cooling systems
designed to keep the card as cool as
possible
now EVGA introduced its hybrid series
graphics cards with the gtx 980 and that
launched in september 9 ad launched in
september of 2014 and the hybrid came
like early 2015 so you guys can see how
long ago that was but since then they've
actually made a few changes and what i
want to talk about here is two things
that really differentiates the 1080
hybrid from the other hybrid models as I
kind of alluded to in the beginning of
this video and that being one that 980
980ti and the 970 that's kind of the
order of the hybrid cards released were
based on reference PCBs that's the PCB
blueprint and design as made by Nvidia
and then EVGA came up with a custom
cooling solution for a all stock 100%
untouched graphics card board and then
called it a hybrid which is perfectly
fine but this time around they actually
are making the hybrid on the for the win
PCB so it's one step up from the SC
which has got things like ten plus two
power fades it's also got on there dual
BIOS which is going to give you things
like a more aggressive fan curve for the
fan on the PCB and it's also going to
allow you to be able to update power
limit which is going to be a good thing
because you want to take advantage of
the cooled graphics card that's being
cooled by water so it's you're going to
see a lot of benefits to a water cooled
/ hybrid graphics card
you're not going to see temps that are
nearly as high as an all air cold
graphics card even something with custom
air coolers like the for the when air
cold cards have but you're also going to
see a much more steady and lower voltage
going into the graphics card which means
lower temperatures but you're also going
to see a much more stable clock and I
don't mean necessarily a stable
overclock I mean a stable core clock
where GPU boost is not going to be
bouncing around all over the place
because you're never going to get near
the temperature target that the air
cooled cards are so it doesn't have to
do any sort of dynamic throttling
whatsoever of the core clocks you're
going to get a very consistent speed
which really makes a hybrid card like
this a huge benefit now something else
they changed with this particular cooler
is the fact that it has a different fan
on it in the past all of the hybrid
cards like I said 989 ati 970 had a
blower style fan on it which can still
be fairly noisy even though they are not
running at nearly as high of an RPM if
you were dealing with like a standard
blower card like on a reference card or
a founders card but that style fan that
little turbine fan is still very very
noisy so they've opted to go with their
kind of a reverse blade swept fan design
like you would find on their AC X
coolers which means an immediate direct
downdraft of air right onto the VRMs and
you're also going to get a lot less
noise and wind chopping sound if you
will with this cooler so they've
actually made quite a few changes this
time around and I'm excited to see how
this actually performs on the for the
wind card because for the first time we
should see some very respectable results
in things like temperatures standard
boost clock speeds and overclocking so
with all of that out of the way let's go
ahead and get to the best part of the
video the benchmarks transition
so full disclosure here all of the tests
that you saw were on the slave BIOS
which is a little bit more aggressive
fan curve on the board for the VRMs and
a higher power limit but I didn't change
the power limit I left everything
default but I did go to the slave BIOS
immediately because I also played around
with overclocking now yes you did see a
21 64 max overclock speed on that chart
but all the tests you saw were run at 20
25 because that's where the card boosted
up to by itself and that's where I left
it I didn't change any of the settings
for any of the benchmarks that you guys
see the only chart that you guys would
see where I overclocked it so that you
could see how much of a benefit there
was was in firestrike all the rest of
the tests were but it was actually
denoted on there that it was OCD so all
the rest of the tests were done at
factory out of the box settings on the
second bios so really these benchmarks
should be no surprise it's it's right
around where all the other ten eighties
are it just does at a much much lower
temperature but really the the point of
this card here is simply to do it with
better acoustics in bed better
overclocking Headroom in terms of
temperatures on a chip that can
otherwise get pretty damn hot I mean 60
nano meter FinFET is a pretty small chip
with a lot of focused heat and the water
cooling the water cooling unit here on
the hybrids having no problems handling
that but you might have noticed on the
chart that we saw 51 C as a max temp in
fact I'm sitting at 51 c right now and
let me talk about that for a second here
because that's warmer that I would have
liked to have seen this card get
especially since some of the other
hybrids in the past sat right around 43
to 44 C do you have no control over the
fan on the radiator as it's setup
precision X does not control the speed
of the fan on the radiator it controls
the speed of the fan on the card for
cooling the V RMS now keeping V RMS cool
is obviously very important but they
have their own dynamic fan control setup
based on water temperature that allows
the fan to go faster as it starts to get
warmer and right around the 51 52 C is
where it starts to ramp up that fan uh
so you should never really see harder
than about 51 or 52 and I keep looking
behind me because I've had this looping
now for about 45 minutes just doing more
temperature testing and it's sitting at
51 C as we
sit right now but the radiator fan has
started to speed up but down in the 40s
the radiator fan is pretty much running
at an idle speed which I feels a little
too conservative because the fan that
they used is not very loud and they can
get away with higher rpms and in a
closed case where I've got this thing in
an open test bench and right behind me I
cannot hear it what I hear is my my pump
on my test bed and you could get better
temperatures with a little better fan
curve or at least give the the consumer
control over that fan so I wasn't happy
with those results and what I did was I
ended up taking off the stock fan to do
some testing here and I took an ek
Vardar fan and put that on which has a
four pin pwm fan and plugged it into the
motherboard now I could do that because
the fan that comes with this is a
standard three-pin fan that is molex
right in the middle of the cable so it's
not hardwired in where you'd have to cut
it or leave the fan on flopping around
you can actually remove the fan entirely
plug in your own fan to the motherboard
and control that few motherboard
software in my case I use speed fan but
with the Vardar fan a fourteen hundred
and fifty rpm fan I could run it at
about 1213 rpm there are 1200 to 1300
rpm it's not very loud have control over
that and got the temps to come down
significantly in fact I saw 44 C by
changing out the fan didn't get really
any louder just used a higher quality
fan and was able to get much better
temperatures while overclock that 44 C
guys was at that 20 164 megahertz
overclocked number that you guys saw in
that chart so I got curious and I put a
second one on there and push pull and
ended up seeing that come all the way
down to almost 41 C it was like 42 it's
sometimes at 41 go back to 42 so we saw
almost a 10 C drop in temperatures by
changing out the fans with something
more high static pressure and a little
bit higher rpm so it's something that
you can do at least with this kit is you
can upgrade the fan if you want to now
something else that this card features
as well as the rest of the for the win
and classified graphics cards from EVGA
is a full RGB LED control and you can
control that either using precision X or
using the led visualizer built into the
GeForce experience app so I obviously
made mine green
as I have a green test bed and you guys
are going to call me a fanboy anyway but
I like green
kinda like a slammer green I really I
really like it so anyway there's that it
is retailing at the time of making this
video EVGA u.s. pricing is seven hundred
and twenty nine dollars it's got a
premium but if you look at what some of
the other cards are costing and with the
kind of screwy pricing with the ten
eighty it's up to you to decide whether
or not it's worth it
the temperatures are obviously kept well
in check even more so when you put on a
custom fan and start playing around with
fan curves but it's it's definitely it's
definitely going to give you a hell of a
gaming experience in games with the
amount of fps that a 1080 can draw or
can render draw that technically draws
and renders whatever you guys get what
I'm trying to say but it's time to go
thanks for watching guys let me know
what other cards you want me to review
in the future I still have a GTX 1082
classified that I've got do my review on
I do also have before the win 1080 and a
1070 I've also cut more AMD cards I've
got a look at their just turn into such
a GPU channel but I've also got an ek
water block for the tight next Pascal
card so maybe we'll be doing some
water-cooled tight next stuff now what
the heck I might as well do it it's the
two things I love graphics cards and
water cooling just smooshed into one so
you guys can look for that in the future
anyway thanks for watching guys hit that
like button if you liked it subscribe if
you're new to the channel check out the
description for other links to stuff or
just come and follow me and say hey
what's up on Twitter or Instagram anyway
guys thanks for watching I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
