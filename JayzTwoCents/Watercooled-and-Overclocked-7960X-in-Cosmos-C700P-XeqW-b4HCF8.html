it is time to review a case but you know
I don't like to just do straight-up case
reviews talking about the features I
like to actually build in the case
because that's how you get a really good
feel for a case I mean that's where you
just that's where you are able to decide
where its shortcomings are how to have
an IO shield dislike fall out of there
that's where you decide where the
shortcomings are and you actually get a
good idea of what the case is all about
this was the Cougar case that built sort
of a crudely thrown together and the
parts are definitely not cheap by any
means but the system was just thrown
together with parts we had available
when we moved into the studio and I
needed an editing rig when I was moving
the Rison system to some other uses and
this is that but now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna be checking out the new
cosmos see 700 P which is a highly
anticipated case because the cosmos line
and the half line are the high airflow
cases those are two cases that really
put Coolermaster on the map in terms of
enthusiasts gamers and professionals

I'm gonna changing out a couple of parts
in here too though I'm not gonna be
reusing my x99 system here although a
great system with a 6900 k8 core is 16
threads overclocked a 4.4 definitely no
slouch but I'm trying to decide what I
want to go with moving forward I'm
thinking about putting in my 79 60 X
which is a 16 core 32 thread so I've got
some concerns here about how it's a
cooling which will figure out these like
rubber pieces got like duct Wow
these are the Maglev fans from Corsair
and I like them they're fairly quiet and
they have a lot of static pressure I
tend to go a little crazy on the zip
ties so then it makes case and build
this assembly a little bit of a pain in
the arse my biggest complaint with
Corsair fans in the past was they never
gave you enough cable length
I think they've remedied that now you
had a good amount of link on there now
before like the the sp1 20s and stuff
they didn't give you enough length in my
opinion so my 4 gate Tara Buddha Margate
Tara Buddha my 4 gigabyte Barracuda
Drive that I've been editing off of I'm
gonna be switching that over to one of
the 10 terabyte drives but you know what
you guys know how I like to do this
glamour shots time
you
I'm gonna dab but I honestly feel
there's no better way to find the pros
and the cons to a case than to kind of
really push it to the limits even if I
had just thrown in hardware
off-the-shelf air cooler and stuff I
don't think I would have found out some
of the things about this case that I'm
not really fond of let's go and start
with some of the things that are really
cool about it first of all I've heard a
lot of people complain about the you
know the orientation of motherboards
some people really like the inverted
motherboard look because you can see the
cooler on your graphics card you can see
that sometimes it seems more natural for
some people to have it upside down
because then I don't know whatever
reason you could you could flip this
around and make it a left side case so
that the windows on the left side it's
upside-down it's inverted so it's
actually compatible with switching you
know the orientation depending on how
you want it so that's a really neat
feature you can actually take the drive
cage and scoot it forward scoot it back
you can make more room for front mounted
radiators radiator support is actually
pretty off the hook you can hit fit up
to a 420 rad in the front so 120 240 280
360 in the front or 140 280 420 in the
front on the top you can actually fit a
420 radiator in there and you can fit it
at the same time even though
coolermaster says it's officially not
supported the problem is because it's a
center mounted radiator and it's not
slid forward or towards the face of the
case like a lot of companies are doing
now what happens is if you're running a
thicker radiator than something like a
30 mil it's going to interfere with
something like the motherboard in fact
I'm running a 45 mil thick 360 right now
there's actually no way I'm going to get
the EPS power off without removing my
radiator because once I put plugged in
the power and then put the radiator down
it covers perfectly the EPS power pins
so I can't actually remove them and take
them out but on the flip side I
shouldn't really have to because the
only way I can get the motherboard out
anyway is to undo the loop because it's
rigid tubing so it's kind of a you know
6:1 way a half a dozen the other no
matter what to get this motherboard out
I have two fully disassembled it anyway
which is coming down side to rigid
tubing but I'm on a tangent
I digress that's a conversation for a
different video but I've got two
graphics cards in here which is nice
they're not sag
as far as as much as they were in my
cougar case which is kind of interesting
but yeah they look beautiful in there in
fact Bret turn the LED on there we go
crunching on me that's a lie Bridge led
my bed something else it's kind of nice
though is it got these shrouds all over
the case we've got the one on the bottom
right here covering the PSU I left that
one in there just for the sake of clean
cleanliness we've also got this one that
would go right here in the front but
obviously I'm leaving this one off
because we don't want to cover the
reservoir and the tubing as some of the
best visual assets of doing a build like
this so we're gonna leave this one off
and hand that to Nick there's also more
on the back behind the reservoir where
the res is mounted which kind of meets
up cables so as you're running cables
are not all ugly and in the way and
since I'm running white cables in here
against a black interior cable
management is a big deal because white
cables would obviously stand out if they
were ugly but as you can see we don't
have too much of a problem here with the
GPU though I'm outed the cables around
the side like this because I don't have
the front panel on so I could do that or
that front shroud because with the sli
spacing in this particular motherboard
it pushed the lower graphics card really
close to the pass-through grommet which
made it very ugly and hard to get a good
tidy run because it's offset because
these cards are longer were normally
that grommets lined up with like the
founders edition cards so the tubing or
the cables could come straight through
and go right into the graphics card and
look clean these were offset because
they're longer cards and so I had this
crazy Bend that just didn't look good so
this is the better cleaner routing
option for me full length filters on the
bottom on the top and on the face so
that you're able to easily pull out the
filters everything you have just
minimized inside of your case you blow
these out and off you go
but let's go and talk about something
that I'm not a fan of with this case and
that's the fact that it only gives you
two three and a half inch drive sleds
and when I kind of complained about that
to Coolermaster their response was they
had listened to feedback over time of
various cases where people wanted more
water cooling and reservoir support and
less harddrive cages so they kind of
came up with this mounting sled sort of
a hovering mounting sled which actually
looks an awful lot like the in wind
sleds that I used in the tattoo point-o
case in the Terry Crews build but
regardless I'm only using one of them
because I have one three and a half inch
drive in here but one of the things that
was amazing about the cosmos too was the
amount of native three and a half inch
two and a half inch drive support that
you've had with all of those drive sleds
and you kind of lose that with this
that's some of its heritage that you're
not getting here and it did say you can
purchase those separately but they're
$5.99 each on a case that's already
about 300 bucks if you have to buy five
or six more of those to get all your
hard drives in there at six bucks a pop
out it's another thirty thirty-five
bucks just to add something that was
previously on an additional case that's
really expensive or on an expensive case
so that's kind of a downside to me but
this case looks amazing it's got
built-in case lighting you can see out
here you can cycle through it
where's the button to cycle through it
for static it's also got RGB you know
stuff going on I just leave it on white
does cycle and whatnot but it shares a
lot of heritage from the cosmos to these
rails are all metal they do support the
entire chassis and this is not a light
build by any means so we've been moving
it all around we were filling it and
having to tilt it and put it upside down
and on its back we were using those
handles trust me they came in handy so
moving the case wouldn't be too hard
because of the support of those rails
but again it's a very heavy case and
something worth keeping in mind but
ultimately I don't have too many gripes
about this case and I know a lot of you
guys have been really asking me about it
yeah they see the C 700 that's awesome
but what about the H 500 that's coming
guys it's got a later embargo date I
will be doing something with that I
don't know if it'll be to this caliber
but I will be doing something because
again the half series is a highly
anticipated case that a lot of people
want to know about because they were
there was a huge fan base for the high
airflow series and they're bringing that
back as well so anyway guys it's time to
go thanks for watching my look here at
the C 700p basically my look is just
doing a build in it hit the like button
if you guys enjoy this build this is I
basically did a build that would
normally take me several days and
crammed it into two days actually a
little less than two days I think it
turned out pretty damn good especially
that view fluid you guys wanted me to
use the blue in the thread Ripper build
so badly beside I'm using silver and
thread Ripper and the blue fits in here
perfect contrast with the white and the
gunmetal and the black I don't think it
could have looked any better I know some
people are disappointed that I didn't
water cool the graphics cards but I
wanted to keep using my further win
three cards because they're so damn
powerful and it's gonna be nice now for
me to try out different graphics cards
to on my main system which I wasn't able
to ever do with skunkworks because they
were hard lined water
graphics cards so now I can at least
play around with that and with the
modern cooling now no problems there I
mean the graphics cards run so damn cool
now with the custom coolers it's not
really a problem that's why I made at
least the LEDs match right because then
you can kind of it sort of ties in but
it's time to go guys thanks for watching
make sure you guys mash that like button
merchandise link is down in the
description below hundreds and hundreds
of shirts sold in the first month that
this has been up so huge thank you you
guys will support it that way and as
always guys thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
