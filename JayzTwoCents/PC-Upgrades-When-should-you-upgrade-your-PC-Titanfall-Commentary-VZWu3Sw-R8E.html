addicts this is js2 sense bringing you
one of those commentaries that are
somewhat rare on my channel but I like
to do them because it sort of gets me
playing games and as you can see here I
am playing the titanfall campaign which
is a multiplayer campaign and I am
enjoying this game when I get a chance
to actually play it so what do you guys
think of that intro they're pretty sweet
huh you'll see it a little bit later in
the video it was a pretty epic battle
the gameplay here starts out kind of
slow but then I sort of get into my
groove later and I become MVP of this
round so go ahead and enjoy this
gameplay it's pretty rare when I'm MVP
at anything but you know I put out an
article on my website the other day Jews
who said so icon makes you go and richer
today if you haven't been there talking
about how Intel has leaked some of the
preliminary information on what we can
expect with the new extreme series there
x99 platform and their new Xtreme 8 core
16 thread Boheme if CPUs and it got me
thinking you know the average person is
probably looking at maybe building a PC
right around now and they're confused on
crap what should i do should I wait for
this to come out or you know I don't
know if I should wait for that to come
out or if I have a PC now should I
upgrade to it so I've got me thinking
rather than talk about x99 and the
little bit of information that's on the
internet I figured it might be a little
more prudent for me to have a
conversation with you guys about whether
or not it's right for you to upgrade
your PC at this current time now when it
comes to my timeline on x99 and when I
suspect that or speculate that it will
actually be releasing to market will be
sometime in June of this year right
around Computex
that is kind of when this stuff tends to
debut to the world Computex is the world
stage for seat PC and CPU type
technologies GPUs and all that stuff it
is the world platform kind of like CES
for computers
so let's go ahead and continue this
commentary here what the mindset of
everything could possibly change in June
for all we know and we do know that
there's some more stuff coming down the
line with Intel with the Broadwell and
their you know their minor has well
refreshed so it's I get a lot of
questions people asking is it time to
upgrade should I upgrade and you know
that is a very difficult answer for me
to give you a definitive yes or no
there's a lot of factors that you have
to ask yourself and that's kind of a
reoccurring theme in these commentaries
that I do about PC components and what's
right for you you must be honest with
yourself and you must ask yourself a few
basic questions the first basic question
that is probably the most important
question is does my PC currently do what
I need it to do it comes down to that
people if your computer does what you
want it to do then the simple short
answer of do I need to upgrade or is it
time to upgrade is no but let's face it
if we build our own computers and we're
gamers we are also enthusiasts which
means that we are going to want to
upgrade so that kind of brings me to
question number two do I need a new
computer or do I want a new computer
those are two very similar sounding
questions that have completely different
connotations that go along with them if
you're like me and you're doing constant
rendering or you're doing a lot of power
using with your computer
chances are moving up to a
next-generation
platform could very well be beneficial
for you if you're just a gamer or you're
not really doing any sort of intensive
tasks on your on your PC chances are you
would not see any sort of an effect
moving to a newer platform not just x99
or any of the eight core sixteen thread
stuff coming out from Intel but moving
to any platform that be moving from AMD
to Intel which I did last summer or
moving from a lower end CPU on AMD or
Intel to a higher end CPU if you're
doing simple tasks like gaming and
surfing the internet you're probably not
going to see any difference other than
you'll have less money in your wallet
and at the end of the day you're really
not going to see any sort of quote
unquote seat-of-the-pants difference of
your
pewter has a lot of things you guys need
to take in mind when it comes to
upgrading you may need a new power
supply you might need new memory x99 is
only going to take full advantage of its
new platform on the ddr4 the new ddr4
Ram so you're going to have to take into
account you have to buy a new
motherboard you have to buy a new CPU
and you're going to have to buy new Ram
which means you're talking a lot of
money and if you're just doing simple
stuff like playing titanfall right here
it quite honestly would be entirely
wasted so what I think would be a better
upgrade if that is the situation that
you're in would be take a look at your
graphics card maybe you should get a
second graphics card and go SLI or
crossfire with your current GPU and
there was that kill by the way we saw in
the beginning yeah that was pretty
awesome you know for a shitty gamer like
me it was kind of cool to pull that off
but anyway I digress let's go ahead get
back on topic here oh yeah look at that
I killed that guy Street anyway it may
be prudent for you to maybe upgrade your
graphics card if you're running a lower
mid end graphics card instead of
upgrading your CPU and your motherboard
or your RAM or anything like that it
could very well be more beneficial for
you to upgrade your graphics card
because we've already know gaming
utilizes your GPU more than any other
piece of hardware in your system hands
down now if you're finding yourself like
me and you're doing a lot of rendering
maybe some 3d modeling CAD drawing photo
editing Photoshop that sort of stuff you
are going to be utilizing the full
potential of your computer now I'm
currently still on z77 platform which is
already a generation behind and we do
know that we have a new generation
coming out later this year so I'm
starting to find myself in the situation
of is it time to upgrade as we know when
I went to z77
it was like the very last day of that
being the current cycle and z87 came out
the next day but I knew that going with
z87 was not necessarily the right move
for me because lacked a lot of the
stability with overclocking that I knew
I would get with a nice refined silicon
that was currently being put out in the
3770k CPU
these are things that you also have to
take in mind if you like to tweak your
computer new like to overclock and stuff
it's never a good
to adopt the very first round or very
first phase of any new platform rollout
early adopters you take the chance and
you take a risk of getting a dud the
bottom line is the the silicon process
and the processing of the CPUs just are
not nearly as refined as the process
matures now we do know that Broadwell is
going to be a minor refresh so there's
not going to be anything substantial
happening with that refresh but we do
know that there's probably going to be
some new motherboards or things coming
down the line to go along with that
refresh so you're going to start
considering backwards compatibility and
what may or may not be happening with
that in the arena of motherboards and
CPUs so there's a lot going around right
now
now what would my advice be to someone
who's asking me should I build a
computer right now my answer to you
would be absolutely buy it and build it
right now you're not going to be missing
out on anything major when it comes to
the new features in fact most of us
barely use any of the features that are
really available to them on their
motherboards anyway so guys I know
there's no definitive answer that I can
give you but I'm going to tell you that
if you're the kind of person that wants
to have the latest and greatest you have
to make sure that you have the money and
the deep pockets to go along with it
it's going to be expensive there's no
way you can stay on top of PC technology
because you're going to be seeing
constant refreshes which means you're
always going to have a huge diminishing
return on your performance the dollar
ratio now I suggest if you're looking at
building a PC right now you go ahead and
build it and you just don't look back
take your PC do what it is you built it
to do whether it be gaming rendering or
whatever and enjoy it you're not going
to have a lesser gaming experience
because you decided to go ahead and
build now versus waiting a couple of
months from now if you decided to buy
something that was a couple of years old
that's a little bit different story so
guys this has been Jays two cents here
just telling you if you were looking at
building a PC don't wait because all
you're going to do is constantly find
yourself waiting if you're afraid of
missing out on the latest and greatest
now before we go ahead and get on out of
here I want to just tell you I did end
up as an MVP of this round and I'm very
proud of that and rather than get to the
drop ship I decided to go ahead and take
advantage of this Titan out here that
just found himself kind of out in the
middle of nowhere
and check out the way that this round
ends I think this pretty much just says
it all he had no idea he was being
rodeoed and I'm just plugging away at
him and I'm racing the clock to see if I
can get him killed before the timer runs
out and I think you guys know the way
that this is going to turn out boom
challenge completed Jay's $0.02 MVP it
rarely ever happens but hey I'll take it
when it happens guys I hope you've
enjoyed this video I hope it helped in
some way and if it did you know what to
do hit that subscribe button and as
always I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
