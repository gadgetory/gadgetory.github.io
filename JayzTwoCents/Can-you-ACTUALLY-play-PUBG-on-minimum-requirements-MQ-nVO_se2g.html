going to continue with our minimum specs
investigations with modern games to see
whether or not you can actually play
these triple-a titles at their minimum
requirements and up today it's probably
one of the most popular games to hit the
market over the last year just
absolutely sweeping when it comes to
popularity and that being pub G or
player unknowns battlegrounds really
weird name but pub G you've probably
heard of it by now at least spoil the
ones you love this Valentine's Day with
the gift of awesome portable gaming
performance from MSI featuring Intel i7
processors Nvidia graphics and high
refresh rate displays nothing says I
love you like MSI and just to show how
much we love you here at JSU since we're
giving away to MSI optics 27-inch gaming
monitors worldwide to learn more about
MSI's light up of gaming laptops and to
enter our Valentine's Day Giveaway click
the link in the description below so if
you've heard any previous rumors about
this game or about it being unoptimized
or just poor-performing that's probably
true considering up until this point it
was considered an early access title you
know early access means it means give us
your money now because we want your
money now we don't want to earn it yet
and hopefully we get all the bugs fixed
but if you experience any bugs and while
we're still developing it so I digress
guys what we are going to do right here
is we are going to test this with the
minimum settings and then make a couple
of upgrades to the system to see how it
performs so the minimum requirements for
pub G is Windows 7 or higher we are
running Windows 10 and Intel Core i3
4340 which I don't have so I opted to go
with the AMD FX series and it's
recommending a 6300 now it will have a
6300 I have a 6100 so we're talking
bulldozer here versus I think it was
piledriver piledriver I think was was
the successor to bulldozer but anyway I
look up user benchmark reviews to see
what the difference in performance
between the two was and it was anywhere
between 9 to 11 percent across the board
faster the 6300 anyway so what I did was
I applied 810 percent overclock to my
6100 did a benchmark run and a couple of
other benchmarks to see how it compared
and I was spot-on so I pretty much have
got my 6100 running at 6300 speeds so a
stock 6300 speeds so obviously your
performance can
if you overclock and that's no different
here so memory it's recommending six
gigabytes of video memory
that's a weird number I don't have two
gigabyte sticks laying around so I've
got a single 8 gig stick of ddr3 running
1600 so it's Corsair Vengeance Ram
running 1600 and I've got a gtx 660
installed which is what it recommends if
you have an AMD side of things the
equivalent would be the HD 7850 don't
have one of those we are running a 6100
overclocked to 6300 8 gigs of ram with a
single stick so single channel not dual
channel and we are running a gtx 660 and
of course you need 30 gigabytes of space
we are running this on an SSD and it's
already running right here so let's just
jump right in if we take a look at the
settings you can see we got a fraps
counter up in the corner at showing 42
frames per second in the menu give us a
mixture of settings between medium and
low mostly medium I think the post
processing and anti-aliasing is what's
gonna be hitting our FPS the most so I'm
gonna go ahead and drop those down to
low right now and see what happens to
our counter up in the corner so you know
it only went one fps so I think when we
get in the game we'll see some
improvement there yeah so let's go ahead
and just get in here and see how it goes
now I'm a terrible pub G player I'm
really really bad no judging make fun
all you want I'm terrible I've never
gotten a chicken dinner I think my
profile shows I've killed one person
so what whatever is what it is this is
all about the FPS not how good I can
play so it's not looking too promising
yet I don't think we're gonna be hitting
1080 60 FPS necessarily the closer we
get to the ground I guess we'll see but
right now we're flying through the air
even looking up at the clouds I'm not
able to get that 60 FPS tray oh god oh
god I could be one of those guys that
gets stuck in the tree by everyone
parachuting yeah so as you can see we're
sitting about 40 FPS right here and you
got to ask yourself at what point are
you willing to trade off frames per
second for the sake of just being able
to play the game so I'd like to try and
stay alive long enough to change the
settings here
so let's see if I just go ahead and drop
this down to low low settings all around
and you can see we gained about five FPS
here inside the buildings not looking
too promising here without the
anti-aliasing and the view distance it's
probably very dangerous to be walking
around outside as you can see outside
here we're still only getting high 30s
low 40s on the FPS let's go down to very
low let's see if that's possible I
didn't really change anything so we're
gonna go down to 720p and that seemed to
help a little bit
let's go from medium 720 nope low 720
what if we do this we're gonna do medium
and you go low post-processing low
anti-aliasing I mean okay I mean we can
play the FPS has certainly improved it's
just under 60 but we're not gonna be
hitting 1080p 60fps even on the very low
settings so what I think we'll do after
this is we will overclock this graphics
card a little bit to see what happens
the problem is it looks like we're
playing through like a fuzzy filter if
that makes sense okay so all I did right
now is overclock be graphics card
seventy-five megahertz on the core and
100 megahertz on the RAM I'm gonna go
ahead and bump up the fan a little bit
too so that we don't get any thermal
throttling or any any possibility of
that I wanna keep the speed going and
you can see in the menu we already
jumped up to 68 now 720 that was
terrible I would rather game at the
lowest possible settings in 1080 than
even higher settings in 720 unless I had
a 720p monitor going down to 720 on a
1080p monitor is more it looks terrible
compared to just playing a native
resolution now this is not the exact
same map and that's gonna be what's hard
about testing something like pub G is
the fact that the maps are you know
there's different Maps but it's it seems
to be a pretty consistent gaming
experience and as you can see now in the
starting area we're sitting up in the
60s already
it's cuz we right we're on very low I'm
gonna change these settings real quick
see if we can't just go low and see what
happens
okay so low put us into the 40s 50s
someone go very low post-processing see
I bump this up right there so
post-processing seems to be a big hit on
the system right there unfortunately
it's not translating to as equal of a
performance increase in the game as you
can see we are down into the 20s so I
don't know how much that's gonna be the
airplane but make once we're down the
ground and all the textures have loaded
then and this is gonna be vram right
here all these textures popping in and
stuff that's gonna be highly vram
related remember we're only running two
gigabytes of vram in this feeling anyway
a lot of people coming right here oh
yeah okay yeah I don't like the
overclock alright so seventy-five
megahertz wasn't working on the core I
went ahead and dropped it down to 50 and
I reduced the member well let the memory
200 cuz I'm pretty sure the memory is
going to be fine so let's try that again
oh right here gunshots okay so yeah I
mean it looks like we're still chillin
in the upper 40s what would be great is
if I just killed one person just one
person that's all I ask
yeah we are still looking at the mid 30s
upper 40s and 1080 1080 with the minimum
requirements is not looking too good
know what wait client what were the the
wall right there and it was a big
opening all right one last attempt here
1080p very low yeah so even the very low
settings with this hardware is not going
to yield us 60fps I killed a guy Wow
sounds are all jacked up do you hear
that so obviously we're not gonna get
1080p 60fps
at any settings even with overclocking
this a little bit with the minimum
requirements so 720p 60 sure on low
settings if you have a 720p monitor
right so we're gonna do is we're going
to do a small upgrade to this machine I
could go straight to the recommended
which is a risin 5 1600 a 1066 gigabyte
or higher or a core i5 7600 it doesn't
even have an AMD recommendation for the
graphics card which is kind of funny for
the recommended settings doesn't have
AMD so what I'll do right now is I'll
just grab another graphics card
something that's not quite as far as a
1060 but we'll see how we this goes and
I'm gonna add another stick of RAM into
this to give it dual channel and kind of
see what happens remember we're on ddr3
here so I'm trying to avoid by going to
that next recommended is going to ddr4
because I know that's gonna increase the
cost of the system significantly given
the price of RAM and especially graphics
cards so the idea here is we have the
mindset of we had an old system that
were maybe found some Craigslist deals
and we're gonna try and give ourselves a
better gaming experience for not a lot
of money so our hypothetical system was
upgraded via Craigslist that's the idea
here you guys keep telling me to use
used parts in these videos so that's
what we're doing we added another stick
of matched Ram so now we have 16 gigs of
ddr3 running at 1600 and I upgraded the
graphics card to a nitro 380 X from
sapphire so this is a 4 gigabyte card
significantly more powerful than gtx 660
and we are running these same exact
motherboard cpu combo as before an FX
6100 on a 970 chipset but I pushed the
overclock even farther we have more
cooling Headroom so we pushed the over
clocks to 4.4 that's now giving us
nearly
one gigahertz overclock from factory so
the question now is can we now play at
1080p and regarding pricing of this
graphics card I looked it up I looked at
the price of 380 X's on eBay just like
anything else there's definitely some
fluctuation there's one up here for $400
that's way overpriced but I'm looking at
one right now for 229 so yeah there's
definitely some fluctuating prices kind
of the downside of when you're trying to
deal with used stuff as your results are
going to vary based on your region so
let's fire this back up and see what
happens already the system is much more
snappy just because of the fact that we
have so much more overclock happening
and dual channel memory dual channel is
probably the bigger upgrade here than
anything at least when it comes to
system resources well our menu FPS has
jumped significantly up to a hundred fps
so there's that I mean that's an
improvement I'm not gonna bother
changing the settings until I get into a
match though we've seen the menu doesn't
mean anything that's way smoother than
it was before holy crap there's nothing
like pub G C right now with the 1080p
low settings or very low settings we're
getting nearly 90 fps what I'm gonna do
right now is I'm gonna go ahead and try
and find some cover here in Iraq we're
gonna go back to medium see what happens
if we go meet him so where FPS looks
like it's sticking still in the 60s so
we're looking at 66 63 this is doable
this is very doable and I probably
should get myself oh I'm I'm so gonna
die I'm I'm so screwed alright let's see
how much we should get down here well we
at least yeah I'm so far out of the the
play area it's not even funny like on an
island practically over here I am on an
island geez so let's see what happens if
I bump this up even more so now we're on
1080 high let's kind of do a look around
to get everything to pop in and load the
loading new textures and looks like
we're sitting right around 57 58 not bad
so what if we go and take our settings
here and we take post-processing and put
that to medium
an anti-aliasing to medium so we gain
one FPS anti-aliasing very low not
really changing a whole lot I mean we
were able to achieve the 1080p 60 frames
per second on medium and high settings
right we're on high settings with a
mixture of high and medium and we are
actually getting pretty smooth
experience given the level of our
hardware I mean remember this is a this
is a very low-end CPU I know that some
people are not gonna like hearing that
but this CPU is dated it was the initial
architecture that launched the FX series
the bulldozer it was unfortunately
terrible of IPC's it just didn't really
live up to the standard and it is
pushing seven yes seven years old to
came out 2011 guys seven year old CPU
running pub G and we are getting a 60
FPS average here we're getting pretty
damn close to the 60fps number and I
haven't even overclocked the GPU yet so
I'm going to go ahead and overclock this
graphics card slightly and see if this
helps at all so I just overclocked it
about 60 megahertz it's nothing
incredibly you know let's go to 1150
bump the memory up to 1600 and we're
still going and we just crashed I think
the takeaway here is that if you go up
to the recommended and go with a 1066
gigabyte and then I 570 600 K or Rison
1600 you're obviously going to play
1080p high settings 60 FPS no problem
whatsoever the fact that we were able to
do it on this CPU and this much older
recommended hardware then hey there you
go shows pub G has come a long way
anyway guys thanks for watching today's
video if you have any recommendations on
games that we should do this with I like
doing this sort of testing I think it's
exciting and I think this is much more
realistic to the average gamer because I
think this PC represents more of what is
in the average home then obviously what
you see here in this studio so sound off
in the comments below guys tell me what
you think of today's video and what
games you think we should test thanks
for watching guys and as always I'll see
you in the next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
