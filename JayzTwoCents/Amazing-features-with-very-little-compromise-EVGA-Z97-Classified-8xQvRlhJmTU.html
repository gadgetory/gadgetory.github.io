you a video about the EVGA z97
classified now why the heck would I even
be interested in a z97 motherboard
well that's because when I was recently
in Paterson New Jersey and New York City
for business I went ahead and decided to
pick myself up a 4790k i7 processor
which is what you guys know we've been
waiting on for my personal rig update so
about further ado let's go ahead and
take a look at the z97 classified here
from EVGA now with this it comes with
all of the features that you would
expect with the z97 classified or
anything that carries the classified
name when it comes to EVGA but what's
cool about this motherboard is they
really didn't omit anything they just
kind of went alright let's go ahead and
cram everything in there that people
could possibly want and they did now the
classified has a lot of features on here
and we'll just highlight them here on
the box it does support fourth and fifth
generation socket 1150 processors now as
you know or maybe you don't and you're
about to find out
the 4790k is still a fourth generation
processor this is still a Haswell
processor but it is their fourth gen ii
they call it a second fourth gen
processor so fifth gen means that the
z97
is going to be 100% compatible with the
upcoming Broadwell release when I say
upcoming I mean it's coming in 2015 but
their next processor their fifth gen
processor though they're Broadwell will
be completely compatible with this
motherboard now it does have an
enthusiast they call it an enthusiast
layout and the reason why they call it
that is it supports 2-way Plus of
physics 3-way plus of physics four-way
SLI or crossfire X now if you've been
counting we actually have five PCI
Express lanes on this motherboard now it
does have four dimm slots
that's a twenty six sixty six plus I
guess that means it could handle three
thousand I'm assuming but has up to 32
gigabyte support six USB 2.0 six USB 3.0
six native SATA 3 six gigabit per second
ports
to Marvel SW raid ports has Intel Smart
Response for SSD caching technology if
you have an intel SSD and it has onboard
creative sound Core 3 quad core audio
processor it actually has a built in
quad core audio processor that is not
real tech everybody seems to be going
with real tech on their onboard audio
but this one actually has a creative
labs or sound blaster built into it
which i think is really awesome it does
have the noiseless passive cooling
solution so they ditched the lower fan
some of these EVGA motherboards had fans
on the lower chipset option there for
cooling and the it does have support for
the lucid logics and I'm not going to
talk about lucid logics it's more of
less like a software solution when it
comes to making your internal graphics
card do something on the chip or that
the processor I don't really use it so
I'm not gonna talk a whole lot about it
now let's go ahead and talk about the
physical properties of the board it is
an EI TX so it's a standard ATX length
but it has about an extra inch of width
on there and that inch could make the
difference of this fitting in your case
you need to make sure your cases are ei
TX compatible 5 PCI Express Express
slots as I mentioned you do have a 1 X
PCI Express right there 6 pin auxilary
power for the PCI Express Lanes if
you're doing your multi-gpu
configurations and you need more power
if you're doing high-end overclocking
that massive cooler here on the bottom
which is passive no fans so no noise you
do have your four dimm slots up here to
eight pin EPS power connectors here for
the CPU so if you're doing ln2 or
high-end overclocking you can get nice
clean power speaking of clean power you
have an eight phase-- vrm set up here
with a massive heatsink on there that is
connected by a heat pipe to the plx chip
as well as the lower chip here and you
do have right here on the side it's a
basically your voltage readout it has a
connector that plugs into there
somewhere here I kind of threw
everything on the floor this is actually
the third time I've recorded this video
camera problems if you know what I mean
but they plug into there they've got
pigtails that come off of it and you can
use those pigtails to put your voltage
meters in without having to actually
touch the pins themselves you have on
the side right here a an LED readout
which during post will give you trouble
codes if something goes wrong with post
and once you're past post it does turn
into a CPU temp
you're reading so it's always going to
show you your cpu temperature you have
right angle 24-pin power as well as USB
3.0 plus so this I think is great you're
not gonna have the plugs coming off and
making a crazy loop to get behind the
motherboard tray you just have a nice
right angle here rather than having to
have a funky Bend now you do have one
let's see one two three four five
I see five fan slots so that's more than
enough it looks like only two of them
though we're PWM which is CPU one and
two and then you do have three yes three
BIOS right here on the motherboard there
are three BIOS chips and you switch them
by using this little toggle right here
this 3-way slider so that you can play
around with the BIOS or upgrade one BIOS
and if something goes bad at bricks then
you just switch the BIOS and you're up
and running you're no longer have to be
afraid of doing a BIOS update because it
may crash on you or you may lose power
you'd still be up and running on the
bottom down here you do have color-coded
front panel connectors as well as a
built-in speaker now this is what I
think is awesome
many motherboards now have a speaker pin
out she can plug in exhilarating here
your post beeps this one that's built-in
and I haven't seen something like this
since the early 2000s because most
motherboards now don't put the beep on
there because when you hear your
computer turn on and go beep most people
think is like 1988 all over again but
that's awesome because the beeps are
important for troubleshooting so thank
you EVGA for putting the speaker on the
motherboard now guys this is also
featuring their ultra thick like PCB
design so it's very very heavy it's one
thing to keep in mind too now on the
back we do have quite an array of things
going on here as I mentioned we do have
creative labs sound right here two mini
display ports a CMOS reset button on the
back as well as right here you do have
four USB 3.0 two Intel Gigabit Ethernet
ports so you can prioritize your packets
by plugging in different routers or
different connections to this and you
have four USB 2.0 on the back these
creative also does have a optical output
right there now they put more gold
material into the socket for a better
action they've used their pasta they
call it pro Pross happen
camera but they call it their yeah pause
cap capacitors on here there's square
capacitors with EVGA logos on them
they're all over the motherboard but
everything on here is just built to be
very very high quality and very high-end
now something else I think that's really
amazing that this motherboard is the
accessories that they give you they do
give you a two-way SLI bridge which I
mean come on most most motherboard
manufacturers are doing that the state
these days so you have your standard
black two-way SLI bridge right there
it's black it's branded with a BGA you
are also given a hard 3-way SLI bridge
because it is compatible with 3-way they
go ahead and supply that because the
spacing on the PCI Express from
motherboard to motherboard is not always
exactly the same here is that so it's a
hard one that's a little PCB built into
that and then they also give you yeah
you guessed it a four-way SLI bridge
that this one doesn't have one of those
perforated like tear here thingies so
yeah a four-way SLI bridge right there I
mean look at that the only thing I like
about this one is it says primary up
here which I know they could have maybe
made a little marking that said primary
maybe in small where it says primary is
kind of ugly but that just goes right
there and all of your graphics cards you
know would be linked together wait for
your four-way SLI I hope you've enjoyed
this video
Vivi is an ebj motherboard let us know
what your experiences are down in the
comments section follow on Twitter if
you want to know more about what's
happening the project skunk works I tend
to do most of my updates on Twitter and
Instagram it's not going to be a
complete build log like red mist was
because I just want the time for that
this is my main system and it can't be
down that long so this is gonna be
basically building as fast as I can once
I start the project so there you go guys
the z97 from EB
fabulous motherboard as always see you
guys in the net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
