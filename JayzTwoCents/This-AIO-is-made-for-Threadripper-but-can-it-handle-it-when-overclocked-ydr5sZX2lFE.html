and we are going to talk about some
cooling of the Red River today because
why the hell not you've got it you gotta
cool it right level of your gaming
experience with the Corsair one small
form-factor gaming pc featuring
water-cooled intel seventh generation
processors m2 nvme SSD support and
liquid cooled GTX 10 series GPUs to
learn more just head to Corsair comm
frederick per actually comes with a
Sutekh bracket so you could take your a
i/o cooler is that you may already have
the round star style cooler anyway and
then you can actually mount it on to the
cooler here and put that on to your cpu
if you look right here the copper circle
it's obviously a lot smaller than the
heat spreader itself now admittedly many
people will argue well J doesn't really
matter most of the heat is right in the
middle anyway the point of this heat
spreader though is to do exactly what it
says spread the heat so anywhere we're
not actually touching is lost efficiency
and transfer and cooling which is
exactly what we want to avoid so that's
why enter max has actually come out with
the lick tech 360 which is a TR for
specific a i/o cooler but before we do
that we got to actually prepare our
setup here if you guys recall the last
time I tried to do this video is having
an issue with my socket is a Foxconn
socket on a gigabyte motherboard and
many of you guys were telling me no you
have to just kind of start the screws
then torque them down you're doing it
wrong the problem was I couldn't even
get the screws started unless I put all
of my body weight into it so I've got
another motherboard here sent to her by
asus thank you guys for helping me out
and as you can see this is the way it's
supposed to work this is not a Foxconn
socket this is a lotus lotus Lutz I
don't know how they say it but Louis I
don't it doesn't take any effort to
start these screws which is exactly the
way it is supposed to be three takes a
little bit of effort but there goes so
yeah it's one of those things where this
is the way it should have been so now
we've gotten started then we can torque
them down I'm often asked J why do you
do this on a box why don't you just do
it on the table well I do it on the box
because I need to allow a little
overhang for the tabs on the GPU to hang
off otherwise if it's flat on the table
the GPU doesn't fit in there very well
so that's why I use the
in case you were wondering okay so
here's the cooler right here the cool
thing is it is a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator giving us a lot of
surface area which is kind of important
when you got this mini-course is
remember well I'm trying to knock
everything out of the box thread Ripper
has a lot of course I mean it's kind of
it's kind of the whole point that's why
they call it the red Ripper let's see
we've got our three fans right here and
I'm telling you I know this is still the
biggest and heaviest pump I think I have
ever felt in an AI oh look at that thing
oh my god that is just massive and if
you compare it to the socket you can see
it covers the entire CPU now one thing
to keep in mind though is at least as
this ships this is only gonna work on
tr4 it comes pre-installed with the
brackets already on there because of the
size of this it probably won't fit any
other socket cuz there might be some
issues with neighboring components at
capacitors and standoffs and stuff but
yeah if you're buying this for tr4
chances are you're gonna be sticking
with it anyway I always like to enter
Max's radiator design because although
it's just a basic aluminum radiator like
you'd find in any AO they always had
this really nice looking shroud on the
side so if you take a look at this in
your case or you can see it and it's
actually pretty nice-looking which i
think is you know it's a good thing
we've got our triple fan splitter and we
have got our molex plug and then of
course we have our hardware if you've
installed any a i/o cooler on any sort
of Intel 2011 socket this is pretty much
the same style here this screws right
into the standoff threads which are
already on the socket itself and then
you just put the pump down and then you
use the spring-loaded
retention screws to hold it in place and
the spring is going to put the the
springs are going to put the tension on
it where it needs to be so you basically
just tighten it down to the threads stop
now disclaimer here because I've already
tried to do this video once when we
determined that the previous board was a
problem I'm not using the standard
thermal paste that was included with the
AIO so that is worth pointing out I'm
actually using the stuff I normally put
on my GPU blocks so
there could be a difference of a couple
of degrees one or two degrees usually
pretty minimal one thing I really like
about the radiators too is they have
these rubber standoffs right here these
rubber guards what this does is help
absorb vibration so it really is like a
work very well thought out a IO and ER
max has always been one of my favorites
they don't go the normal route if I mean
with a iOS which are always about
cutting corners and maximizing yields
they always seem to just I don't know do
it right you can find a history of my
like for inter max by just doing a
search because I've done a few videos
regarding there a iOS over the years so
the mounting orientation here is pretty
much a push config if you want to know
whether or not you should do push or
pull of course I've got videos on that
you can go and check those out
separately rather than us talking about
it now but not only does the radiator
have the rubber standoffs they have them
on the fans as well so it's such a
well-thought-out piece of machinery or
equipment the counter is a machine it's
got moving parts I'm gonna truth now to
see if this one works has no this Strix
doesn't have any surface mounted power
buttons so I've got to do this the
old-fashioned way
so right now we're using just whatever
the factory pwm curve would be on this
because this pump doesn't have any sort
of smart control it doesn't have like
its own software it basically just runs
off the pwm headers on your motherboard
so the fans have their own header and
the pump has their own header so that's
why I like to plug them into CW or Pete
CPU one and two because then whenever
you do to the pump it's also gonna do
the fans unless you want them to be
independently controlled you can do that
as well okay so we're using AMD risin
master here which I'm not a fan of I
don't like that software a whole lot but
it's probably going to be the most
accurate in terms of monitoring
temperatures so this is the 1920 X so
this is a twelve core CPU not the
sixteen core cuz that's being used in
the in the symbiotes build but here it
is right here you can see we've got
22.75 C currently on the core you can
see our various cores are all kind of
moving around
doing their thing like they're supposed
to but we do have one cord that will
turbo up to about 4.15 gigahertz this is
all out-of-the-box settings we have not
changed anything and then you can see
right here this is the just the windows
built-in thingamabob er so our our
performance what you might call it yeah
I mean I like to use the most technical
of terms around here so it's going to
take a look at some Cinebench right here
let's see how this does and yes I'm
aware that Rison master at least in the
past could actually affect performance
and scores I don't care about the score
I care about the temperature which is
what we're looking at right here so if
we take a look at temperatures see we're
steadily rising which is expected well
right around 40 see it really starts to
slow down as you can see that's really
respectable holy crap then our score
right there is a 2380 remember these are
all stock speeds so there's I'm just
gonna run it again I'm gonna run it back
to back to back I know this isn't
exactly the most efficient way of
loading up a CPU in terms of
temperatures but this is just one test
I'm starting with give you the fans
slowly speeding up so I don't think
we're gonna get too much hotter than
this because this temperature you're
seeing right here is what the fans are
running really low like the fans are
barely turning we're sitting right
around 43 C on the last test but you can
see under load all cores drop down to
3.7 gigahertz so of course what to do a
little overclocking because I mean why
not it's what we do around here
we overclock we overclock everything
even our toilets
let's look like we're gonna even hit 45
C right now at stock settings at least
using Cinebench repeatedly so we are
using the world-famous BMW blender test
you guys can download it yourself if you
want to test it but anyway where's the
start button I forgot if we get over
there render am okay so this is the
blender CPU test so also all of this
rendering is being done in the CPU which
means we are going to be pushing it you
know as far as we pretty much can't I
don't think we're gonna see the temps
really go up Joe another truth I really
don't think so I mean the memory is
sitting at 21 33
the cores are sitting at 3.7 gigahertz
across all 12 like if we actually hit 45
or 46 C I'll be surprised now I can hear
some of you already complaining that I'm
testing this outside of a case and
that's fine because you know what
there's note there's no case I could
grab that's gonna cover all of the
scenarios out there in the world right
now our environment is sitting at about
71 Fahrenheit and we are sitting in an
open test situation like this so that we
can see what the cooler itself is
capable of when we don't have any
introduced variables like poor case air
flow so take that for what you will if
you stick this in a case this terrible
air flow of course your temps are going
to suffer go check it out we hit forty
five point seven forty five point five
that is super impressive it really
especially considering we are talking
about an all-in-one cooler the air
coming through the radiator is still
cool too so we're not anywhere near heat
soak in fact want to touch the end tanks
right here they're still cool to the
touch yeah there's no warmth coming
through this thing yet so we are nowhere
near saturated now this cooler the
triple fat version 360 is actually
capable of 500 watts of dissipated heat
so that that is no joke alright the test
just finished and look how fast our
temps are gonna come back down check
this out
an important thing in too is that our
fins were probably not even getting near
50 probably right over 50% in terms of
duty cycles so I said duty I'm gonna try
to go all cores 4.0 it's probably gonna
be kind of hard to share a core voltage
I'm going 1.4 and then memory we want to
bump this up this math is hard for me
29:33 tube over 2 so we want a 1466
I guess now we'll see if we even post
I've never tried to overclock and rise
and master but seems easy enough okay
there it is so it doesn't actually take
effect until res and masters running out
which I guess is kind of neat alright
software level overclocking whatever
alright so let's go and run a test and
go
so the temps immediately shot higher
than I did before but that's kind of
expected right we're running 1.4 voltage
which is not even I'm not even sure if
we need that much but I'm just trying to
go for brute force fifty four point
seven five see on the cores and the fans
significantly ramped up as you can hear
but hey when you're overclocking the air
can we through them is still cold so
there is no soak on this radiator oh
there I go eaten up more I guess I'm
pretty impressed with the fact that
we've got 4.0 gigs stable on all 12
cores
it feels like thread Ripper overclocking
it's easier than then rise in there both
rise immuno enemy like the actual like
r7 arisin 7s rise in fives because it
seems like I've got to do a lot of
tweaking to try and get 4.0 stable on
those but here it was just clicking a
couple things and here we are running
4.0 stable in all 12 cores CPU or memory
is running just under 3000 and we are
sitting just under 60 C on the chip
which has quite a bit of headroom in
terms of t.j.maxx so we're doing pretty
good I like that the animatics the logo
lights up got a nice kind of an elegant
look to it I think we might hit 60 C on
the last part of this test right here at
59 point 5
fifty nine point six three nope we
didn't hit sixty fans ramp down temp
drops rather rapidly once we're no
longer under load so basically yeah if
you guys have got yourself a TR four
based CPU so that's obviously thread
Ripper X 399 and AMD and you're looking
to get the most cooling that you can
without going custom loop well you've
got to definitely check out inter max
I've got a couple of different versions
too this is the 360 they also have a 240
now they're not the cheapest a IO is out
there this one runs about 149 USD at the
time of making this video and the two 40
runs 129 USD which I guess is really not
that out of the ballpark when you
compare it to some of the other like
high-end a iOS out there it's definitely
worth checking out
yeah so I guess that's it for today I'm
glad I was able to finally do this test
now I got to figure out a build to use
with this system right here but we got
another high profile build coming up
guys you definitely don't want to miss
that we'll be introducing that later
this week but I'm gonna go tell me you
guys thought about the inter max tr4 360
the lick tech coolers I've always been a
fan of these as I said so definitely
check them out guys you can find links
on where to find those down below anyway
time to go thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
