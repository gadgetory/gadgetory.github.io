insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strapped in with Jays two cents as he
takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys Jays two cents here still
hanging out here at the cooler master
suite here in Las Vegas at CES 2014 I am
joined again once again by rajeev you
guys are gamers I'm a gamer now we're
going to take a look at dedicated gaming
peripherals here offered by Cooler
Master Richie what are we looking at
over here so you know on the other table
we had some of those gaming peripherals
kind of added into more of like you know
workstation environments and now we're
focused more on full gaming builds not
only the half stacker can do that but we
also have of course our cosmos SC which
is a much smaller case using the good
unique design but also built for kind of
the gaming outlook one of the big things
are going to focus on is our aluminum
series and we kind of showed this off
actually last CES and now it's kind of
coming to fruition this year you guys
can see just how long it takes some of
this stuff to make it to market well a
lot of the stuff we got a lot of user
feedback so we kind of went back to the
drawing board on a couple of things
redesigned things and one of the big
things that we really want to do is be
able to make these peripherals your own
not just using a cooler master product I
mean even on our mechanical keyboards
we've kind of hide it hide our branding
because a lot of people don't want that
gaudy look and now we've taken it to
another level where you can fully
customize it and so here's an example of
our mech keyboard using a CM storm
poults kind of design all over it so
this is something that he's gonna get
you know he won his starcraft 2
championship in america so you know we
gave him these plates and these are
customized for him excuse me so you can
use on all his gear now they come
normally they come just like the Reaper
that we looked at just a kind of
anodized silver aluminum just sort of a
it's not bear it's anodized so it's not
going to corrode or anything on you but
they are fully customizable with you can
you can put vinyl on them you can do
like carbon fiber sticker paint them
whatever you want to do with them yeah
and so like the Reaper is right here
with that you know customized you know
Paul
rest area you guys know I'm a schoolgirl
over this is still my favorite mouth and
then of course our pulse our headset
which I got to get your review of very
soon our modular headset which you know
really has strong booming bass sound but
also again that customizable aspect I
use these right now for a lot of audio
mixing and I absolutely analog or USB
it's a stereo and it uses an analog to
power the sub but it does use a three by
three and a half or sorry yeah
three-and-a-half millimeter for the for
the sound and you and a lot of you guys
have spoken up that you don't like USB
interface because you're then a slave to
the USB controller and however it's been
programmed so you guys can hook this up
to whatever sound card you're using any
pre amp or whatever you want so they've
listened to that and it's
three-and-a-half millimeter I'm excited
about that yeah and the great part about
is that you know we did sound test set
like gaming events like quakecon impacts
we just had people hey just check it out
and a lot of them were shocked at like
you know how good the sound and how
clear the highs are how deep the base is
so the pulsar has been around for a
while but you know people are still
barely catching on to it and we're
really excited about all the new unique
features and I'm sure we'll see a Jays
two cents version absolutely you get me
one you know you're gonna you're gonna
see that on there okay so moving forward
so you know this is this area is
something you've already covered the
mechanical key switch tester were very
familiar yeah so we do still sell this
for fifteen dollars you get a fifteen
dollar credit are you able to keep him
in stock now cuz when you guys put him
up there why 10 minutes and they were
gone the first time you mentioned it
they were sold out we did get a whole
new batch available so if you guys are
looking the way this works is you pay
fifteen dollars and you get a fifteen
dollar credit towards any cooler master
keyboard on our cm store website and of
course you know that's something that
will always want to push with the
educational aspect right and not only
that you guys will be able to let your
friends you know mess around with it so
if they're buying a new keyboard they
can figure out what switch type they
like because that's what's hard about
buying a keyboard especially if you're
going to be buying it online you can't
feel the switches you don't know what
you want to buy fifteen dollar
investment you get the credit back if
you buy a CM storm keyboard and you get
to keep the switch the switch tester the
big thing with that too is things like
the green switch and even the upcoming
clear switch we will have in a very
short limited run they're very hard to
find even in a store you're not going to
find them as easy
so this actually kind of leavey eights
that big for us and you'll be seeing a
lot a lot of retailers and people will
probably get this on retail shelves so
that when people are out there buying it
it's not just about you know even our
practice understanding and educating
people on technologies this just goes
back to the whole mantra of coolermaster
University at the end of the day for us
right now okay so I see a keyboard over
here where that's got blue backlighting
obviously we're looking at some blues
what is this it doesn't look like any of
your other keyboard line that we've
looked at I mean this is actually going
to be a software suite that we're going
to be demoing for you in a bit and what
it what it allows you to do is when
you're playing a game it'll actually
functional link all your components all
your cooler master components because as
I as I mentioned or if I didn't mention
it's a cooler master in CM storm we're
kind of blurring the lines now and
everything's going to fall under the
cooler master umbrella we're really
going to focus on just letting people
know that cooler master equals quality
and that's something that you have
confidence in so whether it's gaming
peripherals cases power supply whatever
and so this new software you know
codename fortress which will basically
allow you to control every aspect which
means when you load up a game like
Starcraft 2 you know your your dpi will
change your LEDs will change your your
bindings will change even the fan speed
will change and account for whatever
game you're running if you know it's
going to be like a battlefield 4 64
player version you can you know boost up
your fan speeds make sure everything's
running at full you know cooling
capabilities yeah custom profiles guys
based on the tasks that you're loading
up on your computer now is it going to
interact with your all in one color
units that you're putting out yes
absolutely so there's a lot of this is
again very early stages I think one of
the big things we're gonna want and this
is for you guys leave your comments we
definitely want to see what you guys
would like to see from software
functionality absolutely I mean I you
guys have to admit there's some things
here that you're seeing that are
directly related to comments that you
guys have made and without these
comments these these manufacturers don't
know where to go with some of the
technology until you guys give that
feedback so I guarantee your regime will
be watching the comments on these videos
so make sure you give your feedback on
what you see here today you've heard a
lot of you know early technology you
know very early stage but that's what
this is CES is the world platform for
emerging tech and you guys are taking a
look at it here at cooler master Richie
thank you very much for showing me your
product line make sure you follow us on
Twitter and Facebook
for all of your CES 2014 coverage you
don't miss anything and as always I will
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
