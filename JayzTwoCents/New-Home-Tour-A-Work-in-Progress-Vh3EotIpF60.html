know it's been a few days to put up a
video that's because I've been busy
literally with an army of people moving
my ass off ok let me make sense
did what it's so mom you really think so
if it's a white thing well she says it
gets the job done - ugh that's mom a
fractal design no - OH - it's not about
how big it is but all about how you use
it all right so we are in the new house
slash studio slash shop and one of the
reasons why we did this move like I said
as I needed more space and I completely
outgrew what I was calling my shop I
don't even have a shop actually I grew
what I was calling my office so we moved
it to a much larger place so I figured
what we'll do this video here is I'll
kind of take you a tour through the
house that you guys see what the new J's
- since headquarters looks like then
we'll go from there
I guess it's a man this place is huge a
lot of stress but I think it's totally
worth it to bring the channel upwards
and onwards okay so this is the French
the front porch area here you can see as
you come around comes all the way around
to the side it's a pretty decent like
size neon front porch area stuff that
you know get furniture for that
neighbors are getting some work done
anyways here here's some cutting wood
very desert friendly house so when you
come in the front door you there this
long hallway here that goes to this part
of the house and there's a baby is it
baby
hi are you eating the USB cable have I
taught you nothing so when you first
come in the house to the left here we've
got one of the bonus rooms which is as
you can see it's gonna be the kids like
playroom area nice wood shutters these
were to actually just installed before
we moved in on the right side over here
which is free you guys can tell we just
moved on this is gonna be the front
office area so it's gonna be the wife's
computer desk and stuff little Jays
computer desk my piano so it's going to
bookshelf with books and like a an area
to sit and read coming over here you can
see we've got a little hallway of course
where all the magic happens
at least one of them anyway and then we
have a mirror hi this is good to me this
gonna be the dining room right here
we're actually waiting on our dining
room furniture to be delivered we didn't
own dining room furniture because we
didn't really have a dining room a house
that was what we turned into the play
house or the play or the play room so
that's being delivered later today we'll
go upstairs in a minute this is what I
like to call the Harry Potter closet
right here because as you can see it's a
massive closet of its craziest closets
like the size of some apartments in
Europe so there's the baby right there
getting her PC on learning how to eat
keyboards apparently the whites getting
sick too great but here's that giant
couch we bought you remember this couch
barely fit in the other room and I
showed you guys that yeah gives you an
idea of the size of this great room here
this is a fireplace and then that's
where the TV and stuff is gonna go I
still have to install all of that here's
the kitchen again everything is just
completely in shambles but the kitchen
there and then this is gonna be I kind
of like a breakfast nook this small
table here eventually has a built-in
desk as you can see right here so I
think there's a light switch I think
I've dubbed this to be what's gonna
probably be the homework area what do
you think homework area is gonna be
there this is the washroom waiting on a
washer and dryer to be delivered with we
did again we didn't own any of our own
so we had to get new stuff there that's
the washroom this goes out to the garage
which obviously is housing nizzy right
now and then just other stuff out here
part of the racing sim is actually
chilling right there and that is going
to be hooked back up I'm really excited
about that that just goes into the back
yard right there which is a little bit
disappointing we show you the backyards
like I said it is a drought friendly
house so there's no grass in the
backyard at all you over here so we can
adjust it's just got more of that white
rock for the entire backyard so there's
no covered patio back here missed
opportunity if I bought this house
remember I'm leasing this but if I was
to purchase this house
I totally would have made a complete
covered side yard I probably would've
brought a cover out right here you know
a patio cover and brought it out the
side because back over that way would
have made a perfect like fire pit and
sitting area you know for like
get-togethers and hangouts and stuff
good lighting part of the problem is
there is absolutely no plumbing back
here there's no sprinkler system so
that's why they went drought friendly
like this the only water coming out here
as you can see is this bigot right there
and yeah I'm not gonna manually
you're not gonna manually water the
entire house and stuff I also looks like
I've gotta figure out what the hell they
were doing here with that that's all
sends I messed up right there really
won't figure that out that's like
totally threaded the wrong that's a male
thread no no female weird we'll figure
it out
then we here's that front courtyard area
like I said so here's where you can pull
in again what they're doing over there I
know what the neighbors are getting
anyway
you pull up right here as you can see I
backed in yes my Altima and then we
actually use this door more than
anything right there as kind of the
entryway into the home this single car
garage right here this is actually so
this whole thing right here is actually
gonna be my shop this is all the stuff I
packed up from the office cuz the rest
of the racing simulator right there but
I'm gonna put some shelves in here I'm
gonna get some work benches and desks in
here and this is gonna become another
set where I do a lot of the building
videos and the water cooling videos and
stuff like that so I have to keep
putting water cooling spills inside the
carpet and stuff so this is gonna be
kind of nice has a ceiling fan so I got
obviously decent lighting in here but
it's got a ceiling fan which is really
gonna be nice for the summertime
I'm can't even explain to you how
excited I am about that oh did I mention
the baby's walking now do that
careful socks on tile you plug down whoa
oh it's like daddy went after your drunk
TechTalk chickens oh really are you
doing the tour now okay I'll follow you
go I'll follow you let's go as well have
some fun well before the baby gates are
put up you're losing your pants kid what
are you from South Central it's gonna
take quite a while with one step every
15 seconds no didn't as far as you're
gonna go okay well she messes around the
stairs I'm gonna go ahead and head on up
so one of the things this house also has
is an upstairs loft slash family room
area
walking up them I know which is uh so
this is the upstairs loft area which is
also going to double as an another
family room with TV and couch and stuff
and I'm also going to pull out the
racing simulator up here we come like a
game room with the Xbox and all that
sort of stuff this way
is the master bedroom here's a hallway
for storage and stuff it's funny the
previous people who lived here left
behind some books and yeah I have no
idea what kind of monsters lived in this
house before us so here's the master
bedroom yeah as you can see mattress on
the floor everyone knows the story of
Bodhi first move you spend the first
night with the mattress on the floor for
the most part now obviously this room is
completely empty because we don't own
any bedroom furniture that was a stuff
that my parents left in the other house
that we just used and I'll be moved we
had to buy all new furniture so that's
why this move was so damn expensive
here's the bedroom bathroom I should say
big Oh deep tub not a jacuzzi tub kind
of sad about that but anyway it's got
jack-and-jill sinks but here's the cool
part check this out this is the master
closet you can see it's a walk-in it
kind of goes all the way around but look
at this check this out and this is what
I'm working on I'll do a video on this
too whole network patch panel yay so the
whole house is already pre-wired with
cat 5e yeah I know cat 5e is not cat 6
or cat 7 but I don't need any more than
a gig over the line I'm not doing much
on the NASS maybe in the future I'll
figure something out maybe I'll run dual
lines to the rooms but this is pre-wired
so I'm not gonna rewire the whole house
but anyway yeah I'm gonna be doing have
to do like a 20 port switch and I have
all that right here try and mount it
neatly to the wall somehow maybe mounted
to a board paint the board white mount
that to the wall they'll be a lot easier
that way
here is it the shower as you can see
it's nicely well drop this open okay
check this out here's the shower it's
actually really long can't really tell
it's pretty long as I shower head
and standard shell in it yeah bathroom
stuff whatever
there's the poop nap closet because we
can shut the door there not to smell my
crap gay literally you know to smell my
crap
so first room on the left over here is
where my quote-unquote office is gonna
be the room itself is not that much
bigger than the other room I recorded in
but I'm okay with that because in there
skunkworks they're always asking me
where's gunk works there it is right
there guys don't worry the light strip
falling down and everything because it
hasn't been sticking very good since
this is literally only going to be a
computer room I don't have to do all my
work in here I have to do all of my
building in here of the water cooling
stuff I don't have to deal with the
space that was being taken up in the
closet because I had the storage and
studio downstairs but yeah this is gonna
be pretty nice plus the window is not
gonna be directly behind me anymore so
this is gonna aid in some more natural
light I'm excited about that a baby
apparently has found the upstairs
bathroom oh she likes her privacy so
this is the baby's nursery and I
actually wanted this room first for my
office because of the amount of windows
in here and the amount of natural light
that I can get in this room the problem
is the way this house was built you can
see the walls in the corner have these
support beams there and there so my
corner unit desk obviously wouldn't be
able to go in either of those two
corners and these windows over here as
you can see are far too low to put into
that corner so I wouldn't been able to
utilize the shutters which kind of would
have kind of defeated the purpose of
picking this room because of the
lighting so I went ahead and gave it to
the baby's room plus it has these
halogen
you know track lights here built into
the lamp which would have been neat to
do some cool you know top-down real warm
lighting whatever little walk-in closets
in the bedrooms here little Jays room is
over here you can see we already Jerry
started setting up some of her toys and
stuff
she already has like this kind of like a
butterfly lamp thing which is kind of
neat so
a lot like a little kids room and then
again she has a walk-in closet over here
too which is kind of neat we didn't even
realize at first like what do you mean
all the small bedrooms have walk-in
closets that's crazy so yeah that's
where I've been that's why there hasn't
been a video in like almost a week now
literally have been dealing with as you
can see this was a lot of stuff to move
I like that I can just open these
shutters and bring in you know so much
light man it's crazy the amount of
lighting you see I got her
you know rasher it there I don't know
Raschi well but yeah the amount of light
just the space I don't even know what to
do with myself I am beside myself but
anyway remember I wanna bring you guys
the best videos as I possibly can so
when we were shopping and looking around
for houses you know some people are very
specific like the kitchen has to have
this or it's got to have this kind of
family room or this much square footage
the only thing I kept repeating was it
had to have plenty of garage space 1 to
work on the cars 2 to have a shop so
that I can do proper build videos and 3
it had to be friendly when it came to
the networking in the house as well as
recording space that was all I cared
about because this doubles as my office
that do all my work with this stuff as
well so anyway
that's it I'm gonna go ahead and get on
out of here hope you guys have enjoyed
this quick little tour didn't do much of
the vlogging of the moving process
because yeah one moving too would have
slowed me way down three I can't find
anything as it is so at least I kept the
camera safe right now I have no idea
where anything is like I don't even
found my toothbrush yet no no I had to
use like an one of my yeah two
toothbrush I use for my travel kit so I
don't get to use my nice sonic brush or
whatever alright guys thanks for
watching anyways we'll see you in the
next one I'm gonna get the shot bill as
soon as I can but I'm going to vlog the
building of the shop I'm going to vlog
the setting up at the network patch
panel because as you guys saw though the
wires just terminate into a junction
block and don't go anywhere it's
actually designed for the house to be
pre-wired and whoever owns or moves into
the house to deal with getting it all
set up to the switch and all that stuff
so we'll do that we'll do a video on
that I did test the internet speed 66
down 4.5 up so we get a little bonus
it's obviously not my 300 by 20 that I
was getting with Time Warner
but it's doable we'll make it work and
if I've got to bring in multiple lines
into this house to get more speed we'll
do that anyway guys thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next video and
until then I guess tweet me and stuff
alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
