Computex 2017 kicking things off here
with the EVGA day this right here that
I'm holding in my hand we're gonna get
straight to it it's something we didn't
see with the gtx 1080
but has made another appearance here
with the 1080 TI this being the kingpin
edition graphics card now I'm standing
obviously with Vince mr. kingpin himself
as well as 10 now I want to I want to
kind of have a quick conversation with
you I figured this card exists for a
reason you talk to us about power
delivery you talk to us about things
that are different on here that although
the card looks similar to something like
a founders or for the win three it has
unique touches on this that matter so my
question to you is one what is different
on here and why well basically this card
is designed to push this GPU to its
limit with basically no thermal limits
you know voltage limits and we have some
extra stuff on there like droop droop
jumpers which can help in the
fine-tuning of the maximum clock okay
show me real quick we got this
demonstration earlier and I thought this
was important you guys to see show us
what goes into taking something like a
founders based card to bring it to this
level
okay well Tim yeah basically like on the
far side like we take the founders cards
and we attach this crazy-looking a like
erm card so we can test all the power
limitations and find out what the
voltage is GPU can take and then like we
know okay for the overclocking needs and
like for even for the water cooling the
gaming what limits we have space limits
and them we implement all this knowledge
which we learn from the using founders
edition card into TP cards and then on
the less lower level
do I believe Garthim SD card so what you
see right here though in a more shrunk
down condensed version is present on the
kingpin charge yes yep so that's so when
you hear the internet say I'll just get
at whatever card they all overclocked
the same that might be true up to a
point but to take it to the next level
or to the extreme level though the power
delivery is obviously most important and
they've taken the power delivery that
they've implemented over there shrunk it
down and exists here on the for the win
subi for the kingpin card now we've got
three bios here right so we've got a
normal and OC n NL n 2 so Ellen 2
obviously would kind of unlock you into
this mode to be able to start taking it
to an extreme level so out of the box
this card is actually guaranteed 2025
now it's not going to ship with that
speed enable but you can enable that
speed and it's guaranteed it's the first
time the ebj is actually offered a true
overclocking guarantee with a number
attached to it on average though how far
have you seen somebody's get out of the
box on air cooling I've seen 2150 plus
Wow ok yeah not a single 1080 I've taken
a look at our 1080p is seen personally
has been able to achieve anything higher
than a 2088 so that's already showing
obvious improvements in the power
delivery what's the challenge though I'm
getting there um you can't have the card
overheating then it has to be cool at
you have to have like a cool environment
in a case yeah on a hot summer day not
the same kind of conditions that I have
here in my lab of course right now it's
got a pretty cool system here too we got
it like a closed-loop ln2 system so it's
kind of like water cooling on steroids
but it's Ellen 2 and he's actually able
to recapture some of that lnto after
it's gone through its phase so he
doesn't have to well let it all
evaporate you guys have seen those
cooling towers where they spill out it
just evaporates and it's gone so he's
able to recollect some of that but
you've got for how many gallons I'd be
saying they are 180 liters each Wow
capacity and how often you read three
Phillies um watch every week every week
to two to four tanks a week okay well
you know I look forward to seeing this
car once it's available I don't know if
we have any kind of timeline on that yet
we'll update as we know more but yeah
this card is is pretty cool now I asked
the question upstairs and I notice that
kingpin cards always have many DV ports
or CV mini display ports on
not full-sized display ports but when I
asked the question and I got the answer
I felt really stupid so that you can go
a single slot if you're going to take
the air cooler off anyway but they are
obviously three mini DisplayPort and
HDMI 2.0 we've got our DVI back on there
now the back plates got something cool
to wear it actually has their RGB flow
or flow RGB design where they are the
LEDs on the back you can't really see it
here because again it's not a full
production card the LEDs will actually
give like a flow effect as the power is
going through the part right that was
the idea behind it yeah the concept is
like sort of input to IO to sort of
close people yeah each of the RGB LEDs
controls individually so we can actually
control them set different color
different brightness and we'll see like
different dynamic does it so that's
pretty neat so it's not just aesthetics
it's actually getting a little bit of a
lesson of how power flows through a car
something else is different here too is
we actually have our PCI Express power
on the back of the card so when it's in
your case like this sort of making like
a clunky 180 degree turn you can just
make a nice pipe 90 into a case if it's
in there or if it's on a test bench then
you can just plug it into it on the back
as well something else to is it does
have copper plated heatsink it's very
heavy if you guys have ever held a
kingpin card you would know that they
are significantly heavier than even like
for the wind cards because of the
additional copper on there and we've got
some same similar designs like the four
two and three we've got the pin fins on
there we also have probes right here
that you can plug in for monitoring
things like voltage and temperature what
else can you monitor off this well this
one is just the temperature for that
voltage ship so you're going to see the
G fuel this primary voltage and also
like by both elbows if you guys didn't
know software voltage monitoring is very
inaccurate so this is something that
allows you to hook up a multi monitor to
and you can monitor things very
accurately on the back here when we got
in this place we also have here the Eva
bus connector so anything you can use
but dongle to adjust the voltages and
also have the status LEDs so they will
show you if the voltages are okay then
all the 5 LEDs will believe and we can
also use the interface connector which
will help our upcoming software how to
actually modify different car settings
like monitor all the temperature
settings so including like even go into
the Sub Zero like for extreme
overclocking and water so we will
actually get you read the information
through the header not to the BCAM
you can do either way so because like if
you have the just legacy system then you
can have to use a PC interface but if
you want to have extra controls which
gives in color card provides the MU
using other M you can just have the
cable going to the motherboard they're
very great all the data well there you
have it guys if you notice that the
kingpin card name was missing in the
latest generation well it's back and I'm
with the man himself thanks for talking
me today no problem 10 nice new as well
and I'm gonna go ahead let him get back
to his a extreme situation here also to
these shows I have to show that this
controller this is this looks like a
mortal kombat right like a arcade
controller but look at this shows a show
method this it is actually or it was 360
controller we modified this last year
for copy text actually and this can run
up to 4 GPUs and one CPU we have these
buttons to activate the battle flow all
the lm-2 annually so this is your Alan
to controlling pretty much yeah Wow
see I tell you guys all the time I don't
do anything cool these guys do cool
stuff
no pun intended alright let's go thanks
for talking this guy thank you
alright we'll see in the next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
