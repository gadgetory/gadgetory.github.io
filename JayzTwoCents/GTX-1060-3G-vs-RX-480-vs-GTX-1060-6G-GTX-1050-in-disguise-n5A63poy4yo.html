card around the 250 to $300 range you
can get a lot for your money right
around there there's a fierce
competition taking place between the gtx
1066 gig versus the RX 488 gig what
happens when you throw another card in
the mix meet the geforce gtx 1060 again
only this time it's got three gigabytes
a little bit less cuda cores at eleven
hundred and fifty-two verses twelve
hundred and eighty of the bigger six
gigabyte brother but it's got the same
1500 six megahertz base clock and a 17
hundred and eight megahertz boost clock
the one we're looking at today is the
gaming x variant from msi but as you
would expect from my board partner this
one's got a custom PCB and eight pin PCI
Express power slot and it's got a little
extra oomph under the hood at an 1835
booze clock so what happens when you put
another graphics card inside the space
it's already got fierce competition I
don't know let's find out
so if you found it kind of surprising
that the three gigabyte card with over a
hundred less CUDA cores and half the
vram was actually performing just
underneath its six gigabyte bigger
brother then you wouldn't be alone and
actually gave the R X 480 a run for its
money beating it in all dx11 titles I
have ashes a singularity back into the
lineup because I tweeted that I was
having some frustrations with it I've
mentioned it in previous videos that I
couldn't get it to work right and that's
because I am a freaking idiot every
single time two things were happening
every single time I loaded a card in
there it was resetting all of its
settings back to recommended and so it
was constantly changing things based on
the card that was in there that's a good
function to have if you're not trying to
benchmark if you just want to put in the
card in play that's a great thing but I
had to go back and manually set
everything and I was a noob and wasn't
doing that something else I learned was
whenever you launch the game from inside
steam obviously it gives you an option
to run DX eleven or twelve at startup I
was selecting twelve obviously the
problem was I also have a desktop
shortcut that was loading dx11 and not
giving me the option to switch and I
didn't realize it so that's why I was
getting some really sporadic results but
anyway that's beside just thought I'd
share that because I was like I'm an
idiot I can't figure this out and it was
making me mad but regardless the RX 480
and DX 12 is definitely showing a total
disregard for Nvidia saying we can get
just as good performance if not better
because of the way we handle
asynchronous compute so which card
should you buy well I think you have to
ask yourself one question it's not a
very easy one to come up with answer to
but that being are you going to play
games that are going to be dx11 dominant
or are you going to bank on the future
of gaming taking advantages of things
like Vulkan API and dx12 where the way
AMD handles its
asynchronous compute shows that there
are some massive
gains to be had as long as developers
are coding for it that's the gamble guys
and that's the one I can't answer for
you but I will say I don't feel that
this card belongs in this space the
three gigabyte 1060 was shaped CUDA
cores as far as I'm concerned this is
the GTX 1050 one last thing you might
have noticed was I didn't show pricing
and that's because I never showed
pricing in the beginning and then I
started showing it and now I'm doing
away with it again because pricing right
now on these cards is stupid
you can it is really stupid you could
buy a $399 1060 right now because
they're not available so pricing is
inflated and the exact same thing is
happening with the RX 480
I don't know if there's just that many
more people buying graphics cards as
time around or the manufacturers just
aren't manufacturing enough of them but
all of these cards are pretty much out
of stock making pricing artificially
inflated so because I could not find a
solid baseline price I just decided I'm
going to show the performance and you
guys have to determine which card is
gonna be best for you on pricing because
I'm Tony right now as somebody who deals
with this every day I'm frustrated with
the pricing I cannot imagine what a
first-time buyer or even a newer buyer
is going through right now trying to
find the right card based on pricing
shame on the market shame on the
artificial inflation and shame on people
who are jacking up these prices trying
to take advantage of the limited supply
yes guys I know economics supply and
demand but still so this is the part
where you guys get involved sound off in
the comments and let me know if you
think this card makes sense or if they
should have called it a 1050 I think
they could have called it a 1050 made it
cheaper and it would have been that much
more impressive but instead it shares a
name with its bigger brother that has
less cuda cores and less memory which I
think only causes confusion amongst
people that don't think about
researching the card and realizing
they're actually buying something lesser
that shares the same name anyway guys
thanks for watching and I'll catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
