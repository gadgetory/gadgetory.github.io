message before we get into today's video
if you were gonna be in the Southern
California area or anywhere near
Temecula this Saturday April 28th then
head on down to Temecula and check out
camaro con there are gonna be hundreds
and hundreds of Camaros taken over the
parking lot and what is going to be a
really fun car show and I'm gonna be
there of course with the car you're
about to see in this video I will be
hanging out at the fast tech booth so
I'd love to meet you guys if you're
gonna be in the area come on by say hi
and see some really cool cars ones that
definitely make mine look like a chump
all right enough of that I'm gonna go
ahead and get started with the video hey
what's up guys Jase - since he and I'm
reading kind of a bonus video about cars
and stuff things that interest me other
than tech so if you're not into that
sort of video then this is probably not
the one for you what's up guys Jase -
since here and you may not know this but
I actually bought a new car you guys
know I had nizzy my 370z Nismo I still
have that car and it's still a track car
but I bought something new and I've been
tracking it and I think it's finally
about time I make a video about it meet
Ellie my zeal 1:1 Ellie get it Ellie
so I'm that guy that runs on the Nissan
challenge with my Camaro it's all good
unfortunately as with normal track days
somebody always has an issue this car is
still trying to get out on track it's
got a bad alternator normally not a
problem the problem is the way Nissan
installs the alternator on the bottom of
everything under brackets you got to
remove belts you gotta remove hoses you
gotta move all sorts of jam on the
other hand puts the alternator on top
takes five seconds but yeah we've
literally got four guys here right now
trying to get this alternator out
because it's a it's a shitshow
in terms of what's required so if you've
been following me on social media you
guys know that I take my car to the
track the 370z it's all purpose-built
mca suspension real high-end stuff
nothing rep on that car all legit and i
take it to tracks like chuckwalla Willow
Springs and I wanted to step it up and
there's one car that I always said I
really wanted to own ever since it was
announced last year and I bought it now
I understand there's a bit of a low
budget video but that's why this is sort
of just me and you guys talking at the
top of a Zeus a canyon up here on the
tabletop talking about this car because
I have already tracked this car twice if
you guys been following social media
like I said you've already seen pictures
of it you kind of seen pictures of me
tracking it and that's what the car was
built for I'm not the kind of guy that
can buy something that was meant for
something and not use it for that
purpose I don't buy trophy cars I don't
buy things to sit in the garage I bought
this I did the break-in and I actually
rolled over the miles to finish the
break-in at the track so we took the
chuckwalla
we did it's an amazing session at truck
wall all four sessions car perform
beautifully took it to Buttonwillow
yesterday which was Sunday if you guys
are watching us now Sunday April 8th we
took it to Buttonwillow of course I had
my coach Stephen Doherty I guess I'm
gonna put a link to his channel in the
description below he is a 2012 I think
it was GT Academy winner he is my coach
he's been teaching me everything I know
about driving profession or you know
right we'll put it that way driving the
car right and he's going to talk a
little bit in this video too about the
car but let's just say that this thing
is an absolute monster if you don't know
what this is this is a zl1 Camaro
that has basically an LT for
supercharged 6.2 liter with a one point
seven liter eaton supercharger on it
that was pulled out of the zo six
Corvette transplanted into the Camaro
with a Tremec 6-speed and an LSD
multimatic spool valve shocks everything
on this car built for the track the
tires on the front are goodyear eagle
supercar f13 RS which are a six d tread
where our compound or race compound tire
formulated specifically for this arm
changing hands missus formulated
specifically for this car 305 3019 in
the front three twenty five thirty
nineteen in the back and i've already
burned up the fronts that was a bad toe
alignment and whatever I digress we we
fixed it for Buttonwillow and obviously
performed well in terms of power though
factory at 650 horsepower 650 torque I
did stage one like immediately bumping
that up to 700 in about 715 we're
currently doing a stage 1.5 this month
month which is going to bring it up to
closer to 750 and almost 800 torque that
is a monster more power is never a
problem and I've been able to handle
this power on track absolutely no
problem whatsoever in fact this cars got
way more than I am able to give it just
even nobody took it out on track I let
me drive a whole session with it he was
a gt3 GTR driver for factory Nissan
driven EMSA and some of the most
world-famous tracks and I wanted his
opinion on it and that's what we'll talk
about okay so this is Steven Doherty you
guys might remember I did a video with
him when he took me out for my first
track day back in November of 2016
wow it's been a while obviously things
have improved so I let you talk for a
second like I told them I let you drive
for a whole session on this 20 minutes
25 minutes session or whatever and you
to preface this don't like GM yeah I've
never been a fan of GM cars I grew up
around like circle track racing where
pretty much everything is GM so you'd
think I would be a big fan but
pretty much all American cars I just
never really liked for whatever reason
so I've always stuck to Japanese cars
Nissan's right yeah that's kind of how
we met a Nissan challenge group exactly
but yeah I mean this thing they
definitely are light years ahead of the
older older Camaro stuff like even the
interior um you can still see some
little plastic plastic and cheap GM
stuff but a lot of Alcantara yeah a lot
of Alcantara which I think kind of seats
that are yeah the Recaro seeds that are
great for the street but you do move
around in them a bit in the track yeah
once you get a helmet on yeah the grass
pushes your word and I mean this thing
is such a monster the g-forces are just
throwing you around too so yeah so what
are your thoughts sent on the setup
because member this is with the
exception of flipping the camber plates
180 which is a feature of the car it's
all the stockmen multimatic spool valves
it's the stock although the last session
wasn't the stock front tires I burned
them up you guys probably saw on Twitter
me looking for tires last second we had
some mostly burned up supercar three
hours in the back mitts mismatched
compound but you still sent it so what
how do you feel about the way the car is
set up yeah the the engineering that
they did behind this car is incredible
like to see that level of engineering
out of an American car is it's like it's
good it's refreshing but man they they
have done so much of this car like the
dampers are amazing the only way you're
gonna get dampers that good is to have a
half a million or a million dollar race
car you know yeah the dampers are
probably a good chunk of this price of
this car yeah be honest I would I would
think they're at least like a $10,000 I
was you hear everyone complain on the
street you know the car and driver
reviews you know and Rodan track they
complain it's too rough for the road for
the street it's kind of funny how that's
true right it's not something gonna fall
asleep in but on the track it's just it
really comes to life yeah and it makes
the car all come together and make sense
because the last thing you're thinking
on the track is this is rough because
it's not yeah it's it's perfect and the
the dynamic adjustable you know that's
what the spool valve is all about
dynamically adjusts has a completely
different damper rate at slow speed
versus high speeds which meant when I'm
curbing something at 110 miles an hour
it's not throwing me up out of the car
it it absorbs the bumps really well and
doesn't translate it to the entire
chassis moving yeah so it soaks those up
extremely well that the platform stays
nice and level and man it it's really
like I said refreshing to see this level
of engineering on an American muscle car
basically what about the arrow
cuz GM's not really known for arrow
right and like you know I've raced some
GT cars and done some prototype testing
and stuff like that with real down for
us obviously it's not gonna be to that
kind of a level no there's no LMP car
right but the thing I think you can feel
the most is the fact that it's not
actually lifting like a lot of
production cars have lift believe it or
not at speed so this might only make a
little bit but you it really helps if
that plus plus a lack of lift that is
giving you the true down exactly so your
brakes the downforce isn't fighting the
lift so your brake zones are way more
stable you can brake harder later at
speed the higher speed corners the car
stays nice and planted like you said
earlier I'm not a big fan of American
cars but maybe this starts to change
anyway guys yeah so he's got a channel
it's called that racing life I put a
link in the description below we talked
a lot about a circle track racing that
he's does like extreme budget racing
people think you have to have a ton
of money to go racing you don't Steven
really shows that but you also want to
see some onboard ride-along stuff with
the real high-end he's got that too so
there's a link down below if you guys
wanna check that out
one Elise stands for the track pack
that's their MPO code so basically one
le is available on the LTS the SS is
obviously the ZL ones and that basically
means it's got a lot of track oriented
upgrades to it so in this it shares the
exact same six piston or yeah six piston
front brakes as a CL one same 4-piston
rear brakes obviously they're Brembo 390
millimeter rotors in the front huge
rotors but it has something
significantly different than the other
Camaros and that is Aero you'll notice
the big canards on the front it's got a
bigger splitter on the front the same
side splitters you'll find on the
standard zl1
but it's got a large high-rise
carbon-fiber rear spoiler that the zl1
standard doesn't have its overall the
same shape the zl1 sits more like on the
on the lid of the trunk but this
actually brings it up better into the
airflow there's not a whole lot of
difference you could tell on the outside
also there's different wheels or 19-inch
wheels 20s which you find on the
standard zl1
they're much wider they are 19 by 11 in
the front 19 by 12 in the rear because
of the size of the tires that are on
this but something else i did to the car
that i forgot to mention is i did do a
muffler delete doing a full exhaust on
this car is not something that really
picks up a lot of power but the stage
one-and-a-half that we're doing picks up
power because of the overdrive pulley
for the supercharger it's already got a
poor two throttle body it's already got
the cold air intake or not the cold air
it's called a cold air intake even left
under the hood it's just a larger intake
diameter and where it picks up the air
it's a bit more free-flowing versus the
standard airbox which is about colliding
down the supercharger so the first thing
he'll notice on this car that makes it
that you can tell something's been done
at least to the intake is affect the
supercharger is so loud
it's also gonna have long tube headers
which is a part of the stage 1.5 and so
that's going to really open up the
airflow so we're over driving the
supercharger by 10%
putting the long tube headers which open
up the exhaust flow so the pressure
actually comes back down but the CFM
goes up so that's how we're making more
power that way but man I got to tell you
right now when it comes to the
capabilities of this car I never wanted
to own another Camaro my first track car
I ever owned we'll call it track car it
was literally just a shitbox Camaro to
say the least was in 1992 Camaro z28
didn't even have the 5.7 liter the 350th
5.0 liter which is basically taken out
of one of their old ass trucks back then
the 1500 trucks made no power 220
horsepower to the crank which was hard
to get a car made out of steel to get
going now obviously you guys deserve a
much more better produced video about
this but we did a nice drive today after
two track days I just wanted to share
the car with you guys because all the
support you guys have make stuff like
this possible a lot of you have shared
interest in seeing more about car stuff
track stuff my track experience the guys
I do track with and I want to let you
guys know we are actually starting
another channel that's gonna be focused
on that but not just myself the group of
guys that I track with are all gonna be
a collective on this channel so this is
going to be a group channel covering all
sorts of different things everyone's got
a different path everyone has a
different background a different budget
and we're gonna be covering everybody's
journey into this the guys that are
beginners Nick's a part of this
definitely as a beginner all the way to
Steven Doherty who has driven some of
the you know highest horsepower / track
oriented cars that you possibly can on
the most iconic tracks in the world so
we've got a huge range of experience
that this is gonna be about there's a
lot of car channels out there on the
internet most of them are focused on
either me me me or show cars or drift
which is alright but I don't do those
enough guys out there representing grip
which is exactly what we are doing drag
racing has a huge showing drift has a
huge showing but where's grip so that's
we're going to be doing no I don't have
a link for you today but trust me when
it's ready
that link will be shared and hopefully
you guys will come on over
follow our experiences on that but guys
I'm gonna go thanks for kind of watching
this little vlog I know that car stuff
isn't for all of you there's a lot of
tech in cars and that's why I have
underestimated the amount of you that
are also into cars and tech because I
guess they definitely go hand in hand
especially them out of tech in this car
to keep you from killing yourself when
you put your foot down then the it's not
ready to go straight and wants to go
sideways and there's a lot of tech
they'll keep you from doing that we're
also doing something with Audi there's a
TT RS that I currently have my hands on
right now too and we're gonna be doing
some cool videos about outies tech going
on in their cars so make sure you guys
check that out anyway like I said we're
gonna go thanks for watching guys we
wanna know more about this car head on
over to Twitter there's tons of pictures
Instagram as well and some of that
behind the scenes track stuff that can
be seen over there so guys we'll see in
the next one thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
