videos we're actually shoot one today
I hear me talking which is really
strange Phil Phil's editing if you guys
can't tell why am I wearing these when
this coming because that's what DJ's do
bro having a one year just one year with
its aluminum bezel solid construction
and adjustable base the vast 35 inch
ultra wide 100 Hertz VA panel for mass
drop offers performance at an affordable
price learn more about this drop by
following the link in the description
below so we discovered a neat trick
around here we discovered I when I
wiggle my butt around in this chair are
you ready okay so same thing with if I
go to the light switch alright so it's
this particular chair it's a vertigo
chair it's a mesh back and I'm wearing a
sweater in denim honest I am in the
autonomous chair that's right the
vertigo chairs no Phil sitting in the
vertigo chair it's right there so my
butt my butt was too big for that chair
okay check this out if I go to the light
switch you ready Wow
oh it's the ground screw oh oh what
it'll sound like touching the metal
bottle watch it like ruins my watch no
like I think I don't know I don't know
science because it's Spirit absorbed we
have not done any sort of behind the
scenes in forever what you smell you
smell my fart sorry why do I feel like
you just follow me around without your
air freshener so we have things to do
around here so we figured you we do it
behind the scenes we've got a lot of big
boxes we need to figure out what to do
with the shelf space what shelf space
exactly and if you look at the studio
behind me if there's nothing under NDA
back there I saw you stepped on a creaky
wood plank
Nik farted and it sounded like a wood
plank like so here's the thing I don't
like I don't like cluttered I really
don't like clutter I know I'm kind of a
head's a little cluttered but even if
you look up here like upstairs where the
offices are you can see the space up
here is starting to like we got more
chairs than we have butts I don't
understand why we have more chairs when
we have butts we also still have all
this foam right here this is sound
deadening foam kind of like what's on
the wall right here I don't know how
much this really helps the curtains help
the most but we have still the ceiling
up here and I want to have one of my
bounce boards which is like this guy
right here this board I want to have it
pop out above the ceiling right here
with that foam on it to help stop some
of the echo there's the exotic PC
giveaway computer right there that
winner one of the Taylor each was his
name that's gonna be going his way there
pretty soon that's our resident Nikolas
hi something else we did that I'm really
proud of is we got a lot of rigging up
into the ceiling above us so that we
don't have to constantly be tripping
over C stands and stuff like we've got
our hive light mounted right there the
other one is over there of course we've
got our rear lights like you guys have
seen in the past yeah Nick's gonna turn
em on they're all remote-controlled
so that's bright something else we won't
do today too is we're gonna replace this
work bench top because it's pretty
narrow as you can see so imma be adding
one of those IKEA countertops as big
thick pieces of wood or mounting it to
this thick wood yeah I said thick wood
so that's what's on the to-do list today
whether or not we get it all done hmmm
I'm thinking about replacing our bounce
port with our reflect my reflector but
our diffuser and shining straight
through it because it softens up the
light a little bit all the bounce
Lighting's good to do oh we should show
them how we cope with not having the
proper arm for now we did gaff tape
it's not really cooking very well I mean
it doesn't stay
it doesn't stay when you put it on to
the side it doesn't hold that's because
this is this is like cheap this was the
first rigging I bought of anything it
was off eBay for like a hundred bucks
and it was a three softbox light kit
technically that was one of them
but I've actually got proper studio
light in there now there's a lot of
trying to make things that were not
designed to do what you're trying to get
them to do involved in what we do Oh way
to go I really wish I had speed wrenches
here at this video this top will come
off with these these uh wood screws that
are going through the wood but the
problems we've got to or the far corners
are behind the frame I don't feel like
taking the whole top of a table apart
just to get to that to the floor 50% of
the way there Wow
let's turn it into a computer case wait
what done advertising your cobalt would
they ever do for me hey we're going to
finish it now hey yeah we're probably
gonna buy some more rigging like this
right here because I want to bring
things here in that general area Sophie
off-screen I do too is get more shelves
for our AV rack Mike we've showed before
in the past like all the public gear we
use to make videos these crappy ass
videos we use really good stuff for bad
videos but you can see what the weight
with all of our lenses this stuff alone
is like causing this to droop so I don't
think we want to drop all the lenses no
now I know he said in our last little
like periscope we did if you guys saw it
that we were talking about buying or
leasing or whatever a bigger space we
kind of put that on hold we're gonna do
the best we can with what we've got
because obviously we've got we've got
Phil now say hi there's a hand we
decided we're just gonna put money into
our human resources and better the team
rather than better the space because
what good is having all this space if
I'm still being you know overworked by
being editor camera guy and all that at
the same time the team is growing we
decided we're gonna make our space a
little bit more user friendly which is
why we're now heading to Ikea to get a
new high density wood countertop and
we're gonna head over to get some new
rigging and stuff for our overhead so
anytime we leave the studio usually we
get in some sort of trouble so who knows
what will happen this time I won't be a
part of this there won't be me so it's
2018 and I don't know why this isn't
better connecting this sort of is sort
of like you think out of all the tech
problems this would be like the easiest
thing but no and then the it'll drop out
I don't know yeah automaker's tiresome
you is successfully paired again I'm
actually surprised that let you pair
while we're driving we're stopped that's
like oh my gosh
you ever wonder who Sam is selfie
lighting ok so what are we doing here
because we don't know we're dude unless
nikka ready to this intro which would
make this pointless right now yeah so no
one tells me anything here that should
see imagine paying more imagine more
profit buying food at $10 that's
expensive me photography automotive
Chapman wears on a camera buddy like
that but I will haggle or happy he has
more stuff for this video to run into
see Nick if you buy this
26 inch flexible soft box kit so Jade
just made a focusing joke about Nick's
focusing ability but I mean the first
video that I shot officially the top
comment was like Oh lol autofocus errors
so technically I guess that crown goes
to me let's trust
they just walking slim up because I'm
shooting in real time
so I thought I got a lot but dude what
the the power's out back home so this is
survival okay see case in point
Edison just called and said now our
power will be back on until 9 o'clock
tonight it is currently 2:30 p.m. I
could starve to death in that amount of
time but not now you both a while you're
not gonna be playing the night
[Laughter]
I've been saving this forever
I mean he does kind of own a studio
though so that's just finally now a
McFlurry I didn't read the Sun ice
machine is broken
yeah and I wanted to look for it I
didn't read the sign the ice cream
machine is broken either we were walking
with their bit buttermilk chicken strips
mirror made with real butters
[Laughter]
there's no nervous Nick does not exactly
move quick on his feet you'll learn this
where you going I'm thinking I want ice
cream you want ice cream tears to
Millennials least we're not tight pods
yeah cheer lady worth fidget spinners ok
confession
the motion is
I'm gonna this video sponsored by v3a be
cool piece of wood it doesn't think that
would stop there you have you're wasting
James footage dude he's gonna have to
import all this dude safety first back
one you can build a computer but can he
build a desk safer already
today on Beakman's world yeah okay I
guess do right I just wanted to
double-check okay so I'm gonna end this
vlog way I started it with me holding
the camera go home Phil go home Phil its
sole it over here
oh I said it's lit I actually meant that
is a lot of light this this watch with
all those lights I said go home why
going upstairs oh no it's my computer
now okay so waiting as much done as I
want it we bought the stuff we needed as
you can see right here on the table
where are these here dude science here
system
this takes a lot of trust don't come
down here they have that feel save
yourself all the light is so bright one
of the reasons why I wanted this
tabletop on here those it gets more
texture and color anyway you guys been
asking for a behind-the-scenes or a vlog
or something for a while so that's it
we're gonna go starting to rain here in
California which means the apocalypse is
upon us so we're gonna go of the seat
shut up now all right we're gonna go
thanks guys let's see in this bye
