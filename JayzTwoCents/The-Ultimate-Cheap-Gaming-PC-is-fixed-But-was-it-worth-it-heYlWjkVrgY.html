this video we should it was just the
other day where we were getting crazy
artifacting and all kinds of problems
with our 2200 G based extremely cheap
gaming PC well we have fixed the problem
here we're going to talk about that and
then we're gonna get into some of the
performance metrics of how this computer
performed and whether or not I recommend
it remember the whole point of these
videos is to try out these combos and
see if they work and whether or not you
should go and buy it but first you
should listen to this message from our
sponsor you know in hindsight was
probably a bad idea to bet the car I
told you never bet on red never bet on
red didn't just say he's gonna help us
out where is he anyway I don't know all
I know is he said that we would know
when he was close
how are we supposed to fit in this I
have actually an idea we can do it's a
v12 yeah it's a nice car sir that's what
you're saying right now
now no it can't be quiet dude I got you
covered
everything needs in the trunk J front of
the car
what the heck am I supposed to do with
the mesh if I see mini dude it's like
the mesh if I see mini no it's stuff you
can fit in there
you'll get it figured out
you know what I got an idea so go into
settings and check our video make sure
that we are fullscreen and there is it
keeps showing this crazy resolution
though 1440 by 560 that's not the
resolution we're actually running
running 1600 by 900 and then we hit
confirm and we go back it still says
1440 but I think that's some sort of bug
I don't know anyway besides the point we
fixed the issue now a lot of you guys
were giving us a lot of your own
particular solutions of what you thought
they were now hardware wise we ruled
everything out hardware wise we we
switched the motherboard which we
thought was the problem wasn't the
problem it persistent we tried different
rim because ap use use system memory
shared system memory to give you the
vram that you need for your apu to work
try a different Ram that wasn't it tried
putting in a graphics card and it worked
fine which was pretty much expected
because that's a completely
self-contained video processing unit
which obviously took the APU out of the
equation when we tried a different CPU
the problem persisted so what we ended
up doing also was thinking ok this is
Gabbie software related we tried
reinstalling Rison master we used edu to
make sure that all of the drivers were
uninstalled reinstall it problem
persisted to go to AMD's website
download their latest driver problem
persisted until Phil Phil had an idea of
just doing basically a search and trying
to find out if anyone else had these
similar problems of what we found was
1803 Microsoft Windows 10 has always
been this seems to be the root of
everyone's problem these days and the
latest adrenaline driver were having
some sort of a problem but it wasn't
always the same games like some people
are problem pup G's people have a
problem fortnight obviously we were
having the problem in csgo and in Friday
the 13th and what we found is if you go
to AMD's website here we're gonna do
this real quick so to go drivers and
support and you go over here to manually
select your driver as you would expect
we download APU processor with graphics
we select here our desktop APU processor
with graphics and then if we go over
here select your product rise and 3
processors with Radeon Vega graphics
which is what we've got and we're using
Windows 10 64 bit it's the only option
requires Windows 10 but you'll see right
here the adrenalin Edition 18 point five
point one
we found we downloaded this and
installed it it was downloading
technically not the latest version of
the driver so so Phil actually found
through a search if we did a Google
search for q2 2018 adrenaline driver is
now available with support for the 2400
G so we went there and that brings up a
Twitter post where AMD actually mentions
it so then if you go to this download
link right here this bit Lee when was
this put up this was put up May 18th
if we go here and download now the
adrenaline Edition q2 20 18 release
notes and then download the actual
driver that's here and we will link to
it in the description that solved our
problem but what's funny as we found
that when we then installed it and then
did an automatic you know search for the
latest driver it actually recommended an
older driver than the one it was
actually trying to install so AMD itself
has still not like updated the page I
guess to recommend this driver but this
driver fixed our problem so I was a long
way of saying it was a driver issue but
the problem was downloading the latest
driver from the list was not bringing us
to this one okay so here we are now with
our 2,200 ger eight gigabytes of Patriot
ddr4 and it is overclocked to 3.75
gigahertz and our memory is running 20
800 megahertz I believe it is and we are
going to use an AMD Rison master trying
to squeeze out maybe just a little bit
more performance the 2200 G is like
literally the bare-bones bottom of the
bottom entry level way of getting into
gaming and the idea here was if you have
a limited budget can you build a system
that you can build upon without it being
like completely obsolete by trying to
add things like a GP or whatnot so our
temperatures as you can see are running
really good rolling sitting in the 25.7
and we are running the stock cooler if
we go into game mode as she crashed on
me at 1250 which is unfortunate so I'm
gonna go ahead and back this down just
to like 1200 because that gives us only
at 100 megahertz overclock which is
probably not going to be very noticeable
but the problem is when I apply this it
needs to reboot the system
and that's sucky it didn't always do
that so no way it's a weight but if we
look at the driver version even here it
just says adrenaline q2 2018 it doesn't
actually give you a driver number I
think I might show it in actual Verizon
master or even Radeon software you can
see we are running twenty eight hundred
megahertz memory because it's 1,400
times to write DDR double data rate so
let's go ahead and start up Friday the
13th video settings again that
resolution is very odd we're just gonna
leave it it's being dumb
we're gonna run here anti-aliasing
medium we'll just run the medium preset
how's that that'll work works for me
confirm we'll try this one out basically
I gotta kill people and I get bonus
points for doing it with various
objectives meaning don't let them see
you trap them in a trap push Chad's face
in the fire really a wholesome family
game so you can see the little cutscene
we're only getting 22 fps 1917 okay
maybe we'll try low settings cuz that's
already pretty bad this Jason looks dumb
this is playable fps though oh she
duped me should you be like every other
woman I've ever chased with an X all
right so mid-40s appears to be roughly
our average all right so we're in doom
if we go to our settings sure we might
be seeing 50 FPS up here we're here
running 1600 by 900 everything is like
off low 100% resolution scale Phil's
suggesting we drop that down like 70 but
we'll see how this goes
everything is low low low trilinear
NSA's off so I mean it's playable is
probably gonna be subjective at this
point FPS is like I said sitting in the
40s
the CPU can handle it this is clearly
just GPU as being really really pushed
hard so I'm going to try an older title
now I'm gonna try Middle Earth shadow of
Mordor this is a game that was
definitely hard to run in its heyday but
it's been a few years since this has
come out now we are at medium settings
at 1600 by 900 native resolution but as
you can see in the benchmark track we
are again down into the 30s 33 what
makes low FPS terrible as the
fluctuations same thing with high FPS if
you have really high FPS but there's big
swings of a fluctuation then that would
obviously portray as a bad experience we
had an average of thirty six point seven
eight a minimum of 25
a max of 50 so we're gonna go ahead and
switch that to low and see what happens
so we went up to a average of 48 Oh too
so yeah we gained about 10 FPS or so
across the board a little bit higher a
14 on our max what I would honestly
recommend at this point is the the CPU
is great it's really not bad at all
400 bucks and you can play something on
it if you want to play side-scroller
games or like indie games from Steam
this would be able to do it all day long
without a problem if you're starting to
get into modern or even modernistic
titles titles that are running on
popular engines like unreal or even doom
as you saw which is normally pretty
lenient with low-end Hardware was still
giving us a little bit less than
desirable experience with the 2200 G
that is overclocked 100 megahertz right
now so what happens if you were to just
save a little longer go mow some lawns
donate blood I guess you would have to
sell it if you just gave it away Inc
anything for it that's not gonna help
your build you get what I'm saying here
I'm gonna put in a gtx 960 right now
that we were able to find for about 80
bucks to $100 used on Craigslist or
other forums like overclock net places
like that you could find these GPUs
usually all day long and let's see what
our performance increase was with the
same hardware but just throwing in a GPU
which in my opinion would be the next
logical upgrade path so this is the msi
gtx 960 gaming this was actually my
dad's GPU and this was a GPU I highly
recommended at the time that it was new
it I still recommend it honestly all the
way up to 1080p gaming at medium to high
settings depending on the titles but
that's one of the reasons why when I did
this and my rationale and the parts that
we chose was why I didn't want to go
with a super low end power supply simply
because now we can actually run this
because we have enough power supply
power to go with it that's why we went
with that 500 watt power supply from
EVGA so now I can toss this in there
it's not gonna have any problems being
powered by our power supply because we
have PCI Express power plugs and now we
are gonna get an immediate increase in
our gaming performance by simply
plugging in this guy so the 960 is
installed and the nice thing about
having a discrete GPU is the fact that
we can over
because the APU you can't overclock with
MSI Afterburner you have to use AMD
risin master or the BIOS and it's super
picky but here I just did a simple plus
100 on the GPU core plus 250 on the
memory bumped up our fan speed so now
we're gonna go ahead and jump back in to
Friday the 13th and play the same titles
that we just did and we're gonna compare
the performance which is obviously get
obviously going to be a lot higher
because remember 1600 by 900 resolution
at 960 can handle at 1080p without a
problem but it's just going to decimate
1600 by 900 no problems whatsoever now
these are the same exact settings we
left off with with the APU and already
in the menu you can see we jumped up to
a hundred and twenty plus fps it set
itself up to high remember we were at
low when we were getting the 40-ish FPS
now we're at high literally fps a
hundred and fifty ish in menu much
smoother already a little bit of dip
obviously is a lot of particle effects
and stuff happening there but clearly a
much better experience all right well
obviously we proved our point Friday the
13th so let's head over to doom so we're
on the Vulkan API still overall quality
high and anti so tropic filtering 4x any
sitrep any any sub anisotropic and this
and so tropic that thing is set to 4x
and if you look at our video here you
can see here's our resolution we have
XFX AAA on which we did not have before
yeah look at the FPS already 19 DS it's
super smooth
there is absolutely no rubber banding as
like before where it felt really kind of
wobbly and jello II medium settings 100
FPS this is the one that we were only
getting 30s mid 30s on the Jassi apu and
then we went to low which gave us you
know up to like the 42 or 48 average FPS
as you can see right now we are getting
more than double that I think we proved
our point here the 2200 G was able to
get us started but I highly recommend
adding a GPU even if it's something like
an Rx 460 the 2400 G is a significant
jump over the 2200 G I have other videos
you guys can check out the 2400 G just
go to my channel click the magnifying
glass type in 2400 G you
and plenty of instances where we used it
and tried it out it's a significant jump
over the 2200 G I just feel like the
parts I chose on this probably not the
best way to spend your money I feel like
you need to add a GPU in fact it might
even make more sense if you're going to
save up for a GPU just save up that
money by a risin 1200 which is a little
bit more powerful on the CPU side just a
little bit then a 2200 G and then you
won't have an APU just sitting there
doing nothing when you do add a discrete
GPU like this now it doesn't matter what
GPU you add even something like an Rx
460 or an old 750ti or something like
that in my opinion is going to be a
better gaming experience than just
relying on the 2200 G because although
decent still definitely lacks in terms
of the performance I was hoping for it's
not a way I would spend my money again I
would definitely would add a graphics
card to the build if possible also don't
go with a 320 board I mentioned that in
the comments of the last video and the
link of parts go with the B 350 or
better better overclocking better build
but anyway guys we're gonna go do me a
favor if you did an ultra cheap build
comment down below with what your build
was and what you think the performance
level is and how you like it because it
helps people who are searching for parts
make a better decision also look in the
description below you guys will find
links to other things like affiliates
parts discounts on various items and
stuff that we've kind of worked out for
you guys and also if you're new around
here watch hit that subscribe button we
would love to have you join our
community because I think we have a
pretty good one so we're gonna go guys
thanks for watching as always we'll see
you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
