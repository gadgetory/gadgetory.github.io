Jays two cents and if you're building a
computer any time soon and you have to
fit a lot of stuff in a small case you
don't want to miss this
if you're like most people out there and
space is a serious concern when it comes
to building your Tower this is gonna be
a very full-featured case that comes in
a very small package it's got lots of
fan support you can fit up to 10 fans in
this thing lots of dust filters it's got
lights on it plenty of storage space and
not to mention it looks really cool the
N 600 is 100% black both exterior and
interior long-gone of the days of the
bare steel interiors which I really
never liked on the old coolermaster
cases you have dust filters here on the
bottom the front and the top keeping
things clean and as you can see you have
a lot of storage options up to three
optical disk drives up to five SSDs
including one on the rear of the
motherboard tray and up to seven hard
disk drives all fitting inside of a mid
tower case so if you've got a lot of
disk drives that you've got to figure
out a place for all of them don't worry
this case has certainly got you covered
the shipping materials for the N 600 or
nothing unsurprising you have hard
styrofoam in a clear plastic bag keeping
things nice and protected it does the
job for a nice light case like this
underneath the bottom piece of styrofoam
you will find a little warranty
information here where it explains
everything you need to know about your
case it's got some parts replacement
information in there and covering the
side panel here in fact our review model
here came with a window in it there is a
window and a non windowed version but
it's got a nice kind of a smoked look to
this window which is very nice I do like
the smoke look they look very very
attractive and the case is very light
it's actually not heavy at all now if
you're a water cooling snob like I am
you'll really like the pass-through
grommets for external water coolers give
120 millimeter fan in the back and extra
PCI slot and you have seven PCI
expansion slots here for your longer
motherboards the top of the case also
supports either two 120 or 140
millimeter fans now one thing I really
do like about this case is all of the
internal cables for your front panel
connectors in your USB ports and your AC
97 audio are all black some cases come
with non sleeved or even non black
cables which is heard a horrible eyesore
but coolermaster has gone the extra mile
here and giving you a very
generous length of wire so you can
nicely route this so that it's all nice
and pretty through that window and it is
all black front panel connectors
everything is solid black which should
look really good on a solid black case
so I definitely like to see this now one
of the most unique features of this case
by far is the fact that you can take a
240 millimeter all-in-one cooling unit
like the site and 240m here and mount it
to the back of the case next to the
motherboard tray you have to remove the
middle hard drive cage to do this but
you do gain a really unique way of
fitting out 240 millimeter rat in there
and not taking up all kinds of space
above the motherboard it's a pretty
nifty little mid tower case it packs a
lot of features into a small package and
that's one of the things that I've never
really liked about mid tower cases is
that you're usually stuck with very
limited options when it comes to builds
now the one limitation that this case
does have is that if you want to put a
hundred and twenty millimeter times two
or 240 millimeter all in one cooling
unit in there like the side and 240 mm
that we put in this one you have to put
it in the mounting option behind in the
hook the hard drive cages there is not
enough space between the top of the case
and the motherboard for you to do that
in fact there's only enough room there
for fans now I did put the jet flow 120
fans in here as exhaust fans does an
awesome job of even on the quiet
adapters with 1200 rpm adapters it moves
a ton of air through the case so there's
no issues there when it comes to air
flow the aesthetics of the case are very
pleasing it's got a very matte jet-black
look to it but it also has some nice
polished piano finish pieces on there
like you can see on the front right
there it's got a polished bezel the
entire front of the case case is a mesh
grille it is made of plastic but it's
very very sturdy it doesn't creak or
crack when you move it around it's very
very solid so solid you expect a steel
and plastic case to be I mean there's
plenty of options for fans you have 220
millimeter intake fans that you can put
on there you can put 240 millimeter
exhaust fans on the top but the rear
option is 120 millimeter only this case
only comes with two fans one intake and
one exhaust so
do recommend putting more fans in there
especially if you're gonna be putting
high-end components so if you're looking
for a mid tower case that you can
confidently put high-end gaming
components in there and not really have
to worry about heat and have nice easy
routing when it comes to installation
and if your parts I definitely recommend
the n 600 from coolermaster it's a great
case and it definitely gets a J's bye
hope you guys have enjoyed this video if
you did you know what to do and I hope
that you guys stick around if you happen
to stumble across my channel if you've
got some video suggestions of things
that you'd like to see me cover put it
down in the description or tweet it to
me I'm always communicating with you
guys I love to bring you content that
you guys want to see so I'm gonna get on
out of here
show me what you're doing with your
builds and I'll see you guys next time
I'm J's 2 cents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
