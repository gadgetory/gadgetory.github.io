guys know me you know I like to tear
into product before I actually look at
it and give a review actually you kind
of have to tear into it before you look
at it huh but I like to look at the
product as much as I can before I do a
review that way we can get a little bit
more intimate with what it is we're
talking about insert creepy joke here so
yeah guys obviously I've already opened
the HS to 60s here from funk now funk is
a brand that I'll become obvious I'll be
honest I wasn't entirely too familiar
with but you know they've kind of
surprised me I mean when it comes to the
packaging it's really cool I mean it
kind of goes above and beyond some
packaging that you see out there in fact
it's got this little window that opens
up gives you some product information
here gives you a little window into what
the product looks like right there and
you know other than talking about
packaging I would just go ahead and see
what comes inside the box now as a gamer
there are you know you have to have
long-term term comfort in mind I mean
most gamers are going to be sitting at
their desk for hours and hours and it's
important to have long long-term comfort
when you are sitting there having your
long-term gaming sessions now why am I
talking about comfort well me personally
I don't like cloth ear cups they maybe
it's just my skin I don't know they over
time it tends to get really itchy and I
kind of start pawing them my dear kind
of looking like a dog and it really gets
annoying so I prefer leather ear cups
and you know sometimes you have to make
a buying choice depending on the type of
ear cups that come with it
well I'm mentioning this because one of
the things that this these headsets
they're this headset gives a definite
thumbs up from me is the fact that it
comes with two sets of ear cups now they
actually come with the cloth ones
installed which is what I have right
here but I've switched them to the
leather
because like I said I've been using it
so they've got interchangeable ear cuffs
so you can determine what's most
comfortable for you
the cable again another plus is very
very long because it is analog and it
has a three and a half inch plug on
there three and a half inch plugs
sometimes you have to go down maybe
below or behind your desk or you have to
get behind your computer and you need
the length and you want room still to
move around so it's got a very long
cable in fact it's say how long it is on
the box I'm interested this it just says
detachable solution let's see if it says
it right here these are the kind of
things I'll admit I'm not very good at
looking up before we actually do these
types of reviews but I don't see the
link listed anywhere on here if I had to
guess I would say it's probably closer
to 8 to 10 feet it is probably closer to
10 feet but it's got a single plug on
the headphones side it's got velcro on
there so you can wrap it up and keep it
nice and tidy and then on the PC side
you've got of course your headphone and
your microphone jacks now another thing
that I think is really interesting is
you know you've got your product manual
here and it's got a bunch of specs in
there that a lot of people you know may
care about headset frequency response
we'll look at that but it's got this
warranty card that's attached right here
inside them the manual so you can stick
that in your wallet or yours maybe your
backpack or something so you always have
your warranty information with you now
let's go and take a look at the
frequency response of these I've already
listened to them but I don't know
exactly you know okay so it shows it's
got the pretty typical 20 Hertz to
20,000 Hertz which seems to be pretty
much like the industry standard and why
is that well because that's the hearing
range of the human ear 20 Hertz to
20,000 Hertz basically it covers the
entire spectrum of that sound so here is
the headphone or the headset itself
right here the construction on this
really is beautiful I do like the way it
looks now the kind of big the ear cut
portion of them is really big but they
swivel around so you can always get you
know comfort position they of course are
extendable if you have a big head like I
do or if you have a little head you can
shrink it down as you can see I've
already got the ear cups on there now
when it comes to install
the ear cups it's really really easy
actually there's this groove that is
inside the ear cup right there or the
headphone right there
you just take the edge of the leather or
the cloth whichever one you're using
with it they're both leather when it
comes to the part that attaches you just
stick it in that groove and then you
start turning and turn and turn turn
turn and as you keep turning it it
threads itself kind of like a chain on a
bike and there it is it's on really
really easy the material on the ear cup
side is pretty much that kind of a
rubberized plastic it looks really nice
you've got some chrome grill going on on
the inside but when it comes to the
microphone you may notice there's not
one on there and obviously as you solved
the cable it is detachable well the
microphone is right here and as you can
see it is very very tiny I mean it
barely gets picked up on the camera
where is it there it's very very small
but you can stick it on either side of
the headphone that you want if you want
on the right side assuming you aren't on
the left side you can do on the left
side or detach it and move it over to
the right side it's interchangeable so
you can stick it on any side that you
want I'm gonna go ahead and leave it on
the right side because that is what kind
of where I like it and then you can take
the plug and plug it into the other side
really really simple it's got on your
cup or it's on the ear the volume
control up and down so it is no inline
control in fact I've got that on there
backwards let's go ahead and try not to
be a complete noob in this video it's
probably a little late to say that but
anyway plugs in right there and then
there's the headphone yeah yeah they're
extremely comfortable I
they really are comfy when you have the
leather portion on there they are a bit
more noise cancelling than if they had
the cloth on there but then again the
cloth is better for long term comfort
because you don't sweat as much but if
you're like me all cloth earphones make
me itch so it's not anything specific to
the funk EHS 260 headphones what I'm
gonna go ahead and do right now guys
what you guys are most interested in is
I'm gonna go ahead and plug the
microphone directly into my camera or
directly into my zoom h4n that way we're
not dealing with any sounds coming from
the computer or in
interference of electrical noise so you
guys can hear how the microphone sounds
pretty much raw so let's go ahead and
see if this experiment works and if it
fails miserably well then I'll switch
over to the computer we'll just do it
that way so let's go ahead and change it
over
oh yeah we're back we've now got my
microphone from the HS 260 plugged in
directly to my zoom h4n handy recorder
that's going directly into my camera and
just to prove that this is the mic that
were using I'm gonna tap it and I really
like how low-profile this mic is and
it's very flexible and keeping it out of
the way and it's also got a built-in
mute switch on the mic itself if you
just flip that switch and like I say you
couldn't hear anything that I'm saying
because it has the built-in mute on the
microphone now guys this is
aesthetically probably one of the most
pleasing headphones I think that I've
really reviewed on this channel yet it
definitely gets a J's by their comfort
they are completely over the ear I have
no complaints about them at all really
the interchangeable sides between the
cables and the mic is really important
because sometimes your computers on the
left and even want the cord to cross
your body or go across your keyboard
maybe it's on the right like mine so you
could switch which side the cable is on
there's some flexibility to it the extra
ear cups just going the extra-mile with
the nice packaging and the way that the
manual is I mean this book is it's
really it's pretty nice and the little
extra warranty card in there that way
you can put it in your wallet and never
lose it and they do come with a 2 year
manufacturer's warranty on there so
definitely kudos for that giving a
two-year warranty where a lot of just
give a standard 1 year so guys what do
you guys think about these headphones
they are PC only so you know if you if
you looking for a dual platform
headphones unfortunately these will not
fit that bill but what do you guys look
for in headphones and get this video a
thumbs up if you're happy that it wasn't
a keyboard review because we seem to
have an awful lot of those lately guys
I'm gonna go ahead and get on out of
here
tell me what you think about these HS
260 headphones from funk and as always I
will see you in my next video
