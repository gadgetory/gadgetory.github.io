especially when it comes to Intel's new
launches the 79 60 X and 79 80 X II well
you know I think it's funny about that
naming convention first of all as the X
always meant extreme but then they
called all of their $2.99 CPUs X but
they're not all extreme so they put the
e in there so that's extreme edition
whatever I digress we're gonna be taking
a look at a little bit of that today but
this is not a full review of that CPU
and I wanna make that first and foremost
clear because I've been working on other
projects I'm late on that but I want to
see what happens here if I install a 79
80 X II into my test bench here which
has what looks like is going to be an
under sized
power supply is currently running one of
the gigabyte 800 watt power supplies and
when if you couple that with something
like a single GTX 1080 which when
overclocked can take about 300 watts of
its own power leaving about 500 max
output capability what happens now when
I leave only 500 Watts left to the CPU
when we've seen that when you start to
overclock it it pulls more than that the
new cooler master master set 120
features perky RGB lighting control
exclusive hybrid switches with the look
and feel of mechanical keys down in
professional-grade keyboards and a
precision gaming mouse with durable
Omron switches and all at an affordable
price
get your click fixed by following the
link down below Intel it's been a really
strange year for Intel in fact I don't
find this platform to be the most
compelling it's obvious it means nothing
to gamers right this is not a a gamers
platform by any stretch of the
imagination this is a content creator
slash multitaskers wet dream when it
comes to this many threads in fact this
is giving us xeon level of performance
with the number of cores and number of
threads but we can actually overclock it
and that seems to be where the problem
really is coming from where once you
start to overclock this thing the power
of draw just goes through the roof the
deluxe edition right here although
decent I'm not gonna take any chances
because I don't want a fire in today's
video but we're gonna be using the
rampage extreme motherboard because of
its
for power delivery which is exactly how
it was communicated to me this is not
the most compelling launch this unit to
me I'm actually more interested in the
8th gen CPU stuff because this is
actually coming out a little bit later
very soon
so this is the Z 370 next Nick thinks if
it was called the 370z board that I
would have been a little bit more
excited about this but I'm actually
excited about this because we are
getting mainstream CPUs that have six
cores and twelve threads like 8700 K
which is in this box somewhere I think
this guy got teeny tiny it is and yet
they're six cores and twelve threads in
there but I'm concerned because I don't
want to have to rewire this thing for
the power supply examine if you guys can
see it look underneath here like oh nice
and tidy these wires are how everything
is all zip tied and and run out of it's
run out of sight but now I have to redo
all of this that's going to be a pain in
the foot it's almost like all of the
rest in peace' call the fire department
AMD jokes have made their way over to
Intel there we go
the problem was this hole was like the
exact same diameter of these little
retention this so we got to put that
away soon the rampage stuff has always
just been nice I'm glad they got away
away from all the red in fact if we're
gonna talk about power requirements I've
heard that the dual eight pin is like
pretty much required the rampage board
doesn't even have dual eight pins
there's an eight pin and a four pin so
yeah this might get interesting really
quickly this is this is where I kind of
wish I had a monoblock for this
motherboard I don't think there's gonna
be one for a little while I may take
some time for them to make them but this
is we're keeping the vrm is nice and
cool too it's going to be a problem
because I mean the videos that have been
making their way out regarding this have
all said to the power delivery cables
get pretty toasty got ice the perfect
for alcohol good as new
nice and shiny
those are the doctor's office so the
sockets gonna look identical to every
other one see this is the one that says
2.6 so this is indeed the right one you
labeled it correctly sir kudos no I'm
looking forward to that I'm looking
forward to checking out the new Maximus
that you're gonna get with the Z 370
pretty sure that that's gonna be a cool
motherboard worth taking a look at not
to mention the Maximus boards right they
had the extreme on the last one which
included the built-in water block this
started look like an ASA sponsored video
it's not them
I'll never nurse I'll never get past the
point where I care about the way wires
look even on things like test benches
where they shouldn't care about being
all pretty I care did you hear that
North Korea is firing no no
okay it might be better name I love the
edge lighting
how many motherboards though because we
have that on thread refer also and
that's what's gonna give us some of our
lighting I'm gonna update the BIOS and
then I'll come back with the actual
testing okay so we got a couple things
set up here ready to go this is my watt
meter man this thing is old ugly and
baiji anyway I don't right now and you
guys are probably not gonna be able to
see this very well the contrast is very
poor but we sit anywhere between the
high 90s to the low 100's about 110 I
think I saw 117 for a second at idle but
this is just the system at idle all
stock speeds I've also got real temp
running right here hopefully the glare
is not too bad but I've got real temp
running right here it's not showing all
the cores real temp has not been updated
yet to actually be able to work with
this CPU but at least it gives us sort
of an idea of what the core temperatures
are looking like there's also a tiny
little readout right here in an OLED
display on the motherboard itself that's
giving us and don't even bother trying
to focus on that nikinoo see if it's
gonna give us an idea of what the
package temperature is interestingly
enough though I downloaded a Seuss's own
software which is our tuning utility to
try and see what's happening here with
with temperatures and stuff and you can
see it's not showing like it's not
really working very well right max core
frequencies zero process of cache
frequency zero active core count zero
package temperature zero so even though
this is a motherboard that supports this
particular CPU it doesn't look like this
software isn't updated yet so that's why
I'm using real temp and we've got our
audio used to cheer just anybody around
100 watts 98 104 98 105 100 103 so not
too bad and then we also have a GTX 10
atti Strix Edition here that is sitting
again at stock speeds so let's go and
get our base test out of the way let's
go ahead and do I'm gonna do a Cinebench
run I'm curious as to what the cinnamon
score is and how - scoring compared to
everyone else's so we'll just run the
CPU test and our load right now is going
up to 291 to 88 to 92 87 to 94 to 96
looks like 296 with our max draw from
the wall where that's wall power that's
everything not just a CPU but that's the
whole system right here plugged into
this power meter but we got a score of
3364 it seems to be pretty in line with
what everyone else is experiencing so
going to save that score looks like our
max temperature has reached about 40 39
44 or 42 43 and 39 and I looked at the
core socket while it was running and it
said 44 on the socket so temperature is
at least under water here are our pretty
good so we're going to try a CPU test
here on Blender this is the BMW test
that everyone pretty much uses it's kind
of the standard and we're just gonna go
ahead and click render here
all right blenders finishing up we're
still sitting right around 280 between
277 to 281 watts on this so yeah it
didn't draw more overtime as it got a
little warmer in fact package is sitting
at 36 C and if we look at real temp our
max temps again 42 41 45 45 so you can
see we're in the mid to low 40s wish I
could see all 16 cores but again can't
you get the idea though I'd also
rendered that in 2 minutes and 27
seconds so we can compare that when we
overclocked this I'm gonna see what
happens with some gaming now or at least
something like 3d mark which is a GPU
stress test I'd I expect the wattage to
be higher because I'm running a 1080i
custom piece of II is a strict card
that's got some overclocking applied so
it's gonna go to about 2000 I'm
expecting it to probably go up to about
400 watts on the meter if I have to
guesstimate between the low load the CPU
is gonna see but the high load on the
GPU I'm expecting about 400 watts so I
guess we'll see if my predictions are
right or not and we are at 413 406 414
410 so I'm gonna say about 415 wattage
from the wall once again so actually saw
431 Watts peak the amount of power draw
from the wall in a test like that but
here's a CPU test it's going up to 253
to 45 to 75 so it's definitely all over
the place but no more than we were
seeing with something like Cinebench or
even blender so think we have a pretty
good idea of how much
the CPU is drawing at stock which is
actually not too bad if you think about
it remember that's that's a total system
power there let's see our graphics core
at ten thousand four zero ten thousand
forty two and our CPU score ten thousand
sixty six it's been a long time since
I've actually seen a CPU score exceed a
GPU score but hey that works for me
alright you know it's time to do now
it's time to overclock so I've been
talking to a seduced about this because
I was concerned about the fact that we
have an 8-pin plus a four pin power on
this and I've seen a lot of reports
people saying dual eight pin is a
requirement if you're gonna overclock
this otherwise you were going to just
set your house ablaze but Asus has
assured me that they're BRM design is
perfectly fine with the eight pin plus
the four pin now I don't have a I don't
have the tools or the equipment to
verify that but I'm gonna take their
word for it and if this goes up in smoke
then I'm assuming that they'll stand by
their product and replace whatever goes
bad and this is not an overclocking
tutorial so this is just gonna be a
quick and dirty because I want to see
what we get here with I'm just curious
as to what we can actually choose we're
gonna go manual this little OLED display
is the best thing that anyone's ever
done for motherboards a q-code thing is
cool but you have to always have to look
up the numbers but now it tells you like
on the little display exactly what it's
doing so it looks like we might get a
good food on 4.5 let's wait for
everything finish loading but looks like
our Idol has gone up from 90 watts to
approximately about 178 Watts so you can
see we've gone up significantly just by
changing that and we're not even at load
so we are almost at load wattage well
not almost I mean we're about a hundred
watts shy of load at idle now but it's
verified we actually so we are four
point four seven gigahertz on all 16
cores so all 36 threads are getting that
kind of power let's bring up our real
temp again idle temp still seemed pretty
good if this is if this is accurately
reporting remember this needs to be
updated but I don't I'm cool with it
sitting in the high 20s at idle
we're pulling now 561 Watts from the
wall so that's double
and you hear the fans just immediately
ramped up and our temperatures member
had they were at the mid 40s mid to low
40s well now it looks like we went to
the upper 60s to the upper 70s depending
on the court but leave the difference in
score though 4427 versus the 3364 so it
looks like at least your performance is
scaling with the power draw
that's scary though like my watt meter
is getting kind of what I wonder if I
have a pinch it because 4.5 is one of
those that like they were like a good
chip will hit 4.5
all right blender time okay here we go
or popper tripper or Papa true pop eight
triple a breaker that's not offensive
it's right around 580 watts but look how
much faster that's going oh my god there
were last time about 220 or two minutes
27 seconds we're pulling right around
585 watts from the wall member this is
an 800 watt power supply so actually not
as bad as I was thinking we're sitting
at 71 see on the package so we have gone
up approximately 30 see about 30 see
maybe one idea that the water temp
increasing look at the condensation
inside the reservoir there you see how
we're starting to get some fogging so
the water temp is definitely increasing
but the air coming through the rad
actually isn't all that one not quite
600 up there 603 605 607 so it's going
good
610 so we saw a peak of 620 watts but an
average of right around 585 but we came
down from 2 minutes 27 seconds in
blender till one minute 44 seconds with
just a couple of clicks in the BIOS so
average usage right now just while the
GPU is doing it saying came up to about
500 watts I'm seeing what I saw 505 515
but now it's down to like 493 495 498 so
we came about a hundred watts just in
gaming right just under a gaming stress
test like this
so the CPU test right now is drawing
only 400 watts 434 447 right so
obviously it's not as stressful as
something like blender or Cinebench
which is expected but look at our CPU
score came out from 10,000 what 100
to twelve thousand five hundred and
thirty-four and our graphic score came
up a few points as well about a hundred
points does that mean our 79 80 X E is
bottlenecking they actually recommend it
to have a fan blowing oh that's warm
yeah before we do this I think we need
to plug a fan in and point it at the BRM
I forgot to do that
Asus was like yeah we recommend if
you're gonna overclock you have air flow
in the V RMS and I'm water-cooled so
clear there's no fans their voltage over
em I said to one point two seven five
I'm just gonna leave it there we don't
really want to leave it there because we
don't want it pumping that voltage when
it's at idle but for the sake of testing
we'll just do that
i'ma grab a fan tada it's literally just
leaning there if I hope it doesn't ramp
up too much and like mess things up
alright so so at one point 275 temps are
sitting still right around where they
were before man is that thing like
weekly rate but we saw 85 88 88 beds
that's not that's not gonna cut it
look at the score look at that 4440 Q
that's too warm though right up 91 see
right there all right I'm gonna dial VIN
I'm gonna dial in the overclocks and
we'll come back so I reduced the wattage
down to 1.25 and I increase the quartet
or the core clock up to 4.7 I'm curious
if we'll even boot may I have finally
won the lottery four point seven now if
you guys are curious as to why four
point seven would be a big even four
point five is a big deal maybe this is a
two point six gigahertz chip I'm sure
it's got 4.4 ABX right that's only one
or two cores at the most I'm running all
cores overclocked right now four point
seven bigger Hertz
let's see and I reduced the voltage down
to one point two five let's see if this
if this actually holds up man that ramps
up fast
still getting hot though eighty eight
eighty nine four thousand six hundred
and eleven the fact that I've reduced
the voltage and increased the clock and
it still at least past that like a
couple seconds to do this test let's
just see how far we can go
this is crazy I might have actually won
a lottery for once been a long time
since I've had like a good overclocking
chip like my chips have always just been
like middle of the road middle of the
river I've Brian but you guys have kind
of seen a little bit he's forcing the
ICA forcing me he's he is being the
devil's advocate on my shoulder st. go
for five gigs go for five gigs you can
do it go for five gigs burn it down and
we actually so we got four point eight
which was good we got four point nine at
the lesser voltage and cinnamons crashed
but the system didn't hard-luck so what
I'm gonna do now is I believe it takes
approximately four or five seconds for
Senate bench to do its test I just want
to see if I can get five gigs in
Cinebench that's all I care about now
for 5.18 way why did it I put 50 as a
multiplier why we have five point one
don't question it I don't think it's
gonna run it can't possibly it can't
possibly survive Cinebench
Oh No but again it's not a hard look
yeah if I can get that down to five
where I want it we'll be okay
so even playing around this now for the
last couple of it about an hour and a
half or so trying to get five gigs we
couldn't get it I got four point nine to
run stable once but I can't get it back
so I'm thinking I actually degraded the
CPU down slightly in just the amount of
testing in that voltage we were sending
out at a 264 here's a crash dummy
so 4.8 right now we're in a 1.3 2 volts
which is highly unreconstructed I kind
of tune around 1.2 75 and work it down
from there because we're at the limits
of water as you could obviously see I
want to see what the power draw was in
the worst case scenario so we're sitting
at 190 Watts right now idle again total
system power if I hit run on this we
spike up to seven thirty seven seven
forty four seven forty fifty three so
7:53 is where we went and we came down
slightly on the score again four
thousand six hundred sixty-seven so
negligible difference but again probably
because throttling see all these cores
are exceeding 80 that one-city 90 that
one-city 97 again if I could see all 16
of them I think we'd see more of them or
throttling which is to be expected
because that meant that much voltage in
this speed is already approaching where
we need exotic cooling just because they
might have focused heat that's in there
remember the die didn't get bigger it's
not like thread ripper where they got
this huge die it's still in a very small
package ladies and so what it'll happen
there is you'll get much more focused
heat now what about something like a 264
right so a 264 is a stress test and it
stressed this stuff like system memory
CPU cache or FPU so I'm gonna test just
the CPU though so I'm gonna take off the
CPU data cache promise to take off the
memory we'll just do cache Fu and CPU
and see it already detected that there
was overheating that's because this was
actually running in the background when
I did the Cinebench so I'm going to
clear all this and I'm just curious once
again what our temperatures are going to
do under the
test as well as our voltage so 779 was
where it started
695 658 so it's definitely all over the
place but as you can see we are also
thermal throttling slightly and look
some these cores 105 105 so yeah we have
definitely exceeded our cooling so I
died of it back down to 4.5 and just to
kind of show you once again this is what
you get I also pulled the voltage all
the way back to 1.25 so hopefully it
doesn't crash I also brought the memory
back up to 20 666 probably could get 29
33 out of it but whatever
29:19 whatever it is you got yeah as I'm
saying but if we compare now we are
getting 599 Watts pulled from the wall
and you can see our temperatures are
much more acceptable our score came down
of course 4300 86 so we lost about 300
points just under 300 points but you
know you're gonna lose a whole lot more
points it can blow up your chip simply
because he gave too much voltages and
stuff so anyway that's been my two cents
about this chip cuz it really was I was
really most concerned with power draw
temperatures and what overclocking was
like on this because we had seen rumors
that it could be up to one whole
kilowatt or thousand watts pulled from
the wall when overclocking this
especially on lnto I think the guys that
hit six gigahertz were pulling a
thousand watts and we saw that by just
going from 1.25 to 1.3 to our voltage or
our wydad went from roughly 600 watts to
750 just that little bit yeah it's
pretty exponential but yeah 4.5 on this
chip you could run this everyday and not
have any sort of problems with that said
