already why the heck is Jay taking a
look at a TV but this isn't the first
one of taking a look at in fact last
year we took a look at LG's OLED 65 eg
9600 which was an amazing TV but it had
some things that I wish that it had but
it didn't that the new LG b6 actually
has which is why we're kind of reviewing
this again now huge thank you to LG for
sending over this TV for review they did
send this specifically as a media review
sample so it's important to let you know
that this is 100% my opinions everything
you're going to hear me say today is my
opinion in my opinion only and I want to
make sure that you guys understand that
that is the way things are always going
to be so huge think at LG for sending
this over but remember what you're going
to hear is 100% my opinion and now that
business is out of the way let's talk
about why we're looking at this today
OLED technology or organic LED it's not
new it's new in this format but it's not
new we actually saw this years ago on
small displays like tablets and cell
phones and it became apparent
immediately that the contrast range that
you can get with OLED is unmatched I
mean even in the old days of plasma
where plasmas were like plasma gives you
a true black plasma also couldn't give
you the dynamic range you needed to also
take it to that next level which is
exactly what we're looking at here with
this OLED technology now LG advertises
an infinite contrast range OLED is the
first time we are seeing a true 100
percent black which is amazing because
that opened up the door to something
else which is what we have today which
is HDR or high dynamic range we'll talk
more about that in a second now I
believe their claim although I don't
have a scope that I can put on this TV
to actually measure is this truly an
infinite contrast ratio I have a funny
story to tell you here real quick
my daughter's she's almost two and she's
always taking the remote control and
changing settings on things and she
changed the settings on my set-top box
too when the show is over it doesn't pop
up the little play menu to tell you the
show has ended you know pause recording
delete whatever it just stops it just
goes to a black screen and stops I
didn't know that so my older daughter
who's seven says daddy something's wrong
the TV
every time my show is done the TV turns
off I'm going what I'm coming down here
and I'm watching TV and then sure enough
the show ended and the TV turned off I'm
going what the heck the power lights
still on
I actually thought something was
defective with the TV but I thought that
doesn't make sense because the TV is
only playing the signal being sent to it
by the set-top box then I started
messing around with it and I realized
what was happening was the screen was
going black but it was so dang black I
thought that the panel turned off
because I'm used to LED / LCD you know
or CFL back lights flat panels that
still have some light bleed that comes
through the panel when it's turned on
you guys know I'm talking about you turn
on your computer you turn on your panel
the panel flicks on you can tell the
backlit turned on and the black screen
turns kind of a gray color well you
don't get that with OLED you get a true
black one that made me feel like an
idiot because I thought the TV wasn't
turning on that's actually pretty damn
cool if you think about it now that kind
of segues me here into the next segment
about brightness which is the next
challenge when it comes to creating a
true high dynamic range TV now the
challenge has always been developing a
TV that can one go dark enough to retain
the details in the lows like things and
shadows right you look at dark hallway
or a dark alleyway in a movie is it just
going to look like one washed out shadow
are you gonna retain those spying
details in there the same goes and this
is actually the harder part retaining
details in the highlights which are
things that go towards the clipping or
for white where all of the detail is
lost because it's too bright
well the CD has 20 stops of dynamic
range which gives you an extremely wide
range of brightness to work with which
is why it has all the certifications
that are expected for high definition or
high dynamic range content now the last
thing I want to talk about before we
move on to webOS because this is more
than just a TV is that 10-bit color that
I mentioned just a second ago because
you might be used to hearing the the 18
million colors because of RGB well this
TV because of its 10-bit color is able
to produce 1.07 billion colors not
million billion this TV here is more
than just a TV it is also a complete
home entertainment system it's got all
of the popular streaming
there it's got YouTube it's got Hulu
it's got Netflix but it's got a full-on
web browser in there it's got LG Apps
access to things like weather traffic
news it's just it's all that you can
even attach a camera to this and you can
have video conference calls on here it
has a microphone but setup on this thing
is also ridiculously easy when you plug
it in it automatically will detect it
there's a wired internet connection or
you can connect it to wireless it's
going to update itself with the latest
firmware you tell it who your TV
provider is it will set up the box so
that you can have a single remote to
control everything
oh let HDR technology like I mentioned
it allows you to this TV is in a
category of its own if you don't believe
me go to Best Buy go somewhere where
these are on display and just look for
yourself it is absolutely a game changer
when it comes to TVs and right now it's
the only OLED panel is the only OLED
panels are available by LG what I want
to do quickly here as I start to wrap up
this video is talk about some of the
things that have changed with this panel
versus the original OLED panel I took a
look at last year which was the 65 eg
9600 the panel I looked at last year was
curved it also had a flat option the one
I'm looking at here now is a flat option
this one is a 65 inch it's almost edge
to edge not quite but it's pretty dang
close it is thin as compared to the
curved panel this one's even thinner
because the curved has to have some
rigidity right because it's curved this
one's even thinner than that of course
the base is a bit thicker where the
electronics are this one has more HDMI
HDMI ports
once you hook up an HDR source to it
it's going to detect that it's HDR you
can even tell it go to HDR mode it will
set itself up and you don't have to
touch any of those expert settings or
calibration it is ready to go out of the
box of course you can calibrate it and
go into the expert mode and change
things but I don't feel that that's
necessary the color on this is amazing
it's not like oversaturated it is it is
accurate and true exactly as you would
expect it to be because of the amount of
colors that can create and the HDR it's
very close to what you see with your
eyes and reality but one thing I was
glad to see is it's also got a standard
vase amount on the back of the TV which
was something that the TV lasts you
didn't have it had its own proprietary
Mount which kind of sucked you spend a
pretty penny for this TV then you've got
to go buy and special mount for it not
the case anymore you can use whatever
wall mount you want in this case here I
installed an articulating wall mount
that allows me to make the TV look like
it's floating it's kind of away from the
wall I add some nice backlight to it the
backlighting you see is not part of the
TV it's actually something LED strips
that I added I'm actually a little bit
worried that I sound way too excited
about this but guys I've had this
installed now for several weeks and I've
been looking at OLED TVs now in the
living room for over a year I did like a
whole living room remodel to do that
last review and I did I did quite a bit
of work to to get this one installed I
had changed the mount which was kind of
the sucky thing about them going back to
vase amount was I had to get another
mountain here so it was kind of like a
double-edged sword but that's okay it's
a that's something I'll I'll gladly live
with but I'm curious you guys tell me
how do you feel about this panel
technology it's not cheap it's really
not it is it is cutting edge but the
price has come down significantly
compared to where OLED first debuted and
where we are today which is kind of the
normal progression of technology so I'm
curious as to what you guys think about
this I can't wait until we see this on
desktop that infinite contrast ratio HDR
as long as the refresh rate is there
then we're good guys sound off in the
comments tell me what you think about
this what TV are you using and of course
if you live near a Best Buy don't take
my word for it go there look at it and I
mentioned Best Buy they're not
sponsoring anything but I mentioned that
only because it's the only place
personally near me that I know has one
on display but if you go anywhere
they've got LG authorized retailer you
will see a display for the OLED
technology I guarantee it go and look
then comment and tell me what you think
time to go guys as always huge thank you
once again to LG for sending this TV
over movie movie-watching has never been
the same in fact I've barely been to the
theaters ever since I've taken a look at
these panels because they are so amazed
so much money like my 4k blu-ray player
and stuff I paid for all that I remodel
the whole living room last year just to
enjoy it and I'm a sucker for these
types of these types of videos I'm not
just a PC guy guys not just a PC guy
guys I just love tech tech is so cool
all right guys thanks for watching I'm
rambling now as always I'll see you the
next month op you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
