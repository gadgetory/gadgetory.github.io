today we're doing kind of a twofer we're
doing two product reviews at the same
time sent over by g.skill and no it's
not memory as you can see we were taking
a look at two of their brand-new gaming
headsets
that's right g.skill has expanded the
popular Ripjaws line on to gaming
peripherals we already took a look the
keyboard and now we're gonna take a look
at two brand new headsets you don't want
to miss this today's video is brought to
you by Harry's now before you guys tell
me pump the brakes Jay stop being a
sellout Harry's is the actual official
raiser of the Movember foundation which
is something I care a lot about than the
Movember foundation if you guys don't
know have takes place every single
November and is about bringing awareness
to men's health trying to find cures for
testicular cancer prostate cancer heart
disease all sorts of things that are
actually really an issue for guys and
Harry's is giving back to the foundation
during the month of November so that is
something that really resonated with me
now stay tuned at the end of this video
where there's a special offer but in the
meantime you can check the description
where you can learn a little bit more
while you're watching this video and at
the end of this video I'll tell you a
little bit more about the service and
how I felt about it because it was
actually my first time using it okay so
we've got two headsets going on here the
SV 710 which is a 7.1 simulated surround
and then we've got the sr9 10 which is a
real 7.1 surround with multiple drivers
going on right here inside the ear cans
now the headset itself is made out of
plastic but it's got a pretty hefty
construction to it lots of flexibility
of spring-loaded headband here so that
you always have it resting comfortably
on your head we've got some pleather at
ear cups right here that are on the ear
cans they are not interchangeable
there they don't come with any other ear
cups so if you guys don't like leather
unfortunately that's the only thing
available here and then it does have
quite the swivel going on on the ear
cans as well as a little bit of rotation
inside right here so that they fit
perfectly on your head now we do have a
rubberized cable and that's kind of the
first thing I've noticed here that I'm
not a fan of is rubberized cables kind
of tend to get tangled up within
themselves
there's a little bit friction based and
they do tend to get kind of caught up
and I wish they had gone with some sort
of a paracord however this is a rubber
now it is a headset which means it does
have a microphone and the microphone
retracts you this little guy right here
this little swivel dude and you can just
push that back up inside to can if you
are not using the microphone now it does
also have its own control base right
here and because this thing is a true
7.1 you can independently control the
volumes of the different drivers inside
the ear can and you do that by simply
pressing the different buttons right
here which actually looks like a shifter
pattern it will then rotate through the
different location of the drivers you've
got Center you've got right left front
right left rear and you can
independently control those volumes so
if you don't want as much rear
enhancements you can turn that down and
then you've got a quick mute right here
BAM you can mute that sucker real quick
same thing with a mute button right here
for your microphone now in the interface
with the PC the thing is a USB a lot of
people don't like USB but I'm kind of a
fan of USB as long as you know
everything is tuned nicely because it's
very simple it's plug-and-play you not
to worry about setting things up on your
motherboard you don't have any
motherboard board influence on you know
the motherboards amp etc etc it's simply
just plug and play it's easy to move
between pcs if you're going back and
forth between say a laptop or multiple
gaming PC's or whatever then it is going
to be very very simple okay so I've got
both hooked up and as you can see they
do glow red inside the ear cans which is
kind of nice they it's got the g-scale
logo with like the spider there and it
looks an awful lot like it's really kind
of floating because they are hollow they
are plexi you can see inside there you
can even see all the little independent
drivers in the 7.1 on the 7.1 simulated
however it looks much much darker and
the reason for that is this is more of a
smoked lens on here or cover rather than
this one on the 7.1 true which is
definitely clear but anyway this is a
different colour as well you can get the
7.1 surround also in black I do think
the solid black looks better the
construction is completely identical
however one thing that is different
here is the volume control which is
really freaking big that's actually
really big and I think it's kind of
unfortunate that the color on here is
blue considering the fact that all the
colors on here on the headset are red
but you can mute the thing right here on
the side when the thing is muted it's
gonna sit here in flash green blue green
blue and it's got the same rubberized
cord and all of that now one of the
reasons why they sent me this one I've
actually had the 7.1 surround for quite
a while several weeks in fact actually
probably closer to two months but the
reason for that is I complained that I
didn't think they sounded very good now
here's what I mean by that music on true
7.1 surround headphones do not sound
very good music is generally mastered
for stereo and these being a true 7.1
and having much smaller drivers and
fitting all of those drivers inside the
ear can meant that the bass wasn't very
heavy the bass was there but it wasn't
very heavy it didn't punch and it wasn't
a very good listening experience for
things like YouTube videos or listening
to podcasts it just wasn't personally
for me a very pleasant experience so
basically g.skill said well why don't we
go ahead and send you our stimulated 7.1
which has a true stereo mode and true
drivers in here which are going to give
you a little bit better bass because
they're bigger drivers and they're going
to be a much better experience for
listening to music so I think what I'm
gonna do right now is I'm gonna go ahead
I'm gonna fire up some music here on my
computer listen to these and then I'll
come right back and tell you how I feel
about these compared to the 7.1 so don't
go anywhere
what it's Jess
okay so I'm gonna tell you right now
that these actually sound very very good
especially once you download the
proprietary software to control them
remember they are USB so they can be
controlled by software which is exactly
what G scale is done they have a suite
specifically for the sr9 10s and the sv7
tens so they sound really really they
sound amazingly better than the 7.1 at
music however the 7.1 and things like
gaming especially FPS shooters are going
to be much better than these when it
comes to simulated Y shame is a simulate
a true 7.1 surround so you can tell
where shots and footprints are coming
from their footsteps these although
stimulate does a decent job it's never
going to be as good as say you know the
seventh of the ninth ends over there I
got so many different names I'm in ten
nine ten blah blah blah numbers
everywhere anyway there's a couple of
things that I don't like about this
though for instance you might have
noticed when I was wearing them they
look stupid
they I'm sorry but they look absolutely
terrible what what is up with this right
here it's like it's like I have a handle
on my head for someone just picked me up
and carrying me around and this what
whoever in their design department
thought this thing up here was a good
idea I'm sorry because I I get that you
want them to be suspended on your head I
get that you want adjustable headband
but how big of a head are you
compensating for I mean unless they pull
all the way down like that I mean that
person's got to have a massive noggin
because now that your cups are below my
ears like all the way down under my jaw
so aesthetically they are not very
pleasing to me whatsoever
okay last test we got to do real quick
is the mic test the they have the exact
same mic in both of these so let's go
ahead and do a mic test real quick
alright well it is time for the mic test
and here we go right now
now unfortunately in my opinion this mic
is extremely disappointing it sounds
very modulated it sounds very 8-bit it
sounds like something that I would have
had back in the 90s chorus in fact I had
microphones from the 90s it sounded
better than this it's even lesser
quality than like a $4.00 desktop mic
you know those little plastic mics that
you can get from Walmart I
don't know why the mic sounds terrible
everything has been updated on this both
of them sound identical so it doesn't
make me think that this one's bad or
anything like that I think they just
used a really substandard microphone in
this headset now part of it could be the
fact that it's running over USB I don't
know there's lots of good USB mics out
there so that doesn't make sense
in fact it sounds worse than some
wireless mics that I've complained about
you know wireless headsets where I can
understand why the wireless would sound
this way but this thing is wired I have
no idea why it sounds like this I've
downloaded all the latest drivers latest
software there's no adjustment for the
microphone in any of the software but
with that said yeah I'll stop making
your ears bleed because it's microphone
sounds terrible so there you go guys my
review of the SR 910 and SB 710 Ripjaws
gaming headsets from g.skill now I said
in the beginning and I still feel the
same where I do not like the sr9 10
period that's subjective it's my opinion
I don't like the way it looks I don't
like the way it sounds I don't like the
way the microphone sounds and it has a
very terrible hollowness to them when it
comes to the audio it I don't know if
it's because all those little drivers
and it's very hollow when they're behind
them and the fact that they have these
little these plexi windows that do not
really hold any of the ambient sound out
from coming through the plastic they
very very low if any noise isolation
whatsoever because of the plastic and a
plexiglass back sounds to me like
listening to music with us
microphone our speaker that's inside of
a shell and you suck the shell to your
head and it's got that very sort of an
echo e slash hollow feel to it not a fan
whatsoever
the 7/10 on the other hand much more
solid feeling when you put them on
there's very little sound that makes its
way through the ear back of the ear can
into your ear because of the fact that
it's a bigger driver there it's more
solid there's more there's less hollow
space in the ear can and I think that
that might be why but both of these
headsets do suffer from an issue where
all of the sound that happens to the
headband and the cord gets translated
right up into your ear
now I think that's because they're they
try to keep them lightweight so they're
very Hollow both of them which makes
sound very easy to travel and then
Reverb into the headset itself now the
sound quality of the 710 is great like I
said not a fan of the 9:10 sound quality
or anything the only thing the 7:10 net
or the 910 s going for as far as I'm
concerned truly is the true surround 7.1
so when it comes to things like
battlefield 4
I even wore those when I was playing
battlefront it's amazing to hear where
the sound is coming from but at the same
time like I said I felt like I had two
shells stuck up to my ear with tons of
echo and reverb didn't like it
whatsoever so if you can get past that
then those might be for you otherwise
the 710 might be the ones to check out
but once again if you need a microphone
then I might skip this series altogether
if g.skill can get that microphone
updated and sounding better then I'd be
all for it putting my name all over it
but other than that the g.skill ripjaws
headsets yeah mmm just about the only
thing I can really say sorry g.skill but
I think you get an A for effort
ultimately you have to try and get your
hands on these and listen to them for
yourself unfortunately a lot of stores
like Fry's a Micro Center don't have
these units on display or demo for you
to try out you have to hope a friend has
a pair or something that you can listen
to because headphones and headsets are
very subjective what I may like you may
not what you may like I may not so it's
very difficult to translate that but all
I can do is tell you how my personal
opinion on these which unfortunately are
not headsets that you will see me
wearing in the future now like I said
the beginning of the video today's video
was brought to you by Harry's now
Harry's is something I normally wouldn't
do an advertisement for however the fact
that they are the official razor for
Movember they are giving back to the
foundation to try and bring awareness to
men's health and find cures for prostate
cancer testicular cancer and other
things plaguing men I figured that this
is something that I was passionate about
so I wanted to go ahead and do it now I
had never tried any sort of a razor
service like this I typically go over to
the grocery store and deal with trying
to find that guy with the key to unlock
the razors and then pay an ridiculous
amount of money for razors from those
big brands which I'll admit I hate doing
and tweet my wife at miss J's two cents
or mrs. J's two cents I'd say right
we're married right miss missus anyway
you could tweet her and ask her off to
not buy razors it's not very often
because I tend to use them until they
are just dull pieces of metal
ripping my face apart ripping the hair
out rather than cutting because that's
how much I truly hate shaving but I was
pleasantly surprised when this thing
showed up because I was expecting just a
razor but I ended up getting a razor a
very cool shade of orange by the way an
extra razor blade a cover here so that
when you put it inside of your shower
bag it's not going to be getting gunk
all over it a nice can of very nicely
scented foaming gel for shaving your
face and then also a exfoliating daily
facial wash I love exfoliating
especially in the morning and then you
also get some aftershave lotion which is
a big deal because I tend to get a lot
of razor burn now the cool thing about
harrys.com as well is the fact that you
can order just one or you can send it
for a subscription but either way if you
look in the description you will find a
coupon code offered here just two J's
two cents followers where you can get
five dollars off your first order but
the biggest deal of all to me is the
fact that Harry's is contributing
towards a Movember foundation which is
furthering men's health as a whole
anyway thanks for watching today's video
guys and thanks for listening to my
spiel about Harry's like I said it is
close to me cancer runs rampant on both
sides of my family as well as my wife's
family so I thought that this was
something that definitely needed to be
included in the month of November I'm
gonna get out of here guys check the
description for that coupon code let me
know how you guys felt about today's
headset like I said I'm on the fence
maybe you have them maybe you've
listened to them maybe you think I'm
just full of and that's okay too
but anyway guys I'm gonna get out of
here and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
