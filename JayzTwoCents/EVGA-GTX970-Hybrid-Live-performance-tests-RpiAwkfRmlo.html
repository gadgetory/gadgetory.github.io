bringing another hybrid card to their
lineup they've already got the 980 980ti
and Titan X hybrid cards
well now we're taking a look at their
brand new 970 hybrid the lik max to 120
and 240 from enter max is another
awesome choice of a io liquid coolers
for gamers and enthusiasts without
breaking the bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more I'll admit I was a little
confused when they asked me if I wanted
to check out the 970 hybrid because I
thought the card is over a year old
you've already got a 980 980 TI and
Titan X hybrid does it make sense for
someone to buy a water-cooled 970
instead of taking that extra money and
putting in to say a 980 well when I
asked them that they responded with well
the 970 hybrid is only 399 dollars
making the 980 even a reference style
980 $100 more expensive than this option
maybe this makes sense so I thought yeah
definitely worth taking a look at to see
if this thing at a hundred bucks less
than a 980 makes sense now I am NOT
doing a specific 980 comparison with
this today I'm gonna be doing that in
the future because if I did a 980
comparison today and then videoed like
I'm gonna do today about its
overclocking and water cooling setup on
here the video would have been way too
long as I fear this video is already
gonna be long so there will be a future
video about this thing vs. 980 and other
brand options specifically from AMD in
the same price point to see how this
thing holds up given its a water-cooled
card that is about a year and two months
old so make sure you guys stay tuned for
that but anyway here it is the GTX 970
but you might notice one there's no
backplate and two it is the small style
970 it's pretty much the ITX card that
they put an extended cooler on hung the
fan off the back of it and then you've
got a fan that is cooling all the
components on the PCB including the VRMs
and then of course you've got a radiator
that is keeping the core itself nice and
cool now I'm okay with there not being a
backplate on this one and I'm gonna let
it slide because we've given up the
backplate for a water cooler and kept
the price point affordable yeah a
backplate might have
made this thing cost ten bucks more but
there's gonna be some give-and-take I
guess I would have liked to have seen a
backplate I really really would have but
I kind of understand why they didn't do
it on this one oh well anyway the front
of it here does have a blower style fan
which as I mentioned it's going to blow
air over the components that are on the
PCB and then we do have a really nice
technically it's a faux aluminum it kind
of looks like an aluminum shroud on here
it is plastic but it's very realistic in
fact I couldn't really tell at first if
it was real aluminum or not so I emailed
EVGA and asked them is that real or not
it is faux for real fake it's not real
but whatever inputs are the same you got
to DVI is you got an hdmi 2.0 as well as
a DisplayPort and then just like
standard 970 because this is a standard
reference card not even like an SC or an
SSD or a for the win this is just
straight-up mini ITX 970 form factor
with like I said an extended cooler on
here so nothing custom about this
whatsoever which made me wonder why did
you water cool the one that's not got
any of the additional power phases or
any of that stuff is it gonna matter
well guys let's go ahead and find out
right now
okay so what I'm really interested in
today's video is just to see how far we
can actually push this thing and does
the water cooling really matter when it
comes to the 970 so I'm not gonna be
running through my entire gambit of
games and stuff that are normally
benchmark simply because we've done so
many different 970 reviews and given the
fact that this is basically an nvidia
standard PCB even the short PCB I'm not
going to waste a lot of your viewer time
I know the questions here really are
does it overclock really well does the
over this the water cooling really
matter and how cool does it really run
so here's what we're gonna do we're
gonna be using some valley benchmark
here and then we will do one real-world
benchmark because you guys want to see
more of those real-world benchmarks and
we will take a look at well look at
battlefront because I think battlefront
although it's a new game it's using an
older engine a lot of graphics cards can
really push battlefront and I thought
we'd see how it performs all the way up
to 4k on this graphics card now right
now you can see we're idling at 27
degrees Celsius which is actually very
very good let's do this now let's go
ahead and run valley here it's let it
run for just a few seconds actually
let's see what this card is boosting up
to by itself and then we will go ahead
and we will see how well this thing is
able to overclock now I'm using EVGA
precision 16 and the reason for that is
I want to make sure that by using
something like MSI Afterburner there's
no missing function sometimes EVGA cards
like the kingpin card there's a lot of
functions that are unlocked in EVGA
considering it's their in-house software
I want to make sure that we are using
you know the we're getting full
potential out of this card by not maybe
somehow limiting it by using msi
afterburner so valley benchmarks what
I'm using here extreme HD which is
basically 1080p and all the settings
pretty much are maxed out when you do
extreme HD and then we're gonna go ahead
and see how this thing does now there is
also going to be an overlay on screen
here up on the left hand side it's gonna
be probably a little bit difficult to
see simply because it is kind of over
laying on top of valley there and you
can see it boosted up to thirteen
hundred and fifty-four megahertz memory
clock is at 3500 six and the GPU
temperature is sitting at about 35 C so
we'll let this go here for
just a couple of minutes maybe I'll fast
forward he'll let this go for a couple
of minutes and we'll see what the max
temperature ended up being as you can
see - the memory usage is only sitting
at about about one gigabyte of usage
it's just pretty typical for a synthetic
benchmark like this it's it's all on a
track it's free rendered and it's not
going to be using up too much of your
vram after all man it is a 970 which
means we do only have 3.5 gigabytes of
high speed V RAM available to the card
so if you start pushing really high-end
resolutions like 4k and stuff you might
start bumping up into that cat
temperature sitting right now at 39 C
it's probably gonna peak right around
here based on some experiences I've
already had with this car because I have
been playing around this card obviously
prior to this video I like to give you
guys raw impressions and reactions and
stuff but at the same time I kind of got
to know what I'm getting myself into
make sure the card is working make sure
it's not dead or needs to be are made
and as you can see here 13 54 megahertz
is where we've pretty much peaked out
here it's stuck there though it hasn't
been fluctuating at all GPU boost 2.0
it's sitting about where the air-cooled
card would be I you know I do have
multiple EVGA SSC 970 s here which are
custom PCBs and they do also sit right
around the same mark when it comes to
GPU boost so the water cooling initially
is not really making it go any farther
in terms of GPU boost 2.0 but of course
we care about how far we can push this
thing and does the water cooling really
affect your max overclock so that's kind
of the point of today's video also - you
can see we did hit 41 C for a minute
there it's also important to note that
this room is closed right now there's no
air flow into this room no air
conditioner so the temperature is going
to probably rise a little bit
considering the fact that we are you
know in a closed room here now one other
thing I want to do real quick is I want
to go ahead and run the synthetic
benchmark here get a score because I
want to see how far the score also
improves when it comes to you know the
overclocking on this
all right so the test is done here are
our numbers and average FPS of 57.8
score of 24 18 minimum of twenty eight
point eight and a max of 108 point eight
there's a lot of eights here eight
eighty so anyway that is our baseline
temperatures stuck to about 42 C which
I'm actually surprising and go higher
than that concern in this room is
warming up even though it's December it
is gonna be 85 degrees Fahrenheit here
today good old California all right so
let's go ahead and close this and let's
do some benchmarking what I also like
about this card is just how fast the
temperatures come down as you can see
we're already down to 36 and it will go
all the way back down into about 30 flat
high 20s no problem whatsoever
now the fan just like on the 980 hybrid
and 980ti hybrid this controls the
on-board fan that is actually on the PCB
not the fan that's on the radiator I do
still wish that they would have made the
fan on the radiator controllable as
that's going to more or less control
your temperatures not the fan on the PCB
so that's something I really wish would
have been the case although this is at
adding active cooling to the V RMS and
it's blowing air over the PCB which is
keeping all those components cool so I
wish that there would have been like
other brands are doing allowing you to
control the fan on the radiator a few
moments later so you can see right here
the numbers are 1560 megahertz it's a
plus 206 on the core really plus 205 is
where I where I considered it to be the
most stable but my OCD was not liking
1559 on the core so I mean at 1560
memory overclock was 37 58 total sets a
plus 250 on the memory which was giving
us was giving us about a 7500 and 16
megahertz effective ram speech is pretty
good you can see our max temperature
here is 42 C I've had this thing running
for a little while now doing some
stability testing
in fact it's been running for about
about 20 minutes now and then I
restarted the test for this particular
take what we're gonna do now is go ahead
and hit f9 to start the benchmark and
then we are going to see how much the
score and the averages and stuff
actually improved if at all so we'll go
ahead and fast forward this here so we
don't waste too much of your valuable
YouTube watching time okay so you can
see our score came up to 26 ninety-one
average FPS came up quite a few to sixty
four point three minimum thirty one
point seven and a max all the way up to
120 two point two so you can see we
gained quite a bit by overclocking this
card alright it's going to check out
some battlefront and see how this thing
can do so the settings here in Star Wars
we'll just do a quick test here at 1080p
1440 and 4k everything is on high
settings here whatever the high preset
is I'm not gonna do that's great let's
do Ultra we do the ultra preset so FPS
is looking pretty good here I mean but
the game is not very demanding which is
one of the reasons why we're doing this
yeah I only hide around the corner on me
oh oh no no I you about to kill a friend
so you can see we're getting well over a
hundred FPS here in 1080p mode
constantly over 100 FPS we've got some
dips here in the lower hundreds
let's do this now let's go ahead and
change this to 1440p and see how it does
dill over 60fps it looks like but FPS as
you can see even in 1440p is really
really good not have any problems
playing here
I killed myself all right as do 4k see
how 4k is doing a single 970 playing
some 4k here it looks like we're
chilling in the 40s that's actually
really good
everything looks so sharp and so pretty
this game is so freakin pretty I swear I
love how pretty this game is down to the
30s in this room here's a lot of
lighting in here though
I like first-person view a lot of people
give me a hard time like no you should
play in third-person
I like first-person that's why it's an
FPS not a TPS it's in a third-person
shooter fps biatch well I think that
ought to give you guys some ideas of
what to expect with the performance of
this 970 so let's get out of here with
some final thoughts you know this is a
really interesting time for this card to
come out if he asked me because the 970
has been under a lot of fire not only
because of the crossbar issue with the
RAM making it 3.5 gigabyte sonam a true
4 gigabyte card but the fact that AMD's
300 series really targeted the 970 in
trying to kick the 970 off of its perch
as being the best bang for buck graphics
card when it comes to system builders
and gamers no I was really surprised
that EVGA went the route of making a
hybrid 970 considering the card is over
a year old I mean the card came out in
September of 2014 well over a year ago
so why bring the hybrid series to the
970 well obviously that's because
there's a lot of benefit still to owning
a 970 today and considering they already
have hybrids on the 980 and 980 TI and
tight next cards it really made sense
for them to do this now I was concerned
when they first hit me up about this
card and asking me to do this review was
is there a way I could do this review
and have it not just be nothing but me
talking about it didn't make sense to
put a water cooler on a 970 but
considering they kept the price at 399
for this water-cooled card yeah it
doesn't have a backplate but I think
I'll let it slide on this one
considering we can give it the backplate
get a water cooling solution on here
this kind of overclocking these kinds of
temperatures the temperatures never went
above 43 degrees Celsius I think now
a water cooling solution at this price
point of 399 does make a lot of sense
now it's $100 less than a 980 but this
thing overclocked is giving you 980
performance in fact it's very very close
to 980 overclocked performance it's not
that far off now I'm definitely gonna
have to do a video in the future where I
take this card and put it up against a
980 now obviously the 980 will beat it
stock for stock and once you overclock
the 980 it will pull ahead of the 971
overclock even this water-cooled card
but it's important to take a look at
price to performance ratio and I really
want to compare what the FPS per dollar
is between a 980 and the 970 hybrid it's
definitely worth taking a look at like I
said $100 cheaper and you're getting
this kind of performance so if you guys
want to see that video make sure you let
me know in the comments if you guys are
interested in that performance per
dollar and then we'll do the same thing
with like this card versus a 390
considering this is right around the
price of a 390 on AMD side in fact I
even told EVGA that they might have shot
themselves in the foot by this video
proving that you don't need custom
high-end PCBs to get really good
overclocking unless you're gonna be
doing something like ln2 or serious
voltage modding but even then you would
be running not even necessarily water
you'd be running like liquid nitrogen or
even chill system some sort on your card
to keep those temperatures under check
once you start getting like 2 volts of
you know GPU core time to get out of
here guys thanks for watching we got a
lot of cool stuff coming and like I said
I've got a complete system giveaway I'm
gonna be doing so make sure you
subscribe so that you can check that out
it's gonna be a lot of fun we're gonna
build it we're gonna see how it does and
then we're going to give the thing away
including a monitor keyboard and mouse
you don't want to miss that
alright guys thanks for watching it as
always I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
