back from vacation and we got loud
noises and stuff going on but I've got a
video to make about graphics cards today
and I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I'm not
gonna stop for the noises so if you guys
hear any funky loud or pumps sounds just
deal with it okay Coursera is proud to
present their new Hydra X line of custom
water cooling products the new XG 5
series radiators offer the perfect
balance of finden s'ti and airflow to
keep your loop cool and quiet
the XG 7 water blocks feature
full-coverage cooling through GPU while
also maintaining an aesthetically
pleasing design while the XC 7 and XC 9
cpu blocks keep all your modern cpus
nice and cool to see the complete lineup
of high directs cooling products from
corsair click the link in the
description below
alright so did you guys listen to my
video where I said don't buy anything
yet well usually ones when when someone
like myself or Paul or tile or Linus or
Dimitri or whoever says you guys should
wait you should listen do you know why
because obviously we get this stuff
ahead of time and we know what's coming
and I feel bad because I came back from
vacation and there were messages in my
inbox saying hey Jay I saw a video
saying I should wait to buy but I went
ahead and bought 20 70 and it's like
you're gonna find out today why you
should go return that card because we've
got three new SKUs from Nvidia here the
2060 super 2070 super and the 2080 Super
which we don't have our hands on yet not
to be confused with the TI because ok
their TI models ok they just called it
super which i think is super stupid but
that's just my opinion and that doesn't
really matter I mean you could you could
you could call it tamp X Edition for all
I care if it performs it performs ok I
don't really care and just call it super
fps absorbent who cares when it when it
comes to the graphics card lineup it's
interesting because we are on the cusp
of AMD's 5700 series embargo lifts and
so it's so much is happening right now
we didn't know pricing on this when we
got the cards we had the cards in hand
before we even knew what they cost which
is interesting in fact when I did on my
last video about these cards coming
nobody knew what the price was yet so it
was kind of like everyone was sort of
like kind of waiting for the trying to
fake out the next guy to see who's gonna
go and well Nvidia went and they
announced their pricing and
well AMD just sent us an email
announcing that they have reduced the
price up to 5700 XC and 50 750 Bucks
respectively in each card because the
pricing of these cards are finally
announced so that kind of makes it's
actually kind of good news because it
means our review would have probably
been a little bit skewed and the fact
that we waited to do our super review
until I got back from vacation was kind
of a good thing because now I think
we'll have the most price accurate
information in our video
sometimes late it's better than never I
guess and by the time this video goes
live the embargo yes there was an
embargo on pricing you believe that okay
whatever when it comes to our charts
there's a couple things you need to know
here we compared it to the Radeon 64 and
the Radeon 7 for a couple of reasons one
the vega 56 fell off the bottom of the
chart
it didn't even it didn't even come close
to matching the 2060 super and it barely
met the 2060 the only reason 2060 is
even on the charts because we need to
see how much of an improvement you're
getting with the super model the other
thing too is a 5,700 series like I said
it's still under embargo so we can't
share that information with you until
that embargo lifts which you'll then see
complete charts in that video of all
these and how they stack up so without
further ado let's go ahead and show you
the charts and one thing to keep in mind
is you look at these these are founders
edition cards so when it comes to
pricing we're comparing it to Founders
Edition pricing from Nvidia which as you
know is a little bit of a premium MSRP
cards are hard to find the AIB partners
are the AIB Board partners all believe
that their cards are better and superior
to the founders Edition cards I mean
they won't necessarily come out and say
it but they all believe that they're
better they put more engineering better
coolers and all that sort of stuff on
there
so finding an MSRP cards hard usually
they're at least the same price of a
founders Edition and often times more if
you're looking at like Strix models and
like XC ultras and you know Galax
whatever cards alright so that's
something to keep in mind as you look at
these charts we also have no 4k numbers
for the 2070 because we don't have a
Founders Edition 2070 card and we did
that testing I was kind of on a no one
should use the 2070 for 4k just 1440p or
high FPS 1080 so you're gonna notice
that figure is kind of missing from that
card if you think we should start
including 4k on all benchmarks let us
know in the comments below and we'll
start
do that for every single card model but
we kind of ran out of time and for
testing on this to get this information
out I still think if you're running 4k
you should be running like the most
expensive card that you can get which
should be 2080 and above to be honest
but let's go ahead and show you those
benchmarks so that you can try and
digest all of the craziness happening
right now in GPU land
so it's no surprise that the supermodels
are faster than their non super variants
thanks for watching today's video guys
are knows that that's kind of what it
comes down to but let's talk about value
here because there might be value in the
McLaren to someone who was getting ready
to buy like a shear on right so you can
say oh I was gonna spend three million
dollars on a car but I got a deal like
five hundred thousand right so it's all
relative so it's up to you to determine
where the value is on this so the 2060
super is fifty dollars more than the
standard 2060 but for that extra 50
bucks you're getting a bump in CUDA
cores you're getting a bump in vram as
well you're getting eight gigabytes of
gddr5 memory bandwidth versus the six
gigabytes found in the standard 2060 so
that means the 2060 being questionable
with modern titles at 1440p that need
eight gigabytes of vram because various
titles could easily like especially rise
of the tomb raider or shadow of the tomb
raider you could easily bump into that
six gigs no problem and when once you
hit that that overhead or that Headroom
you start to notice stutters and stuff
in your gaming because you ran out at
vram so having two extra gigabytes of
vram and not just a nominal kuduk or
increase with a clock increase you're
getting at least something for that 50
bucks these the the true story here
today though is the 2070 super
completely sliding into the exact same
pricing point as the 2017 on super so
that means that you're getting 2080
level performance for significantly less
with the 2080 launched at nearly a year
ago it launched at a seven hundred and
ninety nine dollar founders edition
pricing in august of 2018 here we are
now in july of 2019 and it's got an MSRP
of four hundred and ninety nine dollars
well the 2080 is also getting a kind of
a new model replacement with the super
edition and although we haven't tested
that to see how it compares to the 2080
TI i can tell you the 20 ATT i also got
a $200 price reduction at 999 dollars
for the founders card and remember it
was a $9.99 for the non founders MSRP so
it was too
hundred dollar premium there to get a
founder so I don't know if we're gonna
see possibly at $800 20 atti model but I
can tell you that everything sort of
shifted down while the performance sort
of shifted up which tells us that all
along that could have probably been the
case with r-tx I could have probably
launched it at a much cheaper price
point and given you a great level of
performance making a lot less of a
distaste out there for the r-tx adoption
rate because everyone felt like it was
an expensive premium to to get DX our
level gaming and and and the price you
had to pay to get good fps but now that
we've seen an improvement in RTX
performance because of maturity in DX r
and coding for it and getting everything
sort of patched and smoothed out it's
not that hard now to get 60 plus FPS the
problem was if you got 60 FPS with a
$1,200 graphics card that's just kind of
like that's definitely not gonna make
anyone happy regardless how pretty the
scene looks so seeing the prices come
down is definitely a step in the right
direction and seeing the 28 a super be
cheaper than the 2080 was and be closer
to a TI model performance is obviously a
huge step in the right direction
but seeing the 2070 be at the same price
point as a 2080
currently actually cheaper because 28 es
right now still cost over $800 but
seeing a 490 dollar or for $99 price
point for 2070 super means you're
getting that $800 pricing performance
level a year ago for $300 less so that's
all a move in the right direction
whether or not that's worth it to you
though only you can answer that like I
use that terrible analogy a minute ago
of McLaren versus a Chiron that is I
mean those are not those are two
completely non comparable you know
fruits right there and that's kind of
the same thing going on here but the
reason why we included Radeon seven and
Vega 64 is as you can see the Vegas 64
is more expensive than a 2060 Super but
it's being beaten by the 2060 super in
many tests I just wanted to include the
Radeon 7 so you could see how the gaming
performance stacks up at that price
point problem as Radeon 7 was a fairly
limited card which means pricing didn't
really adjust to come down which means
you're still spending over $600 on a
card being beaten by a $499
card.if gaming is what you're shopping
for so there's a lot of ifs when it
comes to this there's lots of skews on
an invidious side now because at the
time of making this video you've got an
overlap of the 60 and the super the 70
on the super and then the 80 on the
super and then the di and then 1660 TI
is 60 60 and 1650 probably coming in the
future I don't know it's one of those
things where it's now kind of like
confusing to look at all of this and go
okay don't want to spend $50 more and
get 15% ish more performance or don't
want to say the 15 get this more should
I just been a hundred that's the problem
I think with having a product stack that
that's this dense but the reason for
that is this is competition this is
competition and we're seeing in video
respond by giving you more performance
and it's kind of funny the 2060 is the
one that increased to be honest the 2018
the 2070 those are the ones that shifted
this way but the 60 kind of went that
way it came up and priced slightly
whereas the overall value of the 2080
super is cheaper than launch pricing but
more performance at a lesser price so
the 2060 kind of went more towards the
middle I think that's because it had to
get away from the 16 60 TI performance
because member when the 16 60 TI
launched we said it was too close to a
2060 to not justify just buying a 2060
and at least having the arti cores in
the tensor course so it's a crazy
discussion but yeah the 2070 is
definitely the one that I think shows
well at least the better performance per
dollar because it's the same price with
the performance levels of nearly a 20-18
on Ti so anyway we can't complete this
this review technically you can see how
they stack up versus the current models
that are available here because we like
I said are just days away from another
product launch with more graphics cards
and we still don't have the 2080 Super
in our hand so this is sort of an
incomplete video this is where you guys
chime in I'm curious in the way the blob
thinks and I'm referring to this as a
blob because individual opinions are all
considered outliers and think of it as a
big giant Venn diagram with a million
different circles and where they all
overlap that's kind of where we want to
focus on our reviews in the way that we
kind of handle is moving forward so what
I'd like you guys to do is explain which
card on both sides in this lineup you
would buy and why I'm also curious as to
what other titles you think we should
start testing with because a lot more
modern titles have come out since we
started with this suite about two years
ago with a certain the current lineup
that we have and I want to include more
modern titles to give you guys a bigger
picture of how these cards actually
perform so this is where you guys sound
off in the comments below on how you
feel about the super Edition cards which
I mean yeah they got some shine on there
and they say super which I guess is kind
of super cool but I'm just waiting for
the 2017 Super T I phone another truth
you know it's out there it's coming
right see the Super T I gender son
edition we've got a that's a little
leather jacket wears a little leather
jacket on there sound off in the
comments below and I'm really curious as
to how you guys feel about this it's the
first time we've seen seen Nvidia come
and kind of revamp an entire lineup
which is sort of depressing because that
means we're probably not gonna see a
next generation of r-tx based cards
anytime soon because they just gave us
that nominal little evolutionary jump in
performance on the same edition which
hopefully means that we're gonna see
good things in terms of a performance
increase in DXR with next-gen
performance or hardware which is
probably not coming anytime in 2019 so
anyway that's all I gotta say about that
guys we've got a lot of Hardware views
coming up on this channel this is this
Hardware review season and I'm loving it
we've got CPUs we got more GPUs to talk
about we've got I'm gonna give it away
I've got some things planned that I'm
not even sure how I'm gonna do it I'm
probably gonna suck at it which is
what's gonna make it entertaining but
anyway guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
