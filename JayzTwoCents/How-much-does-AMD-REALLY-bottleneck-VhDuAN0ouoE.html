too big on me but I really like it
because it tells you exactly what you
should keep in mind when you go into the
comments of today's video so when I did
the five hundred and fifty dollar gaming
PC and I chose AMD as my processor
specifically the 8320 everyone kind of
flipped their and I knew as I was
building that system I was like I'm
gonna follow this up with a
bottlenecking video it's been a long
time since I've done one admittedly all
the way back to the 3770k that was still
new when I did a bottlenecking video if
that gives you any idea of how long it's
been so we're gonna do today is we're
gonna take some high-end Hardware play
some games and we're going to take the
8320 an we're going to play some games
both of them on gtx 1080s we're gonna
see how much of an FPS difference there
really is today's video is brought to
you by me I made it I brought it to you
all I'm askin is that if you're new
around here if you've been lurking for a
while why'd you go and hit that
subscribe button we'd like to join you
here to the cool kids club showing that
you have some of the best taste in tech
youtubers and all of the internet and
Who am I kidding this channels mediocre
at best but I digress either way it's
still like you to hit that subscribe
button and hang around for a little bit
but with that said let's go in jump into
today's video so before we turn and get
into some games there is some
methodology we have to get out of the
way here our baseline is going to be
done on an Intel i7 59 30k overclocked
to 4.4 gigahertz it's got 20 800
megahertz ddr4 HyperX predator RAM in
there it's running on a x99 for the win
and of course it is water-cooled now
some of you are already gonna be like
that's not fair because that's not
representing what the average gamer is
going to have I'm not trying to
replicate what the average gamers going
to have I'm trying to remove any
possibility of any choke points or
bottlenecks in the system to see exactly
what the GTX 1080 is capable of when the
CPU and all that is not gonna be holding
it back in any way now the point of
today's video is not to say that if you
have an AMD system that you won't be
bottlenecking or slowing down your FPS
the question is how much so that's the
point of today's video if you've gotten
any other impression out of this video
then I suggest you watch it again
because that is not the goal here
transition
we're going to start off here with a
little bit of 3d marked fire strike
normal because normal tends to have a
higher score which lets the GPU ramp up
go as fast as it can because it can pump
out a lot of frames in 1080 series we're
going to because this is a base test
here we're just going to let the test go
we're going to see what the GPU score is
and the combined score to kind of
compare what the differences are and
then we'll move on some games all right
so one the 59 30 K we got a twenty two
thousand 194 graphics score that's up
slightly from the score I got when I did
my initial testing it was like twenty
two thousand ninety seven or something
like that I mean we got a combined score
of eighteen thousand six seventy so
that's our baseline
alright so Metro last light here super
sampling is on tessellation all that Sun
normal and then the settings are on very
high so we're gonna let this test run
and check the FPS so our average
framerate on that was ninety three point
seven six with a minimum we're gonna
look at minimums here where they're
available with a thirteen point nine to
Metro last light though the minimums are
kind of misleading if you will because
when it starts it goes in single digits
sometimes okay so next gonna be doing
here some rise of the Tomb Raider we're
doing this in dx11 mode not 12
because AMD system is running on Windows
8.1 so I can't test that in DirectX 12
maybe that'd be a future video how much
does that alleviate some bottleneck but
I think we've already talked about that
a bit anyway here are the settings SMA
and all that junk so let's go ahead and
run the benchmark and then we'll see
what again what our average FPS is rise
of the Tomb Raider overall score 130
0.06 so 130 FPS was our average so here
are the settings right here ambient
occlusion hi everything's high and very
high no reflection MSA population
densities all up and then be sync off TX
a is off of NSA's at 2 X and FX AAA is
on of course we're at 1080 so those are
the settings we're going to apply
and we are going to do the beginning
mission with Franklin where he has to
repo the car I like that because it's on
a track and it's the same every time I
do it you can see the FPS counter up
there in the corner
obviously we're getting a lot of FPS
here so we're going to do once we start
the driving I start my fraps benchmark
and then it will measure the FPS while
I'm playing
okay so we got rip fraps running up here
I'm going to let it do its benchmark
while we go and then at the end of this
when we get to the parking garage we'll
stop it and we'll see what the average
FPS was all right average of 156 FPS is
what that red number was alright next up
is shadow of Mordor preset is on ultra
of course we're running 1080p with
unlimited FPS and we're going to do the
benchmark and then were going to follow
the benchmark with actual gameplay to
see what kind of variants there is there
too because I know I'm not sure if this
benchmark is as rough on the graphics
and CPU as playing the actual game would
be so let's run this see what the
settings give us and then we'll play
some games team
all right average FPS 160 5.21 max of
233 and a minimum of 98 technically 99
it was 98 point nine four all right so
it's going to do a game and see if we
get those same type of FPS I don't think
we will I believe in the game I think
it's limited but I've spent a long time
since I played this game I'm not sure
yeah so just like I thought inside the
game here we are limited to 100 FPS okay
so as expected amp es has just locked at
100 so I guess we're going to see if we
get any less than 100 on the AMD system
okay so as we start the Metro last light
test here I put some stuff up on the
screen for you guys to check out we've
got the GPU temperature GPU usage and
GPU frequency as well as the CPU
temperature and the CPU usage on the
bottom so what you kind of want to look
for now going forward on this test with
the AMD system is as the CPU usage goes
up you'll probably see the GPU usage
start to go down because the GPU is
having to wait for the CPU to can finish
whatever tasks it has going in its queue
but so far though it doesn't look like
the GPU is bouncing around too much I
mean it's sitting in the upper 90s it
went down to the 70s for a second and
back up to the 90s and you can see the
temperature is going up on the GPU and
the frequency is staying pretty steady
so we'll just let this run and then
we'll compare it to the first result on
the i7 system
so here's a score eighty five point two
one a minimum frame rate of one point
one seven there were some pretty there
was like two or three major stutters in
there during explosions and that's
obviously where the minimum frame rate
came from but yeah so here's how those
compared to the i7i sunrise the tomb
raider you can see the GPU usage in
percentage right there
is down quite a bit compared to the CPU
usage going up so you can see the CPU
usage is sitting right around
seventy-five to fifty is bouncing around
quite a bit but as the CPU usage goes up
you'll notice the GPU usage goes down
so you can see our here our overall
score is a ninety two point six two and
that's how this compared to the i7
system here so you can see there's a
difference question is how much I don't
know I'm actually putting out the
differences here I forgot what the
scores were so I'm going to kind of
learn along with you all right same test
here with Grand Theft Auto 5 ok the
average on this one was 91 so that came
down a bit obviously from the i7 system
which is funny because the CPU wasn't
pegged but the GPU wasn't going to 100%
either
alright shout out more doors up we're
gonna run the benchmark and then just
like before we're gonna run the game
okay so here's before and after a shadow
of mordor average FPS 120 5.9 max FPS
205 point 6 1 and minimum FPS 81 and
that's how that compared to the i7
system now in the game I'm pretty sure
we're going to see the same results as
before just a cap of 100 FPS even with
the AMD system if we are still sitting
at that hundred FPS number CPU usage is
down in the 40s and high 30s GPU usage
is in the 60s ok one last test to do
that is the fire strike score and based
on what we've seen so far across the
board we would expect to see the GPU
score on fire strike fall how much I
don't know we know the combined score is
definitely going to be lower because of
the fact that I seven system is a
extreme you know x99 motherboard with a
12 thread CPU in there that is
overclocked so I obviously the combined
score will be lower here but we care
about is the GPU score is the CPU
causing GPU to slow down I mean it is
but the question is how much
okay so here's the final result eleven
thousand seven twenty nine on the
combined we expected that to come down
it came down about seven thousand points
but the graphic score only came down a
little under four hundred points there
as you can see twenty one thousand eight
thirty three is what we got versus of
twenty two thousand two hundred
something on the i7 so it really wasn't
that much different now one could almost
deduce from the firestrike score is that
the 8320 is not really bottlenecking
the gtx 1080 now the reason why that
test shows very close scores compared to
the actual games is the fact that fire
strike is optimized to stress the GPU
and put all of the tasks on the GPU with
the exception of the combined physics
with the CPU and the CPU only test
that's why the combined score or the
total score is much lower now in the
case of games what's actually happening
here is the CPU is taking longer to do
its cpu specific tasks like figuring out
where characters are where to put these
things on the screen what's actually
happening in the game because it's not
on a track and preloaded like synthetic
benchmarks so the GPU spent some time
waiting which is why it doesn't spend
all of its time up in the ninety ninety
five ninety nine percent usage range
because the CPU is handling its overall
job a lot slower again as I said in the
beginning though today's video is not
about whether or not AMD does or doesn't
bottleneck I think it goes without
saying that it does create a choke point
in your system if you match an AMD like
8320 or 8350 with a very high-end modern
GPU like the GTX 1080 or god forbid even
like a Titan Pascal now the percentage
of what your games are going to slow
down is going to depend on the
optimization of the game itself and how
much CPU it really relies on there's
obviously very CPU dependent games out
there like City skylines I think it's
called but forgive me if I got that
wrong obviously those games like Daisy
HN h1n1 whatever those types of games
use a lot of CPU because there's a lot
of things it has to calculate that's
happening in the world because the world
is handled by the CPU the eye candy is
handled by the GPU so that's why things
like fire strike didn't show nearly as
much of a slowdown obviously I don't
think you should buy a 1080 and stick it
in an AMD system because you're going to
get a pretty diminished return on that
investment but I was just kind of
curious after I did that last video how
much
does it really slow it down you put in a
mid-range GPU like a 950 or a 1050 volt
if it doesn't exist yet or a 10 60 or
something like that you're not going to
see as much of a bottleneck but at least
as you did with a 1080 but the chances
are they're being a few percentage
points the difference in fps is
definitely going to be there because
again the CPU is still having to handle
those same tasks that I was having a
hard time doing with the 1080 anyway
what's happening is you put a lower-end
GPU that can't render those massive
amount of frames anyway then it's not
waiting for the CPU because they're
operating on a more equal level and in
tandem all right guys time to go hope
this videos helped as I said
careful careful if you go down into the
comments section of this video it's
going to be a flame fest I don't even
think I'm going to visit that myself I
did the video I did the way I wanted to
do it and the information is there I
take you for what you will time to go
guys as always thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
