remember the video I put up very
recently of me going and getting two-way
SLI you know number one scores on 3dmark
gamers Nexus has thrown down the
gauntlet he has beaten my score in time
spy extreme there it is right there
we'll put it we'll put it up there but
look the Canadian J is two cents we
still don't know why it says Canadia
even three mark doesn't know but gamers
Nexus has beat me by over 300 points we
can't have that that is not acceptable
that is not going to fly with me because
I've talked a lot of smack so I've got
to back it up so here's what we came up
with pretty simple I threw it together
in my spare time let's uh let's take a
quick look at what we did here and then
yeah let's see if we can't take back the
leaderboard before Paul and Kyle even
get their foot in the race we are going
to get the finish line me and Steve
probably and volkov they're good to EVGA
offers a full range of components
including video cards motherboards power
supplies cases and peripherals
regardless of your needs EVGA sure to
have you covered to see what EVGA can do
for your next build head to EVGA comm so
here's what I came up with just sort of
all the things I put together in the
past all kind of came to one giant
solution here we've got the air
conditioner we've got the box fan we got
the four 480 rads we've got my custom
water-cooled reference design 20 atti
and you guys if you guys watch our last
video you see how we kind of mess around
with that but I have paired it with an
EVGA XC ultra which is yeah so I've got
two matched cards which is definitely
gonna help and I don't feel bad saying
that we've got some some extra sauce in
here or sawsan Steve use shut mods so I
don't feel bad
pulling out all the stops and going with
software modding now if you watch a
video long enough you guys or you watch
my channel long enough you guys remember
the 780 cards ahead 7 80s those were
custom hacked BIOS and all that stuff
let's just say there's a little bit of
old-school flavor in these cards which
should give me the edge the moment Steve
went with the shut mod all bets are off
this is war
now a little bit of quick background on
this beef real quick this is a friendly
beef
we are friends this is all in good fun
because we all know the real
overclockers like devour and and Vince
kingpin and in the slinky PC and all of
them are gonna get there Ln two setups
going soon and we are just going to fall
off the top 10 pretty quickly so we're
enjoying this while we can also too
while Steve was doing his livestream
technically last night he beat my score
and had a score that could be his but
then he beat it by so much I had to come
in to the studio so I actually drove in
late last night half sleep fatigued I
was actually running a 5 gigahertz
overclock at 5.1 for a little while
actually overclock on the CPU pushing
1.5 volts the CPU is hooked up to the
air conditioner and the quad read so it
was staying plenty cool during the
3dmark test any other CPU tests would
have just overheated it so I came in I
flipped on the system and then
immediately shut off and it dawned on me
I forgot to turn on my pump because my
pump is this guy right here being
powered by an external power supply that
I forgot to turn on I over heated it so
badly so quickly that it actually shut
off before it even got to the splash
screen and ever since then I have not
been able to get anywhere near the
overclocks I had before because I'm
pretty sure I killed some transistors
with the instant heat that it saw which
means that it's no longer an amazing
overclocker that was a that was a golden
chip and I killed it Steve your flesh
would be enough to where you made me
degrade and damage my CPU so we are at a
disadvantage today already I'm gonna say
that right now we are going for combined
score on that leaderboard and because
the CPU is not giving me the score as I
was before I've got to make up for it
with graphics and I'm hoping this
setting or this setup will do that
so here's we're gonna do we're gonna go
ahead and just kind of run our first
test see what the figures are what the
numbers are I'm not going to go through
all the settings that we're doing on
this I'm going to be tweaking things
like system memory CPU s obviously the
CPU specs mesh voltages mesh ratios all
that stuff a whole nother video that you
would not be able to get through today
and we are going to be trying to find
our sweet spot between RAM on the
GDD are six as well as core because the
max speeds are not always the fastest
speeds so let's go ahead and see what we
come up with okay so that's not gonna
work I mean my original score was a
fourteen thousand four three I just got
a thirteen thousand four six one now
remember we are doing combined score
this is what gets you the leaderboard so
my graphic score is significantly lower
than it was before
fourteen thousand zero zero two CPU
scores okay it's down about two hundred
points from my maximum like I said I
hurt my CPU so I don't know if were
gonna get that any higher but I was
using two of the MSI these are the
gaming X trio cards or custom PCBs and
stuff but I what the problem with these
cards is they just what's the problem
call twenty eight et is extremely power
limited so I was not able to get these
BIOS hat to be honest but it was easier
to to get some modded bios for the
reference PCBs rather than you know
having to go through the manufacturer
themselves now we need to start playing
around with our GPU overclock to see
what we can do I don't want to touch CPU
I want us GPU because I mean that's
stable now I spent hours upon hours last
night just trying to get anywhere near
five gigs again I said about 200 points
below where I was in my last test I'm
afraid to touch it for the sake of
stability it's working Lee Berlin leave
it alone and ain't broke don't fix
actually it is broke I tried to fix and
that was the problem so alright we're
gonna go to overclock our GPUs just a
tad we're going to start with core clock
and then we will see what we end up with
now they're really observant
out there in internet land probably
noticed that we are not online our
results we don't want to upload our
results as we're doing it test after
test after test we are basically offline
then we're gonna save and upload just
like Steve does in his live stream so we
are going to do the best we can to get
to that 14 367 maybe in at 14 3 6 8 and
I'd be happy and then we're gonna upload
that but you know I'll talk about
something in the difference between
doing this on video versus doing this on
live stream you can snipe a live stream
you can watch and see what their
settings are and go from there by doing
this in video I can keep my settings
secret and I'm definitely gonna do that
because don't forget
J'son dickhole
all right well that's not the result we
were hoping for I actually lost a little
bit of graphic score by going up a
little bit before I won 100 on the core
clock uh yeah here we go here you go we
go oh okay our that came up
significantly fourteen thousand four
eight one we're really getting a
thirteen thousand eight thirty one
combined score oh I can't even match my
own score it's okay he's Tech Jesus I'm
tech Judas we will get through this
Judas betrayed Jesus if you didn't know
okay fourteen thousand one two - that's
so I beat my old score I'm still about
two hundred and ten points behind Steve
CPU score is extremely consistent so
that's good it means my CPU is solid GPU
scores started coming up from 14,000 to
14,000 850 - I think my highest before
was a 1488 4 so yeah we're getting there
Oh 14,000 321 what was Steve's Steve's
was 14,000 367 so I am 46 points behind
him interestingly enough look at my CPU
score that came up to fifteen thousand
two to nine but my CPU dropped ten
thousand 705 that is we're like
whack-a-mole here right now I didn't
change anything on the CPU and suddenly
it drops so either something ran in the
background or Windows updates something
I don't know we're fully updated okay we
beat him fourteen thousand three seven
one beats his 14,000 three six seven
interestingly enough my CPU score came
back up well my GPU score dropped a
hundred points from our last test so
literally this is like that scene in
Fast and the Furious where DOM is
driving that that piece of crap in
Havana and it was like all falling apart
in Cuba and it was like on fire and he
was driving backwards that's kind of
what we're doing right now I'm sorry but
this is four points this is a four point
lead I don't think this is gonna hold up
his CPU score is an eleven thousand four
two two I'm eleven thousand Oh
6:3 so he's clearly got a commanding
lead on the cpu score his GPU score is a
fifteen thousand five three and I'm
15,000 won 7-2 so we are both like right
at the same level but with two different
weights if that makes sense so I don't
think that's gonna hold up if you can
get any more speed up as GPUs this this
will lose so I think I'm gonna go for
broke I'm gonna push it just a little
bit more just to get a little bit more
of a lead so we did it we beats we beat
Steve it was a long arduous hard path
14,000 468 that is what exactly 101
points higher than his score almost 300
points higher though on the GPU and let
me tell you what's kind of pissing me
off about this I'm comparing the results
online there it is right there 99
percent better I'm going to the Hall of
Fame and it's not updating I think he
broke he broke this last night when he
added his livestream and everyone was he
brought the site down and for some
reason it's not updating its does my old
score 14,000 oh-for-three
but if you look you can see his score 14
367 is indeed lower than my 14,000 468
valid score that's all we care about so
as soon as the Hall of Fame cache
updates we will be first on that
leaderboard again it's just I don't have
the instant gratification of looking at
it and seeing my name on there maybe one
more five more at fives nope clearly 3d
mark is biased this reminds me the old
days of overclocking where the guys were
just like come up with crazy convention
or non-conventional methods to cool
their stuff all the way to you know lnto
like now and it took me this crazy
contraption and all the cords on the
floor show the floor over there Phil
look at this this is not ideal all these
extension cords and stuff because 1600
watt PSU anyway guys we're gonna go
thanks for watching check us out on
Twitter gamers Nexus Paul Kyle a bit wit
Paul's Hardware myself because we have
this kind of a battle going and it's
actually quite entertaining it's taking
us back to like the old school
the overclocking and duking it out I
don't know who's gonna win the ultimate
battle out of us for but it's fun in the
meantime all right guys thanks for
watching and as always we'll see you in
the next one and I'm gonna keep pushing
for higher scores until something breaks
and then I'll cry
one more refresh
I love it Steve
it's your turn balls in your court
you're lucky don't don't don't don't
don't don't don't don't don't don't
don't don't don't don't don't don't you
know these tests take like five minutes
ago I have something to entertain
yourself dude dude Oh wrong Channel
there we go really notice that we I'm
doing again I was like yes do you yes
dude did you guys know I basically did
the voice acting for any of our videos
when we go at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
