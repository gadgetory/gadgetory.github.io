here at CES 2015 and we are hanging out
here at the cooler master suite at the
Palms in Las Vegas now one of the things
cooler master has listened to when it
comes to customer feedback is they have
just such a huge portfolio of product
can become very difficult and
overwhelming for a new buyer or even a
an experienced buyer to find the right
product when you have so many different
SKUs that have just small variants so
what coolermaster is actually doing in
2015 is they're simplifying their
product line to make it easier for the
consumer to identify what it is they
want with their product and then to shop
within a certain tier structure now the
way they're doing it here with tower
cases is they've got their essential
mainstream performance and ultra and
they've kind of put together a catalog
of cases that fit that particular tier
and with that same concept being
utilized over here in the performance
and ultra you can see with performance
the idea here is you have room to expand
like we've got that you know cm storm
case here which is obviously got a lot
of room for a custom system and then
ultra being you know their flagship the
cosmos - so it it really makes it simple
for you guys to identify ok what do I
want and they've really carried that
concept to their entire lineup of CM
storm products or Coolermaster products
so like I mentioned Coolermaster is
trying to really simplify their product
line up so that it's easier for the
average consumer to come and pick a
product I mean they're really sticking
with that essential that mainstream that
performance tiers so it really becomes
simple whether you're talking about
keyboards or mice or headsets you
basically know what it is you want are
you trying to just essentially buy
something basic to get you buy do you
want something that's a little bit more
mainstream or something that's
completely performance oriented so
that's really good to see especially
with the company that had such a huge
product range like coolermaster now one
of the things they're bringing new well
not really new but the kind of Reed
bringing attention to is their famous at
least in Europe the G Series power
supplies now this is the bronze series
it's an all-black PSU semi modular it's
actually performed really really well
out in Europe
and they're bringing this back here to
the Americas but of course we've got you
know the v-series the gold power or gold
rated power supply as well as the
platinum rated power supply so it falls
in that same tier lineup of essential
mainstream performance and then ultra so
that's actually pretty good to see now
if we come over here and we look at
systems behind us not only are they
making it simpler when it comes to
choosing you know the right products
based in that tier range they've also
put together a couple of user scenarios
here that kind of fit you know more or
less what is the end goal of the system
you're building these are just
suggestions of of what you could do with
the different tier system that they're
now bringing to the market it's you're
not being pigeon-holed into that
particular lineup but it's the whole
goal of Coolermaster at least in 2015 is
to make it easier to shop for the
products that you're interested in
now there's something that's actually
really cool here that I want to show you
guys it's a new type of cooler and I
think that is going to be really
interesting so go ahead and follow me
okay so when it comes to coolers really
things have been kind of stale in the
market you've got your standard heat
pipe design or vapor chamber your
all-in-one coolers your custom loops but
really when it comes to the advancement
of technology of cooling there's a
physics behind it that really has just
been established in our universe and we
can kind of harness some of that now
Coolermaster has actually teamed up with
a company called cool chip to develop
what they're calling here their kinetic
cooling now this is actually pretty
interesting if you know anything about
convection or the way that heat actually
dissipates they've basically taken a
well it's a kinetic cooler where the
energy is actually captured through the
heat sink and the heat sink itself is
rotating which is actually promoting the
convection or the the pulling of the
heat out of the component itself and
moving it into the environment but
cooler masters also helped design a
piece here where it's got a ton of
surface area including heat pipes so
you've got the kinetic energy the actual
spinning heat sink with the couple Asian
if that's even a word the coupling of
heat pipes which are kind of standard
cooling that's pushing the air through
those and giving you a massive amount of
cooling because you're promoting the
natural like I said convection of of
heat dissipation now what we've got over
here is a small display of you know a
standard Delta fan this is kind of a
server solution here
now Delta fans are really really loud in
fact you've heard my gaming server I've
got twenty five thousand rpm
Idol fans that can go up to forty
thousand rpms if I turn on the server
everybody in the neighborhood is very
upset with me so this is just one fan
and you can hear when you turn it on
deltas are not quiet so what we've got
over here is actually one of their
kinetics server solutions which is
actually dissipating more heat than a
standard forty millimeter 30 millimeter
Delta fan would be pushing at high rpms
but you can hear it's extremely quiet so
it's actually very interesting
technologies so this is something we can
look forward here to in 2015 with cool
chip and cooler master bringing these
new concepts to light and the cool thing
about this is it also because it's
aluminum you could even get some cool
designs they could anodized it they
could be black red and you don't
actually lose any of the cooling
capacity because anodizing dies the
metal and it's not like painting where
you actually insulate some of that heat
so I don't have an ETA yet and when this
is actually becoming to market but I can
say that this is something you guys are
interested in speak up in the comments I
know cool it and Coolermaster we're
going to be checking out to see what
people are saying about this but more
cooling capacity lower temperatures
lower noise it's definitely a win-win
okay now one last thing I want to touch
on before we get out of here and I know
this a little bit longer video than
normal but I thought that this was kind
of an important thing to talk about is
the cooler master case mod world series
and you guys know I love custom
computers and we've got what we got
right here is actually a case mod that
was actually done by Richard or you know
Darth Beavis very sleek looking thing
but this is a worldwide case mod with
two different categories
you got tower mod and scratch build a
scratch builder definitely where my
interest is going to be in but it's
sponsored by Intel Asus ocz and Dremel
yeah Dremel I mean really you can't do
be a case martyr without some sort of a
rotary tool so make sure you guys go
check this out at mod Coolermaster comm
this is going to be really cool the
world series of case mods and it's
actually I might have a little bit
something to do with this so stay tuned
for that because always guys thanks for
watching our coverage here of CES 2015
as always a huge thank you to the crowd
sources or crowd source contributors who
helped out with the tube start campaign
to bring us here without having to bring
in any sort of corporate funding or
sponsorship and as always guys I
definitely
we appreciate all of your support so
stay tuned and catch you in the next one
right that's usually how I end it I
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
