guys that's your job what's up guys it's
that time again it's friday we're
watching Jays two cents and take
addiction episode seven so we had a lot
of things to cover today as always every
single week superhuman enhancing drugs
that can turn you into Captain America
and the world as we know it is no longer
our stone
so have you ever wanted to be captain
america I would love to be captain
america because I bet he gets all the
actually I'm married so you would
probably want to be kept in America
because you could get all the girls so
some studies have shown that businesses
are looking at using
performance-enhancing drugs drugs that
can boost your brain ability boost your
work output we've already got some
exoskeleton type devices that you can
attach to your body but businesses are
looking at using these types of drugs to
enhance the output of their employees so
it brings up a few controversial points1
can your employer require
performance-enhancing drugs and to what
are the side effects of such things
there's a few psychologists out in
England that are saying that this would
put an incredible amount of stress on a
person's brain whereas you may be able
to cope with the stress and the longer
work hours if they're looking at putting
in with using such a drug but they're
afraid that you may snap they're worried
that you might go into post office and
actually mail something no that's not
don't worried that after a while your
brain just my noon sorry I came down off
my drugs because I with the amount of
stuff I do for YouTube I use riddling
along with pep pills along with sleeping
pills and along with viagra and that
tends to make me a little bit excited so
I can counteract that with the low-grade
beaver tranquilizer so I talked about it
on Twitter I've talked about it on
YouTube on I don't think I mentioned it
on my blog but I did talk about it on
game addiction and the last tech edition
yeah whatever some of you said stop
talking about your xbox we don't give a
damn well i did and i bought to connect
with that and now i'm a little sorry
that I did because you see Microsoft is
looking at getting a patent that gives
them the ability to use any built-in
camera on any product that uses any
Microsoft operating system so we're
talking Xbox Live we're talking windows
8 windows 7 any laptop that runs windows
of any addition to use the camera built
into these devices to spy on you and
what they're hoping to do is use facial
recognition to go along with licensing
to determine whether or not you're
viewing content that is licensed to you
as somebody who downloads illegally nom
kidding so do you have drm content how
many times have you said hey check out
this video and you hand your phone or
your hand your iPad or your computer to
somebody to take a look at a particular
video or a movie that you're watching
how would you like for a pop-up to come
up and say hey you're not recognize is
licensed to watch this video here's a
link to go and buy it for 1499 because
that's kind of where they want to go
with this they want to use facial
recognition on their cameras to
determine whether or not you are allowed
to watch something that somebody else
owns that sounds a little bit ludicrous
and ridiculous to me because I now have
to start charging you 1499 per episode
and there goes the subscriber count now
don't freak out yet this isn't a la this
isn't put in but this is a patent and
everyone knows that patents show an
intent of a company for what it is that
they want to bring to you in the future
so this is just the beginning we're
talking Microsoft and other
subscription-based companies are going
to start jumping on this bandwagon this
is a story that I'm going to continue to
watch as it rolls out it's probably
going to be years in the making but as
you know we're in the information age
and now we are apparently in the video
age where big brother is watching you at
all times as it is they already sell
special covers to put over your connect
because people are very paranoid that
Microsoft is going to be watching you
through your connect and in the past
some people have already proven that the
Kinect sends data even when the xbox
isn't on so how many of you are caught
doing something in front of that connect
that you wouldn't want your mom in an
oval halo 4 came out none of you are
watching because you're playing halo 4
but the four of you that are watching be
careful in the next time you log on xbox
live and if you're one of those people
that like to troll and trash talk in the
open forums and put your hand down I
know that's you I don't trash talk much
because I'm a really bad noob wait till
black ops 2 comes out maybe I'll put up
some gameplay then we'll start a comedy
series so 343 industries lead Bonnie
Ross an executive producer of halo 4
Kiki wolf kill epic name by the way hope
that's really their name I'd be
disappointed if it wasn't so they're
really upset about some of the anonymity
issues that go on with Xbox Live and all
the trolling xand all the name callings
and all the shenanigans I love the word
shenanigans and sexism that goes on on
xbox live they decided there's a zero
tolerance policy regarding any name
calling towards females so if you say
any sort of sexist comment towards a
female xbox live there are no questions
asked you are immediately banned from
xbox live and that is that Xbox Live
thinks is this a great trend because
they made a comment on there and I'm
gonna paraphrase here that when you take
adolescents and you give them the
ability to stay hidden yet say whatever
they want in an open forum you get a lot
of trolling how many of us have seen it
in the open forums or any lobby on xbox
live you can't get away from it so
they're going to extend it to that type
of behavior so you all might want to
clean up your attitudes that applies
xbox live is going to get really empty
and I will be the happiest guy on xbox
so foxconn chairman terry gal has said
officially the iPhone 5 is due hard to
make and we can keep up with you guys so
there's a rumor that Terry might be
outsourcing some of the iphone 5
production to one of their sister
companies which is Foxconn international
holdings for assistance on assembling of
the iphone 5 now he won't officially
come out and say that and he
specifically refused to comment on that
when a reporter asked him if that was
his intention but the reason why that's
a little bit controversial is the fact
that all of the devices that they make
that compete with the Apple devices that
they make are made at Foxconn
international so hon hai precision
industry which is the actual Foxconn
sister company that's making the iphone
5 while the apple devices were made you
know that's where they make the iphones
is where they make the ipads and the new
ipad mini and all the other tablets and
phones that they make go to Foxconn
international and in light of this news
the hon hai precision industry stocks
over the last 24 hours have just been
plummeting but the foxconn international
holding stocks has been officially
listed as a by and has been soaring the
name of the game people I said it last
week on tech addiction I wasn't going to
report on any more apple news I have to
I I just have to report on it because
every single week I'll go to the news
and it I can't help it they are just
their corporate culture is gone ever
since Steve Jobs died at least he held
it together a little bit he was still an
asshole but at least he kept the nice
hip vibe that comes to with being Apple
all right yeah i just called all of us
hipsters but see at least he was able to
keep it together but ever since tim cook
took over and he's had to delegate a lot
of the corporate responsibilities that
Steve Jobs used to take care of they've
just gone insane they're suing everybody
they're being sued by everybody and now
the corporate culture is falling apart
and here's what I mean by that I'm going
to bring out a new segment every single
week where I do 60 seconds of apple imma
try and bring you as much Apple news in
sixty Seconds as I possibly can and with
that we're going to go ahead and get
this started with Apple is being sued by
New Zealand man for incorrectly listing
some prices of some items on their
website so he bought sixteen hundred
dollars worth of cables and other
peripherals for $35 Apple sent him a
payment confirmation shipping
confirmation ship the package guys happy
deal of the year grey Apple goes and
intercepts the package and then send
some email saying sorry our prices were
wrong tough he's now suing apple
apples in deep water because they
changed the code on their website when
it comes to their apology to Samsung so
what they did was they put the link at
the bottom like they're supposed to but
they put it just off-screen to where you
can't quite see it's when you go to the
website if you want to see the apology
you've got to scroll down slightly click
the link go to new page and there it is
bad apple so Apple is currently
interested in leasing some licenses that
Google currently holds over motorola
mobility and basically they said we want
to use some of your patents but we're
not willing to pay more than one dollar
for that patent license google said
tough we want to charge you twenty
dollars apple says that's not fair we're
taking you to court and we want to pay
one dollar judge says it's their patent
they can do whatever they want apple
says that's not fair they're charging
too much if you make a judgment it's
more than a dollar we're gonna ignore
you we're gonna do it anyway and the
judge said case dismissed it's time to
your favorite part of the show in mine
too its technologies dumbass of the Week
and up until this point I've always talk
to you about a particular criminal who's
done something stupid regarding
technology but today i'm bringing you a
man who says that he was given the gift
of Earth by God in Japan and he decided
to auction it off on yahoo auctions this
is just a ridiculous story I'm having a
hard time he'd be reporting it the
auction started on October thirtieth and
was scheduled to end at November 6th and
as of November 6th the winning bid was
123 million dollars and that's like 96
bajillion yen I think is the official
conversion rate and as with any auction
there's a Q&amp;amp;A section where a bitter can
actually put in a question and some of
these questions were absolutely
hilarious like for instance one guy
asked how come you can't see the back
side of the world on the photo that
you're showing on your auction is there
a reason why you're not showing that or
are there possibly countries that are
wasting resources wasting dollars and
constantly fighting each other another
guy said he doesn't want the entire
world but he has interested in Cuba
because lives in United States and he's
really jonesing for a cute
in cigar so can he make some sort of a
discount and just package off Cuba and
buy that separately the guy said he's
more than willing to move Cuba to Japan
if he buys the world but then again it's
his world so it's his job to move things
where he wants to another guy asked if
he buys the world is he god the guy said
no God gave you the world therefore you
are not God it's pretty much been said
and on top of that the guy who asked if
he becomes God he told what's matter are
you crazy so for anonymous guy in Japan
trying to sell the world because God
gave it to you on yahoo auctions your
technologies dumbass of the decade
alright guys so that's all I've got for
this week so on Monday night make sure
