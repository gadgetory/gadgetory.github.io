myself becoming more and more put off at
the thought of reviewing all in one
water cooling units I mean they all
pretty much look like they're cut from
the same mold usually you have a 120 or
a 240 millimeter radiator you throw on
some ugly fep tubing and a low profile
and sometimes really cheap looking pump
and bam you have an all-in-one water
cooling unit that just blends into the
crowd I mean what fun is that so when I
open the box for likho tech look for the
lik tech yeah funny name I know the lik
tech 240 from enter max and admittedly I
didn't even realize they made all in one
water cooling units before I was
immediately shocked by what I found
inside EVGA ACX 2.0 cooler with its
three phase six slot motor 11 swept fan
blades and double ball bearing design
offers reduced power noise and thermals
for the optimum gaming experience click
the link in the description to learn
more now the moment I pulled the cooler
from the packaging it became apparent
from the get-go that this unit was not
like other units that I had previously
reviewed other brands seem to really
place an emphasis on lightweight
properties by using plastics and thin
walled aluminum radiators coupled with
very delicate fins that seem to smash
them if you even so much as look at them
the wrong way but not this bad boy the
first thing I noticed was the cooling
fins are extremely heavy duty in fact I
was intrigued by how thick these cooling
fins were that I felt compelled to run
my fingers across them over and over
again as you can see just to see how
durable they are and you know what they
didn't Bend when I first showed pics of
this thing on Instagram with the caption
of heavy duty some physics folks can't
even talk now some folks expressed how
unhappy they were with the cheap and
delicate feel of other all-in-one
coolers that you find on the market and
I have to say that I agree
in fact sometimes all-in-one cooling
units are shipped with pre bent fins
removing all of the fun that you have
bending them yourself but not this guy
and look at that
now if you want to bend these fins you
better bring some heavy-duty machinery
and my time maybe recommend a hammer now
you might be thinking Jay why are you
spending so much time talking about the
fins well the matter of the fact is the
fins are typically the most fragile part
of any of the all-in-one cooling units
and they're part that people are always
terrified of smashing and rightfully so
you know you move it around trying to
get into your case and finagle it in
there and you try and install it next
thing you know I can lead to some
smashed fins and that's not really
attractive at all so when I realize that
NMX went out of their way to create a
unit that would offer protection and
high-quality fins I felt that it was
actually worth mentioning now some of
you may already know that many of the
all-in-one coolers that are currently on
the market are simply a Sutekh rebrands
that's why so many of them would look
just the same they're ASA tech rebrands
but that's not the case here in fact NR
max has actually designed this bad boy
completely in-house all the way down to
the pump design speaking of pumps
believe it or not the pump creates heat
and anything that also creates heat must
be cooled now oftentimes the coolant
passing through the pump not only cools
the parts that it's touching
you know the CPU the case of all human
coolers or maybe the GPU in the case of
custom cooling loops but the coolant is
also picking up heat from the pump
itself now enter max actually realizes
this and much like people do on their
laying DDC pumps with their custom loops
they've actually opted to pre install a
heatsink on the top of this pump as well
this makes me very happy to see because
that means that there is less heat being
dumped into the coolant itself meaning
for much cooler CPU temperatures for
prolonged use now lastly there is a blue
LED the pump adding a little bit of
bling but unfortunately it is not an RGB
LED I'm not sure what companies have
against RG B's but I digress now
something else that's nice to see is
that this thing is made entirely of
metal well except for the tubing of
course because that would make
installation of the sink a complete and
utter bitch but the pump and the
brackets and even the radiator have a
very nice head
dooty feel to them thanks to their
all-metal design well except for the
tubing like we discussed one touch that
they added was this kind of a metal
shroud that's placed on the radiator now
this not only offers a sweet aesthetic
to it
but it also offers even more protection
infernally convinced that I could strap
this into my chest and use it as a
bulletproof shield
I'm not kidding guys this thing is
freaking rugged don't do that with other
brands now the fans that come with this
unit are also pretty interesting in fact
the blades have a bit of a sweeping
blade to them are a little bit sweeping
blade design that not only reduces the
chopping sound created by flat bladed
fans but this also increases the
aesthetic pressure without having to
massively increase the RPMs a speaking
of rpms these fans have a switch on the
hub where you can actually set the max
rpm of the fans now when I saw this I
was like now they call it their
adjustable peak speed or ApS for short
and allows the user to set the max RPMs
from 1300 2000 or 2500 rpm that's
freaking amazing in fact I'm not
personally aware of any other fans on
the market that offered this feature and
I'm not talking about those cheap inline
slider switches like the antique fans
have but this is managed right at the
hub on an electronics level so if you
know of any of those any other fans on
the market that currently offer this let
me know and speak up in the comments
kind of like to check them out now as I
mentioned earlier the Sweatt blade
design offers a high static pressure
which is arguably the most important
spec when it comes to fans and radiators
and these fans are still pushing an
impressive 1.7 millimeters of h2o at
1300 rpm 4.7 at 2000 and a whopping 7.4
at 2500 rpm now just to put that into
perspective the Corsair SP 120 high
performance fans you know they're static
optimized pressure fan
hence the SP pushes only 3.1 at 2,350
rpm now that's half as good as these
enter max fans and don't even get me
started on the quiet edition it was
actually quite laughable alright alright
so I've babbled on long enough
about how this thing looks and about the
fans let's go ahead and dive into the
performance so go ahead and queue up
that transition now to really push this
thing I decided to hook it up to my
Intel 4790k which is of course
overclocked now I chose to use this CPU
instead of the 5820k in my test bench
due to its inherently hot nature of the
4770 and 4790k now it's not very hard to
cool the big CPUs like the 58 20 or the
59 30 or even the 8 core 59 60 X do
their due to their epoxy based heat
spreader now enter max is advertising
that they're all metal pump and ceramic
bearing are to blame for the lack of
noise in fact this thing was so quiet I
was almost convinced that I that the
pump is not even running at all I'm not
even kidding guys because when I powered
up the system I touched the pump I felt
no vibration whatsoever and I
immediately reached to the back of the
PSU and I flip the oh switch as I
call it to power off the system because
I was sure that I was running this or
that the pump was not running and I was
scared that I was going to damage my CPU
now it's freakishly quiet now because I
still didn't fully trust this ultra
silent pump I mean if you can't hear it
it's just not natural anyway I did my
first test at stock speeds and voltages
which for the 4790k is 4.4 gigs
turbo at 1.2 volts and in my surprise
the CPU was idling in the upper 20s to
low 30s most of the time it was sitting
right at 30 degrees Celsius on the
socket and the same goes for the cores
now when it comes to the load
temperatures the socket maxed out at
about 52 degrees Celsius with the core
sitting in the mid 40s to low 50s and
that's 50 degrees Celsius under t.j.maxx
for the chip which happens to be 105
before the CPU starts yelling for
thermal throttling to keep itself from
being cooked to death so yeah the pump
is working now that I was convinced that
this thing was actually running even
though my brain still had a hard time
wrapping itself around this absolutely
silent nature of this pump I mean again
it's just not natural I decided it was
time for more power little Tim tool man
reference
now I decided to take it slow bumping up
the speed only a couple hundred
megahertz at a time now while I was also
increasing the voltage I went to 4.6
gigahertz at 1.33 volts and I ran a 264
suite for 30 minutes to allow all the
temperatures to be a stabilize and
equalize and the results are absolutely
outstanding temperatures for the cores
never exceeded the low 80s with the
package temps sitting in the upper 80s
now sure it's warm but remember this is
an all-in-one water cooling unit and we
are still well under the danger zone for
the CPU 105 degrees Celsius now this
wouldn't be Jays two cents if I didn't
take some risks so I decided to push my
CPU to four point eight gigahertz and it
maxed out the voltage all the way up to
one point four volts yeah that's well
above the recommended voltage for any
all-in-one water cooling of it now the
results are actually quite amazing the
core sat in the mid 80s which is
outstanding however the package did
reach a temperature of 97 degrees
Celsius at which the PC started to
thermal slightly or thermal throttle
slightly at 3% according to a 264 but
the odd part is according to CPU Z the
CPU never actually change speeds or
voltage and once I pulled back the
voltage to 1.35 volts which is the max I
recommend for a 24/7 use by the way the
results are nothing short of custom loop
type performance now temperatures
normalized in the mid 70s with a couple
of cores reaching the low 80s when
processing FPU stress tests but if you
look at the screenshot you can see that
even when the middle of the star in the
middle of stress testing the cores were
actually sitting in the upper 60s to mid
70s with the package sitting in the mid
80s the entire time the last thing worth
mentioning is that this was all achieved
with the max rpm set to 2 to 2000 rpm
but the cool thing is that the RPMs can
still adjust down by using the BIOS in
my z97 classified behind me in fact it's
set to 2500 right now but they're only
running at 50% speed and even that 1.4
volt test where I got up to 97 degrees
Celsius it still wasn't running mac
speed on the fans so how do I feel about
the animatics liquid tech 240 I think
it's a freaking homerun I'm really happy
to
cited to look at this because especially
at a time when the cooler market really
is kind of stale and everybody's sort of
copying each other
enter max has a has clearly spent a good
amount of time refining this unit and
creating a cooler that they really
should be proud of now when it comes to
the pros that are plenty the list I mean
the fan design is outstanding the
aesthetics of the radiator and the pump
are unique and hell they're even
attractive even the tubing looks good
I really do like the look of flat black
rubber tubes I'm surprised I've never
put one in a custom loop myself now the
heatsink on the pump is clearly working
because I was specifically making sure
to touch it during my stress tests and
the top of the pump did seem to be
drawing some heat out of the pump now
the installation is easy the
instructions are very detailed and
they're very easy to follow oh yeah and
it also cools the CPU too which is kind
of a good thing usually but of course
there is no such thing as a perfect
product and when I'm going to start with
at the is the very same thing I have
knocked other brands with in the past
which is the lack of RGB lighting I mean
with so many color combinations
available with hardware now red green
heck even yellow in my case the blue LED
really does seem a bit off
even if RGB isn't something they plan to
do I would recommend that they at least
change the color to white or even at the
very least an option to turn the light
off altogether now some may say this is
due to the lack of intelligence software
something that is currently included
with all of the models of the Corsair
units or all of the AI models of Corsair
units I should say but perhaps maybe a
toggle switch to change between red
green blue and white built into the pump
would be something worth considering and
would actually make this unit more
attractive to themed builders but
seriously though at least consider
changing the LED to white because that
would match so many more units now the
last con worth mentioning is that the
rpm switch on the fans are inaccessible
once the unit is mounted to change the
RPMs you have to remove the fan which
can be a bit of a pain in the ass should
you decide later that you want to reduce
the RPMs that they
or max rpms that they will spin at this
really isn't a huge deal though since
really all you're doing is limiting the
max rpm and since they are PWM fans you
can still slow them down with your
onboard CPU fan header like I'm doing
behind me in fact it even includes a PWM
fan splitter so you can run them on your
CPU header but as far as cons go that's
really it and even the only cons I could
come up with are really nothing more
than nitpicks so there you have it guys
J is 2 cents on the enter max lick tech
240 I really think they should change
the name but if you're shopping for an
all-in-one water cooling unit you really
should consider this thing for your own
rigs in fact I'm putting this very unit
inside my CES portable PC that I'm
building yes I will be doing a video on
that in the future it really is just
plain badass now if you want to know
where you can buy the unit or you just
want to learn more about it check out
the links down in the description for
more information now also if you have
any questions or you just want to chat I
love interacting with the fans of the
channel and talking tech with you guys
is a whole lot of fun so feel free to
head on over to twitter at JS 2 cents or
facebook and hit me up now as always
guys thank you for watching you guys
make the channel a whole lot of fun to
keep working on and as always I hope to
see you guys in the next one
take care
