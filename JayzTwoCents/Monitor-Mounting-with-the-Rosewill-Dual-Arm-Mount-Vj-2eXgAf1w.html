remember from my room tour I showed you
guys that I have a 27 inch monitor here
that is on an articulating arm so I can
do stuff like that with it but what you
can also see is I have a second monitor
over here that is not on an articulating
arm and quite frankly that bugs the ever
living crap out of me so what we're
going to look at today is a solution to
get both of my monitors up off of my
desk so that we can have so much more
room for activities now in order to
achieve that we are going to be taking a
look at the Rosewill our HMS - one one
zero zero three dual monitor arm it says
it supports between 13 to 27 inch
monitors which has kind of been my
challenge I found a lot of dual monitor
arms that only go as high as 24 inches
that I have a 27 inch and a 24 inch
monitor over there which was kind of
creating a little bit of a problem for
me now one of the other problems I was
coming across is that to find a dual
monitor arm that supported these sized
screens that I have I was looking at
some pretty expensive options when it
comes to the packaging of this thing
clearly it's no frills I mean it's got
the label on there and that is pretty
much it
in fact the instructions that come with
it are literally one-page I mean it's
really really self explanatory so I'm
going to show you what comes in the box
and I talked about how the build quality
feels then we're going to throw both
monitors on it and give you my opinion
on whether or not this is a good
solution for you guys because quite
honestly this is very very inexpensive
now inside the box here it's pretty
basic I mean they don't spend a lot of
time giving you all sorts of just stuff
you don't care about right on the top
you've got a little box here that's
tough both of your visa mounts in there
that's a important thing to point out is
you have to make sure that your monitors
support the VESA mount my monitors are
visa 100 millimeter which this does
support as well as the other size can't
remember off the top of my head with
that other sizes yeah I'm pretty bad at
this whole tech thing so anyways you get
both of these constructionwise I'm not
sure what the kind of metal it is it
clearly is a cast metal it's not like
billet or
machined it does feel like it's cast but
it also feels really sturdy so I'm not
worried about it breaking I mean after
all these monitors are not very heavy
I'm you get the desk mount here which is
got some rube on on it for pretty thick
desk I mean holy crap I mean look at
this
they really anticipate you having a hard
time getting out of a plastic here
because well this is me we're talking
look at the thickness of that so you
have your little twist you know thing
there but it's got rubber both on the
plunger part that screws against the
part that mounts to your desk I like the
fact that it's rubber on there my
monoprice mount that I have here does
not really have very much padding on
there so it can scratch the desk again
build quality looks pretty good this is
the part that mounts to your desk
you've got your hard way here from your
bushings here for mounting it to your
monitors and then you have the most
important part and there's nothing else
in the box by the way which is the
actual articulating part right there let
me check that out so when it comes to
mounting these you literally mount these
to the monitor and then you drop the
monitor right down in there that's it I
mean it does look like has a little hole
here that you could put a piece of
hardware through there look at this any
right here it looks like you could put a
clip on there to keep it from coming out
but honestly once you set it down in
there it's not going anywhere guys it's
a monitor alright so that's it that's
everything it's in the box let's go
ahead and mount it up I know let you
know if it fits and we'll find out
together so stay tuned
oh yeah and don't forget guys it it does
articulate that's kind of the important
part right yeah well there she is all
put together and honestly I have to say
it's pretty damn easy I mean really it's
just attach the brackets to the monitors
attach the articulating arm to the
mounting pole after you mount that to
the desk and then screw it down that's
all there is to it I like the fact that
the monitors themselves are on a ball
and the ball has three adjustable spring
tensions on there so you can adjust how
tight it is when it comes to tilt and
rotate that way doesn't sag down over
time all in all the quality feels pretty
good I mean it's not
wobbly I mean of course it's going to
have some wobble to it because you have
to monitor arm or two monitors extending
off of a single mounting point so you
are going to have a little bit of a
little bit of wobble there but honestly
it's not bad at all and given the fact
that it's only 69 bucks at the time of
filming this review I challenge you to
find a better articulating monitor arm
that can fit a twenty seven and a twenty
four in such a manner which allows me to
not have to leave them parallel but I
have the 24 inch curved inward that way
I have kind of a surround thing going
you'll notice the pole is off to the
side because I want my 27 in front of me
and my 24 off to the side so the pole is
not centered but it's nice to get both
monitors up off the desk because now I
can have more desk space push things
under the monitor just kind of have more
room to expand out and I like a nice
tidy workspace the routing of the cables
was nice and easy through the built-in
cable routing function that's built into
the arms and all-in-all it's really not
so bad the only downside I really think
it's going to annoy me over time is it
has kind of a real gritty finish and
that gritty finish is going to attract
dust in there and it's going to be
really difficult to dust it because it's
not going to want to let go of it so
that's kind of a downside since it's a
real cast metal kind of texture to it
like it almost feels like a bed liner of
a truck it's really the kind of best way
to describe it if you guys are
interested in checking out this monitor
the link is down in the description it's
going to take you to new wake because
that's where this monitor arm is
available I feel this is a good monitor
arm I'm going to be using it and I have
no doubt that this is going to hold my
monitors up with no problems whatsoever
and it's going to give me a lot of life
at least until I get a third monitor
which I'll have to find a try monitor
mount so guys it's been Jays two cents
tell me what you think about this
monitor arm for 69 bucks at the time of
filming it's going to be hard to find
another one that's as good as this one
guys when we get on out of here make
sure you check out my other videos I
have on the channel and I got some
exciting things coming up here in the
future I will see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
