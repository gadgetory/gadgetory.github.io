of stuff to cover today robots that can
chase you down and kill you Nissan's
brand new steering by wire system and
the 2012 list of most unsecured
passwords ever so normally I have all
kinds of things to talk about when it
comes to Toyota but this week we're
changing it up and bringing in some nice
on this is kind of cool because I'm a
fan of Nissan i own a Nissan and Nissan
is saying starting with their infinity
series in 2013 they're going to get rid
of the mechanical steering system in
their cars they didn't say which model
yet but they're going to debut with at
least one model and they're going to go
with a steering by wire system what that
means is they're going to use the
electronic servos and sensors in the
steering column rather than have a
mechanical connection it's going to use
actuators and electric motors a lot of
people were worried when they made this
announcement that what if the car loses
power well it turns out that there's a
clutch attached to the steering wheel
that still mechanically attached to the
wheels that will give you enough
steering take it out of a sticky
situation should you happen to lose
power it's kind of like the new
electronic throttle systems only it's
going to work with the steering I think
it's kind of cool it's supposed to
alleviate a lot of the small input that
the driver has to put into their car
that way when you're driving straight
down the road you can just hold the
wheel and the car will straight has
cameras that will read the lines in the
road and it will stay straight all you
have to do is give it big inputs to tell
it when to turn I don't know how it's
going to feel i'll probably go test
drive one with something like that comes
out i think it's really cool but it's
definitely a step towards cars in the
future that can drive themselves so in
october 24th this robotics company put
up this video demonstrating this new
robot that they've designed that can
look at an atmosphere in an environment
it can analyze obstacles and it can
maneuver over those obstacles including
jumping it can climb it can use its arms
to stabilize itself it can go up and
down stairs and this thing can even run
this is kind of reminding me of the
movie I robot and it makes me wonder
whether or not we're getting a few steps
closer towards that whole Skynet thing
we're gonna have robots taking over the
world
or the matrix you know that stuff is all
science fiction but there's a hint of
truth to all of it but when it comes to
artificial intelligence when it starts
learning on its own and learning how to
take over its masters that's when we
have to worry now I'm just kidding I'm
not afraid of robots but probably not
going to get one of these things the
only thing I'm really asking myself is
how far can technology take this
artificial intelligence I mean already
this is this is incredible I mean there
was the optimal robot that came out
about 10 years ago from Honda that's
what was Honda and they have it on
display over at Disneyland and it was
kind of amazing that that thing could
walk up stairs but I'd say we've come a
long way in the last 10 years when it
comes to this particular robot I think
it's pretty cool so seeing that has just
put out the 2012 top 20 worst passwords
of the year and the top three are no
different than they were in 2011 that's
one two three four five 123456 and
password should I get a machine other
honorable mentions where I love you
Jesus let me in I'm embarrassed to say
I've actually used that one before
password one password to trust no one
it's actually kind of monkey football I
mean the only thing worse is using your
own name so group of scientists over at
Flinders University did a sleep study in
regards to gaming before bedtime and
they want to see if there's a
correlation between the amount of games
and the type of games you play before
bed and whether or not it affects the
amount and quality of sleep that you get
I know about you guys but I live a
pretty hectic life of a full-time dad
husband with a full-time career and I
barely have enough time to do the
youtube thing as it is so when i play
games it's typically late at night and
before bed and sometimes i can get in a
couple of hours but they say that if you
spend 150 minutes or more playing games
before bed you're gonna get 30 minutes
less of REM and REM if you're not aware
is the rapid eye movement
they found that those that spent 50
minutes or less typically we're not
affected at all in their sleep pattern
by the games that they play or the type
of games that they play but they did
find that violent or war and
shoot-'em-up first-person shooter type
games certainly had more of an effect on
them than MMOs or other slow you know
progressive game style I'll be honest
with you my wife has told me many times
in the morning that I've gone to bed in
the middle of the night and woken up
screaming throwing grenades diving for
cover shooting people and I never
remember any of it but I'm gonna call
shenanigans on that because unless she
records it and shows me playing
battlefield 3 in bed no sexual pun
intended there that could be fun i I'm
gonna call shenanigans I want to see it
and if she actually records that he'll
put it up on tech edition why not so
with all of the stuff going on in the
news regarding Apple and the lawsuits of
motorola and samsung and few other
people in there the US Patent and
Trademark Office has decided to go ahead
and review some of these patents that
Apple's using the Flex that that patent
muscle especially when they're going
after Samsung and the trademark office
has determined that there are 20 patents
that should not belong to Apple
basically in the regards of stops the
advancement of Technology see if you're
not aware you can file a patent on
anything but you can't file a patent on
something that stalls the progression of
technology so they've determined that 20
patents that belong to Apple have been
invalidated and that's great news for
samsung because number 19 on that list
of 20 is the rubber banding effect you
know where you scroll up and you hit the
end of a page and it kind of bounces and
comes back that's called rubber banding
and apple claims that they own the
patent on that which they do and now
they don't so Samsung has already
written a letter to the appeals to court
and the judge is presiding over the case
there 1 billion dollar case to determine
whether or not they can just get the
whole thing thrown out I don't know what
the legality is going to be there since
it was invalidated after they lost the
lawsuit but now that it's no longer a
valid point who knows this may be the
best news and the best Christmas ask em
son has ever had speaking of Apple and
lawsuits they're getting sued again see
last week I brought to you the report
said that the photographer who did the
eyeball for the that they used in their
retina display ad never gave Apple
permission to use that well now a mother
a father and a doctor a pediatrician is
now suing apple over this and what their
claim is that when kids use an iPad they
typically put it on the floor and then
they hover over it and use it like that
so they're looking down all the time so
the claim is that this child has
apparently developed a deformity in
their neck because of the constant
hunching position of playing with the
ipad on the floor so never mind the fact
that the parents are using in the ipad
more than likely as a you know 2012
babysitter we're back in my day it was
the Nintendo you know now it's the iPad
here go away you play the right head
I'll admit I'm guilty of giving my kid
the iPad when I want her to just please
be quiet but really you're gonna claim
the ipad now is deforming your children
for the love of God just think of the
children this is ridiculous my iPad has
never given me any sort of at the for me
oh when will they get that from I'm
starting to think a lot of the
technology heavyweights in this country
are actually watching tech addiction
first a few weeks back I reported that
Verizon hadn't taken my money in the
head and shipped my iphone 5 and had
been two weeks in the very next day they
took my money and had a tracking number
in my inbox so I got my phone after that
tech edition that last week a report on
Google as being one of the top paid
software development companies in the
Silicon Valley and that Zynga was number
four and he knows inga makes draw
something I believe they bought
farmville they've stolen a few other
things from the internet but they make
facebook games ipad ipod iphone apps
while they were number four highest paid
in the Silicon Valley well on Tuesday
when the ipad mini was being announced
they quickly laid off 100 people so what
better way to avoid the publicity of
laying off 100 people do it during an
iPad or an apple event but anyway this
came out of nowhere some of the people
interviewed who were laid off said they
had no indications the company was in
any sort of trouble they had no idea
that they were gonna be laid off they
simply came into work one day and that
was it little meeting your gun so if
you've watched last week's tech
addiction just ignore the fact that I
said that zune goes a good company in
work for they make good money when
comparing it to the Google charts I
wouldn't wouldn't take that bet anymore
so speaking of companies that are
sinking AMD is expected to hold a press
release on October 29
130 p.m. pacific time and as i mentioned
last week again I swear to God all the
big people are watching tech addiction
because AMD says oh Jay's two cents
out of this now we have to hold a press
conference the cats out of the bag but
it's anticipated that AMD is going to be
announcing that they're going to be
laying off fifteen percent of their
staff so fifteen percent of their 11,400
employees you're gonna be looking at
almost 2,000 people laid off that's a
lot of people and then it's anticipated
from an inside source who wasn't named
in the article that the layoffs will be
complete by the end of quarter for this
year merry christmas and happy new year
for anyone who works at AMD you're fired
so right on the heels of AMD laying off
fifteen percent of its staff coming up
the end of this year so Andy has been
awarded an award from the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index as one of the most
corporate responsible companies in the
nation so let me get this straight you
can't keep up with Intel who by the way
also got the same award you put out
processors over the last couple of years
that nobody cares about and is three
years behind in tell you lay out fifteen
percent of your staff and you get an
award that sounds about right so one of
the things this award is about is about
ethics and the way they conduct business
and impact on the environment and the
quality of you know the employer they
are to their employees I think there's
fifty percent of their employees who now
who would probably disagree with this
award but it's just completely ironic to
me that they are laying off fifteen
percent of their staff but they're
getting an award over here for being a
great company corporate lies it's
official nothing makes sense in this
world anymore to jay's two cents so how
can you talk about AMD without the
piledriver released the other day and I
can't give you any first-hand experience
on it all I can tell you is that there's
been about 30 benchmarks on it when it
comes to some very reputable reviewers
like guru3d and gadget all of those
people have done reviews on it Linus
tech tips and they all say basically the
same thing it is an improvement over
bulldozer but we're only talking ten to
fifteen percent based on the application
environment that you put it in games
such it's still not poor Fork or hang in
with Intel so I just and considering
that they've already said that they're
not planning on putting out any high-end
desktop processors beyond piledriver
steamrollers a maybe I just don't think
I'm gonna pop 200 bucks into this
computer go to pile driver if anything
i'll just save my money and a little bit
later go to Intel because I know the
Intel is going to have an upgrade path
for me when it comes to pile driver I
wouldn't say it's a flop but I also
wouldn't say it's the improvement people
were hoping for and it's definitely not
gonna float that ship again because that
ship is still syncing it is going down
all right guys it's time for your
favorite part of the show in mine too
it's technology dumb house of the week
this week's dumbass of the Week is aaron
d Templeton you see Aaron had this
bright idea he found a meth dealer who
was willing to make him deal buying bulk
I'll give you more it's kind of like the
costco of drugs so he says oh man I
don't have that much money but I'll get
together all my friends and we'll all
pitch in you buy as much meth as we can
and we'll split it and we'll all get
more meth for our money it's freaking
genius oh my god I should be in politics
so what's he do he gets on his iPhone
and he starts to text all of his friends
and he ends up sending a text to a
narcotics detective in his own Police
Department hey bro you wanna help me
bust some ass and thin you go get real
good discount yeah in weight was bobby's
number and 149 or for cheer and he
Debbie with you so the detective thinks
that his colleagues might be playing a
trick on him so after verifying that the
number didn't belong any of his
colleagues and they weren't playing a
trick on he says sure i'll come meet
with you i got a hundred fifty bucks bro
so Aaron thing yeah jackpot alright goes
and meets up with the guy second gets
out of his car handcuffed some puts him
in the
I detective takes his phone he now has
the information for the dealer and all
the other people in his phone book who
who is trying to make this deal with to
go and buy more methane vithika so err
indeed Templeton as cool as I think your
name sounds for texting a narcotics
officer and offer to buy drugs your dumb
ass okay guys it's all I got for this
week do me a favor you've got any
questions that you'd like to see
