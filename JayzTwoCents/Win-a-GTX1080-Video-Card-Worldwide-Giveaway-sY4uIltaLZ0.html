here and I want to start off a little
bit of bad news unfortunately and I know
this is gonna break your hearts and I
hate to be the guy to have to do it but
tech talk tonight is unfortunately
cancelled just for tonight though a
couple of reasons actually one Jerry is
in World Maker Faire in New York he
thought he was gonna be able to be on
but Jerry being Jerry forgot that you
know there's time zones and seven
o'clock New York time is not the same as
seven o'clock pacific time so he got his
time is mixed up and he's not available
for tonight's show now the other thing
is that twitchcon is going on right now
down in San Diego so that means would
have been harder to get his stand-in to
come and be a guest tonight so I decided
I'm not gonna compete with any of that
crap I'm just gonna go ahead and take
the night off you guys can tell me to do
that so I'm gonna do it but because I
felt so bad about not doing tech talk
tonight I decided to go ahead and do a
freaking giveaway let's be honest I was
gonna do to give away anyway but this
was just the perfect reason to do it but
right now so one lucky winner is gonna
be winning my gigabyte gtx 1080 g1
gaming you guys can learn more about
this graphics card by checking out my
review of it I'll put a link down in the
description to this video and entry is
pretty easy all you got to do is either
be already subscribed or subscribe to
this channel and there's even a bonus
entry for following me over on Twitter
that's it I don't think that's too much
to ask considering i'm giving away seven
hundred dollar graphics card I and guys
it's actually open worldwide there are
terms and rules and all that stuff
that's going to be found in the link
down below it's being hosted over on
gleam that way I can keep track of
everything including all you cheaters
and get your guys's entries thrown out
for trying to cheat and skirt system but
I digress but honestly though who
wouldn't want this thing I think I RGB
LEDs that cooler on the nvidia side is
actually pretty damn good for the g one
gaming we won't talk about the RX 480
version of it this was actually pretty
damn good and it's the exact version i
used in my video this is my card I'll
even sign it if you want I will sign it
and devalue your card even more that's
right anyway all right I'm gonna go guys
thanks for entering this giveaway is
just want to give back to you guys just
a little bit we'll do some more of the
sub special as we head into the holiday
season here but most of all good luck
