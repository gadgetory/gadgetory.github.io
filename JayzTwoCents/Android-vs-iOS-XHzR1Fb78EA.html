addiction will not be airing today you
can check out tech addictions starting
on its new days this Sunday in the
meantime enjoy this little vlog / rant /
branch / whatever you want to call it
from JS uses what's up guys Jay here
coming at you with another rent vlogs
blog thing about my two cents when it
comes to certain topics regarding
technology and there is a topic right
now that's been a few years in the
making and I've seen comments on some of
my videos already and some of other
people's videos and on forums and even
just out and about and what's really
just on my mind right now is the rivalry
between Android and iPhone and how
people feel a necessity of belonging to
either one to the other and you can't
accept the other if you belong to the
other will go there is that oh this is
it's just my iphone oh I what yeah we
can't we can't hang out seriously I mean
you see it all the time right iphone
sucks android sucks iPhones better
androids better you could do this on
iphone you can do this on android you
can't do this but you can't do that well
i'm better you bet it you suck no you
know you it's getting out of control i
mean in the past it used to be chevy and
ford and then there was Neil of Dodge
guys over there then there's Honda vs uh
well Hana doesn't really compete with
anybody there's just this human emotion
in all of us where we feel like we have
to be accepted we have to be a part of a
club and if you're not a part of our
club then you're not right you're wrong
you know i i've used android before
iphone and now that have an iphone i get
called a fanboy and then I pull up my
galaxy and they're like oh you're just a
super geek because now you have both
phones so it's a no matter what you do
you've got an iphone you get an android
you got both you're always wrong it's
the same thing when it comes to pcs you
got mac vs pc and again there's those
linux guys out there somewhere they
don't really count I mean I swear to God
when it comes to equal rights need to
change it to regardless of race color
creed and operating systems just getting
entirely out of control when it comes to
whether or not you like somebody because
of what type of phone that they use that
may sound very very petty and some of
you may be going really really
this is a problem in the world just look
around I'm sure some of you watching
this video head looked at someone's
phone and made a judgment based on them
because of the type of phone that
they're using you know iphone users are
looked at as hipsters and artsy and you
know better than thou and hanging out in
the coffee shops and I just kind of
describe everything I have totally just
described myself I love coffee I love
art and I like my iphone and then
there's that stick when the Android
users are nerdy or slow or just going
against the grain and they only want
android because I phone is growing so
they've got to stick it to apple by
buying a different phone a lot of people
who buy android buy it simply because
it's the other company there's nothing
wrong with that I don't pass judgment on
anybody who buys a particular piece of
product that they like and when it comes
to this type of technology competition
is good you have to have competition in
the field but it made other companies
step up and really change the way that
they handle their devices a lot of
people may not actually realize that
Apple reached out to google to make some
of their native apps for their iphone
namely the map system and the YouTube at
a book out there knows been on a joint
and they decided to sever all ties with
Google you can't even get google maps
anymore on your iPhone you have to use
the web interface I hate the YouTube app
for iOS and when it comes to the maps
and only have any problems with my maps
but turn okay this way feel like I've
been here before okay fine Apple maps
blow I used it to try you to a business
meeting yesterday and I was late because
it took me down an entirely different
street I'm driving along and I'm in the
field somewhere I'm off-roading climbing
a mountain I mean Egypt and then all of
a sudden here you've arrived at your
destination this can't be right where am
I I'm not in Lansing
hey you can't make this up that just
happened right now but just happened I'm
not in Michigan I'm in California you've
got those android people who just make
it their life's mission to make iPhone
users just completely miserable what's
that oh is that the iphone 5 yeah I've
got the galaxy s3 Scott bigger screen
four point eight inch mm-hmm how's those
mats working out for you huh yeah it did
it get you here by my way of Canada yeah
not so and then you've got those iphone
users that just make you want to cringe
even if you're an iPhone user I hear it
with Steve Jobs last last project before
he died so I just want to make sure that
i had a little piece of the legacy yeah
it's like a it's kind of like it's
little farewell durch to apple before
Tim Cook came in and everything up
four-inch 4 inches is plenty big enough
for me but you know for a phone anyway
yeah without recording this entire time
wish I'd known I would have done
something with my hair the point I'm
making here people is it doesn't matter
what kind of phone you use whether or
not your Android your Apple as long as
you're happy live and let live someone
decides to say something stupid to you
because of the kind of phone that you
use whether it be on the internet or in
person just punch him in the face wait
that's um that's best wrong advice
scratch dad's got up it's just ignore
him and you know the one about your
merry way if you're happy and what
you've got works for you then so be it
and I say that if somebody has a problem
with the fact that you like to upgrade
every time a new phone comes out so what
your money it's your business I just
remember if somebody hates the phone
that you have the bottom line is they're
jealous this has been a public service
announcement brought to you by Jay of
Jays two cents remember doesn't matter
what kind of phone you use as long as
it's better than the other guys above
all else it's important that you
subscribe follow me on Twitter and check
me out on my brand new facebook page
where I'm trying to connect with you
you've got a question that you'd like
answered I'm putting together a QA and I
mentioned it quite a few times and I
would like to get some more questions
here everybody you know they're coming
in slowly leave me a tweets comments or
a facebook message about what it is you
would like js2 sense to bring to you on
youtube hi mom mom I you won't you will
not guess what just happened Oh
god oh my god Jayde students dropped his
phone he dropped his song and he put a
dent in it oh my god oh my god I know
right we'll see it's okay though he went
to the apple store and even though he
was having a couple of problems with his
phone and there was a big ol Jensen if
they decided to go ahead and replace it
