still on Cervantes torpor quit do it I
don't know what that is what's up guys
you're watching Jace two cents and here
we are once again doing another product
review but this time it has absolutely
nothing to do with computers in fact it
has to do with this guy and has to do
with this guy it has to do with uh
mobile devices and being active and
being out in the weather and being
rugged and taking a look at a product
that's designed to keep your device safe
and sound now if you've been anywhere in
your smartphones then or even tablets or
laptops and all anything technology wise
chances are you are very familiar with
the name OtterBox OtterBox has really
been known of having some of the most
rugged cases available in the world but
over the last year or two has really
been a trend of people making waterproof
cases so we're gonna go ahead and take a
look today at the otterbox preserver
series waterproof case from OtterBox now
I've got actually taking this thing out
and taking a look at it yet and I've had
it for a little while and fortunately it
took me a while to get to this sorry
ardor box so I decided what we'll do is
we'll go ahead and open this up together
and we'll get unboxing and installation
and first thoughts all live right here
on camera that way there's nothing
scripted and you know sometimes some of
these cases can be kind of hard to put
together and when we're talking about
waterproof it's very important that it's
done right so we're gonna do this
together right now on camera this is
retail packaging here it's got a nice
little embossed water drops on there it
slides out of here and comes with a
little lanyard right there let's set
that aside and then you have your case
everything just kind of fell out of the
package in me you've got your case that
comes here in two pieces and then you've
got your instruction booklet here in
quite a few different languages so if
you happen to speak fight tastes s sy
Devore taya tui or maybe pro EV way
see sukar Casas then they've got you
covered but I speak that their American
English so we're gonna go ahead and
switch over here I think they don't have
American they only have English there
are eight very important steps to follow
on this and it says right on there you
must clean your device and remove any
dust and dirt and remove any screen
protectors device wipes and stickers so
if you have a screen protector on your
device as I do you must remove that and
that kind of makes me sad because I like
the one that I have on here but for the
sake of the video this is the way we do
it around here and this one's been on
here since this one's been out here
since Maine almost pulled it right out
of my hands holy Wow okay that was a
Griffin case that was a Griffin screen
protector on there Lois look look at I'm
actually rolling like residue off of if
look at that that just rolled off of my
screen this residue there gross it's
like it's not all over the place look so
I'm gonna go clean this and we will be
right back
okay so here we've got my device all
nice and clean front and back there's no
dust or debris or dirt in there and
although I was probably just on there
now I live in the desert so step number
one says open the case in separate two
halves upper right blah okay put the
back panel of the case apart to separate
the two hats done that came out of the
box that way
number three attach the lanyard but I
don't like lanyard so we're not going to
attach the lanyard for feed the opposite
end through the thin lanyard again fiber
plate place the device into the front
panel of the case inserting the bottom
first and pressing the device into place
to ensure it is firmly seated so we're
gonna take the front half we are going
to take the device and put it in bottom
first and then we are going to push it
in there nice and firm that really does
fit really snugly snuggly snuggle ish
ish neatly in there there all right
that's in there not going anywhere
step number six install the back panel
by aligning the bottom edge in place
with the bottom groove gently slide the
bottom edge into the bottom groove
there's a little lip right here and you
just take that and push it on down in
there so it seats in there like that and
seven complete the case closure by
snapping the bottom point first then the
top point and then second middle point
number three our second and the middle
point last I promised I went to school
guys let's try this again complete case
closure by snapping the bottom point one
it's labeled on here a little graphic
first top point two second and the
middle point three last do one final
check to ensure all six snaps are
completely closed so we're gonna do the
two on the bottom then the two on the
top and then we are going to do the two
in the middle so here we go that's
together bottom top middle ensure that
it is all snapped in and sure as heck
looks like we do we have a warning on
the back you probably should have read
that first read installation
installation manual instructions or
installation instructions before
installing device store case pieces
separately do not expose to excessive
heat orally says less instructions dead
estelle on savant to store pro quit do
it I don't know what that is
anyway okay so here's the case it's put
together and go ahead pull the label off
the back there it's now completely
together so let's go ahead and take a
look at the case and of course just like
any Otterbox case it does add a little
bit of heft to it but it's also
extremely durable in fact that was just
carpet you can take it drop it on the
desk
chuck it across the room at the door
because fight your crap out right it
can't hurt the same except you can put
some really dirty stuff on the little
screen protector this is not going to
hurt anything except your own head now
but guys it is tough and when I'm
checking for here is to see if any of
these snaps come up
heart while it's being dropped doesn't
look like it is everything is sealed
right it's waterproof so how do you
charge the thing well you've got these
ports on port plugs on the bottom here
that you can pull up and pull right on
out and there you go plug it in the
speaker ports have as you can see here
they have these little pieces of film on
there be careful with that you don't
want to stab or gouge that because then
it's no longer waterproof but
aesthetically it looks good it's
available in a few different colors I've
seen pink green black white think
there's a blue that's pretty much it it
looks really good you've got cover on
the back there let's see how the camera
flash works here real quick through the
little film yeah it's gonna take a
picture of you guys shall we do that
flash on jeez all right there we go no
complaints but you know if we're really
gonna test this if we're really gonna
put this to the test I think a bowl of
water is in order
it survived thank God it survived and
all seriousness guys I had absolutely no
doubts that this was going to survive
and that it was gonna sit in the water
and play the video and play the audio
and have absolutely no problems
whatsoever
guys this is OtterBox I mean OtterBox
has made a name for itself in the
industry as long as it's been around now
it's being just some of the most rugged
beefiest strongest cases that you can
buy I mean I'm tempted to run this over
with the truck another don't recommend
it so I'm not going to do it
but the backing here on the inside of
the case supersoft it's kind of foamy
it's really really soft so your phone is
actually cushioned on impacts I mean it
comes with a screen protector already
built in and this screen protector here
actually dramatically increases the
strength of your screen because it takes
the impact on the glass and it spreads
it out over the over the surface area of
that so it's no different no different
than like snowshoes right you take a
small foot and you step in the snow you
fall right through if you take a wide
plant you sit on top of it so it's the
same thing with the glass so guys this
is tough I mean what I'd be doing this
with my phone if I wasn't sure the auto
box auto box OtterBox was going to
protect it so there you go guys Jays two
cents I hope you guys have enjoyed this
