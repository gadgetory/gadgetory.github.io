Jays two cents and today we're gonna
take a look at an 80 plus gold rated
power supply that actually meets
platinum standards what the heck kind of
voodoo magic is this also magic at all
it's the v-series power supply from
coolermaster
now before we open up the box we're
gonna go ahead and take the ceremonial
tour around the outside of the box and
take a look at the packaging on the
front here you've got a nice image of
the power supply and a silver label on
here it says power supply it's good to
know fully modular cables which is
really good for easy cable management
get rid of the ones you don't need and
keep the ones you do it's got a hundred
and thirty hundred and thirty-five
millimeter fluid dynamic bearing a high
quality extended life silent fan they
use a pretty good quality fan on this
and it's a hundred percent Japanese made
capacitors which is really good for
quality and having a nice silent
operation without having any sort of
coil whine or capacitor buzz or anything
like that
so does say V 700 right here on the
front I do like the styling of the logo
because sometimes you do look at that on
the power supply 80 plus gold but with
platinum rating as I mentioned a nice
Coolermaster logo there on the side here
we do have some specs Intel form factor
atx12v it does work on AMD so don't let
that worry you
it's got active PFC dimensions are 150
millimeters by 170 by eighty six
millimeters or five point nine inches by
six point seven by three point four one
hundred thirty-five millimeter fan as I
mentioned the efficiency is 90% on
typical load 90% efficiency that's
awesome and it's got a hundred thousand
hours rated life that's a long time guys
so you've got all your connectors listed
there we'll go over that when we open
the package and on the back here you
have fully modular as it says and it's
got some fan curves and power curve on
here we'll take a look at that a little
more in-depth when we get into the
actual power supply and it's got
pictures of the cables that come with it
but who wants to look at pictures we're
gonna actually unbox this thing and take
a look so let's go ahead and get this
package open and let's see exactly what
you get inside get the package open here
you know so the sides if we can do this
without ripping everything apart
cuz I hate this type of packaging
honestly it's got these little flaps on
there and they like to get in there nice
and tight and I like to keep the
packaging looking nice and new because
I'm
kind of weird like that so alright
there's the outer sleeve off the box
you've got a nice coolermaster logo
right there and just like everything
else these days is one of those flippy
open type boxes there and right off the
bat on the top you get a nice very
heavy-duty heavy gauge power cable for
your power supply from the wall you get
a very nice pouch with all of your
cables in there we'll take a look at
that one in a second and then you get
foam high-tech foam I love high tech
foam Tyga's point this up a little bit
better how cake I love high tech foam
and then you get the power supply inside
of this pouch which is really kind of
cool and then you get your instruction
manual that comes with it and just toss
the boss's box aside over there so as
you can see here or maybe you can't see
this power supply is available in seven
hundred eight fifty and thousand watt
variants and they do show different
mounting options in there they've got
your pin out on here
you know it's standard stuff it's pretty
much the same for almost every power
supply this on the 24 pin and eight pin
for the power CPU power but when it
comes to the actual individual modular
cables it's probably proprietary but
this manual is repeated in a bunch of
different languages and we're not that
interested in that we want to take a
look here at this bad boy and as you can
see this is actually a very attractive
looking power supply I really like this
it's got a honeycomb mesh grille on here
which is really good for airflow you've
got your cooler master fan on there as
has a set on the box it is a fluid
dynamic bearing so that means that it's
going to be nice and vibration free it's
all metal construction I love this
brushed aluminum look this two-tone look
on there the v700 is actually printed
directly on to the metal so it's not a
sticker it's not a sticker that's gonna
peel up or come off on you and then
you've got as you can see right there
v700 and all the technical information
about the power supply and on the back
of course you've got your toggle switch
all high end power
supplies definitely come with toggle
switches so we'll go ahead and set this
aside here I really like the aesthetics
oh and then on the back here not only do
you have your modular plugs but they are
all labeled for you so there's no
guessing as to which one is which and
those look this is a very sharp power
supply oh my gosh I've never actually
seen one of these in person only in
pictures and they look very it looks
very good I really like it
inside the package here you've got your
24 pin they it is sleeved it's not
individual sleeved but it is sleeved and
you can see length is pretty decent but
it might be a little bit on the short
side to be honest with you if you're
running it up the backside of a big case
a little bit short I would like to see a
longer cable though especially if for a
high end power supply like this and then
all the other cables that come with it
are very akin to just about every power
supply on the market now there are these
flat cables these ribbon cables which
theoretically make them a lot easier to
route and it also makes a lot easier to
individually sleeve these if you decide
you want to do that it's probably
something I'll end up doing is I'm going
to be using this power supply and a
build I'm working on here at the end of
this year you get 1/2
okay so you get two sets of PCI Express
cables which is good enough for ya so
they're they're piggyback off of each
other so you've got one power cable can
supply a graphics card so this is a
two-way SLI friendly power supply so you
see you've got six pin and eight pin on
there and you've got two of these so
this can handle a two-way SLI or to a
crossfire you've got four pin molex here
with a floppy drive cable who the heck
uses floppy drives anymore so it's got a
floppy drive on there you've got another
four pin molex
R take that back you've got your SATA
another 4-pin molex your another SATA
your CPU eight pin power as which is
also split for four pin if you're using
it on an older board or an AMD type
board or old Intel board and then you've
got your another SATA here so that's
pretty much it
oh and you also get nice black case
mounting screws here for your power
supply now what sets this power supply
apart honestly and I asked this
Coolermaster straight up if this meets
platinum specifications that's a great
selling point so why not classify this
and advertise this as being 80 plus
platinum and basically the response was
under-promise over-deliver 93% is
excellent efficiency but it's not 93
percent at full load obviously if you
take a look at the power curve here
which I'm gonna put up on the computer
the full load tends to drop to
efficiency to approximately
again right about ninety percent
efficiency so that's still I mean that's
amazing that's amazing rating it's just
I guess they want to like they said
under deliver and over-promised or under
okay okay let's get that straight I
apologize under-promise over-deliver
there we go we don't want to sound like
some of the other guys out there that
over-promised under deliver yeah we
don't want that but if you're looking
for a great power supply that's gonna
keep things nice and cool
nice and quiet make great use of the
power being pulled from the wall so
you're not killing your energy bills for
a gaming computer or a rendering
computer and it's gonna take that power
and turn it into usable usable efficient
power and not turn it into heat that's
just gonna disappear into the atmosphere
definitely check out the V 700 series
700 watt 850 watt a thousand watts and
if you've looked at my video that I did
in the past about how much why does your
power supplies are really using you'll
see that 700 watts 850 and a thousand is
perfect sweet spot you don't need any
more than that even if you're running
multiple graphics cards so there you
have it guys if you want to learn more
about this product or learn a little bit
more about the efficiency rating and
stuff Coolermaster has an awesome
website called cm university go and
check it out I'll put the information
down in the description and you can go
and learn about all this stuff and it's
very good educational site you'll learn
all about 80 plus ratings and power
supplies and all sorts of stuff there so
go and check it out so there you have it
this is definitely something I think
should be on your holiday buyers list
this is a series that I'm gonna be doing
here it's I'm gonna be doing a whole

on your list as a great buy for the
holidays the price on this and the
efficiency and the quality of parts to
the price ratio on this is absolutely
superb so there you have it guys the
v700 power supply great great buy I

supply this is not one of those ones as
they send me and I'm gonna just stick it
on the wall this is definitely going in
a build of mine so if you liked this
video you know what to do check out some
of my other videos and as always guys I
will see you in my next video
and we are going to talk a little bit
more about this later when you start the
bill but it's quite a bit different than
