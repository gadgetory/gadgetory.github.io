here and I am holding in my hand here
the next generation of motherboards
featuring USB 3.1 and this one is from
MSI and it is the x99 a gaming 7 MSI is
really made a push towards this gaming
line of motherboards and graphics cards
and it's doing pretty damn well for
itself so today we're going to do a kind
of a quick overview and unboxing of this
thing and then we're going to hook it up
and we're just gonna have a great time
and the only thing we're missing is
s'mores
we don't like s'mores because they're
unhealthy and bad they taste amazing the
new EVGA silent series power supplies
offer excellent silence and efficiency
through their new EVGA Eco mode
technology and also features a seven
year warranty for worryfree gaming
click the link in the description to
learn more I don't really want to spend
a whole lot of time going over the
overview on this thing because really it
shares and inherits a lot of the
features that are already on the z97
gaming series of motherboards especially
the gaming seventh the main difference
on this thing really being the USB 3.1
now the USB 3.1 actually has up to 10
gigabit per second connection which is
twice as fast as USB 3.0 unfortunately I
don't have a testing kit so I can't
actually test that today but just take
my word for it we did take a look at it
at CES and it was going very very fast
especially compared to USB 3.0 now it
features all the same stuff that you
would come to expect which is the audio
Boost 2.0 with its high quality
amplifiers and capacitors on there so
you can run high impedance headphones
directly off the motherboard with a very
low noise floor no hiss or crackle and
actually power power-hungry headphones
like the sennheiser game zeroes or which
just take 150 ohms to drive or they have
150 ohms of resistance to drive and so
you usually would need a DAC or an
amplifier this can do it built in pretty
much all of the MSI gaming motherboards
are coming with the killer 28 2200 NIC
in there so it's a network
prioritization packet prioritization if
you're not already aware that you 2200
is basically pack
prioritization built into the networking
card so that your games get priority
traffic when it comes to the network
coming in and out of your computer now
the USB audio power built into this
thing if you guys are running an
external DAC basically it's going to
allow nice clean solid 5 volt output of
the USB power which sometimes on other
motherboards when you plug in multiple
USB devices the 5 volt can actually drop
down as low as 4.6 and that can create a
problem for some USB powered decks so
this is utilizing and featuring a USB
audio power amplifier built in so it's
always going to have 5 volts of constant
power come out of the USB now this thing
would really be a gaming motherboard if
it couldn't handle a bunch of graphics
cards so it does support up to Quad SLI
and quad crossfire now of course it's
got all the other mumbo jumbo you would
expect like turbo m2 drives for a Gen 3
by 4 one other thing that I really like
the MSI is doing and other manufacturers
have started doing as well is there
promotion of the live streaming
community this motherboard actually
comes with a free six month premium
xsplit license so if you bought this
motherboard then you would be able to
start live streaming immediately with it
with a six month premium key that's
pretty cool and that's just a bonus
right there so there you go that is the
overview portion of the x99 a gaming 7
let's go ahead and hook this thing up
into the testbench
suit some overclocking and some gaming
and let's go ahead and see just how
badass this thing really is I love the
aesthetics of this board it looks
freaking amazing and I guess you guys
know what that means it's time for so
I'll go ahead and let I'll go ahead and
lies cue it up go ahead and say it right
now
I've gone ahead and installed B
motherboard over here and put my lovely
Titan on there as you can see and the
first thing we're going to test with
this motherboard is boot time many guys
know the BIOS can actually add a lot of
time when it comes to booting up your
system so let's go ahead and see how the
BIOS does on here I just hit the power
button and there's the splash screen for
the monitor mmm-hmm
dinna to do b49 see down there postcodes
a two splash screen and windows boot
screen so yeah I mean it's not terrible
it's not super fast but I also don't
have MSI's memory fastboot on there oh
look activate windows because it just
recognized that I put a new motherboard
on here therefore it's like oh yeah you
need to activate so yeah we'll deal with
that later
one of the troubles of installing tons
of motherboards now one of the things I
really like about this motherboard
because I have looked at this
motherboard and looked at the BIOS and
stuff before getting to this portion of
the video is the amount of options that
are actually on this thing it's
absolutely insane
now gaming motherboards tend to have all
the things that a gamer would want you
know things like SLI support better
sound better networking for packet
prioritization probably pilot dip
apparently talking is hard things like
packet prioritization for gaming and
stuff and usually you oh you you give up
a few functions like a lot of
overclocking support but not the case
here now one of the things MSI is really
known for is the MSI OC genie in fact
that's looking kind of blurry let me let
me let me fix that for you there okay
that should be a little better I know
it's not ideal pointing a camera at the
screen but I also am using DisplayPort
for this monitor and I can't capture
DisplayPort anyway if OC Genie here and
clicking that it's kind of like a
OneTouch overclock I'll go ahead and hit
that and let's go ahead and see what
kind of overclock it puts on here this
is my 5820k they did actually send with
me a 59 30 k with this motherboard
but I'm going to go ahead and use my
5820k because then I have something to
compare it to because I was already
doing overclocking on my other
motherboard so I can see if this is
getting me any better results or not so
right away it says OC Genie is enabled
when you go into the BIOS it tells you
like don't touch anything in the BIOS
for overclocking it's not recommended
but we can see here it did overclocked
to 3.8 gigahertz did a multiplier of 38
so up from 3.3 23.8 it's pretty modest
it's only 500 megabyte or megabytes 500
megahertz nothing huge and then the DRAM
went from 20 133 to 2400 now this is
obviously not using eggs and B profile
too because this is 20 800 megahertz Ram
and it's only running at 24 so it's very
conservative these must be numbers that
MSI feels very confident every single
CPU will post with so I'm gonna go ahead
and disable OC Genie will restart and
then we'll start showing you some of the
settings in this board it's actually
quite impressive okay so this BIOS is
going to look very familiar to anyone
with an MSI motherboard we have our
Settings tab here it's got lots of
different functions in here Advanced PCI
subsystem power management setup
basically what happens when the power
turns off etc etc all that kind of stuff
you come to expect boot prioritization
settings there or you can just drag the
icons here around in the order you want
them to boot in very very user friendly
and then we have over here hardware
profile well this is going to bring up a
lot of different stuff here in fact you
have all your different fans you can see
the RPMs are those fans and you can play
with the temperature fan curve on here
so just like you do with your video
graphics cards your AMD graphics cards
you can then utilize a smart fan mode
and you can start to control the fan
speed based on temperature and this
motherboard I'm actually using the CPU
fan 1 for the pump so the pump is
speeding up is slowing down since it's a
PWM pump based on this curve
so you can see here the pumps running at
twelve hundred and fifty now I could
tell it you know just run at full speed
or give me fan control etc etc but I
prefer to just kind of let it do its own
thing it's actually pretty smart CPU is
idling right now at 39 Celsius it's
actually pretty
hot in the BIOS it tends to go under
more to load than when sitting at
desktop but for overclocking I was
actually quite impressed
there are a ton and I mean a ton of
overclocking functions here in fact way
more than the average user is probably
going to need so I'm just going to do a
basic overclock here we're in advanced
mode there's even a simple mode for
overclocking where you can do very
simple stuff in fact I'll leave it it
simple right now we'll do a CPU ratio of
45 that's going to give us 40 500
megahertz as a targeted CPU frequency
ring ratio will leave that audio audio
auto CPU base clock we'll leave that out
100 DRAM frequency let's go ahead and go
for let's go for 20 666
interestingly enough there's no 2800 on
there a lot of motherboards actually
omitted 2800 because it seemed like
there was something going on with the
chipset where 2800 was not stable for
most motherboards and most Rams so they
jump straight from 2666 to 3200 now why
am I not going with 3200 well because
when you overclock the CPU the memory
controller also goes under stress and so
you don't want to go too high on your
memory first so we're just going to do
20 666 which is an overclock on the
memory from 21 33 which is the base
clock but we're not going to the XMP
speed of 2800 just yet
in fact we want to do that we would do
that right here at the XMP profile mem
try it basically it's a compatibility
for performance mode DRAM timing mode we
leave that all stock fast boat boot
stock then we can start playing with
voltages here so we got VCC in voltage
is set at 2 I'm going to put that to 2.1
when I put the voltage a little bit high
as do 1.35 I already know that's good it
turns red because MSI is basically
telling you hey bro you're going to burn
up your CPU but we're fine or underwater
marine voltage will leave all that at
Auto and then CPU specifications CPU
technology support this is just telling
you things about your CPU you can't
change anything in their memory Z CPU
features this is the screen that I
wasn't expecting in here this is the
kind of stuff you tend to find on like
the M power which is
overclocking board you can see you get
you get control over everything in here
you can even at a very turned off
seeonee support but you can even do see
state limits you can do the long
duration power limit in watts long
duration maintained short duration power
limit CPU current limit over temperature
protection interval V ro V and OCP
protection D mi gen to D mi D emphasis
control you guys have no idea what any
of this is I'm sure but basically this
is giving you enthusiast level overclock
and we're talking like ln2 trying to
break World Records type of control on
this and then as well as the digital
power look at all the voltage control
you get in here CP under voltage
protection over current protection
switching frequency you can even change
the frequent frequency at which the
voltage is switching CPU under voltage
protection over voltage protection V
droop control put that at 100 right now
see if you phase control I mean they
just give you so much stuff that for the
average person you would just never ever
use so right now we're just going to try
for basic 4.5 gigahertz and 2666 on the
memory and 2.1 volts into the package
1.3 5 volts on the cpu it's a little bit
on the higher side but I think we'll
post let's say this is kind of an
important number because 4.5 wasn't very
stable and either my Asus board or my as
rock board I had to bump it down to 4.4
over time because it degraded slightly
but we are currently right now in here
and booted 4.5 gigahertz so now we need
to do a little stress test and see if it
holds up and either way it kind of got
my overclocking vote of approval because
it's giving you all the functions you
could ever possibly need for
overclocking and in a gaming motherboard
that's pretty awesome now if it doesn't
crash immediately that's a good thing
now we're stressing the CPU the FPU the
cache and the memory all at once on here
and temperatures look like they're
sitting in the sixty three fifty seven
forty eight forty so yeah looks like
we're sitting right around the mid-60s
on the temperatures that's good because
high 80s is actually
JMX for the 2011 - three sockets so
looks like we're doing pretty good there
so what we'll do now is we'll just let
this run for a minute and then we'll
come back and see how its how its
performing or whether or not it's stayed
stable I should say well this thing's
been going for about eight minutes now
and as you can see we've got no crashes
whatsoever no errors and the temperature
seems to have stabilized right around
the mid 70s on the Coors it's actually
very very good considering how much
voltage is being pumped into this thing
so now if this was an overclocking
tutorial I would tell you to start
bringing down the voltage if you're ok
with this frequency or step it up one
more notch on the frequency multiplier
and see if you get a post I don't think
we will but for the sake of it we'll go
ahead and try 4.6 just to see if it
posts and then we'll kind of go ahead
and do a wrap-up about this motherboard
how I feel about it
well 4.6 is trying to boot into Windows
and we got a crash yeah I didn't think
4.6 was going to happen I couldn't get
that to happen on any one of my systems
and heck even 4.5 wasn't even get able
to get into the desktop on my either my
asrock nor my x99 deluxe board so that's
kind of interesting so I'm not sure what
MSI is doing differently here but we do
seem to have a little bit better
stability so I'm going to put that back
to 4.5 and let's go ahead and talk about
the how I feel about this board well
there we go guys the x99 a gaming seven
from MSI I don't tend to go this deep
into motherboard reviews or actually
pain in the ass honestly to hook them up
and get all the drivers installed and
stuff there's a lot of stuff I wasn't
able to even cover with this otherwise
the video would have been you know five
hours long I mean all the stuff you saw
me doing with the overclock you could do
with their own desktop utilities but I'm
an old-school overclocker I like to do
things the old-school way through BIOS
and as you can see there UEFI BIOS it's
very easy to navigate it's very friendly
and they give you a lot more functions
than I thought that they would I mean
the functions that we were seeing here
were like empower level really makes me
wonder how the x99 X power is is
performing when it comes to all the
overclocking functions so I mean not
only as a software and the BIOS and the
motherboard great but be
action of it is fantastic I mean it
utilizes all of the lineage from like
the military class specs that it's put
on a lot of their high-end motherboards
it's got multi layer PCBs it's got you
know sound house isolation for the
built-in audio so you're not getting
cracking and popping and stuff
everything about it just seems very very
solid now granted it's red and black and
that seems to be a little bit overdone
it does look really really good I mean
the heat sinks on there fantastic
looking the board layouts great the
matte PCB looks fantastic the only thing
I'm not a huge fan of though is the way
that it has green buttons and a blue LED
in there that just kind of kills it for
me make it all red or maybe even a white
LED would look better I think the blue
and the green murder it once it's on and
if you had it sitting up in a normal
case with a case window that would
really take away from the overall black
and red that the gaming line has really
come to to stand for well guys that is
it for the x99 a gaming segment I think
it's going to stay on my test bench for
a while when I do motherboard reviews I
like to put my favorites in the systems
and right now the msi x99s definitely a
very solid solid motherboard can't
really think of anything I don't like
about it with the exception of the
lights like I said and that's very very
it's very trivial so anyway guys follow
on social media if you guys have any
questions thanks for watching thanks for
being a fan of the channel and I look
forward to making my next J's $0.02
video I would say I don't know what it's
about but I actually do I'm actually
getting caught up and the amount of
stuff there is to do including
skunkworks build right around the corner
said that before so that means you don't
believe me but it's soon I promise
oh hey there see you guys come in
welcome to the venture is night with
Jays two cents and coconut monkey
tonight we're going to be reviewing the
dxracer chair so buckle up because it's
gonna be fun for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
