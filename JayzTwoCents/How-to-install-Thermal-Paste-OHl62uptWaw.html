and if there's one thing I've learned
about all the messages I've gotten over
the past couple of weeks is that many of
you are getting ready to take on your
very first computer build a lot of you
are taking on this endeavor for your
very first time which is why this
episode of a little bite of tech is all
about applying thermal paste first of
all you're going to have to make sure
that you have appropriate thermal grease
right here I'm just using some cheap
thermal take for the sake of the video
here but I do recommend it Arctic silver
5 or a s 5 or any sort of silver
compound because it conducts heat very
very well there's three major techniques
when it comes to applying thermal paste
the first one I'm going to show you here
is the P method and what you want to do
is you want to put just enough thermal
paste in the center about the size of a
pea trying to get it as round as
possible and what's going to happen here
is as you place the heat sink onto the
motherboard it's going to evenly
dispersed or displace the thermal
compound on the CPU because it's most
important to make sure that you can get
a nice even application of thermal
grease onto the CPU and one thing I want
to point out before we take off this
heatsink here and see how well that
thermal paste spread out over the heat
spreader this technique does not make a
difference if you're using intel or AMD
or even if you're putting thermal paste
on some graphics cards heat sinks or
some water blocks all of the
fundamentals here when it comes to
spreading out the thermal compound is
the same regardless of the application
so let's go ahead and take off the heat
sink here and see how well the P methods
spread out over the CPU
and as you can see right there it's
pretty and he's it's got a pretty good
adhesive factor okay okay we're going to
go ahead and call that one a blooper it
took this the CPU right out of the
socket with it okay we got the heatsink
off and as you can see here this is one
of the reasons why I'm not a fan of the
P method if you take a look at the edges
here you can see that you do not have
complete coverage of the heatsink on the
CPU so this would have actually led to
an overheating situation in the CPU
because this much of it would not have
been cooled this would have probably not
caused any damage but you would have
noticed higher than desirable
temperatures okay we've cleaned off the
grease and the next method we're going
to go ahead and do here is the line
method basically just like it sounds you
take the thermal paste and you put a
nice even line of thermal compound
across the top of the heat sink or the
heat spreader this stuff isn't the
greatest quality as you can see here it
kind of globbed out at the end but if
you use high quality thermal paste
that's not going to really be an issue
okay we've got our we've got our
heatsink on here it's nice and tight
it's what you said go ahead and take
this off now and see how well the line
method or method number two spread out
here on the heatsink and once again it
took the CPU right out with it this is
alright so there's the line method right
there you can see half of it's on the
heatsink half it's on the processor but
once again as you can see here we do not
have complete coverage on the CPU heat
spreader okay and last but not least
we're going to go ahead and do the ex
method it's just like the line method
only you're going to make an X across
the top of the heatsink what the idea of
the X is is that it's supposed to help
it get into the edges or the corners a
little bit more okay as you can see here
we've got better coverage on the heat
spreader I'm going to go ahead and chalk
this one up to being crap thermal paste
from thermal tape
recommend that stuff at all but I
definitely do recommend the ex method
because it does get better coverage so
there you have it a nice quick and easy
video from Jai's two cents about the
proper way of installing thermal paste
on your CPU or GPU or whatever you are
doing get it now I can already hear some
of you guys jumping right out of my
screen saying hey wait a minute here
on your water cooling video you did a
whole different method with the credit
card or the business card and you spread
it all out over the heat sink I went
ahead and decided not to show that
method because there's a couple of
reasons why some people would say you
shouldn't do that one it can introduce
air pockets into the thermal paste when
it gets kind of churned up and if air
gets caught in between there then it
causes overheating issues I've been
doing it for years I'm very comfortable
with it but I don't want to mislead
anybody into doing something that could
have potentially damaged their computer
and to some of you guys got really angry
about that and practically chastised me
so I don't want to go through that again
anyway I'm going to get on out of here
you've been watching Jays two cents and
this has been a little bite of tech
bringing you short little YouTube videos
giving you guys the power to build and
customize your own pcs get out of here
and go build something do it do it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
