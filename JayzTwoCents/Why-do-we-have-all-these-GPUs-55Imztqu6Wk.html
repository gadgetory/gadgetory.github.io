to behind the desk I think it's almost
like a new series I want to start where
I don't do series Who am I kidding but
anyway it's a series I would like to do
about more like how we run our business
it's a really unique perspective at a
time where there's more self-made
celebrities I don't call myself a
celebrity but it's more self-made people
now than ever I think it's interesting
how people run their day to days and I
think some of you guys might be
interested in that so if you're
interested in it click the like button
that way I'll know but anyway today
we're talking about a very specific
topic and all my videos I see this over
and over and especially lately with the
video about me resurrecting NYX 780 is
you have all this stuff why why do you
have all this stuff Jay why are you why
are you ruining the GPU market Jay we're
gonna talk about that today we're
talking about some myths we're gonna set
some records straight and we're gonna
talk about the things of like are we
contractually obligated to not sell and
give away this stuff we're gonna talk
about all that right now do you want to
be cooler do you want to be more
desirable well you're in luck because
right now you can own your very own Jays
2 cent swag and immediately be the cool
kid on the block max out your sex appeal
by following the link down below we're
gonna start over here as I turn blue and
I walk in front of my spotlight color
correction Jay have fun with this one
this is my AMD shelf my a iOS some cases
on the floor
headsets my keyboards the ghosts as one
case that yes we are doing something
with that I swear I promise the AMD
graphics cards why are there so few of
these versus the Nvidia look at that
shelf Nick look at that obviously we are
in vidya shields now here's what happens
I have a I have a philosophy and a
policy around here where I want to keep
at least 3 years worth of graphics cards
at least three years worth of cards and
one card from each tier that way if I
need to do any backwards compatible
testing future proof testing of past
Hardware we need to have all of that we
need to have at least one card of every
generation that means we need a 280 a
288 5 the 285 X to 2 ATX
292 90 X all of those and we aim to do
that we have some gaps
with AMD the reality is AMD has launched
a lot less cards in the last three years
than nvidia where if you look at in
video over here this goes all the way
back to the GTX 580 reason being is some
of these cards I already owned a lot of
these cards are I've acquired after the
channel grew MD like I said it medically
sends a lot less graphics cards and
NVIDIA does I've complained about the
fact that Nvidia seems to launch a new
graphics card every 5 minutes but I can
go all the way back to the GTX 500
series to see how well things perform
now obviously we have duplicates and
stuff here but what you're going to
notice here is we have like I think the
inventory says we have like 1410 atti is
including all of the the reference cards
the ones sitting in builds like thread
Ripper that's because when its current
generation I don't sell it and I don't
give it away unless it's it's slated for
giveaway will talk about the slating in
a second here so that's why you see all
these 10 atti sitting here on the shelf
if I want to use one aesthetically in a
build based on colors or I want to test
one out of just out of good-nature don't
sell this stuff none of this stuff is
sent under contract
not a single graphics card comes with
the you can't sell it you have to keep
it none of that exists this the irony of
it being green this is money to a
marketing department to Nvidia to MSI to
a Seuss they do not send me a graphics
card in their side of the bookkeeping
they send me $700 basically saying this
is your graphics card to do content with
and obviously they don't pay for reviews
they send the hardware and that's they
take the chance for a reviewer to either
love it or hate it like the NZXT
motherboard sitting right here on my
test bench not a fan I have been very
open about that not a fan of this so the
fact that they send us this stuff will
never influence our opinions maybe some
people that can maybe some people want
to protect that
I want all these cards so I'm gonna be
super favorable so they'll keep sending
it to me but I think most people by now
know if it's a product I don't like I'm
gonna tell the audience and more often
than not the company will come back to
me find out what I didn't like get some
more information think take it and try
to improve it as something I've achieved
and I'm really proud of that but anyway
we go backwards to try and keep as many
of these cards as we can and
as the generations move forward and the
new 2000 series cards come out you will
see this top shelf really thin out
you'll see a lot less of these will keep
at least one founders card of every
generation will keep my favorites of the
custom cards and then the rest will be
either given away to friends and family
maybe a couple online but mostly I give
them to friends of family quietly behind
the scenes it's no one's business who I
give it to or why but you'll see this
thin out you'll see the new cards fill
in and this all sort of slides down
let's talk about these these builds real
quick it's obvious this is my personal
build and I've seen some like J how many
personal builds do you need do you need
a computer to watch YouTube on you need
a computer in the bathroom do you need a
computer to do this and what what
wouldn't you know I don't obviously need
all these builds this I built because I
wanted to build something just really
high-end and classy not that skunkworks
isn't but this is going home with me and
skunkworks is coming back because the
audience likes seeing skunkworks they
want to see skunkworks it was a
centerpiece it built with the channel
and it's symbolic so they want to see it
so it's coming back here this is my test
bench this is my 780ti aka $1,000
ridiculous pricing this is our test
bench this is what we test things on how
do you think I know I don't like the
NZXT motherboard because I put it
together I used it and decided like I
don't like it if I just talked about it
in a box how would I know that so
obviously we have our test bench this is
thread Ripper this is a lovehate system
for me let me explain why this system is
the only 19 50 X thread repre CPU that I
have it is would be great for doing
testing on it'd be great for a server
it'd be great to use so many people
could use this system and do so many
good things with it I put this together
and intended it to be temporary I liked
it so much the audience liked it so much
that it didn't have the heart to tear it
down let me tell you why it's a
love-hate now because it's the only 19
50 X CPU I have I can't do any
aggression regression testing or other
testing with it because I'm not going to
be greedy and ask AMD for another CPU so
that I can just have this one sitting
here on display I haven't bought one yet
but I'm more than likely will but this
system is occupying a CPU 32 gigs of DDR
4 2 &amp;amp; 8 1080 T is a 1200 watt power
supply all the water cooling stuff that
you can see the zenith extreme
motherboard 2 radiators 5 fans do you
see when I'm getting at here
there's a lot of stuff sitting right
here this build is like well the current
cost of graphics cards builds like seven
thousand dollars and I feel guilty every
time I look at it but sometimes you just
have to have these amazing centerpieces
showcasing your work validating what we
do around here but we also underneath it
the irony this is not a hierarchy I
swear we have the budget systems these
are the systems that we use to do
low-end budget testing like we're
talking scraping the bottom of the
barrel like you've got four hundred
dollars which is not a cheap amount of
money but you got four hundred bucks and
you that's all you've got to make it
work can you do it these are the systems
we use for that so the monitor is
blocking it but Andy's system another
AMD and Intel system it like super
low-end stuff but anyway that's that's
why those are there as you can see down
here all of our cases and things power
supplies motherboards I have the same
philosophy with motherboards because how
can I go back and do future proof
testing member when you're testing
future proof your testing old hardware
not new hardware you can't test the
future before it's arrived so we have to
go back to test that stuff so that's why
we have all these motherboards we've got
quite a few generations represented here
we've got some FX boards z97 and up
I wanted a z77 I'd love to get an Ivy
Bridge system but I don't have one
maybe I'll source one but that's why
we've got all of this stuff not all of
it it has stuff in it like there's
nothing in this x99 board this is the
box for skunk works his mother board the
a god-like is in pieces more asus boards
up here but you can see for AMD we go
all the way back to in a 88 X chipset
this is a Kaveri APU that came out in
2013
do the math on that we keep old stuff so
that we can test it here's a little fun
behind the scenes you can see right here
J is build that's the one I just
finished because we put everything we're
using in boxes so we know where
everything is postponed there that is
what we have internally been calling the
post Malone build we've been calling it
postponed because it keeps getting
postponed because of the album drop
remember his his system is based on an
album an album that has not launched yet
I can't go forward with the build until
we have the album inspiration I'm not
getting early access to his album so
I've got nothing to go by
so we're calling it postponed which I
think it's gonna stick what do you think
do you think we should keep it yeah
postponed yeah for sure moving forward
we've got this is all the water cooling
stuff down here this shelf right here
it's all water cooling stuff this is my
dad's case right here the the his build
was in so I keep that around you can see
we've got AMD cpu or motherboards check
this out though this just came in an X
370 Strix ITX Verizon motherboard so
imma be doing an 1800 X rise in Mini ITX
built that's gonna be cool
also got one for Z 370 they sent both of
these at the same time this is gonna be
for the ghost s1 I know you need get
focus on that so K it's all the same
they look identical I'm gonna be doing
the ghost s1 build that tiny little like
six litre case or seven liter case
whatever it is using one of these boards
have decided which yet all of our rise
and CPUs you can see or back there
thread ripper sitting right there more
CPUs Ram SSDs and vme drives all that
stuff is sitting over there what's the
point of this J why are you why are you
doing all this why are you justifying
yourself to the audience I'm not I'm
giving information I'm giving some
transparency of the way we run things
around here I'm a business of hardware
I need hardware to run my business
without this hardware I cannot bring you
guys these videos having cash in hand
does me no good and let's say I took the
audience is not the whole audience the
those complaining about all my graphics
cards if I took their advice and gave
all this away it wouldn't make a single
dent or even a or even a hairline
scratch in the total problem right now
with GPU pricing but if I need to do a
video now I've gotta use a graphics card
and I have all this cash in hand and
there's no supply what good have I done
myself so I'm kind of sitting back right
now going I made the right move by
keeping all this stuff I would have kept
it anyway even if the market wasn't
screwed up but that's because that is
the business we do around here I just I
didn't need to make this video
clarifying anything I didn't need to
make this video justifying anything
there's nothing that justifies my
business is the way I run it you guys
decide if you're gonna watch it I put
the content out it's for you to consume
or to throw
it's not my job to make you watch or
convince you that the way I'm doing
things that's the right way it's not up
for debate
I just felt like making this video to
kind of show you guys a little bit more
behind the scenes than some of the ways
of thinking that I operate around here I
think I'm doing things pretty good the
numbers don't seem to disagree so guys
we're gonna go thanks for watching some
up to the updated content coming here
soon we'll talk about this real quick
this is the ghost s1 if you guys saw me
do the video on this you guys haven't
seen the ghost s1 build because it's not
out yet like the case is still being
funded well it's been funded it's being
built now they're gonna be sending me a
silver one this was a this was a
prototype that was sent to me actually
speaking of hardware laying around we
have a motherboard and the GPU sitting
inside here obviously doing some test
fitting but yeah this is gonna be coming
up here pretty soon when we doing that
1800 X Mini ITX build post Malone it's
coming in studio in one week that's
gonna be cool he'll be here in one week
if he doesn't postpone again but yeah
we've got some cool stuff coming guys
the point of this is I want to make you
guys the best content that I can make is
an amateur and it's up to you guys
hopefully like it or not like it with
that said guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
