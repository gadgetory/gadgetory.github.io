serious fuckup moment on this channel
and we just had one right now and we had
a great dress rehearsal of this video
because I just got done recording it and
went to turn off my wireless mic and it
was already off because the batteries
died mid video I totally pulled a Paul's
hardware did what it's so small you
really think so what does the wife thing
well she says it gets the job done - ugh
that smell
the fractal design No - OH - it's not
about how big it is but all about how
you use it what you see next to me here
is a lineup of graphics cards that I've
been collecting because we all know I
collect graphics cards like old kids to
the 50s collected baseball cards or
maybe kids at the 80s - because I
collected baseball cards and I've
obviously moved on to bigger and better
collecting but I do like to play around
with them for the sake of science and
today we are going to talk about Moore's
law we're going to try to apply it to
these graphics cards and see just how
far we've come in the last 5 years with
the nvidia side of graphics card
starting at the GTX 580 now the reason
why we're doing Nvidia and not AMD is
simply because I'm having a hard time
sourcing the cards I need for AMD
because most of them seem to have died
in self obliterating balls of fire over
time because you know AMD graphics cards
are pretty damn hot and a lot of them
have seen premature death due to heat
consumption and you know spontaneous
combustion I can get my hands on a 59 70
69 70 7970 and what was a - 90 - 90 ex
has already had those and a 390 ex
because I don't have a reference 390x I
only have the one water-cooled unit if I
can get my hands on those cards I will
do the same thing I'm doing today for
AMD and then we'll do a collective video
where we talk about the generational
improvements in performance between both
sides and see you know kind of who has
really been progressing farther over
time and we'll just let those numbers do
the
now this isn't an AMD versus nvidia
video don't look at it that way this is
just the cards that i happen to have on
hand now this is my GTX 580 this is mine
I've actually had this card now for
quite a while I actually bought this
card new back in November of 2010 when
they launched and this has got a lot of
nostalgia with it I actually sold it to
a friend who upgraded his system and
when he did I was like dude can I get
that 580 back and he he actually gave me
back the 580 so that I could do this
video awesome this card was overclocked
and water-cooled when I had it clearly
we put it back in stock reference format
we also have a GTX 680 this was sent
over by Jakob a TV ga thank you sir this
is one of his personal cards my 680 s
I sold my 680 that I had to my
brother-in-law so I don't have access to
that anymore
gtx 780 this is actually coconut monkeys
card
thank you coconut monkey for let me
borrow your card he's currently buy it
borrowing my geforce gtx 980ti g1 gaming
from gigabyte and when I told him I was
done doing the benchmarking he was like
oh do I have to give back the gigabyte
card he referred to it as the gt-r of
graphics cards
I told me I had to give back soon but he
can borrow it for a little while longer
this is his card and then I do have my
personal gtx 980 classified kingpin
actually it is a classified classified
kingpin card but yes this is not a
reference card however I did get a
reference bios from EVGA that will slap
into this card and turn this card into a
reference card where it has no benefits
of being the classified of a kingpin or
any of that it will not boost any
farther it will not overclock any
farther it will not even increase the
power target or any of that stuff when I
plug this in and just let it go it will
do the exact same behavior as a
reference 980 so this is not going to be
indicative of the classified kingpins
performance keep that in mind and then
just for you know laughs I went ahead
put the 980 or the 989 and 980ti we did
a tight necks in there now obviously
there's a couple of cards missing from
this lineup where I'm missing the
original Titan we are missing the Titan
black we are missing the 980ti and the
780ti now the reason why I didn't
include those as those cards are pretty
much variations of the same architecture
that was released incrementally
throughout the year rather than being a
generational improvement to the lineup
what does that mean it means there was
no 680 Ti and there was no 580 ti so I
decided in order to keep it as
apples-to-apples as I can we are
comparing these bare-bones
80 series lineup and then comparing to
the tight Nexus because that's the
single fastest GPU Nvidia makes right
now with all of its CUDA cores unlocked
and I figured it'd be fun just to see
how that kind of McMaster maybe in the
future when we get more TI models
because maybe they started the TI model
of the 80 series with the 780 maybe then
we'll do this video again in another
couple of years so we can do 5 or 6
cards and see how the generational gap
of the TI cards have actually improved
so now that we've rambled on quite a bit
and I don't think there's anything else
to mention here other than again all of
these cards are reference design with
the exception of the kingpin on there oh
yeah I think that's pretty much all
there is to do now I just want to talk
about the methodology here real quick
the reason why I did all of this was I
wanted to see if Moore's law even came
close to being true for graphics cards
and the reason why I mentioned that is
because Moore's law is something I've
always been interested in especially
being a part of technology and loving
computers and transistors and integrated
circuits and all that sort of stuff
Moore's law Gordon Moore was actually a
co-founder of something that is in my
eye
Gordon Moore put this in my eye what the
hell no he didn't really do that don't
don't get mad at him Gordon Moore is a
core co-founder core founder yeah I
guess he kind of is a core founder too
he is the cool I cannot say that he is
the co-founder of Intel and he had an
observation over the years and
especially on paper that the amount of
transistors in a dense integrated
circuit had been doubling every two
years that's a pretty aggressive curve
and you consider if they've made that
observation back in the 70s where we are
now in the you know 2015 we have come a
long way with billions of transistors in
a single unit now obviously these GPUs
are not going to hold true of being
twice as fast every two years or maybe
it will GPU performance I don't know if
that's going to integrate directly to
the comparison of cpu performance which
is what they were more or less talking
about then because they didn't have
graphics units then like we do now so
that's why we're doing this video how
far have we come let's go ahead and find
out
now obviously I only use firestrike for
this test and the reason why I did that
is it wouldn't have been fair to take
the older cards and put them against
newer titles because remember as the GPU
performance and the GPU technologies
increase and evolve so does the api's
and so do the developers utilizing api's
available for current hardware in most
cases I mean do I need to even mention
Witcher 3 and hare work some is an
example so it would not have been fair
to take games like Far Cry 4 or Witcher
3 or Crysis 3 and put them against these
cards because the GTX 580 was the
original Crysis days where it was like
can it run Crysis once again recording J
you're wrong it wasn't crisis it was
crisis to the original Crysis can it run
Crysis was kind of during the 8800 GT x
and 8800 ultra days which again I owned
one of those and yeah it didn't do a
great job at running crisis but the 580
was around during the crisis too era
just one to correct myself once again in
post processing because recording J is a
dumb ass and editing J is a little bit
smarter I don't even know if it would
have loaded with Crysis 3 so what I did
instead was I took the fire strike GPU
benchmark and then we ran it in normal
extreme and ultra and as you saw the
performances on there were pretty
consistent when it came to the amount of
increased a little bit more than that
going from 1440p 580 to 680 at 35 but
then 28 29 and 23 where we had less of
an increase going from 980 to Titan X at
1440p so as you can see 980 is looking
like a really good sweet spot for 1440p
gaming especially compared to a card
like the Titan X which is twice the
price now if we look at 4k obviously 50%
and then a 65% jump and then 30 and 25
where as you can see as cards got newer
the focus turned towards higher
resolution because the 580 if you guys
were not into PC parts when this thing
was new the 1080p was looked at like 4k
now where 1080p was that resolution like
oh man can it run 1080p
now everyone's like 1080p who cares my
phone has more pixels than 1080p but now
4k is obviously the thing and now we're
hearing about 5k and obviously there was
eight Caleb's being talked about for a
little while there as well it's kind of
getting insane we're pixel rate is
increasing faster than GPU speed is
that's why hopefully Pascal is going to
be quite the improvement now I wanted to
say that with the pretty consistent
numbers jumping you know improvement
wise from generation generation could we
predict what the next graphics card
speed was going to be like from Nvidia I
would have said yes if we were still
using standard GPUs surrounded by the
RAM chips that we're seeing today
however that's all going to change
obviously with HBM especially with AV
HBM gen 2 which is what Pascal is
supposed to be now a lot of people have
really spread some misinformation about
Pascal is supposed to be 10 times faster
than Titan X oh my god the 4k can you
imagine that's not what Shen what Jensen
said he said ten times the compute power
so Pascal he was talking about being a
professional environment powerhouse for
video editing and graphics design Direct
compute and stuff like that not gaming
the jury is still out on what's going to
happen with Pascal and gaming we're at
the wait till at least next year to find
that one out I'm looking forward to it
but for shits and giggles though I also
included skunk works in this lineup
because like I said this was my exact
graphics card right here and I was
curious as to well you know I had this
car in this card in 2010 how far has my
gaming experience increased since then
well here are those numbers and as you
can see it's pretty freaking I mean it's
it it pushed everything down so far you
can't even read the numbers on the chart
for the lower-end GPUs anymore
that it's so squished but we were 9
times 3 faster 9.3 times faster than a
single 580 at 1080p 12 times faster than
a single 580 at 1440p and at 4k 34.6
times faster remember this isn't % this
is times faster that's
just for fun holy crap man no no
skunkworks getting kind of old though
it's probably time to upgrade well I
hope this video was fun for you guys and
like I said I will go back and do this
for AMD if I can get my hands on the
cards that I need I might have to reach
out to some of the vendors and see if
they have any old like RMA units sitting
around or something that could at least
get me through the test but otherwise I
hope you guys had fun with this sake of
science type of video science I like
science and stuff if you guys enjoyed
this video hit that like button if you
thought that this was stupid then by all
means feel free to hit that dislike
button believe it or not and actually
helps as well follow on social media if
you guys want to chitchat about random
stuff and Technology and all that
otherwise I will see you in the next
video and thanks for watching this
little experiment of mine let me know if
you want me to do more stuff like this
if you want me to do more direct
comparisons let me know what and get
ready to do kind of an all in one water
cooling shootout to where we take a few
different water coolers and see which is
best I like doing comparative videos
shootouts are fun it's like watching
people fight I love watching people
fight like UFC is freaking awesome
so is Ronda Rousey Ronda is very
arousing if you know what I mean yeah
but she got me in a leglock I'd probably
squeal like a pig in a good way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
