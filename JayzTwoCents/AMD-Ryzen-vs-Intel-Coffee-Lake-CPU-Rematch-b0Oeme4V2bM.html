a crazy week it's been regard any time
there's a new launch where there's
always drama and stuff but the latest
drama has been the multi-core
enhancement that appears to be on by
default on various motherboards I did a
video about that please check that out
before moving forward with this one
because this is a direct this video
exists because I had to do that which
means now I have to do this because the
other thing that was brought up was well
jf the indie 700k was unfairly running
at 4.7 gigahertz which is not the out of
the box experience intended by Intel but
yet one that the motherboard
manufacturers have basically
artificially applied then doesn't that
mean you're Rison versus 8700 K a test
is flawed as well and yes you're
absolutely right do you want to be
cooler do you want to be more desirable
well you're in luck because right now
you can own your very own JS to sense
swag and immediately be the cool kid on
the block max out your sex appeal by
following the link down below so after I
did the MCE video of course I got an
email from Asus that was like whoa whoa
whoa J I just watched this video
something's not right
because in your video and they showed a
little screenshot they're like you show
that sink all Kors is enabled and that's
not on by default and I'm running the
latest retail BIOS by the way guys I
dated the BIOS with the latest retail
when we did the initial test video and
they were perplexed because I went no no
no no optimized defaults goes MCE to
auto and sync all cores by default so
what you see here right now is the way
I'm going to do my test but watch this
if I hit f5 load optimized defaults and
we're gonna go ahead and you just you
can see it just did it right there
but I'm gonna go ahead and restart so
that we can reload the BIOS and I'm
gonna show you that it's on by default
which ASIS was sort of challenging me
and yeah this is the kind of stuff
that's happening here when a company
doesn't even know what the defaults are
internally and some people would is I
don't know so whatever if we go over
here to the Advanced Mode AI Tweaker and
we look right here multi core
enhancement is set to auto
and core ratio sink off-course that's
the default and that's where the fault
was because what ended up happening
right there
is set all the chorus to 4.7 gigahertz
when the 8700 K is supposed to run 4.3
gigahertz under load on the sixth core
CPU that was a 400 megahertz overclock
out of the box which definitely skewed
our numbers versus rise it now the
overclocked numbers are what they are
that was a manual I don't expect that to
change some people questioned about me
using the air cooler there not to a
cooler here on the Rison system and to
that I said temperatures were not a
problem
some people wanted me to verify that we
were indeed running 29 33 megahertz
which I will do but with all the talking
under the way we're gonna go ahead and
redo the test now you understand the
ideology of why I have to redo the test
and we'll see how much different things
actually are alright so I just spent the
better part of the day benchmarking all
over again good results actually and you
know what I know I said I wasn't gonna
benchmark the over clocks again but I
decided to go ahead and just do it again
because I didn't want to leave any room
for undue scrutiny if you will because
this I mean might as well had the due
diligence since I messed up the first
time it's actually a good thing though
that I revisited the over clocks because
I recalled a few of you pointing out in
the original video that when the board
was cycling after I applied the
overclock and I was going another thing
cycling it's being weird when I booted I
made sure that it was actually running
at the three point nine in the last test
but I didn't verify the memory because
once I saw that the three point nine was
applied I just assumed that the BIOS
settings that put in there had applied
and some of you guys were like no no you
need to go back and check it because
reisen's weird with memory and sometimes
it will revert the memory speed but
leave the core speed and I'm used to I'm
used to BIOS where basically if anything
fails and it reverts everything not just
a part of it and that's exactly what
happened so kudos to you that pointed
that out we did do the benchmarks again
with this running at 29 33 and 3.9
gigahertz and the results definitely
improved the whole point of retesting
these CPUs though was to check for
redundancy and accuracy and obviously
things have changed now although the
1700 X at its base settings even 20 133
megahertz
it really stumped the 8700 K and the
reason for that is Cinebench r15 pretty
much scales perfectly with cores and
that's one of the reasons why I like 3d
mark is something that scales perfectly
with SLI practically yeah so on the
surface if Cinebench was the only test
we did it would look like the Rison
system is the clear winner across the
board but that's not really the case
right in handbrake the Intel system was
a few seconds faster again not really
noticeable differences I mean a minute
32 versus a minute 35 blender 526 versus
513 the Rison system actually won in
blender times 5 we got a 7700 even on
the rise end system and a 77 46 on the
Intel system again differences you would
never notice but when it comes to rise
of the Tomb Raider though there was a
significant difference in fps like 30
FPS difference right we got 165 FPS with
the 1080 Ti oh yeah if you guys notice I
had Titan X's on here earlier
I put the tendencies back on because
that was the test we did originally
but anyway regardless we had a hundred
and sixty-five FPS with Tomb Raider and
135 FPS with the rising system and if
you notice the numbers are different
than the first test that's because I
actually added SMA a in this test where
I had FXAA on before because I wanted to
try and put a little bit more load on
the GPU and see if those numbers came
closer together but it really didn't so
yeah although SMA is not nearly as
demanding as like SSA or super sampling
I just wanted to see what would happen
with that one setting the difference
here is how they compare to each other
not how they compared to the previous
test so that's important there and then
premier note no surprise there the Intel
system just dominated the Rison system
and that's simply because core clock is
king when it comes to premiere so we had
7 minutes 47 seconds to render a 4k 2
minute 4k video on the Intel system and
9 minutes and 15 seconds on the Rison
system and once you overclock the
system's everything just kind of scoots
along right on it everything comes down
but the again the intervals kind of
stayed the same the rise in revolt
results came up significantly though
because the Infinity fabric definitely
benefits from memory speed because
that's how it communicates so we saw a
much better improvement on the rise in
system but of course the Intel was still
beating it but you know
I'm not here to tell you which which you
should buy that's not what I'm here to
do I'm here to just give you some of the
information and try and make it as
accurate as possible I failed in that
last video is I know it starting to look
like I do the failed videos on purpose
just so I can come back and do another
video about it I promise that's not the
case I don't want to do the work two
times three times four times I just want
to be honest with you guys and that's
the whole reason why I do it but I will
tell you what I think is a better
bargain I still think the 1700 X is a
better bargain which I said in that
previous video but now seeing how much
the Intel came down actually with the
four point three versus the four point
seven then it's definitely a bargain
with the 1700 X although once you
overclock the 8700 K which you should be
doing because it's a ksq it's the whole
reason why it's there then you
definitely do get your money's worth but
it's a hot CPU so you need to make sure
you have adequate cooling remember the
Rison system achieved all of this
comparative with a water-cooled 8700 k
in an air-cooled 1700 X you can get this
CPU with this cooler for the same price
of only the CPU and we're running a
hundred and what $30 cooler they're $120
cooler whatever it is so they're the
results kind of speak for themselves
there was one other test I was gonna do
though but I decided it's a stupid test
it's a waste of time and I'm not gonna
do it and that is I always get these
comments saying J which you should
really do is is underclock the Intel so
that you can see how it's really
comparing to the Ryan system and it's
like you know what why would I do that
no one is gonna go into their Intel
system and undervolt it or underclock it
no one's gonna do especially 8700 K I
think for science purposes it'd be neat
but then what do I do I do I then go
into the Rison system and disable two
cores I'm maybe I guess I don't know
so yeah I mean it's eight cores versus
six course it is what it is anyway guys
I'm gonna go I apologize for the
inaccurate results in the previous video
moving forward you're not gonna see this
test miss messed up again because right
fool me once shame on you fool me twice
shame on me
only three times I quit alright guys I'm
gonna go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
