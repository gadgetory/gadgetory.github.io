refrigerator started making that noise
right when I started right when we
started of course what's up everyone
Jase two cents here and the christmas
season has just passed and that every
single year that means one thing
some of you either gonna be upgrading or
building your new system you got some
cash and you're thinking about building
or buying your first system or neither
of those apply to you and you just are
here to watch this video laugh at me
whatever whatever the case is those are
all perfectly acceptable so where I
thought today was a perfect time to do
was to talk about whether or not right
now the end of December beginning of
January 2017 2018 is the right time to
build a buyer upgrade your computer
because that's the question everybody
asks all right should I do it now or
should I wait let's talk about that and
we take building computers pretty
seriously here at Jay's two cents but
not nearly as serious as we take
protecting our online experience so
today's sponsor is Nord VPN and right
now they are giving my viewers a seventy
seven percent discount off a three year
plan by going to Nord VPN comm slash
Jays two sentences J a y'see t wo c en
TS a VPN stands for virtual private
network and gives you a military level
grade of encryption between you and more
than a thousand servers in 61 different
countries and that number is growing
weekly now a virtual private network is
more important than ever with the
ever-changing political landscape
constant net neutrality litigation and
the dangers of open networks now
connecting to an open network is
probably one of the most dangerous
things you can do whether it be on your
computer or your mobile device an
ordinarily encrypts that data and
protects you from the internet acting
like a barrier keeping you safe can idea
to an open Internet might seem
incredibly convenient but they are also
incredibly dangerous so that's why using
something like Nord VPN on your mobile
devices as well including iOS Android
all your popular browsers is going to
keep you safe and protected so protect
yourself from prying eyes ISPs and
internet slowdowns by checking out Nord
VPN and getting 77% off a three-year
plan by heading to north VPN comm / Jays
two cents or just click the link down in
the description below
but before we start it's kind of kind of
warm in here I shouldn't dressing for
the camera Nick oh my god what does this
come see it's coming down to this ah one
of two where's the other one
get over here whoa Jesus you just kicked
the camera and you wonder why I'm always
telling you move stuff because you trip
over and we'll fix the camera you guys
been asking for a shirt like this but
you're not gonna get it sorry I'm not
planning on making a J's a dickhole
shirt and I digress maybe yeah stop it
so I understand why people might be
afraid to build or upgrade their PCs
right now you have to kind of go back a
few years to understand
AMD prior to the rise in you know the
Zen architecture launched the last truly
new CPU that came out what was in 2011
which was the bulldozer architecture
which unfortunately was a bit of a
letdown the IPC's were not as good as
they were supposed to be they had 8
cores we'll call them but there were 4
core modules with two Corporal shared a
shared l2 cache so all that stuff was a
bit disappointing but it pretty matte
the Phenom a series of processors which
was very popular very price competitive
and gave buyers a good value the problem
was every single year after that Intel
came out with fairly new architectures
right we had Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge we
had has well we had Devils cannon right
every single year we had something even
though they weren't quite the
improvements we were looking for every
single year the bottom line was every
year something came around at where AMD
was giving us incremental improvements
on the same exact architecture so
basically it was bull drover bull drover
but AMD basically gave a small
improvements on the same architecture
bulldozer piledriver excavator and all
that the problem was it was not keeping
up with pace of Intel regardless of your
position on that the the IPC's and the
benchmark showed it fell behind big time
so AMD became the easy go-to for budget
and value so really what it came down to
was every single year when in Intel
launched their new platforms whether it
was going to be an X platform or a Z
platform mainstream platform it was
pretty simple when it came out you had
about a solid year to know that nothing
was really going to come out so it made
it easy to decide ok June Computex time
something new came out your safe until
at least the next spring or summer but
that all changed in 2017 and with that
the new rise and launch from AMD created
competition in the space which is
something we sorely lacked but we also
sorely underestimated was the confusion
it was going to create inside of our own
minds about the proper time to upgrade
so spring of 2017 saw the launch of
Rison which was huge because we saw the
risin 7 launch first then shortly after
risin 5 and then rise n 3 and I'm moving
into late summer
thread Ripper for new CPU families to
choose from an AMD alone and what we saw
was that they were competing with their
Intel cousins will call them cousins
they're competing with their Intel
cousins at a much better price point so
now became the the turmoil inside should
I buy IntelliJ AMD and that is what we
heard all of 2017 now Intel initially
said they weren't worried about
Rison they're like nope we think people
are gonna adopt a wait-and-see attitude
well guess what people didn't wait and
see people immediately went out and
bought an AMD got back a big chunk of
market share which they were sorely
lacking so Intel responded by launching
the x-series platform in copy text which
wasn't supposed to be launched until the
fall of 2017 and coffee Lake which Z 370
wasn't supposed to be launched until
2018
so both of those platforms got pulled in
to 2017 so that means you had Verizon
three rise in five horizon seven thread
Ripper X 299 and z3 70 platforms all
launched in the same year that's six
I had account to come in but why don't
leave this thumb out whatever that's six
six new CPU families to choose from this
year and rumor has it already we're
talking about a new platform for Intel
in early 2018 so what that is created is
a confusion inside the buyers mind of
being afraid of buying or building
something now because kind of like in
the early days of PC where it was like
you build your PC and two months later
it's obsolete that's kind of what people
are afraid of happening once again now
with all of those new launches though
also means the inclusion of ddr4 Ram and
because of that and the amount of people
upgrading building and buying in 2017
the market share improvement on AMD side
we now have more systems being built and
upgraded than ever before which is put a
strain on the RAM market so your CPU RAM
and all of these CPUs use ddr4 which
unfortunately has made the price of ddr4
more than double in the last 18 months
which is really unfortunate because now
you have competition in the CPU space
and not enough ram to go around
supply and demand took place and now ram
has more than doubled in price which is
really unfortunate so that's a downside
obviously to building right now but that
can't be helped now the GPU side of
things we saw something happened
obviously with the last two years or so
with cryptocurrency
we're cryptocurrency being offloaded
onto GPUs was seeing a huge strain on
GPU supply-and-demand an AMD no one
would have suspected had a really good
hashed performance over Nvidia which
made like the rx series like the rx for
a TRX 584 75 70 absolute monsters in
terms of value when it comes to
cryptocurrency mining so what we saw
there was an inflated GPU market which
again made it very unfortunate where we
had CPUs to choose from that were
competitive and prized I'll say price to
performance was coming down the overall
price of CPU sorta stayed the same what
you got for that money was more
unfortunately you got less GPU for your
money so this is this is the background
you need to know when you try and decide
the future because these create cycles
and cycles either repeat themselves or
break and you can kind of tell what's
gonna happen in the future based on the
past
that's why history is so important but
now it looks like the Bitcoin bubble is
starting to burst again it kind of goes
through these cycles right GPU prices
have normalized and trains grampa and
that was the Bitcoin train you missed it
but no seriously Bitcoin prices were
super inflated and all these other
cryptocurrencies kind of came up and but
now that things have normalized you all
do you really have to be concerned with
is RAM pricing now let's talk about
whether or not you should build or buy
now here is my answer and this is the
way I always treat this and the reason
why this is sitting on the table right
here is yes if you need a computer now
buy it now get the best you can't for
your money now the only time I will
typically tell people to wait is in the
summer because Computex is the world
stage a lot of people are afraid of CES
like new things are coming to CES
sometimes AMD will launch something like
apu related or laptop related unless
you're looking specifically for that
there's not a whole lot to wait for copy
Tex is the world stage when it comes to
computers and new platforms tend to
launch right around then now GPUs will
also tend to launch right around the
April May time frame because especially
within video because that sort of
revolves around GDC and GTC which is
game developer conference and graphics
developer or graphics technology
conference so you've got these two
things that obviously use your graphics
cards which is when new graphics cards
to be launched so that's why I say the
summer time is kind of when I would say
wait but winter and fall are usually
really good seasons to buy because you
can get good deals of end of your
pricing sales obviously around the
holidays Boxing Day you know New Year's
sales all that stuff it's a really good
time to buy now I don't think you have
to be worried about your computer
becoming obsolete that's the thing
people are afraid of is that oh my god
built this thing now and then this
launched and I kind of happened with the
Terry Crews bill but the difference
there is I just wanted him to have the
top of the line so a new Titan card came
out like a week before I delivered the
computer to him which meant a
last-minute upgrade but did that make
the Titan X's he had prior to that
obsolete
absolutely not I mean it kind of stings
a little bit when you might get a little
bit more for your money but given the
fact that we have not seen a huge jump
forward in CPU tech or GPU tech honestly
I mean voltages launched as a whole
nother topic it's safe to say that your
computer that you built at the time that
you built it if it meets your needs and
it's gonna meet your needs for the near
future in the long term future depending
on how high your budget was now things
change with that computer it's still
giving you the same level of performance
that you wanted when you bought it
so because something new that came it
came out and faster and probably more
expensive it doesn't change the fact
that the computer you already built and
bought is meeting the needs now whether
or not you should upgrade comes down to
the one simple question that I always
ask when anyone asks me should I build
or buy a new computer building a new
computer if you don't have one
absolutely yes don't wait do it now
again unless it's summer but upgrading
one question can answer that can your
computer do what you want it to do as
fast as you want it to do it and if the
answer is no then yes it's time to
upgrade any computer can do anything a
potato computer can render a video it
just might take 8 hours to do it if you
don't want to wait 8 hours and you want
to do it in 20 minutes like we do 4k
videos around here render in 20 minutes
because I've got a lot of horsepower in
that computer it makes sense for us but
does it make sense for you only you can
answer that so if your computer is not
giving you the frames per second that
you want or it's not giving you the load
times that you want or the render times
that you want then yes it's time to
upgrade it's that simple of a question
there's no need to overcomplicate it now
usually the only thing that holds
someone back from upgrading or whatever
is going
be budget and that budget usually
dictates the level of performance that
you're going to get very few people
build systems like this these are these
are not needed nobody needs a computer
like this it's fun to build a computer
like this and there are you know a few
people in the world that can afford to
build computers like this but that's a
want and not a need when it comes to
building your computer like I said if it
does what you need it to do
it doesn't matter if something new just
came out I mean it's kind of like it
when a new model car comes out right
after you bought your car it kind of
stings a little bit but the end of the
day your car is still getting you to
point A to point B and it's doing
everything you wanted it to do when you
bought it and that's what matters
enthusiasts care about having the
top-of-the-line enthusiasts care about
being able to have bragging rights but I
don't think enthusiasts make up the core
of this community which is that is the
typical user and buyer who's out there
shopping for things like an i3 or a rise
in three those guys I mean if you fall
in that category you are you are the you
are the boat that is floating this whole
community because those sales that's
what keeps these companies running not
the people that are running out buying
79-80 xes not the people buying titan
Voltas it's the people that are out
there buying the 10 50s and the 10 50 t
is are people buying the low-end Radeon
cards or whatever those are the people
that are keeping this community going so
my answer is the same to anyone that
asks whether or not right now is a good
time to buy unless it's the summer yes
node your computer enjoy it watch videos
about the new high-end stuff but at the
end of the day your computer still is
doing what you needed to do if it's not
then it's time to upgrade if you've got
any suggestions about what can help the
mindset a building or buying a new
computer and put it down in the comments
below because I like to get a viewer
perspective on this stuff and that's why
we did the video where I gave the
computer to the to the guy at micro
Center Sam at micro Center it was still
interesting to go through that and
listen to his perspective when he's
shopping for things which made an awful
lot of sense I was kind of proud because
they're the same kind of things that I
usually tell people but yeah everyone's
perspective is different but at the end
of the day it's your computer and that's
all that should matter and building it
and enjoying it and playing games on it
that's all that matters right all right
guys we're going to go thanks for
watching today's video if you've got any
suggestions on future content that you
want to see or you just want to add to
today's video do it in the comments
below
20-17 has been great 2018 is gonna be
even better
get off obviously with CES and me
finishing up this guy and the post
Malone part two is going to be coming
sometime in January anyway guys thanks
for watching and as always we'll see you
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
