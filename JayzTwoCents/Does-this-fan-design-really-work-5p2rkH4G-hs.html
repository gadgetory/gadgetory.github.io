here and I said in the EVGA closed-loop
cooler video but I wasn't entirely
convinced that their new fan design was
really all that beneficial so rather
than just say I'm not sure that actually
works I decided to do some science and
test that theory for myself now let's go
ahead and preface this with the obvious
this is not the most scientific way to
do this I'm reusing dry ice to give me
some vapor to actually have a visual
representation of what the airflow is
doing I can't see airflow with my eyes
the downside of using dry ice is the
vapor is heavier than air so that's
going to have a little bit of an effect
on how the air flow actually happens but
fortunately the amount of pressure that
these fans and most fans can generate is
going to overcome the weight or the
slightly heavier weight of the dry ice
paper and that shouldn't be too much of
an issue now they do have very
scientific machinery that you can use to
measure air flow and air shape and
airfoil direction and all that crap
unfortunately I don't have access to
that because very very expensive so
we're doing this just a real ghetto
method here in my office but I think the
results should give us at least some
idea of what's really happening here
so with all that out of the way let's go
in just do a little bit of a dramatic
b-roll of some of the testing here and
it will dive into the testing and go
ahead and talk about the results
so a couple things we'll start with here
I do have 35 minutes of test footage on
this yeah don't worry we're not going to
go through all 35 minutes I will not
torture you with that but I did also do
testing here by taping off the sides of
the fan to create a more traditional
style slightly flawed although it did
give me some interesting perspectives
though as I did not tape off the middle
of the fan we'll talk about that a
little bit as to why this was a bit of a
flawed test as well as why this also
gave some pretty interesting insight
also - before people start yelling that
the GPU is going to have some sort of
effect on this test I did actually test
that and as you can see right here the
GPU is running at very low rpm and these
fans over here are still drawing the air
to it so the GPU is having very little
effect on any of this testing now the
first test here I'm just using the dry
ice paper here kind of back and forth on
the fans to see the way it kind of
behaves in front of the fan and off to
the side of the fan now you can see
right here it's obviously being drawn in
you can see a pretty direct u-turn
happening right here as it's pouring out
of the beaker or the container whatever
you want to call it and it's coming
right into the center of the fan and my
concern with this fan design though was
the swoop design right here on the
corners of the fan and what prompted
this whole test was I could feel air
splashing back towards the face of the
fan where it wasn't making its way
through the fan into the radiator the
resistance was actually forcing air to
escape out the sides creating a bit of a
vortex right here as a circular design
or a circular shape so I'm using the
vapor to kind of give me a visual
representation of what I was feeling and
check this out as the vapor comes over
to the side of the fan you can see right
now it's still being drawn in I'm right
over the top of the corner right here
but as I get to the side watch what
happens as I come over to the side check
it out look at how much right now was
just blasted back away from the fan do
you see this you see how there's a
clearly velocity being pushed this way
because I'm off to the side of the fan
now so I'm trying to see what the actual
behavior of the
for his when it's being drawn in from
the side of the fan but you can see
right now quite a bit of air is
physically pushing the vapor away as you
can see right here again it's going to
reverse that you see how much instead of
being drawn in right here in this
section around the corner into the fan
which is what would typically happen you
are getting quite a bit of velocity now
pushing this vapor away from it which is
now giving us what would be perceived as
very turbulent air in front of the fan
now it's obvious air is being pushed
through the rad you can see it right
there I'm not disputing that air is
going through the radiator I just was
questioning whether or not this design
is actually beneficial now as we still
air in from the middle of the fans where
both of these fans are creating quite a
bit of draw you can see it's being
pulled into the center of fan just fine
it's being pulled into the radiator it's
being pushed through but again as we
come out to the side watch what happens
in this area right here boom did you see
that
you see how now there's a there's a
divide there's a split happening right
here I could feel that with my hands and
that's what was concerning me now what
happens when we tape off the sides of
the fans here to see if we can actually
get rid of this turbulence because you
can see right here you can see it with
your eyeballs as a split it's coming
this way
and it's going that way check this out
we look in Reverse and there we go you
can see just as much air is being pushed
away as what's being drawn in which
makes it seem like a very inefficient
design now this is 240fps slowed down to
60fps so this is effectively four times
slower than real-time and you can see
quite a bit of areas obviously being
drawn in but you'll see as we get to the
side though quite a bit of air is going
to be pushed away you see in super
slow-mo here as we get to the side you
can see again right here watch as it
spills out you see how this is already
being pushed away latest coming this way
and that's not this air is not being
drawn towards the cooler at all
let's look at look up here in this area
right here watch how much of this air is
actually pushed away right there as we
are off towards the corners of the
cooler but again you come back towards
the middle it's still being drawn in but
it's being pushed away first so it's a
bit of a spiral effect happening here in
front of the cooler now when I test this
with the tape on the fans kind of making
it a little bit more of a traditional
shape you can see we get a little bit
different behavior here as I pour it in
it's all being drawn into the face of
the fan there's always going to be some
backdraft though I mean that's what
happens when you have resistance which
in this case is represented by the
radiator but you can see that there's a
lot less resistance happening here it's
being drawn in around the corner it's
being drawn into the fan at this point
it's kind of hard to see in the video
I'm quite a bit of weight from the
radiator right here and quite a bit of
ways away from it so I'm trying to see
how much of its actually being drawn in
but you can see there's a lot less
turbulence happening off to the side at
that 45 degree angle it's not pushing
the vapor all the way out here another
angle in real time you can see when we
get off to the side here though how it's
being literally drawn into the radiator
it's being pulled around the tape and in
it's creating quite a bit of a vacuum
which is kind of what is what you want
with a fan you're creating a vacuum to
pull air through or push air or
whichever direction you're actually
orienting your fan
now another angle of the same effect
here you look at how much is actually
being pulled out of the container and
directly into the fan now right here I'm
directly over the corner of the radiator
I check this out now I am closer to the
camera than I am to the actual radiator
but it's being cooled out of the
container right here and into the fan
we're not having any turbulence right
here check this out look at this this is
very streamlined and very efficient
airflow now I did test whether or not
having some sort of resistance above it
would make a difference representing say
the roof of a case or something allowing
this area to not have any influence on
what's happening now it's already
happening down here with the foam that
the radiator is resting on but it didn't
really seem to have any adverse effects
by having it be an open environment
right in front of it after all we are
checking the characteristics of the
airflow it doesn't really seem to have
any effect so I did test that though
quite a bit actually at least 10 minutes
of it but I won't force you to watch all
that now the reason why you're seeing in
this test right here some of the air
being pushed back even though we have
the tape going around the edges of the
fan as I didn't separate the center of
the fans so we have the air being
siphoned in around the side of the
perimeter of the fans as we want but
however the middle of the fans right
here though is still being pushed out so
we do have what is kind of an artificial
barrier between the fans because air is
coming the opposite direction and you
can see that represented right here with
the the container now just one last time
here comparing the super-slow-mo 240fps
you actually get a very good visual
representation of what some of my
concerns were here with this really
smooth shaved down
shroud of the fan check out as the air
right about now there it is you can
actually see it you can see the air
being pushed in hitting this little kind
of a ramp and coming back towards you
immediately check this out loo that you
see it you can visibly see it if we look
at it in real-time look at the air as it
hits the blade and it's just bouncing
right back out comparing with the tape
once again in super slo-mo you don't
actually see that happening you can see
that of course as I mentioned there is
some rebound effect that happens when
you have pressure in front of a fan or
resistance in front of a fan but you can
see it's happening a lot less now I
should have separated these fans with
tape down the middle as well because we
are getting some of this effects still
happening right here which is causing
both of these fans to slam air together
as the air is coming off each of these
fans the blades are turning technically
opposite direction these blades are
coming up while these blades are coming
down which is causing a little bit of
turbulence right in front of it and you
can actually see it right here you can
see how some of the air is kind of
reacting like whoa that's weird so it's
really drawing in more on the sides of
the radiators with this particular test
so it should have been something that I
did it was kind of neat though to see
how the air responds differently though
towards the side of the taped off fans
versus the center of them not being
taped off at all now I did do all of the
testing that you just saw with no fans
on anywhere in this room the vents and
the air conditioning system were turned
off in the house there was no
contamination of airflow by any overhead
vents or fans or anything like that
something else I want to say is that the
temperature differences were negligible
there were no difference what
so ever between tape on and tape off
when I ran be a 264 test and a reason
for that is because we actually have
more heat capability of the system as a
whole with the 280 red then the amount
of heat is being put into the system by
the overclock 59 30 K I said in previous
videos and I've shown this before that
the size of the radiator is more
important the fans that are actually on
the radiator because you can have an
undersized radiator and put the best
fans in the world you're still going to
deal with heat soak so I'm pretty
confident that the 280 on here could
handle all of the heat being put into it
no matter what fan I put on here and the
differences would have been pretty
negligible so perhaps a better follow-up
to this video would be doing the same
exact test with the 120 millimeter CPU
cooler which is on the edge of having
enough heat capacity to cool a 59 30 K
that's overclocked and do everything we
just saw over again and do a follow-up
to this I'd be a good test but the whole
point of this though was to see if
whether or not I was crazy or if there
was indeed air coming back towards the
intake side of the fan more so than I
would normally feel with a standard
traditional fan shroud and I think the
paper showed that I'm not crazy that
that is actually happening I'm not
saying it's a bad fan design I'm sure
EVGA has a reason why they did this I
would really hope that they could come
out with some documentation of why they
did it and what some of their findings
were because I think it would be a good
piece to the puzzle trying to figure out
why they did this fan shape to begin
with there's no literature on it with
the CPU cool or anything so anyway
thanks for watching guys hopefully you
learned something today the very least
you got some cool looking dramatic video
of how air reacts and responds to fans
and pressures and back pressures
radiators and all that stuff if you've
got a cool idea for a science experiment
you want me to do make sure you put it
down in the comments or better yet come
over and tell me at twitter and if you
guys are new around here make sure you
hit the subscribe button for more crappy
videos like the one you just saw right
here and anyway that's it I'm done
talking now I'm going to go see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
