here and you know what sucks about
headphones do you know what I absolutely
hate about headphones
it's the wires the wires I'm always
rolling over it with my chair it's
getting tangled up in my arms right
sometimes get up and go to walk away
from the computer and I forget that
they're wired and I end up yanking them
off my head or sometimes I've actually
broken the cable yeah I'm a bit of a
dork who continues to forget that they
have wires well that's why today we're
going to be taking a look at the
Sennheiser RS 175 these are high five
phones that are well completely wireless
but you didn't see that coming
gigabytes flex display technology
automatically detects and connects up to
four displays for the best gaming
experience in multi display Ultra HD
click the link in the description to
find out more so it should come as no
surprise you guys I'm doing a sennheiser
review because I am a big fan of
Sennheiser a lot of the stuff you guys
have seen on this channel especially
when it comes to audio live paid out of
pocket just to have Sennheiser for
instance my microphone here that I use
that trade shows and also put my
wireless pack on so I have a wireless
mic Sennheiser and my wireless lavalier
I'm talking on right now my DW 100 g2 is
a wireless setup that I'm using with the
camera again I paid for that so when
they asked me if I wanted to take a look
at the new RS 175 HiFi surround
headphones that were debuted at CES I
was like hell yeah I mean the Germans
make amazing stuff I mean everything
that Germans make just seems to be
awesome and I'm half German so I guess
that means I'm at least half awesome now
one of the things that really struck me
when I first took these out of the
package is they're so freakin light and
I think we kind of get caught up in this
weight equals quality type of thing I
mean this is the entire transmitter
right here and I am pretty much positive
that if I open this thing up it's going
to be mostly hollow with a small circuit
board in there because it literally
feels hollow we'll get back to this
thing in a second now the headphones
right here
our adjustable as you would expect
they're very strong clicks so they're
not going to be moving around on you
very soft ear cups and because they're
wireless obviously there's going to be
batteries in there so if you just simply
twist the ear cup they come right off to
show a rechargeable triple-a battery in
there I like the fact that they used a
triple-a style battery instead of
something proprietary which means if
you're out and about
well technically wouldn't be out and
about but if you're listening to a movie
or something and you forgot to charge
the thing then you're not out of luck
you can just grab some triple A's and be
up and running and then charge it later
speaking of charging it's all done right
there in the headband as you can see so
it's just a contact charge so if you
take your base and you just stick it on
there it makes contact and it starts
charging a little light comes on and it
will show red for charging Green for
when it's charged and you're good to go
so whenever you're not using it you
cradle it it's actually charging as far
as buttons go you've got your power
button on the back right here and what's
kind of funny about that is a Jerry
Jerry will tell you last week a Tech
Talk I was trying to talk to him when I
was like I can't hear you I can't hear
you and I for some reason just
completely brain farted and thought that
by taking them off the bass would turn
them on but no it doesn't you have to
turn them on there so I thought that
something was up and I couldn't hear him
but I I was just an idiot and didn't
didn't turn him on don't judge me but
you also have full control over the
sound by the buttons on the right ear
cup you've got volume up and volume down
as well as they surround button and a
bass button now these things put out a
ton of bass like a crap ton of bass I
like bass I really really do I like
rumbly low frequency bass that you can
feel and when comes the home theater
systems and stuff and I have found
myself continuing having to turn the
bass boost or the bass enhancement off
because it was just so much I wasn't
expecting it now these are advertised as
surround headphones however these are
not true surround these are a simulate
surround so I'm not a fan of that
because pushing the different surround
button you basically have off low and
high which is nothing more than a low
and high enhancement of sound to make
you feel like you have a real surround
stage
you really don't I'm not a fan of that
because when I was listening to movies
and I have watched several movies on
these to kind of get my subjective and
objective opinion here all it seemed to
do was take the sound that I was hearing
and make it feel farther and farther
away and then bring it back when it was
off it didn't feel like I had I couldn't
pinpoint where sound was coming from and
that's what surround is all about so I
don't really feel that these give you a
very immersive surround feel because
when you have two drivers that are
centered on your ear it's gonna be very
difficult for those drivers sure right
and left no problem right left center
but front back right rear left rear or
right satellite left satellite front you
know that's going to be very difficult
for it to actually tell or translate the
difference of where those sounds are
coming from and I don't think they do a
very great job of that
sorry ascend Heiser but that's just my
opinion on that if these have been
individuals surround drivers in here
though then I know for a fact that they
would have sacrificed a lot of clarity
as well as a lot of bass now a good
surround sound system usually has a lot
of bass so the the fact that they're
using which I they look like they don't
actually say I've looked at all of the
literature that I could find to find out
what size drivers are in this thing and
it doesn't actually say but they look
like 40 millimeter drivers they could be
50s but they look like 40s because you
can see them when you take the ear cup
cover off but I don't see any separated
tweeters in here or anything like that
so and they do appear to be maybe a silk
dome tweeter or maybe a titanium tweeter
I can't really tell in fact all the
technical information I looked up I
could not find the size of the driver or
the material that's made of so when it
comes to specs of the headphones and the
sound they advertise a response range of
17 to 22 thousand Hertz that's wider
than the typical twenty to twenty
thousand that you find so it's going to
go below technically where the human ear
is audible of bass but you can
definitely feel it and it goes well
above the typical voice range of you
know speaking as well as nice crisp
highs when it comes to the high
frequency range so listening to movies I
listen to things
like dramas which had very little action
very you know low amounts of spikes and
noise I watched some action movies I
watched some comic movies like Avengers
and what I found was I kept wanting to
watch movies these made it amazing and
considering the fact that I have a four
month old child makes it amazing that I
can wear these at night and I'm not
waking anybody up in the house now I do
have these hooked up to my computer
through optical because it has two
different inputs it has a digital
optical in and it also has an analog 3.5
millimeter jack now you don't have to
pick which one you can actually switch
between these you can have two different
devices hooked up to this at the same
time so you could have say your
smartphone your mp3 player going into
the input here for the three-and-a-half
millimeter Jack then transmitting
Wireless to these headphones as you go
around the house now speaking of going
around the house and doing things the
range on these is a hundred meters
that's 328 feet of course that's wide
open unobstructed line-of-sight but
moving around the house in my house
which has tons of dead spots in my Wi-Fi
I was able to hear these clear as a belt
without any static or any distortion
anywhere in my house so they have got
quite a decent pair of headphones here
if you ask me now not only do you have
the buttons on the ear cans for the you
know so control of the bass volume and
surround you also have the basin
surround buttons right here as well now
of course these do carry the amazing
sennheiser name so they're not cheap you
guys are just going to have to go and
down in the description or look up look
these up yourself to find current
pricing I don't like mention pricing
it's always changing in fact I've had
times where the prices change from the
moment I recorded the video and edit it
and put it online it had already changed
and people are calling me out like your
price was wrong so you guys are going to
go look up the price but trust me it's
not cheap but you definitely are getting
an amazing headset it does have a
two-year warranty on it they sound
fantastic very very clear and I think
that that's what I noticed most about
these Sennheiser headphones is when
there's a lot of bass happening or
there's a lot of dialogue while there's
bass or just glass breaking you can hear
every bit of that none of it gets
muffled or garbled by the bass and bass
coming out of the same dry
giving you your mid-range tends to
overpower the mid-range it can give you
a lot of garbled sound if you have low
quality drivers that's not the case with
these every sound was very clearly
recreated through the drivers and it was
just a fantastic listening experience so
these are going to make a fantastic
addition to whatever you hook them up to
I currently have them hooked up to my PC
through the optical but you can hook
these up to your home theater and if you
have optical cables around the house you
can just move the bass and plug it in
and off you go and the cool thing is is
if you have more than one of these one
bass can operate two headphones so you
could have two people at the same time
as a in a home theater listening to this
without disturbing anybody else in the
house or nearby or the dorm or whatever
so I did have some people asked me if I
thought it was worth putting like a mod
mic on this but no I don't because then
you lose the entire wireless aspect of
these by having a corded mod mic these
really are not designed to be a gamers
headset they are designed to be high
quality high-end audio for whatever you
connect them to now gaming on this is
fantastic as well I had a blast playing
battlefield 4 hardline or battlefield
hardline which I guess technically at
battle before hardline let's face it and
GTA 5 and the sound even while gaming is
just phenomenal
so there you go guys hope you guys have
enjoyed today's video if you guys are
audio files please don't like murder me
because I'm not an audiophile and I may
have said some of the terminology or
slang or audio file a hipster hipster
speaking correctly so just deal with it
but sunglasses let me put them on right
now so anyway alright guys as always
