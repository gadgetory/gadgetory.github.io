again I am collaborating with my friends
over at mass drop to bring you my review
of the matrix tube bluetooth wireless
stereo headphones from me electronics
the mass drop is a pretty cool site
where users can recommend products for
discount pricing and master up will
actually approach those companies about
offering group discounts if enough
people are interested and yeah they even
do PC products and I think it's pretty
damn awesome if you ask me so be kind
and check out the link in the
description if you think you'd be
interested in seeing what products are
currently being dropped but I like
current like literally dropped you know
what I mean with its improved radiator
support and legendary noise optimization
the new define r54 fractal design is a
PC builders dream come true click the
link in the description to learn more
well I guess we started by taking the
tour of what comes in the packaging now
inside the box it's pretty simple there
is a hard carrying case that features a
soft kind of a carbon fiber simulated
carbon fiber exterior and as well as the
instructions and an audio cable now you
know what you can do with the
instructions
I can't toss them because cables are in
there now opening up the case it becomes
pretty apparent that the main design
aesthetic of the Matrix twos is their
love for carbon fiber unfortunately this
is just simulated carbon fiber it's not
actually real but it still looks really
nice and it's a very welcome design
change except over the polished plastic
that seems to be all over headphones in
this category the main frame of the
headphones is actually has this nice
rubberized texture to it which should do
a fantastic job at repelling
fingerprints and smudges it also
features swiveling cans which allow for
a nice flat profile for storage or
putting it in your backpack and the
headband is actually a metal frame which
is also wrapped in simulated carbon
fiber and it has a nice amount of
padding on the top and sleek leather on
the inside which keep things nice and
comfortable now it also features
multiple steps of adjustment on either
side should you have a larger
an average noggin and I find that the
halfway point seems to be good for me
but overall you get about an inch of
adjustment on either side now of course
these headphones are wireless and can
connect to your device over Bluetooth
but the cool thing about these
headphones is that you can pair them
with your device either using the
traditional bluetooth pairing method
which involves like a four-digit code or
you can connect them using NFC if your
device supports NFC and NFC stands for
near field communication it's actually
present on most newer Android devices
unfortunately if you have an iPhone 6 or
a new iPad air 2 NFC is only supported
using Apple pay so you have to pair
using the old school bluetooth pairing
method but when it comes to the
Bluetooth they do offer support for apt
X and AAC audio codecs for some pretty
damn good HD quality audio now the
controls are located underneath the
bottom of both sides of the cans you
have a volume up and down switch on the
left side and you have media controls on
the right side play pause rewind answer
call all that stuff now one of the
things that I do like is that it does
have a jack right here which comes in
handy if you don't want to drain the
battery listening to your device it also
has a charging point on the backside of
the right ear can as well and the ear
cups themselves were made of what I
think is real leather I'll be honest I
can't tell if it's real leather or not
it doesn't advertise that they're real
leather on the box but they sure smell
like leather but they call it their
comfort touch ear pads now I would
assume they're real leather and if they
were real leather they would want to
advertise that they're real leather but
they don't so I really don't know what
they're made of either way they're very
comfortable and very convincing to be
leather now the foam inside is extremely
soft and it isn't around the ear style
but I find that they're a little bit
smaller on the around the ear so if you
have big ears they might actually sit on
there and they also sacrifice a little
bit of bass because of the fact that
they are a little bit smaller around the
ear because you don't get a really good
seal and they're gonna have a little bit
of noise bleed when it comes to your
neighbors so you want to keep that in
mind if you can be using these in like
class or something now the drivers in
these things are 40 millimeters in size
and they feature the typical 20 Hertz to
20,000 Hertz response range you would
expect to find they have 32 ohms of
impedance and one
three plus minus 3db of sensitivity now
the specs aren't really that surprising
since these are designed and intended to
be powered from mobile audio devices
like iPhones Androids and mp3 players
now when it comes to the audio they
really do sound pretty damn good
the bass is definitely present and it
seems tight and punchy without being
wooly at all sometimes headphones with a
lot of bass can actually cause the rest
of the sound range to feel muddy and
unrealized on these things are very very
smooth it's always hard to me to
describe how something sounds especially
when you can't hear it yourself but the
best way to describe the highs is very
crisp and very detailed but not edgy
especially when listening to something
like jazz or music with a lot of vocals
it was very very detailed
now the mid sound very natural with
vocals sounding Pleasant easy to listen
to and they feel pretty mellow for most
music genres now I say most music genres
because I felt that these did a
fantastic job at creating good
soundstage for things like jazz pop rap
classical country and even things like
dubstep but when it comes to various
kinds of rock alternative metal Punk
basically anything that has a lot of
sound a lot of crash cymbals hardhats
and drums the sounds seem to have a lot
less sound separation then it became
much harder to determine the different
sounds I was hearing and it seemed to
turn very flat now I know this has a lot
to do with the recording style of these
genres but at least felt it was worth
noting especially when in other
instrumental pieces I could clearly
define all of the different sounds
instruments and vocals that I was
hearing but all in all I feel it for the
price and currently coming in at about a
hundred bucks Before the Mast drop these
are a pretty good addition to any music
lovers headphone arsenal I love how the
cable on the back is actually pointing
backwards instead of down because I
really really hate when I turn my head
and the cable rubs on my shoulder and
some of that sound actually transfers
into the ear can and I can hear that I
find that to be extremely annoying but
even pointing backwards they still don't
interfere with laying my head back
against my chair or my couch and they
really don't get in the way and I also
like how light they are in fact I wore
these for about six hours at work
while testing them out and I never they
never got heavier to me over time and I
also really like how the carbon fiber
looks on them I'm really a sucker for
carbon fiber you guys know in some of my
mods I've used carbon fiber wrap so I
really I really am a sucker for the
looks of these now the downside is the
leather style ear cups can cause some
sweating over time or over long
listening sessions and there really is
no air circulation at all once these
things are on unlike open-back
headphones I'm also disappointed that
the control buttons do not work when
using the audio jack only I also notice
that when the Bluetooth is powered on
and the audio jack is plugged into an
iPhone I get two independent audio level
adjustments one on the phone and one on
the headset both of them changing the
volume of the device but I found that
when the device is not plugged in the
max volume of either used independently
was no louder than when both sliders
were maxed out when it was plugged in so
I don't know what kind of software logic
is being used there but I'm sure it has
something to do with these not being you
know certified for iPod iPhone and iPad
in that stupid logo which would have
inherently caused the price of these to
go up but I digress but guys if you're
looking for an inexpensive bluetooth
wireless headphone that sounds fantastic
doesn't require a second mortgage to get
them then the matrix to air files from
me electronics is definitely worth
taking a look at now it's been a lot of
time trying to pick out any signal
issues while listening over Bluetooth
and I'm pleased to say that they were
very solid and comfortable to listen to
so if you want to get in on the mass
drop just head to the link down in the
description where you can check out the
master op information of course guys
it's entirely free there's no charge for
any of that stuff mass trap is actually
a very worthwhile service when it comes
to tech and PC lovers like us as always
