know what destiny 2 has just launched
and yeah so that's a pretty anticipated
game I think I've never actually played
it I know it was a console like was I
called exclusive that's it right and
exclusive it was only on like ps4 and
Xbox one but destiny 2 is out for PC and
technically at lunch yesterday and I had
a pretty interesting idea something I've
never done before we've done budget
builds right but has anyone ever
actually done a build for a new game and
built it specifically to the minimum
specs to see how well it actually
performs no probably but I'm gonna do
that today anyway fans of the original
half series cases from Coolermaster can
rejoice because the half is back and
better than ever
featuring 200 millimeter RGB front fans
tempered glass side panel and ample
airflow the H 500 P is a worthy
successor to the original high airflow
series learn more about the new cooler
master H 500 P by heading to
Coolermaster comm recommended specs are
quite spread out and the reason for that
I think is I think they're trying to
account for the users on ddr4 and ddr3
which i think is very strange like a
minimum as a minimum right if it can run
on the older platform on ddr3 that
should be the minimum but they're
calling minimum specs on this a 3.5
gigahertz I 330 250 or a 3.5 gigahertz
Pentium G 4562 very different CPUs which
i think is very strange one on ddr3 one
on ddr4 right because the Pentium is new
and the 3250 is an Ivy Bridge era CPU
now after running AMD they recommend an
FX 4350 now it would have loved to have
done that route the FX 4350 but I don't
have one I have a 6100 but that's a 6
core not a 4 core but it's an older
architecture at bulldozer it was
specifically bulldozers when it first
launched versus like the excavator and
piledriver stuff so don't I don't know
if it'd be fair if I did the 6100 to be
honest so I'm trying to go specifically
on what the minimums are here GPU why is
it recommends either a 662 gigabyte or a
1050 2 gigabyte or if you're on AMD a
7850 I don't have a 780 50 I used to but
not anymore
so I'll probably be going with a six
sixty and six gigabytes of system ram
again I don't have two gigabyte sticks
of RAM for ddr4 so I'll be running aids
but I think most people when I did my
video about what's more recommended 8 4
or 16 most of you guys were like 16 bare
minimum so I don't think people are
gonna give me a hard time about the
eight gigs I'm trying hard to build this
specifically to the spec sheet but it's
not easy again they're recommended
they're recommending in three point four
gigahertz I 5 2400 Sandy Bridge era or
3.5 gigahertz I 5 7400 that's such a
wide range I mean that's those two CPUs
perform very differently so I feel like
I feel like their own like Activision
this just seems to be all over the place
on what their minimum and requirements
are I mean there's such a spectrum here
if you're an AMD they recommend an r5
1600 X so I think when we do the second
part of this video where we actually
showed that recommended I think we'll go
with the r5 1600 because that's more
middle ground that's not that huge range
on the GPU side they recommend a 4
gigabyte GTX 970 clearly they typo'd
they met 4.5 kg or 3.5 gigabytes or a 6k
goodbye 1060 now I have 9 7 I think I'm
a 970 still if I do we'll run that if
you're on AMD r9 390 or 8 gigabytes of
RAM so I knew these budget builds would
come in handy right so we've still got
this cyst you guys remember this where
we were kind of doing the budget build
shootout where we had Austin come and
kind of do a blind taste test
right so we're gonna go ahead we're
running the h2 70 or z2 70 here which is
a bit weird for a Pentium but that's
what I'm using because at least we can
overclock it if we want to but if I just
drop in the CPU it makes no difference
really - what motherboard we're running
for the most part so our CPUs in there
we're running our 8 gigabytes of corsair
ddr4 LPF so it's low profile memory and
we need to install the Box cooler a 90
thermal basis it's kind of nice working
with these tiny little CPUs again
because you can literally do the grain
of rice method for the thermal paste
because when you do a thread dripper and
the new Intel's man do you go through a
lot of thermal paces I'm telling you
ok GPU we need a 660 ha I just happen to
have one of those right here this is one
of the first GPU layer
did anything with on this channel okay
so this is ready to go we just need our
download to finish we've been this has
been downloading forever because I'm
pretty sure that like this servers are
being hit hard right now with terms in
terms of downloading actually you know
we can do is we can prep the recommended
system while we're waiting can't we I'm
so glad we kept these systems together
to be honest with you this is our
recommended system this has a 1200 in it
right now that remember I did the AMD
1200 test
I think AMD wins the Box cooler
competition to they're just better
coolers we need to make an anime Neum
cop an ant iminium cooler what do you
think no and the medium the metal and
ammonium is that with the Wolverine you
know adamantium whatever Oh everyone
calls me such a fanboy and is like
where's all your AMD stuff wow you have
all this Intel well I have more rise in
CPUs as I do Intel Rison v 1600 X right
there yeah baby that's what we're gonna
watch it's Hollow
okay 1600 in here for 1600 X actually
which is the one that was worth what we
recommended I'd actually thought about
tearing their systems apart like last
week well last we're gonna need downtime
with a week before that I'm glad we
didn't this is why I don't get rid of
old hardware very often because stuff
like this comes in very handy we can go
back and revisit a topic like this or
visit a new topic like this with old
hardware where the edges clip no more
like I always accidentally bumps like
cancel we start all over that would suck
pick her up affair with all that ketchup
and mustard at a ballgame
yeah a sports ball just to recap here
we've got a pentium g 45 60 run with 8
gigabytes of ram note it said 6 was the
minimum but run an 8 with a gtx 660 you
aggramar running an SSD Markum applying
any overclocking to this the motherboard
although overclockable i don't think
someone running this level of hardware
would be running an h2 70 with
overclocking so there's that maybe I'll
play a little bit I don't know we'll see
vs. the recommended here
which is an AMD risin 5 1600 X 8
gigabytes of ballistics RAM running a
GTX 970 again they called it before gig
we know it's a three and a half gig 500
watt power supply and the very same SSD
both running box coolers so I think this
is a pretty close representation of to
what the average gamer might be running
so as a take this thing a second to turn
on because it now has to reinitialize
for that hard drive but you guys are
seeing first hand though I get this
question all the time like Jake can you
take a hard drive with one Windows 10
installation and looks like move it to
another computer with all different
hardware and you'll see people will be
like no it's locked to the motherboard
it won't work that's true for OEMs and
things like HP and dowels and stuff like
that but see when you plug in a hard
drive into a new system windows
automatically detects all the new
drivers and chipsets and stuff that it's
it's sensing and then it's reinstalling
all of the base drivers it needs to move
forward all you've got to do at this
point is basically just install all the
new drivers for your motherboard like
your chipset drivers and land and all
that stuff just for good measure
although it will work and you're up and
running
alright so video vsync is on let's turn
that off cuz I'm 8 144 Hertz panel so
I'm gonna turn that off though field of
view screen bound adjust brightness and
bring that down just a tad make it
easier for you guys to see graphics
quality overalls on custom and put
anti-aliasing FXAA it's an HD IO 2 X
section quality low medium low and then
the rest is pretty much medium motion
blur off wind impulse what is that do
you know that is no render resolution
and film grain is on I'm gonna turn film
grain off there
so you can see up in the left-hand
corner right now this is the recommended
settings now that was the settings that
loaded with the only changes I'm able to
turn off motion blur and it turned off
film grain you can see we're getting
about 48 54 51 it's not terrible though
I mean it's it's fairly consistent then
remember we are playing with the minimum
specs here oh is that bad
I killed the thingy boom I'm fairly
impressed with the FPS so far though OC
is melee oh that was an accident do that
it said push seat for melee member
turned the corner I did it and then it
hit that guy
they probably set that up like that on
purpose but still going for single shot
accuracy here for minimum specs here and
given the hardware were running on I'm
impressed
so far I'm gonna be honest I am quite
impressed I I don't know how demanding
this game as versus others but you know
what though if this is a game that's fun
to play right it's got multiplayer
doesn't it yeah I have to assume that
this is a good thing if they optimized
the game well enough to where more
people can play it that's a good thing I
guys a shield nothing's more depressing
than you know having to run out that was
a good throw having to run out and throw
our money at a system just to play a
game so you buy a $50 game or $60 game
then you spend $500 to upgrade something
in your system that's not you know
that's not good or conducive to anyone's
budget alright so that was the minimum
requirements now what about when we step
it up to the recommended
I like ramp that big time this is
noticeably noisier though than the other
system to be honest ok so we have the
exact same settings here and we'll see
how far we can push it with the
recommended but as you can see the exact
same settings as before but if we return
to the game look at our FPS more than
double right 128 FPS Wow look how smooth
this is this is cool I mean I love games
where more people can enjoy them and be
a little bit less worried about their
hardware because I mean 160 FPS are
there you can see how smooth this is
can't you like I know the camera can't
because we're recording at 30fps
but like with your eye what do you see
Nick
ridiculously smooth like butter
I bumped that button which made it look
like a totally pro throw didn't it yeah
that was a I bumped it I went to
straight and I bumped to Q and it threw
the grenade at me
it's that very same battle we did before
we were hitting like 50 60 114
so those critical hit points then right
you can hit their head yeah
they're easier if you hit their body so
I'm in fire
it's like Warcraft always getting them
things yeah later loads fps yeah that's
good alright so I guess the question now
asks how far can we push it right I
wouldn't have pushed the other config
because we were already were below the
magic 60fps which gamers like to stick
at right so we wouldn't push that any
farther but what if we take our texture
now what if we did this what if we
brought environment all this stuff up to
like high can we do that
there we go oh wait get sweet with
everything set to highest we came down
to the 90s Oh No
75 89 but you know what though visually
I'm not seeing that much of a difference
are you I don't think this was go that
way yeah this is such a pretty game
rained of Lorraine yeah
oh that's they're shooting at us
so rude
or rather landing
their jump troopers so anyway there you
go guys
destiny - yeah minimum and recommended
settings as you can see you don't need a
high end PC to run some of the more
modern games as long as the developers
do a good job at actually you know
optimizing for it I mean obviously this
came out on console first and to me it
seems like if this is a port it's a
pretty good job I mean the FPS looks
good it doesn't feel like a console port
it feels to me it kind of feels like
doom or something like that that was
made for PC and yeah I'm excited to play
this game I think don't tell Brian
though he's been trying to get me to
play it I don't I didn't want to get
into it but I might have to actually
play through the story now so anyway
guys there you go minimum versus
recommended if there any other games you
think we should do this with if so put
titles of those games down in the
description below and I think Nick and I
agree that when new games launch like
this now we're gonna start doing this
we're gonna start doing min and
recommended instead of just benchmarking
the highest end GPUs which you know is
gonna chug through any game with no
problem
we'll start letting everyone know
exactly where you need to be to start
playing your favorite triple-a titles
thanks for watching guys and as always
I'll see you in the next one
all right back to this game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
