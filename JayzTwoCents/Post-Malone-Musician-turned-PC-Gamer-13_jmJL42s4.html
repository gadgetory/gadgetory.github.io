I've got a special guest I don't know if
he meet an introduction this is the one
and only post Malone he tweeted me and
he was like hey I'm into computers and
shit like what you do and I was like do
you want a computer and he was like hell
yes that is what we're gonna talk about
today but if you guys don't know what he
does obviously he's a musician he is an
artist it's funny it's like you're very
eclectic
right so some call you a rapper some
call you hip-hop R&amp;amp;B but it's like what
do you classify yourself I don't know
I'm kind of pushing for no genre I'm
kind of like trying to get rid of the
genre right it's just old well if you
fall into a genre that you fall into
like an expectation right exactly
exactly this is not this this is not
what he done before right just wanna but
you're kind of known for taking a very
rock kind of a feel using it yeah very
modern hip bro and I think you know
that's important because there's a lot
of like hackneyed stuff out there yes
cookie cutter and remade and made again
but I just want to make something
different that I like and I think people
were like well no I think it I think it
fits a lot of into a lot of pieces
because it I'm personally not into like
a lot of new rap right I like old-school
right and so that's that genre is kind
of gone away right you know and you've
got to really go back to find it hip hop
it's constantly changing every every few
years it feels like this is hold right
that hip hop isn't the same anymore
right but it's kind of neat to see a
couple John Rose mesh together yeah
because it gives a whole new feel and
vibe to it okay sorry I'm gonna ask what
what made you like want to get into
computers and stuff um I usually I've
been a console God for so long all my
friends were playing pub G so I kind of
wanted to cross
was pubsey literally like we yeah yeah
it's very recent yeah it's very recent
it's I probably started the computer
four months ago like gotten actually
getting on to it and I got steam and all
the games you know playing Skyrim on
there and fallout and puppy on there and
just kind of getting used to using the
mouse yeah because it's so how was that
transition it's it's a big transition
because I cannot play with a controller
and all right I can't and that's what's
been hard for console for me right that
thumbsticks it's either it's either one
of the other and I think that you know
switching over being ambidextrous with
like both right you know is it tough yes
I suck so the perfect PC design right
not so much the part to go in it but
like if the looks and feel what would it
be oh I don't know something crazy
because that's a hard question right
yeah no that's a very that's a very
tough question there's so much you can
do not not like a let's do like a oblong
shape yeah yeah like an interesting
shape um well okay so let me let me
throw this Heather Twitter obviously
picked this up right the the the tweet I
did that we were gonna do a collab is
the most likes tweet I've ever done it
yeah sorry Terry but it's a pastor but I
Louie Vuitton key him up a lot but
that's because your guitar I think of
the Louie guitar yeah do you feel that
there should be like a Louie theme in
there and oh no man I kind of wanted to
make it based off of this next record
beer bongs in bentleys that's coming out
okay I want to do a lot of barbed wire
on there cuz I'm barbed wire fanatic
okay um the whole like vibe of the album
is yellow I don't like a super like kind
of like cool yellow and moment one of my
favorite pcs that I ever dealt well you
know skunkworks is my main pc that's
kind of evolved over the years but my
favorite theme on that I did
governmental in yellow yeah right I mean
either yellow or you know we could do
super simple like black or white oh we
gotta go we gotta go
I figure like yeah
yeah make it in your face right so beer
bongs and Bentley so obviously net
that's that itself is just like both
ends in this bag right right right that
leaves those two things right don't you
drink Bud Light out of a wine glass I
love but like anything of yours you're
drinking to have like a which I thought
was just like there are no mugs given
and that's the best part of it is oh man
okay so what I'm gonna do right now
which I normally do like I do with Terry
Crews too and it doesn't mean we're
going to do it I'm just curious like a
lot of your fans out there - what they
think should be kind of implemented in
this right it's gonna be hard because
the album is obviously not out yet right
so just the theme beer bongs and
Bentley's kind of gives us a way to go
should be out in December
okay I don't know what exact date but
right I'm finishing it up but before the
end of the year right exactly that works
out well so you guys obviously know
that's coming out it's hard because the
theme usually has a very linear right
right I do but they the amount of that
collecting in this well yeah I should go
anyway then we can make this super
badass I kind of want to be in
peripherals and included nice right like
the mouse and keyboard that sort of yeah
that would be so sick often you have
like your tower with a have very basic
keyboard mouse in it I play I play on a
Corsair and a razor mouse okay but I'm I
like for keyboards I like the super
kinetic like like the mechanical clicky
is super clicker yeah a lot of the click
the better so yeah blue switches those
are those are those that do the clicky
switch it's so fun yeah so do you do in
your life streaming or you kind of doing
streaming with this I'm thinking of
doing twitch okay very soon I just gotta
get my whole setup you know like right
now I play on a big projector screen
okay which is not necessarily good for
gaming right yeah it's a little bit for
movies and stuff like that but yeah I
just got to get like a nice place with a
green screen and a
the monitor and everything else a nice
thing about green screens now too is
they have these pop-out screens kind of
like this but smaller right that
actually they have some chair mount
student not to your chair so it's small
really and then you just when you when
you're doing you know you're cutting out
the back so you just cut it into the
yeah you just bring your webcam on you
and you crop it that's you don't need to
have like a whole huge set if you don't
want to dedicate that color space to it
so you don't have a dedicated like PC
space right now no it's in my living
room
okay and I switch off so I have one
tower for games and I have one color for
making beads so that's gonna have to
change that yeah if I got to change
because if you if you want to do like a
whole theme set up yet it definitely
deserves like its own its own home yeah
oh yeah if you can get used to a smaller
screen it is because the projector at
that right I can even see the projector
was more of a kind of like a baller
thing it's a big 120 inch thing you're
right and it's there but yeah I
definitely want to get like a designated
space I have a space already I just had
to set it up there you go easy ass well
yeah I wouldn't say you're the only one
it's like my stuff is usually on the
back burner because I'm having
everything else right okay let's talk
about moving forward then see your I
wanna talk about you for a little bit
especially for those that are watching
us that may not know who you are the
last several years have been very right
exponential right for you like house Oz
it hasn't been going from literally you
know you moved out here we're like
nothing right to where you are today
right yeah I moved from Dallas when I
was like 18
I'm 22 now so I've been here for about
four years you know I moved out here I
didn't have shit I didn't have like I
had to scrounge to a glove compartment
to find changed buy smokes right right
you know slept in my friend's closet and
then I put out a song and it all just
changed overnight and that was white
Iverson yeah yeah so what made you go
okay I've I've got nothing I'm gonna
make this song and knowing that that was
gonna launch oh I didn't know I was just
trying to you know live you know is
right hopefully I think it starts um but
I have to assume that you've done enough
of your own stuff in the past with your
friends our families yeah you're good
you should do this right you are like
one day you're like I'm gonna make
I make a sing a song right ya know cuz
I'm uh I used to be in a bunch of bands
and everything like I've done every like
alternative music super heavy music and
but at the same time I was making
hip-hop and that's what I've you know
love to make and really wanted to make
right and so I moved out to LA with uh
just a mix tape and then mm-hmm
everything just happened perfectly right
there's there's such a luck factor
involved oh yeah oh yeah they're mean
same thing with like becoming famous I'm
going to write this it's like you can
work your ass off but there's there's an
in factory librarian if those don't line
up no yeah I though I don't know what
the hell happened it's of great well it
seems like you're enjoying it I'm having
a great ass time I mean it's like how
could you not right yeah I mean you know
I couldn't get much better than doing
what you love so you know kickstands do
you have do you have like anything that
you're looking forward to like I want to
do this
like I haven't been able to get there
yet but this is I don't know I kind of
just want to make the best music that I
can and just you know hopefully people
keep liking what I'm putting out I just
want to I want to make it last as long
as I can yeah I mean I just don't want
it's a good look yeah they're just like
what I'm doing now isn't good enough I
want to be here right I mean there's
always an element of Airy but if you're
always chasing this one thing then it
kind of dilutes what you want right
exactly you got it it's you know it's
all about the ride yeah I'm I'm still
figuring out shit every day
right you know I'm 22 so I just want to
keep growing as a person as a musician
and do you see yourself that standing
out and Records it to some other genres
yeah I'm I'm starting a band okay just
for fun
forget it san diego's play at the Roxy
with all my breath and just that's
awesome but you know nothing I don't
want I don't know I don't want to put it
out like say hey this is my new band I
just want to be a bad no that's that's
cool though because I mean it keeps it a
hobby
right exactly and you know it's not too
serious you can just fuck around
I mean that's what I like about this
project is is you're just like I wanna
have fun right whatever it is this got
to be fun I better be enjoying it
because you're like if it's not fun
what's the point exactly exactly
well it sounds like you're having fun no
thanks for coming out today you're
talking with makes me happy so just like
we did with the Terry Crews bill I'm
gonna do some concepts and stuff we're
gonna probably some artwork involved on
this let's go yeah I think this is gonna
be one for the record books we kind of
like the three Barkerville back that we
were taking a look at what really what
really made that stand out with a lot of
people and he was really admiring that
earlier we were looking at that he
badass dude it's the fact that it go it
went against all the grain right there's
there's this kind of stigma in PC
modding not so much money I'm a PC
building and water-cooled stuff that
like angles had to be perfect right and
with that one I basically was like no
everything in the inside needs to just
be wrong right which I've got wire loom
on there people hate the loom people
love the loom but the point is people
we're talking about it because it just
rubbed you either the right way or the
wrong way up against it and I think
that's what can be fun about this bill
because there's not gonna be a right or
wrong right with this thing you know and
I think that's gonna be that's gonna be
a lot of fun yeah so we're gonna do some
design concepts and stuff and then we'll
we'll log some of it as we're building
do you want this to be a surprise or do
you kind of want to be involved in it oh
I want to be involved but not too much
okay because when a big reveal but I
want it yeah okay cool so then maybe at
the halfway point we'll bring in again
and we'll kind of go over some concepts
let's do it
because with Terry it was fun he wanted
to be surprised right right all
surprised but I think getting you
involved on this would be good since
you're so new to this yeah let's do it
I'm down for whatever all right guys

up where should they go just Twitter
Instagram it's all post Malone no space
