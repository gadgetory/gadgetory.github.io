here with my daughter little Jay so we
haven't done an unboxing video in a
while and today we are gonna be unboxing
something new this is a brand new
service as if there weren't already
enough of these subscription services
out there but this one is called hero
crate now they have a rumored villain
crate coming out they've been teasing me
about it for months haven't seen it yet
so today we are taking a look at
September's and October's hero crate
other than looking at the shipping label
have no idea which ones which but anyway
we're going to go ahead and get started
here if you want your very own hero
create make sure you look in the
description there is a link as well as
like a coupon that you guys can use to
get some money off as well as we get a
little kick back on these subscriptions
here and a lot of it ends up going to
this little girl over here after all
she's the only reason you guys watch
these videos not me the mastercase 5 and
mastercase 5 pro from colormaster
combines modularity with creativity
giving you the freedom to build it your
way make it yours by clicking the link
down in the description since we have
two here we have no idea which one is
which we're gonna play a little game to
see who gets to pick which one they're
gonna get okay we're ready rock paper
scissors do you know how you ready wait
I thought you said you knew how yeah you
say the rock paper scissors and then so
you go one two and then on the third one
you do what you're gonna do okay great
rock beats it all right which one you
want that one alright so let me cut them
let me cut the tape and then you can
open it up now pretty much these are
supposed to be hero themed I guess you
guys can guess that by the name right
hero crate she is a villain that's why
we get the villain crate I think it
would be a lot of fun so we got yeah she
loves the pop caps you have a bunch of
pop caps you have sharknado PopCap you
have the swamp swamp thing yeah
swap guy everything what well it was
Swamp Thing I think was his back yeah I
have a pirate and then I have the the
guy with this gig I can't remember
oh it was a Deadpool but before he was
like Deadpool he was a the gray costume
in the messed up skin yeah Batman yeah
did you have more yeah it's more and
anyway we got a we'll sit here all day
we turn so it's a spider-man 1 what else
is in there obviously this is the
spider-man theme box everything in here
is spider-man and this has all the
Marvel characters on it you know that's
that's in this series man
Ironman I can't I don't Overeem
Wolverine Captain America that's Red
Skull that's Captain America's nemesis
Red Skull The Hulk and the thing is that
Spiderman whole set that's like a big
teacup sort of thing washable and
microwavable it's real glass you've
every careful with that it also has like
a timer on it that's really weird yeah
spider-man pin do you know who that is
yeah
this is venom venom was one of
spider-man's enemies what else we got in
there oh yeah this is just like a little
comic card right and each one of these
do contain a t-shirt I believe that's
one of the things that make mr. tall x
shirts these aren't like the cheap ones
either these are nice shirts the nice
thing about these boxes now is a lot of
them are including t-shirts with them
which is really nice so at the very
least you get a shirt every single month
and if you're a t-shirt wearing guy like
I am then you would like that all right
so that's yours it's going to make room
for mine put your stuff back in the box
now mine shouldn't be spider-man theme
because it's a different month somebody
is let's see if you know what it is okay
oh we got the Wolverine one so I'm
assuming it's gonna basically be the
same thing here little more but
Wolverine theme so here's Wolverine
eating a steak that's convenient he has
his own knives and two medium and
iminium knives but hey so here's our
Wolverine PopCap and I'll let you have
the podcast for your collection okay so
Wolverine PopCap's kind of neat I do
like that so far there's two pop caps in
two boxes these these um the other boxes
were like these are like the Holy Grail
like you got a pop cap you're like yeah
but if you didn't get a pop cap in the
other boxes you're like Wolverine
keychain Jenny
he looks so mean and then of course we
have a Wolverine magnet hey we could put
this on the fridge cuz you're running
out of magnets for your artwork yeah see
and it says anta meant 'i'm that's the
kind of metal that he's made out of
that's the yeah well he was sort of a
experiment yeah and then we've got here
our shirt and this one is a little
Wolverine kind of a mash up shirt here
and it's not in English I have no idea
what it says you guys tell me what this
says if you guys you guys speak
whichever language that is and if you
guys can even see that you tell me what
does it say I have no idea
let me see you're sure I don't think I
showed it to the audience there it's
Thomas Perry me
I know but I don't think I showed it too
oh yeah it's spider-man and Wolverine
alright not Wolverine sorry spider-man
and venom that's kind of neat so it's
sort of like that you know the human
body art thingie humor that's call was
that called the circle and the dude
anyway spider-man and venom
well it just means that you're not gonna
stick it in your mouth and try and
swallow it alright so what do you think
if they all come with pop caps and a
t-shirt that's kind of cool yeah all
right so we're gonna go ahead and give
Little J the pop caps here because she
likes to collect these things other
bobblehead ones lucky dances watch you
can dance if you go right careful um
break so how can you take these
superhero serious when they're just
bobble in their head yeah all right well
anyway he puts his thumb in then it's
devil horns and he's like this okay so
sorry cap here what did you get your
bottle cap the one that you already
broke his necklace she's like took him
twisted him and now his head always
looks to the right so no enemies should
attack him from the left I can't
remember his so hard to say venom venom
so we got that it's like a little poster
card thing I'm gonna open this up real
quick so this is a mug it's microwave
safe dishwasher safe an adjustable date
dial why do we need a date dial on a mug
and somebody in the comments tell me why
we have a date dial on a mug t-shirt
were there anything else
when Spiderman pin and the venom button
that's a lot of stuff in one kit yeah
okay and then my Wolverine kit we had
the Wolverine eating a steak with his
knives which come out of his hands he
everything will ring before yeah so he
can like make a fist and then the knives
will come right out of his skin because
his skeleton will won't make them so we
got this magnet here which is the
periodic table for ant iminium which is
apparently a D we got the Wolverine Bob
bobblehead PopCap a Wolverine like soft
tote and then we got the Wolverine shirt
here just kind of neat these are nice
shirts uh but they're not that cheap
like $5.00 Walmart brand these are
actually till exit airway tags uh it
says they're preshrunk now it's always
been my complaint about some of those
shirts that come in these kits is they
tend to shrink it says preshrunk I will
let you guys know if they shrink further
or not but anyway that's it what's your
what's your favorite out of all of them
the wolverine kit - the mug you can you
could use that as a cereal bowl that's
how big that thing is are you gonna pee
beg for mercy beg for mercy you are
paying aren't you all right guys that's
all for today so if you want to get your
very own hero crate they can look we're
below all right and make sure you guys
if you're is a coupon code or whatever
down there so use that you guys can save
a little bit of money and that's it for
today so tell me what you guys think
about this I know there's a lot of these
subscription services this one's pretty
cool I like that it's just one hero with
one theme all the way through rather
than getting you know whatever a couple
of dollar components the other companies
are just throwing in a block and or a
box and you just you may like it you may
not you know this one here it's like
Wolverine for the whole box or
spider-man for the whole box and who
knows what else I'll assume bill and
crates gonna be the same way Dilek rates
gonna be like all just bad guy stuff in
there what I thought would be fun is if
they sent me a villain crate and a hero
crate each month then we would be a
have like a little game to see which
one's the villain and which one's the
hero that day we have to take a little
test to see who's a villain figure the
villain every single time
all right time you got to here guys
thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe and favorite and like and all
that sort of stuff you guys know you do
because she's on here she she classes
the joint up a little bit more than I do
alright guys time to get out of here
anything once a you just copy me now
alright guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
