and recently we did a video together
talking about Cherry MX switches and the
different colors and what they mean what
they sound like and what they feel like
which is armed you to understand we're
going to talk about today which is all
about the CM storm quickfire Ultimates
mechanical keyboard this thing's pretty
cool so let's go ahead and open it up
and take a look now today we are taking
a look at the CM storm quickfire
ultimate fully backlit mechanical
keyboard if you're not familiar with CM
storm it's cooler masters gaming line of
products for PC gamers some pretty cool
stuff now this is a fully mechanical
keyboard which means every switch on
here from the Escape key all the way
down to the N key is mechanical now this
particular model is the Cherry MX brown
with clear backlight now this keyboard
is available in a variety of different
switch colors and the switch color is
going to pretty much determine what the
backlight color is so the Cherry MX
screen will have a green backlight blue
with blue red with red and then the
brown has the white LED as will the
clear so if you haven't checked out my
mechanical gaming keyboard video about
all the different switches then you're
going to want to go and check that out
so you know exactly what the difference
which is me now in the front of the box
here you have a nice little graphic of
what the keyboard looks like this is a
full keyboard with 10 key however it
does not have any macros now on the back
of the box here we have some information
about the keyboard that is fully backlit
that we do have 6 key and key rollover
and we do have function keys built into
the F keys for multimedia like play stop
rewind fast-forward volume up and volume
down now there are three backlight modes
when it comes to the lighting on this
keyboard you have got a fully backlit
where every key lights up it has a gamer
mode where the WASD lights up and then
it has a breathing mode where all LEDs
light up but slowly fade in and fade out
I do wish it had a programmable
programmable mode where you could choose
which keys you want
it but unfortunately this keyboard does
not have that functionality when it
comes to backlighting you do have five
levels of brightness so you can
fine-tune it how bright you want it and
of course it has no backlight mode where
you can turn off the back light
altogether now the keyboard does feature
a built-in embedded steel plate to give
the keyboard both rigidity and weight
which gives it a really nice solid feel
I mean there's absolutely no flex
whatsoever in the keyboard in fact I
have already got the keyboard out and I
can demonstrate that for you right now
if I take a keyboard and I really try
and with this I really can't it's very
very sturdy and as you can tell there is
no creaking sound which you're hearing
is my hands slipping on it so it's very
very solid all right now before we talk
to you more about the physical
properties of the keyboard that's going
to take a look at what comes inside the
package inside the box you're greeted
here with a nice plastic cover on top of
the keyboard
keeping the keys nice and safe and the
keyboard is sitting in this protective
sleeve you have your key puller for
pulling off the keys on the keyboard you
have a nice gold plated USB cable here
that is braided so it gives you nice
clean look for your cable and you have
your manuals that come with this it
talks about the right way of installing
the USB cable hopefully by now everyone
knows how to do that and then you have
your product manual that talks all about
the different functions inside of your
keyboard do's and don'ts and it comes in
quite a few different languages so you
should be covered okay so when it comes
to the physical properties of this
keyboard you may notice that it is quite
a bit thicker with a higher profile than
many other keyboards on the market there
are some other keyboards out there that
have a much lower profile there is no
rest wrist included with this in fact
there's not even the spots to add one if
you wanted that disappoints me a little
bit because I do like a wrist rest with
my keyboard
but the moment I hooked this up I had
absolutely no problems immediately
typing with it and I wasn't missing any
keys actually found it quite a pleasure
to type on with these Brown switches
when it comes to the front here also you
have this nice
design that's kind of built in the
plastic there so that's pretty nice on
the side here you can see where you have
the channel for the USB cord to come out
same thing with the other side as well
as the back here you have a USB slot on
the back as our channel for the cable as
well as this nice design built in as
well just giving it some nice aesthetics
to it now on the bottom here you can see
where you have the multiple channels
here to run your cable so you have lots
of options here where the cable comes
out you're not stuck to just the back
and I do really like that the cable is
detachable now taking a look at the
cable up close you can see that it is
gold-plated and it does have a very nice
high quality braid on there that's going
to keep the cable nice and secure and
protected and just look really cool on
your desk at the same time continuing on
with the bottom of the keyboard you can
see right here that you have four very
thick very sticky or nice and you know
friction me feets on here made of rubber
that are not going to let your keyboard
slide all over the place that's a really
cool feature but what Coolermaster did
to make it even more secure is if you
like to flip the feet up like some
people do and have a more you know
upright position of your keyboard the
ends of these feet are also rubberized
as well so that you're not going to be
dealing with plastic and rubber causing
it to slide around more so it's still
going to be nice and secure one thing I
wish that Coolermaster would have
included would have been some sort of
built-in USBs some people use wireless
mice and they may like to stick the
little transmitter in the back of the
keyboard at least that's what I would do
to keep it nice and close to the mouse
for a good perception but you know again
at the price point that this keyboard is
currently at the it's something I can
certainly live without it would be nice
to see that included though in a model
here in the future
now the key puller is really easy to use
use literally push it down over the key
and pull it up it's just that simple it
pops the key right off as you can see
and you can even see that it's a brown
switch in there and what makes this
feature really nice is it makes the
keyboard just that much easy easy
year for cleaning now the keys on this
are very nice they all felt nice and
uniform no switches felt like they were
sticking or anything and I did find it
very easy to type on it was
aesthetically pleasing the position of
the keyboard was good and had no
problems going right into various games
and typing on inward or the Internet and
I wasn't missing keys it was it was
actually very pleasant to type on as I
mentioned before this is a 10 key so you
have all of your extended 10 key
functions here and know your keypad but
there are no macro keys so keep that in
mind now when you look at the
backlighting on this thing it's very
uniform it's very even each key has its
own individual LED so it's very pleasing
on the eye and it looks really really
cool I like the different backlighting
functions that are on this keyboard but
as I mentioned before I do wish you had
a programmable mode so that you could
set which ones you wanted to backlight
and which ones you want it to be dim or
turned off you know based on your style
or whatever fits your needs but again
it's one of those things that even
though it was available on my previous
keyboard I never used it anyway I always
left all the back lights on so that it
was nice and blingy on my desk but I
really do like the backlighting on this
it looks really amazing it's it's fun to
type on I actually look forward to
typing on this keyboard but I think
that's because it's just aesthetically
it works for me I have long fingers so I
don't mind that it's a little bit taller
but when it comes to the looks of this
keyboard it definitely is going to turn
some heads if you take this to a land
party or something people are definitely
going to ask you hey what keyboard is
that and once you start typing on it
they're going to be really excited and
want one for themselves I know I have
had multiple keyboards quite a few of
them and I was really excited to plug
this one in and I've used all the other
brands I've used SteelSeries I've used
razor I've used Corsair and I really
love this keyboard in fact this is now
my main keyboard there you have it guys
the CM storm quickfire ultimate fully
backlit mechanical keyboard from
Coolermaster make sure you guys check it
out this holiday season it is definitely
worth a spa on your desk and as always
if you've enjoyed this video you know
