that time of year again because NVIDIA
has just launched their brand-new sweet
spot GPU the GTX 960 and being the GPU
whore that I am you had to know this
video is coming with its improved
radiator support and legendary noise
optimization the new define r54 fractal
design is a PC builders dream come true
click the link in the description to
learn more now I'm going to go ahead and
start this video out with an apology
that's because there's about to be a few
gtx970 reviews on this channel over the
next week or two now this is the first
time in the history of my channel that
we are going to be taking a look at more
than one of the new cards at the time of
launch covering several brand new
offerings from what is sure to be a very
popular card but now that we've got that
out of the way let's go ahead and get
started now first up in this gauntlet of
GP reviews is gigabytes g1 gaming the
960 g1 gaming actually my bad that's the
970 this is the g1 gaming 960 yeah as
you may have noticed by now they have
the exact same cooler as their bigger
brothers the 970 and the 980 now
gigabyte has been taking a lot of time
and giving special attention in detail
to their mid-range cards the same
attention to detail as they give their
flagship cards like the 979 80 but at a
much lower price point now features the
same triple fan cooler with the metal
shroud glowing LED fans with its four
six millimeter copper heat pipes able to
dissipate up to 300 watts of a heat now
they also mention that it has a
backplate and still one of the sexiest
back plates on the market I might add
and one of the major benefits of Maxwell
base GPUs is their incredible power to
performance ratio making the core
arguably the most power efficient and
cool GPU chip coolest GPU chips that
ended it has ever produced because of
this advancement in technology companies
have been really promoting fanless
performance in many lower demanding
games allowing for completely silent
operation and the 960 is absolutely no
exception now on the g1 game
cooller the fans will not even start to
spend until the GPU reaches 62 degrees
Celsius or the GPU reaches 60 watts of
draw okay enough about the cooler we
know about the cooler the coolers not
new just tell us about the specs of the
960 I hear you all right well the gtx
960 g1 gaming has 1,024 cuda cores
running at 1,300 4 megahertz which is a
bump over the reference clock of 1178
128-bit memory bus with 7000 10
megahertz gddr5 effective memory speed
and a 6 phase power delivery system with
dual 6 pin PCI e connectors which is
again a bump over the reference
three-phase power design and single 6
pin power requirement I can already hear
some grumbling 128-bit memory bus whoa
and trust me I thought the same exact
thing when I had my meeting with Nvidia
why the 128 bit but apparently with
their revamped memory subsystem the GPU
can more effectively or more efficiently
utilize the memory bandwidth for an
effective 9.3 gigabits per second via
that 120 bit bus now lastly the 960
features some amazing options with 3
DisplayPort 1.2 dvi-i a DVID
and an HDMI 2.0 port for 4k at 60 Hertz
perfect for the home theater PC and that
pretty much covers it for the overview
last thing I want to mention though is
that gigabyte highly highly touts their
GPU gauntlet sorting basically it's a
GPU bidding process that guarantees
higher overclocks
and an excellent thermal efficiency yeah
a company that actually guarantees
higher overclocks
over their non g1 gaming line of GPUs
and you know there is only one way that
we can test that claim we're going to
play some games we're going to blossom
 up well I'll get you to the choppa
alright sorry about that transition
now before we talk about the numbers
let's first talk about where the card is
placed in the market and the proper
expectation first this is a sweet spot
card well what the hell is a sweet spot
card valve did a hardware poll on the
data collected from all of their users
and they found that the number one and
two most used cards where the 60 series
GPUs like the six sixty seven sixty and
they also found that the six sixty is
the most commonly used card amongst MOBA
games likely League of Legends dota 2
heroes of newerth I'm two out of three
users of that genre we're using a six
sixty or older now personally I feel
that this card is also aimed right at
the 1080p gamer especially those playing
triple-a titles like Far Cry battlefield
for upcoming games like evolve GTA 5 and
this is why I only tested the card at
1080p in the benchmark testing it any
higher any higher resolutions would have
been testing the card outside of the
performance target of the GPU now one
other thing to mention is I test all of
my cards overclocked now I this is my
stance on this it's free performance and
everyone should be overclocking
especially on cards like the g1 it's
built for overclocking now gigabyte
advertised a boost clock of 1304 but I
noticed that I actually boosted all the
way up to 1392 without even touching MSI
Afterburner now this got me excited
obviously because it meant that the
power target and the thermals were
obviously in check so I wanted to know
how much we could really squeeze out of
this card well I'm happy to report that
the card managed an impressive 1527
megahertz stable and I guess it's not
really all that impressive though or
surprising since the 970 and the 980
often are capable of fifteen megahertz
and Beyond or fifteen hundred megahertz
while 50 megahertz now this is a thing
another thing overclocked to 1527
megahertz and the memory overclocked to
7600 and I ran my usual gauntlet of
testing synthetic benchmarks some older
titles some newer titles and I'm very
pleased with the price to performance
ratio especially the average in fps as
every game was at least 60fps and temps
never exceeded 59 degrees Celsius in my
open air
testbench i expect that the case with
proper air cooling would see similar
results now i actually ran the fan on a
pretty standard profile i don't like to
I don't like that whole leave the fans
off thing so I just let them run at
about thirty percent and actually went
up to thirty seven percent to maintain
that temperature in the 59 degrees
Celsius range in fact we are running
right now though fully overclocked here
with the fans running their basic
profile on Haven benchmark and we are
seeing 66 degrees Celsius so that's
still very very impressive
while overclocked now the g1 gaming at
the time of filming this video is
sitting right at two hundred and twenty
nine dollars and if there is any
takeaway from this video
let it be this pay attention with
mid-range cards like the 960 offering
all of the same features as the big
brother like DSR MFA a supporting more
time more and more titles amazing
overclocking low temperature low power
requirements and DirectX 12 support
competition between team green and team
red and 2015 is going to be good so
there you go guys the GTX 960 g1 gaming
from gigabyte is definitely worth taking
a look at if you're shopping for a new
graphics card a gigabyte actually
launched three new net 960 cards
including a small form-factor ITX sized
card which is a trend we have been
seeing a lot more of and like I
mentioned I will be taking a look at
several brands of this card in the very
near future so I hope you guys have 960
fever anyway guys thanks for watching
thanks for supporting and I will see you
in the next video hopefully hopefully
you guys come back that'd be good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
