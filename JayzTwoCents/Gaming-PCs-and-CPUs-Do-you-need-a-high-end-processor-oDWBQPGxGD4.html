processors a lot of folks have found
ways to overclock non overclocking
processors from Intel that's anything
with a non case queue on the new skylake
platform through the help of motherboard
manufacturers making special B clock or
BL CK overclocking profiles and BIOS
that folks were able to install on their
motherboards and get much better
performance out of their non
overclocking processors but
unfortunately in the very same timeframe
that all of this really started to kick
off Intel has announced that it is
upgrading the micro code for the
processors to close that loophole and no
longer allow people to overclock their
non overclocking processors so given all
that that just happened with Intel and
the amount of messages I get from folks
asking me what kind of processor they
really need in a gaming system I thought
today we would go ahead and answer that
fabled old question of do you need a
high end overclocking processor to build
a gaming machine if you're anything like
me then you're really into self learning
I am just a knowledge sponge I don't
like to watch TV I like to learn stuff
when I have downtime and if that's the
kind of person than you are then go
ahead and check out today's sponsor
lynda.com slash J that's you know my
link to let them know that I sent you
but lynda.com is amazing resource with
thousands of online tutorials and even
thousands more written tutorials about
all sorts of subject matter doesn't
matter graphics design web design
programming 3d printing just all sorts
of stuff up there and the best thing
about Lynda calm is you get to learn
about what you want to learn about when
you want to learn about it at the pace
you want to learn it so you can do it in
downtime you can do it on your break at
school or at lunch and just create a
knowledge machine inside your head if
you head over to Linda comm / J right
now you can try it all out for free and
give you full access to their thousands
of online tutorials so at the end of
this video head on over there start a
free trial and member lindakhaas last J
it's how they know that I said yeah
that's kind of important okay so we're
going to do two things with this video
one we're going to do some talking head
and talking hand portion of this video
where I kind of give you some high-level
advice when it comes to processor
selection for gaming systems and then
we're going to try and do a little
real-world test here now
I got to start by saying that there are
a lot of factors there is no cut-and-dry
yes or no you don't need a strong
overclocking or high-end processor to
enjoy games there are so many variables
out there that this video is going to
serve as just sort of a guideline to try
and help you arm yourself with the
information you need to make that
decision without relying on someone like
me to tell you what to buy because that
doesn't really teach you anything
remember teach a man to fish wait no
wait I forgot oh yeah give a man a fish
he eats for a day or in my case one
snack teach a man to fish then there's
always more fish in the sea
something like that teach a man to fish
and you feed him for life that's it
that's what I was looking for so the
very first thing you have to ask
yourself when it comes to building a
gaming computer is what types of games
you like to play most know if you're
like most gamers you like them all you
like MMORPGs maybe you like RFPs you
like RPGs you like simulators it really
is going to depend on the type of gaming
that you want to do now all games are
created differently games are not
created equal in fact multiple games
from the same developers won't even
necessarily have the same amount of
processor load they all use different
types of engines and it's really going
to depend on what type of game that it
is for instance if you're doing an FPS
or first-person shooter the only thing
the CPU really has to do is load the map
once and then all it has to do is kind
of calculate the information being sent
over the internet to where the enemy is
when did he shoot with this object is
here this object blew up it's not a
whole lot of information there because
it's fairly pre-rendered when the map is
loading that's why you have a loading
screen when you go into the game but the
fact that it only has to load that one
map which is only that one section you
know so you know in battlefield you try
to fly out of bounds you just it stops
you it kills you or if you just keep
going because of a bug you eventually
hit the end of the world and you kind of
fall through a black hole and everything
glitches out so you really don't have a
lot of information that the CPU is
tasked with dealing with but if you move
into a very large sandbox type game
let's say something like Skyrim or
Witcher 3 where it's just kind of
endless or at least seems like it's
endless and the computer is constantly
having to load different segments of
maps as you
around there's a lot more load happening
on the processor that reminds me back to
the old days and I know a lot of you are
still planning it flight simulator 10 or
fsx was very CPU intensive in fact you
could buy the best graphics card on the
market and you would see no improvement
whatsoever to the overall gameplay or
simulator play inside of fsx because the
CPU was tasked with doing all of it so
the point here is it really depends on
the game and the way it was designed to
run by the developers typically games
that are console ports are not going to
be very CPU intensive because
unfortunately they are designed to run
on the lesser spec box that you would
find in your living room like a ps4 or
Xbox one or even lesser like an Xbox 360
and then it's kind of gimped on PC now
game developers have really taken a lot
of heat from the PC master-race crowd or
the you know enthusiasts of PC saying
that they want to utilize the amount of
horsepower that they have to get the eye
candy after all that's one of the best
things about gaming on PC is the fact
that you have so much more eye candy in
so much more performance so if you play
a lot of games that turn out to be
console ports then you can get away with
a much lesser non overclocking PC but if
you're going to start dealing with
things like modded Skyrim or modded
minecraft minecraft' runs on Java and
it's very intensive on the CPU when you
start running things like shader mods
and texture mods so even when I was
playing Minecraft and I was trying out
all the different shader mods and
texture mods even though I have three
tight mixes only one of them work with
minecraft though there's no SLI support
it was very CPU intensive because the
CPU is having to do all of the all of
the rendering of the world and all of
those individual blocks it really
becomes CPU intensive games like World
of Warcraft having very high-end
graphics cards are going to help with
things like light bloom and and
different you know render distances and
things like that when it comes to the
eye candy but the overall impact of the
world is happening on the processor now
in reality you don't need a high-end
hyper-threading overclocking processor
speaking of Intel at least in this
instance here you don't really need that
to get a good gaming experience so we're
going to do right now is we're going to
go ahead and play some Grand Theft Auto
5 but we're going to do a first test
here with my 59 60 X full
overclocked right now which is at 4.5
gigahertz and we are going to see you
know how it plays with all 16 threads
and then we're going to get bit down to
4 cores with no hyper threading so we're
going to try to simulate something
closer to an i5 it's not going to be
apples to apples because it still has
that massive cache on there but you were
going to see going from 16 threads to 4
by cutting the you know technically the
processing power in by 75% and we're
going to see how well it performs
technically we're cutting it more than
that because we're going to get rid of
those extra threads as well as the
overclock so let's see how it does all
right so I know it's hard to see but
here is all 16 logical processors going
right now on the 59 6 yet ok so I have
all settings on Macs I'm running a 13 or
34 40 by 1440 piece screen right here
all sync technology off now I chose
story mode because it's much more
consistent as far as I'm concerned when
it comes to you know online mode depends
how many people are in the maps with a
lot of variables so anyway I am using
story mode right here um this guy gonna
hit me nope
I as you can see we're running about 95
FPS right now that is with all three
graphics cards going at the moment
this guy's flipping me off how rude yeah
that's why I thought there we go yeah
here Oh wrap maybe we'll do a little
benchmark right now was it the benchmark
run we'll see what our average FPS is I
guess I don't know my own strength
okay hey Ellen to me and that's okay
this is just a normal day on the
boardwalk
how we make this is how we clear the
path meant to do that and to do that
oh god pull oh I am dangerous
oh ow get in the car get in the car
ah I didn't work out so well all right
so our average FPS on that was 106 so
let's go ahead and take off those
threads and see how it does our CPU
usage as you can see here was
fluctuating in the 30s down to the 20s
that went all the way down to what 10 at
one point max CPU usage percentage was
only 41 percent of the CPU being used
and that's one of the things that made
me decide to do this video today and
I'll explain why at the end Windows
updates all right in the BIOS here I put
the CPU ratio back to auto uncor ratio
we now want to turn off the additional
cores and I'm really sure you can do
that with this motherboard things I
should have probably checked before I
start at home oh yes here it is so it's
called active cores control so we've got
core 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 so what we're
going to do now is we are going to leave
on 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 will turn off 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 7
&amp;amp; hyper-threading is disabled so now
we've got basically an i5 with a lot of
cash I don't mean money ok so it's
probably hard to see but I promise you
it has 4 cores now running no
hyper-threading 20 megabytes of cash
obviously that's quite a bit more than a
standard I 5 what 6600 has what 6 Meg's
of cash anyway yeah so again it's not
apples to apples but it we're trying to
see if there how much difference there
is here in performance well the first
thing I noticed is that loading time
didn't really seem to change its make
sure all my graphics settings stayed how
I had them
ethics yep everything's still pretty
much maxed out vsync off good and go
back to our story mode it's always fun
to me I don't know why it's just fun to
walk up to someone randomly and just
smack him upside the head it's hilarious
where is my bike hey guys look like
Marshawn Lynch all right so I'm gonna
get in a car this time oh this guy's
about to pull me out of the car oh crap
this is bad news
oh here we go Guinea coming through
pardon me okay my dogs dead get out the
way now I always just seemed so violent
this is only necessary I'm kind of
trying to repeat what I did the first
time although I'm not in the motorcycle
wow guys run sideways they'll run down
the sidewalk run sideways there's
someone stuck in my hood hide me hide me
hide me oh crap
ant yep there we go
you shoot the tail rotors of the
helicopters you can make him crash okay
not in a shooting man whoa oh yeah what
just happened
oh well it happened kind of the same way
again the cop crashed into me and killed
me all right
average FPS on that one was 82 so we
dropped about 24 FPS going from all
those threads and overclocked two all
the way down to three gigahertz and
theoretically a knife I've so let's talk
about that now what exactly should you
take from this video will one there's
lots of different ways this test could
have been done and there are ways that
it can be manipulated to kind of prove
both methods it could prove that CPU
makes very little difference to gaming
and it can be proved like I just showed
right here where depending on your
configuration and the game it can
definitely impact CPU usage in fact the
CPU usage when we went down to the four
threads and 3.0 gigahertz at no
overclocking whatsoever we saw that the
CPU usage jumped from the 40 percent
range up to the 90 percent range and
maxing out 99 on the chart so there are
times when the FPS or the CPU was being
completely maxed out but what I want to
point out is I didn't notice any
jittering or stuttering when that was
happening so I don't know exactly what
was making it max out but it did not
affect the overall performance of the
game at all now a lot of folks get
confused when they look at their CPU
usage when they're gaming and they think
my CPU is only doing 30% or only 40%
what's wrong I get a lot of emails from
folks wanting to know why their CPUs are
not going to a hundred percent when
they're gaming well ultimately that's
kind of a bad thing that would mean that
your CPU is falling behind the tasks
that it's being well tasked with when it
comes to generating and computing the
game for you and that means that you're
going to start seeing bottlenecks and
other sorts of performance failures in
the future as games progress your CPU is
going to start falling more and more
behind meaning you're gonna have to turn
down I candy and settings on your game
just to make it playable when someone
message means when when people message
me and say their CPU only shows 40 or 50
percent usage that's actually a good
thing and that means that you have a lot
of headroom and room to grow in the
future as games become more demanding
and the reason why I say you should
always get the fastest processor you
can afford that you know as reasonable
at least I think even the non
overclocking i7 would be worth it in my
opinion over an i-5 is that as CPU
technology progresses and they get
faster and faster the demand on them is
going to get greater and greater as
games progress as well gaming
manufacturers and developers I said
manufacturer really they're building
games as they're making and programming
these games they are going to try and
utilize the hardware that's available at
that time
so if you get something that's you know
barely cutting it now three four or five
years in the future you're you're
definitely not going to be cutting it or
at least you're going to find yourself
really diminishing the amount of eye
candy and gameplay experience that
you're getting because your hardware is
falling behind it's just kind of a quick
test to get you get you thinking I want
to get you guys thinking I don't want to
just hand you all the answers I want to
get you thinking but get the best
processor that you can afford but
depending on the games that you're
playing you definitely are going to want
to get a good graphics card as well
those two have to work together to give
you a good gaming experience if you get
it very high in CPU and a very low-end
GPU you're not going to get a great
gaming experience likewise if you get
yourself you know an i3 or a Pentium
Edition processor and you get yourself
something like a Titan X or a dual
graphics card and then you put it on
something like GTA 5 or Skyrim with mods
again you have that badass graphics card
but your processor is going to become
the point of which you are having
diminishing returns with your hardware
so you've got to find a balance there
anyway guys hope you've enjoyed today's
video let me know what you guys think if
you want me to do this test again with
other titles let me know maybe we will
revisit it with other graphics cards and
things but for now it is time to get out
of here thanks for watching my first
video in the new office it's very roomy
and not nearly as hot as the other one
was and I'm very thankful for that time
to get out of here guys as always we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
