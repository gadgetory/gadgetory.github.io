watching the Friday October 19th edition
of tech addiction and we're going to
talk about why the daily mail says
owning this makes you a girl so the
Daily Mail is reporting that iPads are
taken away your masculinity they're
reporting that the sales of man purses
for the ipad are on the rise see they're
attributing the need for men to carry
around the latest and greatest tablets
and technology and that brings up the
iPad and apparently iPad type sling and
fanny pack type devices are on the rise
amongst men whereas they say women don't
even feel the need to carry an iPad so
feeling a lot more feminine already so
this week Britain's court of appeal has
ruled that Samsung has not infringe on
Apple's iPad patents and patent if you
weren't aware says that the rectangular
design with rounded edges is something
that Apple has apparently patented and
pioneered in the industry who would have
thought the Apple actually engineered
geometry go figure anyway Britain's
Court of Appeals is determined that
Samsung is not in violation of any of
apple's patents and that Apple is hereby
ordered to run ads on its website as
well as its TV ads in Britain stating
that Samsung has not infringed upon its
rights and to issue a public apology so
if you're in great britain i want to see
that ad send it to me i would love to
put it up on tech addiction because a
public apology from Apple over something
like this would just be golden so
speaking of Apple apples in hot water
again I am so sick of reporting on Apple
I'm sorry I apologize but she just it's
like it's almost like a train wreck it's
like Apple versus the world sad bear in
lawsuits with motorola samsung on many
different fronts and now apples being
sued by one woman
and that woman owns this eyeball you see
she's a digital artist and she took this
photo and she made this photo lot of
people thought that this was an apple
generated image but it's not and they've
been using this to demonstrate the
retina display on the new macbook pro
you may have seen it I saw it but it
turns out that the woman who this
picture belongs to never gave Apple
permission to use it really Apple you
just think you can now steal people's
stuff huh you you you think you can
patent geometry and now you think you
can steal eyeballs I'm terrified now
that my iPad in my iphone are going to
steal my eyes at night what's
interesting about this article though is
it reads that Apple obtained the image
from one of the photographers agents in
New York but Apple expressed in writing
to the photographer and the agent that
they did not plan to use this picture in
any of its add material that they simply
decide wanted to use it for layout
purposes I really know what that means
but anyway they decided to use it and
now they're in hot water and chances are
this is going to become a very valuable
photograph because I have a sneaking
suspicion that this will never go to
court it will certainly settle and you
know if Apple had to pay 10 million
dollars for this it's just a drop in the
bucket right they could have one of my
eyeballs for 10 million dollars so in my
last episode of tech addiction I talked
about the fact that the Apple iPhone 5
is went on back odor ever since release
has been at three to four hour week 3 24
hour week to be an awesome work there's
been a three or four week delay through
apple if you ordered the phone and I had
ordered my phone a couple of weeks ago
from verizon and they hadn't even taken
my money yet what's funny about that
it's the very next day they took my
money and then I had a two-day tracking
number and now I have my iphone 5 so I'm
going to give you a little mini review
of how i feel about this phone compared
to my iphone 4s and i'm going to tell
you right now
it doesn't feel any better right should
it have I don't know the 4g on it's
awesome I mean look at the speed right
here this is insane on the cell phone
you see LTE right there 54 mega bits
down almost 11 megabits up but other
than that and the fact that it's really
skinny hi I mean it's got a little bit
bigger screen but as you can see right
here shameless plug of my channel trains
two cents subscribe today it's got a
black bar on the bottom and on the top
because most of the apps don't conform
to the new four-inch screen so it's
going to take some time for developers
to update their apps to be able to tell
the difference of what device you're on
and to you know make everything fit I
did see I I ordered the white and the
bare aluminum iPhone because of us I was
scared of the black iphone and the
scratching issues but it didn't save me
from the scratches I've got one two
three four five six and that's a big one
there seven scratches on this thing from
the moment it came out of the box I
don't care but it's just as I mentioned
in the other video it's a prim principle
of the fact that it's brand new it
shouldn't have anything wrong with it so
I'm happy with it but if you have a 4s
and you don't do a lot with the internet
I'm always on the internet I had to have
4g if you find yourself using Wi-Fi more
than anything else and you just aren't
anal about the speed of the internet
there's no point in getting this phone
there's not the 720p front-facing camera
is nice because I kind of want to do
some blogs later maybe get a little vlog
series going so I could use that as a
blogger put the slightly better
front-facing camera the 720p
front-facing camera a thinner lighter
phone one that scratches easier and 4G
or just not worth the upgrade path the
only reason I did it because I was able
to sell my iphone 4s and makeup like
eighty five percent of the cost of the
phone so it was kind of a no-brainer in
the end it ends up costing me like 50
bucks for the phone so it's not that big
of a deal but if you were to go out and
have to keep your iPhone 4s and pay out
right the three hundred dollars or two
hundred dollars which ever
you get I don't think it's worth it I
really don't not to mention the build
quality on this thing is not pristine
like they advertised it the 4s feels
better in your hand and feels more solid
and that's all she wrote so a census up
in the northern california area of
Silicon Valley that's the San Francisco
Bay Area if you weren't familiar did a
recent poll on the average salary of
some of the largest technology companies
in the world for instance in Silicon
Valley got google you've got apple yet
facebook you've got Zynga they all are
based in Silicon Valley so it's very
competitive for companies to be able to
keep quality engineers so Google is
decided in order to stop companies from
poaching its engineers you know apples
banana pets other map engineers Facebook
has been after some of the front page
design engineers and they've been
successfully stealing talent from google
so Google's decided to fight back by
just raising everybody salaries last
year they did a ten percent across the
board raise and right now Google has the
highest-paid software engineers of
anybody in Silicon Valley and more than
likely of the entire nation because the
average software engineer salary at
Google is 128,000 and some change and
that's just an average at an airplane
flying now get away
and we got a helicopter so the average
salary of a software engineer at Google
is 128 thousand dollars and some change
to put that in perspective the average
software engineer salary in the nation
is only 92,000 so you're talking almost
forty thousand dollars more annual to
work for Google than to save you know
somebody else in the nation Facebook
comes in at second at one hundred and
twenty three thousand dollars in change
an apple comes in third at one hundred
and fourteen thousand dollars in some
change now this is average salary people
this is like a base salary come in
working as a first-year engineer you can
make that much money I'll be right back
okay so I just put in my application at
Google and here an IT engineer or you've
got any sort of software background or
even just you know I t and networking I
suggest you apply Google chances are you
can make some serious dough so Google's
really out to make their Chromebook more
affordable and a bigger staple in the
mobile OS market by reducing the price
of their Samsung built Chromebook
they've reduced the price to two hundred
and forty nine dollars and for that you
get a 16 gigabyte hard drive it does
have an expandable memory slot where you
can add more memory for you know putting
more files or programs or whatever
that's two gigs of ram and it has
capability of running 1080p at 30 frames
per second they did say that was games
or movies but you know this thing is
really small only comes in at two and a
half pounds it's only point eight inches
thick and I was just at Best Buy and it
happened to take a look at it and it's
very impressive it's very quality build
I don't know what I would use it for but
maybe if you want something that's very
light mobile maybe something that's kind
of like a macbook air but you don't need
as much power it's only 250 bucks and I
think that this might be a pretty good
bye but Google really wants to make the
Chromebook more affordable and I think
$249 price point is definitely
affordable so in the first episode of
tech addiction i mentioned to you that
AMD had mentioned that it was no longer
going to be making performance desktop
processors when pile driver was released
we're going to take that a step further
today because rumor has it the AMD is
getting ready to lay off twenty to
thirty percent of its staff AMD
currently employs over eleven thousand
four hundred employees so we're talking
over 3,500 people
potentially losing their jobs because
AMD just has not been able to compete
first it had manufacturing problems
where it couldn't keep up with man then
it had performance problems where it
couldn't keep up with a Speak &amp;amp; Spell
and now we've got just their stock is
plummeting into the ground we got a RM
has cornered the mobile market AMD
couldn't get its foot in the door you've
got Intel that's covered you know
everything when it comes to personal
computers and their xenon processor has
just been creeping and creeping and
creepin on the opteron processor and
there's just nothing AMD can do to stop
those two trains from plowing them into
the ground so it's official now if you
have AMD band and chip JumpShip getting
your d me row for your life because AMD
I have a feeling within the next five
years if that is no longer going to be
around it's going to be bankrupt it's
going to be gone that's it so that also
means if you're looking at building a
computer I suggest you buy your Intel
products now because when you have a
major competitor if they ever really
were there's no longer in the scene
prices only look at guess right there's
a competitor gasps like how much we pay
so halo for one of the most anticipated
games of 2012 is due to come out next
month and Microsoft is pissed because
somewhere along the line this copy of
the game got free got out and they don't
know where the security breach was but
if that wasn't bad enough copies of this
game have now been appearing all over
the peer-to-peer network scene so
Microsoft wants to find out who leaked
this and they want to find out what type
of prosecution they can pursue on this
so they're using their own personal
security as well as local law
enforcement to try and track down who
initiated the leak and find out what
they can do to hold them responsible
because people have been saying already
that they played the game they've beaten
the game and it's popped up all over the
peer-to-peer sites so Microsoft's pissed
speaking of games I'm going to be
starting a brand new series coming to
first week in november i'm going to call
it game addiction i'm going to be
talking about the latest and greatest
news when it comes to games on pc
console and i'm going to let you know
everything that's coming out let you
know how it looks and I'm gonna tell you
everything you need to know about the
world of games I like gay
alright guys that's all I got for this
week so we're gonna end this the way
that we always do and I'm gonna bring
you technologies dumbass of the Week
this week that dumbass is Timothy Clarke
you see Timothy Clarke walked into his
local Walmart and said I'm gonna get me
a Fivefinger discount on some video
games yep so he went over into the
electronics section and somehow got into
the glass case and he stuffed 26 xbox
360 and playstation 3 games in his shirt
26 he's not a big dude that's obvious
that's gonna show man so anyway he
stuffs him in his shirt and then he kind
of tries to meander right out the door
and walmart security stops him and he
started to put a little bit of a fight
and tried to get away but it was pretty
much pointless because you see Timothy
Clarke is the dumbass who decided to try
and shoplift from walmart 637 dollars
worth of items because not only did he
have 26 games you have to xbox
controllers in there as well for those
of you who game on console you know xbox
controllers are not cheap on the shop
with a cop charity event there were
fifty off-duty police officers working
at Walmart that day earning money for
charity Timothy Clarke for trying to
shoplift a Walmart on a day where
there's 50 cops present you're a dumbass
