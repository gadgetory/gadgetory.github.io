now Starbucks coffees the only way to
start this line man all right so we are
on our way to CES 2018 my fifth year
going to a CES but this time it's gonna
be a little bit different because were
going to be covering some really
interesting stuff not just PC but you
guys have been saying you want more car
videos and stuff so we're branching out
a little bit here we are doing a thing
with BMW as well we're gonna be doing
some track stuff on Friday we're doing
some autocross and drip stuff on
Thursday and we're gonna be talking to
the folks over with Gran Turismo and
their new GTV are set up in
collaboration with BMW so we're gonna be
doing some car stuff as well as tech
wandering on the Convention Center floor
to try and see if we can find some weird
things I'm out at a mission to find
what's weird and new so you know what
though we got to go meet up with Brian
he's already out there we're gonna see
it
a couple of idiots can't make something
happen this year have some fun I'm not
durable but I saved the hail of a
Bloggie that vlog camera hi so I to
focus right now here we are at the
Coursera suite here at CES 2018 and
we're gonna look at a few new things
that are very gamer oriented some
updates of some existing products and
even a new product like we're looking at
right here
it's a carbide spec Omega this is Chris
Ayers attempt at getting into more of a
more affordable chassis market you guys
know Corsair has a pretty wide range of
cases but the spec will make it comes in
at about a hundred bucks it's got some
pretty neat features it's got tempered
glass three sixty millimeter radiator
support full-length graphics card
support and it really just really kind
of gets people a interesting looking
case without costing too much it's even
got this integrated case lighting on the
front unfortunately not RGB you can't
change the lighting color and then we'll
cover that you get on the light it's
gonna be dependent on which model that
you get right here they're showing we've
got a red and black version we've got a
white and black and then the black on
black so the black case and the red case
you get the red light and with the white
case he gets the white hopefully we'll
see an RGB version of this in the future
that way you can at least change the
color with your future builds but
unfortunately the light loop fans that
you see in here are not included with
this case which would have made it an
outstanding value but they just got that
in here showcasing you know what it
would look like but something else we
also have in here is one of their new
coolers which is the h1 50i Pro which is
a three hundred and sixty millimeter RGB
with a ml bearing fan so it's not the
RGB fan it's a maglev bearing which is
actually something I've been using my
personal BIG's extremely quiet it's one
of those things where they're trying to
get you a lot of performance with as
quiet as possible and that's what
they're aiming to do here with the new
150 and 115 I Pro which is a two hundred
and eighty millimeter version of the
same cooler now if we're talking about
cases we've got something else to take a
look at over here as well fans of course
they are probably very familiar with the
Obsidian series a way back when when my
first high-end builds that I did
personally was my 900 D what we have
right here is the new obsidian series
they're kind of relaunching the line and
they're starting at here with the 500 D
now pricing on this is anticipated be
about 149 we've got two different
versions here that we're looking at and
keeping what the Obsidian series
tradition there's a lot of brushed
aluminum there's a lot of aluminum on
this chassis but what's new for kind of
the Obsidian series here is the tempered
glass it's got a hinge door right here
which just shuts magnetically there's no
tools required to open this we've got a
brushed aluminum cover on the top right
here this is actually a not a tool-less
removable panel so I would have liked to
see that maybe have some sort of a ball
mount on there to just pop off easily
for cleaning but that does not simply
pop off but on the front we have this
brushed aluminum cover again it does not
swing open or anything but we have
plenty of gap right here on the side to
let air into the front of the chassis
both the door swing open as you can see
so there's not gonna be any issues with
choking off the inlet of this chassis
but over here we have kind of a special
one-off version they're showing this is
the I'm gonna call it a triple tempered
glass panel we've got two tempered glass
panels we've got this gorgeous tempered
glass front panel which is a curved
panel curved tempered glass is just so
elegant but as you can see we're also
showing off your some light loop fans
that are obviously RGB fans but this is
this is what an obsidian chassis
theoretically would look like if you
built it out with all of course there's
DIY build-it-yourself components
obviously we've got a lot of light and
stuff going in this but this isn't an
amazing chassis at the $149 price point
I will probably see the Obsidian series
grow as time goes on there sort of
relaunching it so you can expect it to
probably scale up from here in terms of
size but this is the this is the entry
point into the Obsidian cases so this
right here is the lap board this is a
successor to the lap dog we saw a few
years back oh it's pretty neat about
this is it's got a couple of new
products here from Corsair so this is
the k63 wireless mechanical cherry red
or Cherry MX red switch keyboard it
snaps right in here this is more of a
shell that you could put your
accessories in which is perfect for home
theater pcs my upstairs living room that
you guys have seen that set up this
would be perfect and ideal for that it
also does indeed have a cord as well so
you can plug it in if you want to to
charge it obviously battery life on this
is about fourteen hours continuous use
based on its current setup and the 50%
brightness on the LEDs it's not an RGB
though in order to keep
the power consumption as low as possible
it does only come in a blue LED right
now there is a special edition kind of
an ice blue that's designed to go with
their Corsair 1 but this right here is
the and I always forget the name of this
this is the dart core RGB and there's
also an RGB se Mouse these are Wireless
mice they've got 2.4 gigahertz band that
it communicates with its own dongle now
in terms of response time because gamers
obviously care about response time on
the mouse it's a 1 millisecond response
time on both its wireless dongle and
when it's wired and on bluetooth it's
about 7 milliseconds so that makes it
perfect for if you're connecting it to a
laptop or something just for you know
the sake of using it as a wireless mouse
but if you want to get real serious use
the dongle you get your one millisecond
response time now there's also the SE
which will charge on the Qi which is the
MM 1000 mouse pad which is kind of a
multi-function it's got USB pass-through
it's a even got wireless charging
capabilities up in the corner you move
the mouse off to the side when you're
not using it it charges through the
mouse pad no plugs required but the cool
thing is there's also some adapters that
you can use to plug into your your
personal wireless devices either Android
or even Apple similar to the the wire
the early NFC wireless stuff that we saw
a few years back where you can set your
device on the mousepad as well and
charge that while you're gaming during
your work or whatever so this is this is
a really neat solution here for if
you're looking at having your wireless
peripherals either no htpc environment
or just wireless gaming that's obviously
not everything that Corsair has to show
it the suite just a couple of things
that I found really interesting to learn
more guys head over to Corsair comm as
always a huge thank you to our sponsor
for the show EVGA check out what they've
got going on here at CES 2018 we're
gonna go see what else we can find
as always guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
