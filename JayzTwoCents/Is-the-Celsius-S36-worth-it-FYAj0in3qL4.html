yeah I'm aware that my face looks like a
pubescent ball sack okay I had to shave
the beard then have to I kind of wanted
you to sue to look like underneath it's
been long enough to wear anyway mistakes
were made let's move on today we're
taking a look at the fractal design
Celsius s 36 they also have the news
Celsius s 24 but right now we're looking
at 36 because bigger if you guys have
been following the channel long enough
this probably looks kind of familiar
especially if you remember the holiday
ad we ran last December featuring none
other than your favorite coconut monkey
boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy if
Christmas can't wait w-wait guys he came
he came what time is it
guys I got a fractal design Calvin s 36
I don't know it is like way too early
for this Oh Judy coffee but for reasons
the Kelvin wasn't available in North
America so that's why we now have the
Celsius that's 36 so I figure what we'll
do today is we'll just kind of do a
little bit of an unboxing and we'll see
what you get in the package and we will
hook it up obviously to my test bench
here which is running a 69 hundred K a
fairly warm CPU and we'll see exactly
what you get and obviously you have a
user's guide one of the things I love
about fractals users guys is they don't
suck Oh a lot of users guides suck
especially with like Taiwanese and
Chinese written I mean no hate on that
but some of the manuals guys know are
just terrible but they've got full
illustrations in here and this does come
as you can see right here
what's full on rides and support right
out of the box so none of that having to
spend a way for a bracket because it
came out before that etc etc now I will
say this I will say that this is built
off of the a partnership with ASA Tech
so there is some ASA tech technology in
here those cooling plate technology
there's anti sound dampening vibration
built into the pumps dampening sound
vibration dampening built into the pump
so that we don't get a lot of vibration
I guess unless you unless you want that
sort of thing but we got three fans
right here these are PWM x2 fans so the
blade design is very similar to the
venturi fan that we've seen
mean but these are obviously not been
Therese they're similar but not
identical but they do have a very
similar blade design to that so they're
very good and optimized for static
pressure of course we have a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
and here's all our brackets and stuff
there and nothing else in the box comes
in like this nice egg crate material hit
the mic now I know what you're probably
thinking blah blah blah it's just
another ASA tech design who gives a crap
well guys this still maintains one of
the selling points of the Kelvin that
people really like that it comes with
expandability get more room here down
here now just like the Kelvin this has
expandability in mind so unlike other
AOS which come sealed this is actually
intended for you to be able to open it
up service it and expand it so you can
add other radiators you can add other
blocks a reservoir if you want I guess
so you could take this as sort of a
starter kit and build upon it if you
want it's really nice to see how though
the tubes are actually sleeved we've got
some sleeves tubing here there's rubber
tubing not fep so you have pretty good
amount of flex in there but I wouldn't
go flexing on that too hard because
remember these are regular kind type of
fittings we also have some pre applied
thermal paste here on the pump block
combo and although the previous unit was
built upon an alpha cool radiator this
does not appear to be an ethical rat I
don't know who the supplier for this
radiator is but it is 30 millimeter
thick has a pretty decent fpi or fins
per inch so it has a imagine a pretty
decent amount of cooling capacity one
thing I really like about this though is
that it has a built-in pwm fan splitter
for the fans built into the radiator so
you don't have to worry about trying to
plug your fans into a motherboard or
buying another splitter or worrying
about whether or not you have enough fan
headers for a 360 rad plus your case
fans
you only need one PWM header which will
can control both the fans and the pump
also too you don't have wire flopping
around because of the fact that it's
actually running through the sleeving of
one of the tubes right here so you can
actually let the pump kind of decide on
what's happening with the fans or you
can actually control these via PWM so
you have two different options there for
cooling all right up talking about it
let's get it set up let's put it on
you test system right here and let's see
what the temperatures actually look like
the wires use with these fans are
specifically meant to be used with this
radiator effect they're shorter than
normal and the reason for that is it
allows you to actually route them kind
of behind the screws like this if you
want and when you plug them into the PWM
splitter right here you don't have a
bunch of slop and excess slack laying
around here's the other side of it right
there so you guys can see that you get a
pretty clean installation something to
keep in mind though is if you do decide
not to use the feed of PWM fan splitter
for some reason then these cables are
probably not going to be long enough on
these fans to reach the headers on your
motherboard
I had the test running for almost 25
minutes I want to talk about this this
chart that you see right here the bit in
the beginning there actually was maxing
out at about 82 see on the hottest core
averaging around 78 see across all of
the cores which is not terrible but
that's a bit warmer that I'd like to see
obviously on an overclocked CPU now I'm
asking a lot of this unit imagine it to
cool eight cores with hyper-threading
under a stress test with the auto
setting which kept the fans running
right around 900 rpm now when it dips
down what you see right there was a
10-minute test of me seeing what happens
if I put the fans to a hundred percent
and as you can see the temperatures
dropped about 12 C across the board
averaging right around 71 C average on
the core some down into the 60s I think
one core actually went down to about 59
C so as you can see there's a lot of
headroom in this and I feel like the
built-in controller when you have it set
to auto is a bit too conservative it
cares a little bit too much more about
acoustics than it does about the fluid
tempt not have a fluent tip monitor on
here I know but blue attempt got to but
I'll tell you that the end tanks on the
radiator got pretty damn warm but the
second I flipped it to 100% you could
see the temperature immediately across
the board came down and the radiator
actually cooled off to about room temp
as well I had coconut monkey test it and
touch it and he agreed that it was like
wow it's actually not that warm and then
you can see where I started come back up
right here was where I put it back to
auto and you can see it immediately
started ramping back up and then I
stopped the test now to be able to do
section so let's go and talk about the s
36 realistically what you're getting
here is an all-in-one cooler that offers
expandability so that makes it sort of a
hybrid if you will you can expand it
which makes it kind of like a custom
loop but you're getting the compact
install ability install ability is that
the right word no shaking your head at
me you're getting compatibility with
more cases and ease of installation
that's what I'm trying to say so you're
getting that with this I would just
maybe recommend though studying it to
PWM and controlling the fans yourself
I've it didn't speed up that's the thing
that kind of Concerned me was when it
was in Auto the fan speed did not
increase even though we hit 82
see on one of the cores but regardless I
still would highly recommend this
because this triple unit here is you see
the s 36 - showing an MSRP of $119 u.s.
and it's only $10 cheaper for the s 240
so if you can fit a 36 or the 360
version by all means do it having an
extra 120 millimeters worth of cooling
capacity it's better to have more than
you need the not enough
now what I'd like to obsesses the s 240
because I feel like more people would go
with a 240 millimeter variant you have
more compatibility with more cases than
a 360 but maybe we'll do that test in
the future anyway guys it's time to go I
tell you what though wasn't nearly as
excited as Nick was because he was like
oh boy oh boy oh boy a Celsius s 36 it's
not even Christmas
he's over here you can't see who's
behind the camera right now doing this
I'm embarrassing him alright time to go
guys you guys may have noticed by now -
I'm actually wearing a J's - cent shirt
that's kind of weird not on sale yet but
soon he has been bugging me for some
merchants we finally I find it caved and
did that I'm selling out to myself time
to go guys come what'd you think about
this color and if you think there's any
other AIO coolers I should take a look
at let me know and I'll do the best I
can to accompany but that said time to
go and I'll see you in the next one my
snapping my fingers if I snap the
fingers with a video stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
