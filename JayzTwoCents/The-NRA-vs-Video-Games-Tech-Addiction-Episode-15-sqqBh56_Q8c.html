and I am bringing you your favorite
geeky weekly show called tech addiction
warm and talk about some of the latest
technology news and this is the first
official show of 2013 and we're going to
go ahead and get things started right
off the bat we're talking about the fact
that Kim calm has brought back
megaupload but it's under the new name
mega you're watching the original Jays
27 so don't you go anywhere we're going
to come right back with your latest
geeky technology that is right guys your
favorite flamboyant internet
entrepreneur known as Kim calm or
formerly the owner of mega upload who
has shut down last year by the FBI and
the FCC and the and probably PETA and
FEMA and mad and whatever other acronym
you'd like to put in here has returned
with his brand new website called wait
for it wait for it murderer mega is
bringing you 50 gigabytes of free online
storage and the cool thing about it is
the fact that you can control who can
and can't download your files so in
other words it's just a really really
powerful Dropbox on steroids whatever
the launch event was very very
over-the-top for someone like Kim calm
as you might have expected there were
fake FBI helicopters there were black
SUVs looking like the you know FBI there
were security guards in miniskirts and
of course there was a open bar and it
was just like a big old party for megas
launching and in its very first hour the
server kept going up and crashing and
going up and crashing because there were
so many people logging on trying to
register with mega a hundred thousand
people 100,000 people registered on the
site in the very first hour causing it
to crash many many times in that first
hour and on its very first day mega
logged over 1 million new accounts so if
you've been missing megaupload as your
one-stop place for file sharing guess
what its back but probably for a limited
time because the FBI has already been
watching this and is
are you looking for any little loophole
that they can to shut this down
especially since Kim calm has been
banned from owning or operating any
websites or even using the internet but
legally it actually belongs to somebody
else so whether or not it actually
belongs to him the idea is his and it's
there for you to use right now 50
gigabytes of cloud storage for free
which always seems to be the case
whenever there is some sort of gun
violence in the United States the NRA is
really quick to act and blame somebody
else for the reason why these violent
shootings occur but the NRA in true
fashion needing somewhere else to blame
the blame has decided to go ahead and
blame video games nevermind the fact
that violent movies are released every
single year all over the world featuring
all sorts of different violent acts
we've got to go ahead and blame video
games right their argument is the fact
that millions of people use video games
and play these violent video games which
must be the reason why we are going
around and shooting everybody so I
decided to let's go ahead and take a
look at just a few games of my hard copy
video game library right here and let's
see what I'm likely to do in the future
based on the very fact that I have video
games well right off the bat I've got
battlefield 2142 right here which means
I must be getting ready to operate
robots I love robots so I can't wait
thanks an array for that one but I'm
gonna be going to war in battlefield 3
right here operating tanks and jets and
stuff this game isn't all about shooting
people it's also about blowing things up
so watch out I'm gonna probably blow
something up in the future now and if
that career doesn't work out for me I
can go ahead and trained to use the
force because Star Wars The Old Republic
says that I am going to become an
apprentice so I'm going to become a lord
and i am going to end up being one hell
of a sword-swinging guy with lasers I
love lasers this is awesome I can't wait
and if that doesn't work out in the
future I will go ahead and protect all
of mankind from aliens so if you ask me
an array of video games are telling me
what I'm going to be doing in the future
it's going to be fighting wars in
protecting Liberty operating robots
learning how to use the Force and using
laser swords and lightsabers and Jedi
mind tricks and stuff the video games
are to me not watch out guys I play
pac-man them get ready to come and eat
you know I gotta change the battery on
this thing speaking of violent video
games Congress is looking at passing a
new bill that discusses the rating
for video games the video games rating
Enforcement Act and what that means is
that it's can require that every single
game sold either online or hard copy in
the United States has an ESRB rating on
them which we've all heard of mature
team violence sexual content all that
sort of stuff and it lets parents know
exactly what it is they're buying for
their children and the rating of video
games just like the acts that required
that every single TV show have a rating
on it when the TV show pops up on TV and
it's got that little rating on the
bottom it's the same thing for video
games it doesn't seem so bad on the
surface because companies like EA dice
Bioware treyarch they can all afford
those ratings but what does this mean
for independent game makers who submit a
lot of their games to steam and it's the
only way that they can get their game
out where they charge a dollar five
dollars ten dollars whatever because it
can't afford to get a publishing company
behind them it means they're no longer
going to be able to afford to make those
games because sometimes it is very
expensive to get an ESRB submission and
rating on your video games but it's
going to go ahead and it's going to hurt
our economy even further because they
have absolutely no concept whatsoever of
what stupid laws do for the private
sector in the United States and so it's
going to put a lot of these independent
game makers out of business because they
are not going to be able to legally sell
or submit their game for distribution
because it can afford to submit their
game for an ESRB rating once again video
games are under attack because of the
actions of a few crazy people in the
world that keeps saying people like you
and I from being able to enjoy some of
the smaller things in life if you ask me
this is going to be one of those things
where the old fuddy-duddies in
government actually have no clue once
again what it is that they're talking
about other than the fact that they want
us to feel like they're doing something
because they slap a label and a law on
something so if you feel this is a bad
thing and you live in the United States
or urge you all to write into your
Congress people and tell them how much
you disagree with the requirement of
ESRB ratings especially on indie games
so Microsoft is inching closer and
closer to releasing Microsoft it what's
it called again oh yeah Internet
Explorer Microsoft Internet it can't
even see it I go so long saying
Microsoft Internet Explorer I can't even
say it anymore but the bottom line is
Microsoft is looking at releasing this
for windows 7 very very soon we don't
have a release date that they are
looking at bringing microsoft internet
bloor version 10 to windows 7 and that's
great news because if you're like me you
use Microsoft Internet Explorer to
download all sorts of other browsers
firefox google safari now not Safari
probably not Safari at all but if you
are using Windows 8 then you already
have internet explorer 10 but guess what
Internet Explorer 10 is coming to
windows 7 and I can't wait to use it
just to download another browser just
for the sake of being able to and
speaking of windows 8 if you haven't
bought windows 8 already I don't know
why you would but if you're considering
buying windows 8 you might want to do it
quick because guess what on februari
first Microsoft is raising the price of
windows 8 the windows 8 pro pack is
going to cost you ninety nine dollars
and ninety-nine cents this is the same
version of the software that was being
given as an upgrade for fourteen dollars
and ninety-nine cents only a few months
ago if you bought a new computer in that
time period the windows 8 upgrade
edition will be available online for 119
dollars and ninety-nine cents that's an
upgrade people then upgrade from windows
7 to Windows 8 119 dollars and
ninety-nine cents available online and
the windows 8 pro edition upgrade is
going to be available for 199 dollars
and ninety-nine cents it's hard to say
those prices without laughing because
that ubuntu operating system is really
starting to look very very enticing
because of the fact that it is free but
we're waiting for here is Linux to maybe
get a little bit more mainstream when it
comes with developers and I'm telling
you right now if developers start
developing all the programs i like to
use on Microsoft I see no reason why so
ever while I wouldn't switch to a bun to
because these prices are getting
absolutely out of hand so do yourself a
favor if you're already on Windows 7
especially if you're on 64-bit just stay
there just stay on Windows 7 wait at
least for service pack 1 to come out for
windows 8 and even then I don't even
think it's worth the upgrade price I
know lots of people that are still
running windows XP and are perfectly
happy but I think you might want to just
go ahead and hold off on this windows 8
thing that is my official opinion here
because it is now going to be absolutely
unbearable at that price ok guys so
before I get into this week's technology
dumbass of the Week I want to go ahead
and talk about a little bit of an
announcement here as you guys know in
the beginning of december i did a
giveaway of the munition billets battle
great earphones but guess what i'm doing
another giveaway and
time I have two things to give away
first off since me nishio was kind
enough to send me there SVS to do a
review and test on I got to keep these
but because I fell in love with them so
much I decided to keep them and I'm
going to be giving away my munition
winter white billets right here this box
is opened I did open this and I did use
these however i am going to be including
a brand new set of medium hollow points
because that's what i use to you are
going to be getting headphones that are
open but they are brand new hollow
points completely unused so don't look a
gift horse in the mouth i wanted to go
ahead and put these to good use I don't
want to keep both sets of earphones but
somebody watching right now is going to
be the lucky winner of these winter
white billets from you nishio but i'm
not done there because of all of the
comments I get on my AMD vs intel video
I've decided to go ahead and give away
this AMD apu it is an 88 3870 k
processor with integrated graphics very
good integrated graphics on my dad no
it's not an 810 it isn't a 8 but guess
what it's free and it came to the
conclusion that there are so many people
out there using such outdated equipment
that there might be somebody out there
who can actually use this processor and
give it to a good home it is brand new
factory sealed never used and if you
want to learn more about how to win
these two items stay tuned with J's two
cents because I am going to be doing a
giveaway video talking about nothing but
this giveaway and what it is you have to
do to win either diminishes or the
billets now it's time for that
technology's dose of the week and this
week we are featuring two people a 15
year old and a 16 year old female in
Placer County California that is in
Northern California if you are not aware
with the large geographical area that is
the California State the 15 year old
girl had very strict parents and her
parents would no longer allow her on the
Internet beyond 10pm so she had a 16
year old friend who said hey I can take
care of that problem for you so what do
they do they devised this plan where the
16 year old friend will provide a whole
bunch of sleeping pills and they will go
ahead and mash them up and put them in
milk shakes at which they will offer the
15 year-old girl's mother and father so
that they will go into a drug induced
coma and they can stay on the internet
well beyond the 15 year olds 10 p.m.
curfew when the parents woke up they
felt a little bit groggy so they went to
the police department got a drug test
and found out that the milkshakes
actually did include
a pharmaceutical version of a sleeping
pill in a very very powerful sedative so
they went to the police the police
arrested 15 year old and the 16 year old
and now both girls are awaiting trial in
juvenile hall for charges of conspiracy
and willfully mingling a pharmaceutical
with a food product as much as I got in
trouble when I was younger for staying
on the internet way too late I can't say
that I ever wanted to drug my parents to
say okay that's totally a lie I could I
can absolutely see what these kids are
coming from but I don't really recommend
that you guys go out and drug your
parents so that you can stay on the
internet any later than your curfew so
this week's technology dumbass of the
Week are these two girls up in Northern
California because they are minors their
names have not been released to the
public or the media so I cannot put up
their pictures but I did put up these
lovely pictures of Milkshakes right here
so the next time you have a milkshake
just remember I don't know what you
should remember actually because if you
knew it was there you wouldn't drink it
would you that's been js2 since tech
addiction episode 15 or something like
that we are back to our normal schedule
here in 2013 and I look forward to
bringing you new episodes of tech
addiction every single Sunday where I

news happening in the world of
technology and with that I will see you
