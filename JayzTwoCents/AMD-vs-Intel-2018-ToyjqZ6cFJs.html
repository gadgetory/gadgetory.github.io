gonna bring you a talking head about a
topic that seems to just trigger people
all over the place and start so many
different arguments and bam boys and
enthusiasts alike and that is AMD versus
Intel a topic we've covered a few times
on this channel over the years but it's
probably more relevant now than ever
because for the first time ever it's
becoming difficult to make that choice
because there is so much competition and
both have such kind of different
ideologies to offer
I find myself seeing a lot of people
confused on what to buy so today I'm
going to try and arm you with some
information and some things to think
about when making your decision
hopefully making you a smarter buyer the
new z10 gaming keyboard from EVGA
features a built-in 2 port USB hub
volume slider 3 step adjustable wrist
rest and an on-board LCD display
allowing you to keep track of your PC's
pxo see stats core clock and more find
out everything that the z10 gaming
keyboard can do by heading to EVGA calm
so this is one of those talking head
videos that a lot of you really seem to
enjoy so feel free to minimize it and
play your own music because I'm not
going to I don't want to burn my face
into your screen I want to don't want
that image burned on your screen trust
me nobody wants that before we can kind
of move forward we need a quick history
lesson we're gonna make this very very
brief but if we go back to the FX era
when the about 2011 with the AMD FX
processor launched it was not exactly as
uh wasn't as intel destroying as people
were hoping it looked like it was on
paper it was gonna do really good said
you know the FX 80 120 and 80 150 had 8
cores and it was better than anything
Intel had offering on the mainstream
platform and unfortunately it just did
not really hold water and it gave you a
very good performance $2.00 you know
ratio but it just did not compete or
really give the upper cut to Intel
people had hoped and the problem was as
it progressed it didn't really improve
that much they did some small
improvements to like you know core clock
and stuff like that and it just didn't
really move forward and the problem was
Intel was making fairly decent jumps
generation per generation in fact the
last time AMD had actually truly
competed with Intel and beaten Intel in
benchmarks and and other types of
scenarios was all the way back in the
athol on era in the mid to early 2000s
so you can kind of see how long ago that
was and that's how long we were dealing
with Intel being top dog that's why so
many people were hoping AMD was gonna
topple Intel because that could trigger
competition in the space which would
bring performance up and costs down
which unfortunately didn't really happen
with the FX CPU now fast-forward about
six years to 2017 be highly anticipated
and awaited Zen architecture now known
as Rison launched and a lot of people
were pretty leery simply because of what
happened with the FX launch a lot of
people just didn't know what to expect
with AMD AMD had a lot of hype train and
unfortunately a lot of deer ailments in
launches in past so a lot of people were
just kind of concerned on what was
really going to be the real story
regarding a brand new x86 architecture
that was built from the ground up well
spoiler alert guys then architecture did
just exactly what people hoping it would
do it shook up the CPU industry and it
shook Intel a little bit because Intel
started improving on their CPUs
something that they hadn't really been
doing over the last several years simply
because there was no competition so now
here we are in 2018 with the
second-generation Rison launched and
Intel really had just kind of shown all
of their cards by pulling in coffee lake
and other cpus into 2017 and 2018 that
weren't even supposed to launch until
later on this year
so that means AMD did exactly what we
were hoping it shook Intel enough to
start the cpu war once again now one of
the things that's really unique about
2018 is for the first time I think just
about ever we actually have a mainstream
and extreme platform for both offerings
AMD always competed in the mainstream
market but didn't really have its
extreme market well now we've got the X
399 and X 499 stuff coming out which is
going to obviously compete with X 299
from Intel and whatever the successor
for that is going to be which is gonna
be your very highly multi-threaded tons
of cores you know we're talking Intel's
got its 18 core the 79 80 XE so it's 18
cores 36 threads you've got the 94 1950
X from AMD which is again the X 2
9:16 core 32 thread cpu thinks that
typically only existed in the server
space is now being offered to standard
consumers and they've got your main
stream which is pretty much something
that a lot of people are gonna fall in
that category and that's where the true
competition really is because AMD has
got you know their 2700 X now sort of
replacing the 1800 X now I'm pretty
confident that I could set up a blind
taste test with something like a 2700 X
or an 8700 K and have someone come in
and kind of work on the computer and try
and determine if it is AMD or Intel I'm
pretty confident that someone would have
a hard time doing that one of the things
that's always kind of really
differentiated CPUs on the Intel side
was the number of PCIe lands which was a
very curious way of kind of limiting it
stack where over time you would see the
gimping of PCIe lanes for the same
number of cores let me explain the 59 60
X which was an 8 core 16 thread CPU had
40 PCIe lanes but if you fast-forward to
the i7 78 20x you'll find it's also an 8
core 16 thread CPU on the X 299 platform
but they shaved the PCIe lanes from 40
to 28
so it's one of those things that that's
it's always kind of made people wonder
why Intel is choosing the PCIe lanes and
choosing to chop those over anything
else now one of the things that you get
on the AMD side of things is on the X
399 platform you get more PCIe lanes and
you get them on all of the CPUs so the X
399 AMD series and the X 299 Intel
series is definitely a good option for
power users because of its available
core count it's got very fast course
speed the amount of PCIe lanes available
on both platforms although asterisk AMD
gives you 60 on all of their CPUs it
makes sense for people who have very
heavy multi-threaded workloads live
streaming video encoding rendering lots
of background tasks virtual machines
servers it all would make more sense on
that platform now the main stream
platform I feel is where a lot of the
competition is and where a lot of you
viewers are going to fall into that
category you can still video edit on
both platforms the X 370 from AMD and
the Z 270 from Intel you can ASSU AMD
doing here right they were always
one-upping the intel number because you
know higher number is better a little
bit truly but i think it was really kind
of funny the way they went about that
but anyway i digress
so now I've got the mainstream offering
obviously on both sides so the current
mainstream on Intel is Z 370 you'll find
like the 8700 k-6 core 12 thread the
8780 600 k and then you've got the AMD
mainstream which is the current just
released x4 74 second gen risin and
you'll find the 2700 X 2600 X and that
range of CPU there but I tell you right
now if I was and this is where I'm sure
it's hard as buyers if I was to do a
blind taste test and say to the user
have have a gauntlet of tasks for them
to do something like Cinebench some
gaming some video rendering and I didn't
tell them what platform they were on I
think most people would be hard-pressed
to actually identify what platform
they're on AMD or Intel just based on
day to day use case scenarios gaming
video rendering it's all such a good
experience on both platforms now in
Intel you often get a higher core speed
intel has definitely been pulling out
more megahertz out of their CPUs the
8700 K can overclocked to 5 gigahertz
and beyond very easily
the problem is Intel is now the one that
tends to run really hot because they
chose to stop soldering their CPU there
are heat spreaders on top of their die
which means that there's not as good of
a heat transfer as there used to be AMD
has decided to solder all of their CPUs
because they've heard the complaints
people have about Intel so you tend to
get a little bit better temperature on
AMD which is kind of funny it's a role
reversal of the typical jokes you know
AMD space heaters which the FX series
was kind of referred to as but it shows
just how much things have changed now my
recommendation for most people would be
if you're an everyday average user and
you're just playing your games and you
want to maybe make a youtube video here
and there
the Rison platform has going to offer
you a lot more for your money they're
gonna get more cores and you can get on
Intel for the same amount of money
that's overclockable
it's very easy to overclock actually and
it is cheaper overall than Intel and
giving you what I feel is a better user
experience
for the money but if you're the kind of
person who's looking for IPC you have
programs and stuff that you're running
like Adobe Photoshop which take huge
advantage of the the actual core speed
then Intel might be the way to go for
you you sacrifice a couple of cores but
you're able to get way more IPC out of
those cores which some programs take
advantage of my guess though is if
you're watching this video and you
already know that you need that you're
probably have already made your decision
anyway and you're just curious as to
what it is I'm gonna say Gaming is an
interesting topic though when it comes
to CPUs because we're starting to see
more and more developers actually coding
for the multi-core experience back in
the day most of the multi-core CPUs
would just have one or two cores under
load and it would bounce all around
where now we're actually seeing a very
split up and level core usage experience
where they're dividing that usage among
scores that are available
it only took 12 years or so for it to
actually become kind of the norm but now
that it is the norm we're seeing we're
having multi-core CPUs and games that
are rendering large worlds obviously as
a CPUs that move forward with technology
the developers are able to give you a
interesting gaming experience now where
you can render these massive sandbox
worlds and and they don't have to you
know really worry about the power
available to it with these single
threads single core CPUs so now we're
starting to actually see gaming take
advantage of these number of cores I
mean pub G is one of those that is known
to be pretty intensive on your CPU World
of Warcraft has always been CPU
intensive so now you can see games by
actually going with a higher-end CPU as
a gamer one thing that's also making it
harder is the fact that motherboard
manufacturers and yes I'm gonna throw
them under the bus motherboard
manufacturers were very known for
cheeping out on their AMD motherboards
versus their Intel counterparts
even if they shared the same name even
when the first generation Rison came out
I think motherboard manufacturers kind
of saved cost and didn't build them to
the same robust standards as the Intel
counterparts because we hadn't really
seen how successful Rison was going to
be yet but now you can take an Intel
motherboard an AMD motherboard and they
both feel like they are just these beefy
bricky behemoths of motherboards from
the top tier all the way down that
quality between AMD and Intel seems to
match in my opinion for like the first
time ever so the point I think I'm
getting at here is in 2018 you're really
hard-pressed to make a bad choice you
could easily overspend by buying a
higher-end CPU than you really need
but that's why there are tears and
platforms for consumers now here in the
studio we've got basically every
platform up and running at all times
you've got Rison we've got Intel lady
700k we've got a 79 60 X which is 16
core 32 thread we've got a rise in
thread Ripper 1920 X on X 399 we've got
some older rise and stuff I mean for the
first time ever moving between them I
don't feel the difference in general
usage which is a great thing the only
time you can tell a difference on any of
these platforms is obviously we do video
rendering here is when you hit in code
the time that it shows is the only way
you can tell which platform you're on
and even those scale very very close so
guys this has just been a little bit of
a talking video kind of telling you
where we are here in 2018 when it comes
to CPUs if you haven't been following
any of this then you're probably more
confused than when you started
but it's definitely worth keeping your
ear to the ground because Computex is
coming next month it's in June and that
is ground zero for all things computer
technology we are gonna be seeing some
new offerings obviously from AMD and
Intel I'm going to assume who knows what
it's gonna be it feels like both
companies have kind of shown all their
cards so I don't really know what could
come next but they gotta be showing
something it's the world stage for CPU
technology whether it's gonna be GPUs or
CPUs I have no idea so anyway guys I'm
gonna go if you think I've missed
something in this conversation you just
want to add something do it cordially
try and do make an educated statement
down below don't just do the fanboy AMD
sucks Intel sucks because unfortunately
the forums are full of all of that and
you've got to put together more
compelling and into intellectual
argument than bla bla bla sucks
it's okay I know you guys are gonna do
it anyway alright guys thanks for
watching give me a follow on Twitter if
you guys want to talk about this a
little bit more in depth or I'll just
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
