more affordable type of videos this
isn't a review but more or less kind of
like a flashback in I'm asking myself
especially when I'm talking about with
all the new Intel stuff and all the new
Rises and stuff that's fine for people
who have pretty big budgets but what
about people that don't have a lot of
spend well guess what the entry-level
market is still dominated by AMD FX
based CPUs so FX still worth it I know
let's find out sick and tired of all the
RGB grades well don't worry because the
EVGA z2 70 class of 5k is full of all
the things that matter like Intel octane
memory ready you to nvme SSD support 11
phase PWM for stable overclocking and a
sleek monochromatic design that is
perfect for any bill learn more by
visiting EVGA com if you've been
following the channel for a while this
system might look familiar it's actually
the system I built my dad a couple of
years back it's featuring an FX 8320 now
admittedly you can get better CPUs today
but this is an FX 8320 you give 8350 or
even 83-70 with your incremental slight
improvements over this one here both in
terms of efficiency and performance and
they're all about the same price right
now on Amazon at the time of making this
video
it's $129 for an 80 350 this one's like
124 and at prices actually come up a
little bit because when I first started
looking at these when I did my ultra
budget gaming stuff last year I could
actually get in 8320 for about 90 bucks
so they came up a little bit here anyway
we've got 16 gigabytes of ballistics
ddr3 running I believe 1866 we've got a
hyper 212 Evo on there the motherboard
isn't asrock 970 fatality we've got a v6
50 from Coolermaster in here for a power
and then we are running my Ignite SSD
we've got a one terabyte Toshiba Mass
Storage in there nothing too crazy but
graphics card wise I actually put my 10
70 founders Edition card in there and
that's where I found myself being a
little bit conflicted as I can what
graphics card will be put in there so I
put a slower GPU in there like some like
a 950 or 960 then it's really going to
have a lot less impact on overall
performance because the CPU will
probably have no problems keeping up
with that but what if you have an FX
based system like this
and you want to bump up your graphics
card to give yourself a better gaming
experience while you're doing yourself a
disservice and it's FX still worth it
that's the whole reason why we're here
today I do have this overclock to 4.5
gigahertz so I want to go and put that
out there I'm trying to improve the IPC
a little bit or instructions per clock
because that's honestly where FX is
going to be lacking but let's do this
it's going to start off with some
Cinebench here because I've got my
rising scores on here from when I first
did the rise and testing we can see how
it compares so I've got a 1691 in the
1800 X and then all the way up to an
1805 with the overclocked squeeze my
needs together on that one side MP so
like I had to pee but you know if you
squeeze out a part we need to pee that
happens ok at 4.5 gigahertz our 8320 is
giving us a 712 square head it's
actually better than like a 4690k
although the IPC's are way better on the
4690k I digress there you go we're
getting roughly what less than half of
what an 1800 X is but then again we're
talking at $500 CPU versus 130 dollar
CPU so as what I did I just overclocked
our gtx 1070 plus 75 on the core max
voltage max power limit max temp
allowance plus 400 on the memory because
I want to really kind of I want to push
this FX CPU that's a little point of
this here I've also got fraps up so we
can keep an eye on what's happening in
the corner and here we are we're going
to start off here with GTA 5 and all of
our settings look at the default it's
very high we're hoping to stay above 60
I mean right that's kind of what we want
to see because you drop down to the 50s
right there it could be worse this guy
owes me money
so what happens when you owe me money
and you don't pay oh this guy owes me
money to come here so maybe you get a
card right oh that was bad for your
health all right so if we hop on a car
here what is FPS like guys we're moving
quickly so we can quickly drop down into
the 40s right here you know for 40s
though it's actually not that bad what
do you think Nick oh it's a smooth 40 if
that makes sense right it's not jumping
all around all over the place I would
like a higher FPS than 53 or 48 and if
we look at the chart right when I do my
GTA 5 testing with the 1070 founders
Edition when it first came out we were
certainly getting higher
and this so we are indeed bottlenecking
even a 1070 slightly now what if we take
those settings though and we take it off
very high if we do that theoretically
we're going to be putting more stress on
the CPU I mean normal sounds like what
you'd want right normal that's what I
call it normal I think it's fair to say
that if you're running an FX CPU six
years after it was made you're probably
not into very high range and initially
it doesn't really look that much
different I mean maybe things are not
quite as crisp like over here all right
texture settings are a little lower but
look at what the average FPS did though
came up about 10 yeah so the FPS is
still roughly the same okay maybe it's a
little higher right it drops down about
50 150 so I figured since we're just
hammering the CPU right now with games
that had huge worlds to render why do we
go ahead and go move on over here to
some Ghost Recon wildlands so it
defaulted everything to very high and I
think that's because of the the GPU
that's actually in there because it's
got it sees a 1070 it wants to go very
high on everything but I don't think
it's taking the CPU into a to account at
all
so we're gonna do is I'm going to take
this preset I'm gonna go back down to
high okay so we're sitting right around
55 or if I turn oh you see that
C went down in the 30s right there this
is just and the whole system just shut
off
uh so what how much irony would there be
if this is the second epic system I
killed oh my god I don't smell any magic
smoke that was me turning the switch
Megan oh okay what do you think and keep
going at this breaks I owe my sister a
new computer this is my sister's
computer now before I gave it to ride to
clean it off them like I'm as I do the
video it also could have been
overheating because I loved it a lot
what overheat yeah it also could be
overheating so here's the thing though
like usually if the system overheats
like that it'll just turn right back on
when you push the power most
motherboards today are good enough to
know like if you pull too much current
and it shut off for that reason like
it'll warn you when it pops back up and
it's doing its post like hey an
overcurrent situation was detected
they'll usually tell you that but anyway
right here in heaven though you can see
we're getting some pretty good frames
all right we got a 107 106 going here
this is 8x MSAA right now CPU is
currently at 51 beyond the idle or on
the package just one of the irony be if
I killed to FX systems in the attempt of
showing that they're still worth it
Casey says AMD Healy for service time
last if his name fingers crossed
Mary cut myself before we even started
this video I should have told me how
things were going to go more blood was
needed I'm okay if something goes bad
with PSU and like pops the 1070 I'm not
okay with it popping at 1080p I even
though it's just a Founders card it's
still a 1080 TI in the pretty it's
pretty the Internet's going to be so
triggered right now he said it's only in
founders edition okay what are the temps
right now well it's loading the game 55
C okay oh gee I hope you guys can see
the FPS in the corner though it's it's
fluctuating all over the place it's
anywhere between 50s and 60s yeah see
it's it's hovering at about 59 C right
here so far which is well within reason
I think I can snipe someone from here
my neighbors I'm pretty bad Oh what was
that I think I him in the knee but still
it counts okay I see if I can do this
again is one oh what's that - four - so
unlearn there's nine ah let it go like
over both buildings would you have
killed them Oh
it did it again maybe this isn't like my
slim 19 skills to see it won't turn back
on what we have experienced right here
is some sort of a power situation
situation so if I turn off the power
supply right now and I try and turn it
on we're going to drain those caps turn
it back on
see all right so I just did a little
checking online to make sure I wasn't
crazy and it looks like the FX 8320 will
start to thermal Prada lat 7 DC now
we're not hitting 70 C and we're
shutting down so I'm starting to think
that this might just be something to do
with the PSU or something I don't
believe there's any sort of short in the
system and I built it so that actually
doesn't mean much we're going to do some
doom right now because here's the thing
we just tested two games that clearly
bring the FX to its knees and one of
them is making the damn thing turn off
but what about something like do with
the Vulkan API which is very good with
lower end hardware that's what it's all
designed for especially the x12 OpenGL
is alright but Vulcan it's kind of like
next-level shit when it comes to being
able to run it on lower end hardware so
what is it like okay a gtx 1070 in doom
ultra settings 1080p look at that FPS
within the corner like if you if this is
the only game you want to play yeah I
think you're fine what do you think I
never going to shut off on here get to
an area where they spawn these will set
up because our Knights I'm just
wandering you're wandering
go
so we've decided it's time for us to
test out the power supply so that's what
we're doing right now maybe my theory
about this being a power supply issue
isn't confirmed and if it is guess what
I'm going to get a new power supply from
coolermaster because that one that I've
got has like a five-year warranty on it
five years on it and we bought that
bought that as you can see only they
find us with cable management here at
JCCC sense also to having it wired this
way to would rule out any possibility of
any sort of short in the system I smell
big we're anywhere near the temperature
limits quite honestly we were keeping an
eye on the package we're watching our
package very carefully can you hear me
in there yeah FPS is roughly the same as
it always was I get to go back and try
sniping again fpso still in the 50s 63
removing this isn't bad all the motion
blur is on said that grandma could you
play with this though like what you're
seeing so far with turning and stuff
way too high huh damn it I hate when
you're right you know what I'm much
better at something else here are you
ready oh really long here really
I really can't snipe can I so bad that's
scary I thought someone was Hawking in
the game we really could honk it's you
may drop down to about 51 but only for a
moment like the minimum seem to be
pretty decent look at that FPS right
there and you want me to go to where
those bad guys that's where we are right
now
turn up the bar near the game those
without field three so I expect it to
obviously do a very good job because
this is what this was current game at
the time oh yeah look at that BS in the
corner we're doing all right
well over a hundred oh my god so not
using this mouse that's my excuse I was
weird the way it turned black
oh I got revived they don't do that in
battlefield 4 I don't know why it's
doing that though like every time I die
it turns black dude's got revived again
yeah the FPS here is doing fantastic
let me pull up a noob noob rifle pro/5
you get revived yep three time yay what
was a trade alright so obviously you can
play games on FX you can play games on a
potato if you're willing to play it only
a couple of FPS FX is definitely showing
its age though so it's a hard sell for
me to say yeah go out and buy an FX
system if you absolutely want to get
into gaming because I feel like it's
very minimum you would want to run one
of the eight core CPUs like a 80 328 350
83-70 or whatever and there's nowhere to
go there's an upgrade path that's still
ddr3 and the IPC on it is terrible
instructions per clock are terrible
which is why rise them with such a huge
improvement now if you absolutely have
to go out and buy something today to
play games you can't wait any longer you
can't wait for the potential uprising 3
coming out at the same price point that
B is currently are sitting at when
you're going to destroy these in terms
of performance then I guess it's
definitely still worth it if you already
have the system stick with it a little
bit longer you can live on this little
bit longer until rise and three comes
out maybe pricing will improve all
across the board as competition is
definitely heating up in the space
between Intel and AMD but there's that
guys the weirdness that you saw blame it
on the power supply and the fact that
we're on a clone drive from Intel system
so I would expect some weirdness to
happen but yeah FPS is decent especially
in some of the older games and it seemed
to handle the 1070 okay of course it was
bottleneck a little bit but would you
expect would you expect to the
six-year-old see
yeah anyway guys time to go thanks for
watching hope this videos answers from
your questions I'm asked this all the
time about FX and if it's still worth it
here's my response see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
