this map was it just the eight of you in
the Quality Assurance section that
joined the map was like oh yeah gunship
works
oh yeah tanks work well let's push it
out hey everybody Jay's two cents coming
at you once again with some mediocre
gameplay covered by some epic commentary
continuing on with our series of things
to know before you buy or build or AMD
vs. Intel we're now going to talk about
things you need to know when buying a
new video card video cards are one of
those things that you have to have in
your computer especially if you want to
play games just integrated graphics just
are not going to cut it you're not going
to be able to play the latest games at
even low settings you're just it's you
just can't do it so the first thing you
need to ask yourself when buying a new
video card is what games am I going to
play what games am I currently playing
and what games do I think I'm going to
play and what do I mean by do I think
I'm going to play if you find yourself
playing games that you know are just not
very graphically intensive you know
minecraft or let's say World of Warcraft
or even Diablo 3 or those types of games
then you need to know that you do not
need a very powerful graphics card to
run these games these games are
programmed to run on a wide variety of
systems including laptops and and other
portable type computers that just do not
need that much power if you play games
like Metro 2033 or battlefield 3 or Call
of Duty on PC or any other graphically
intensive game the better the video card
the better your experience is going to
be those games rely more on your video
card than your processor so you don't
want to scrimp when it comes to your
graphics card the next question you have
to ask yourself is how much do I want to
spend there's a lot of price brackets
and price points when it comes to
graphics cards for instance you can buy
a graphics card today for a hundred
bucks
or you can go out there and blow $1,000
on a single card so the range is very
wide and the brackets tend to be between
1 and 1
d 150 250 250 350 and 350 and up so when
it comes to how much you're going to
spend you really need to be honest with
yourself because you don't want to do
what I tend to do and it really really
pisses my wife off we're all going I'll
buy something and I'll say uh you know
what I'm gonna get a step down from what
the best is today because I'll save a
little money and you know what I don't
really need that you know I don't really
need that extra power and I come home
and I install it and I play with it and
she can see immediately by the look on
my face that I am just not happy with
the graphics card so what do I do take
it out I put it back in the box I box it
up I Drive all the way across town I
spend time and gas to go and exchange it
for the model that I should have got to
begin with so make sure you're honest
with yourself on what you need and how
much you're going to spend because in
the end you're either going to be happy
or you're not and you want to make sure
you make the right decision the first
time another thing that's really
important when it comes to buying a
graphics card is how long do you think
you're going to have this card before
you upgrade again if you find yourself
on the common three-year PC cycle or
every three years you find yourself
upgrading components which is a very
common upgrade schedule you're going to
want to get a better card because you're
going to want it to last you longer if
you find yourself doing an annual
upgrade you can probably get away with
medium grade card or maybe even the one
step below the best available for
whatever brand you tend to go with so
you can get away with spending a little
bit less today because you know tomorrow
or you know metaphorically tomorrow
twelve months from now or less you're
going to be buying another graphics card
it's going to get expensive to spend
$500 every 12 months on a graphics card
by itself because chances are if you're
upgrading your graphics card that often
you're probably upgrading other things
in your computer to be a little bit easy
on your pocketbook and instead of going
with fad gtx 680 maybe go with a 670
save yourself a hundred bucks you'll
thank yourself later now kind of
circling back to the what games will I
play you're probably going to have a
hard time determining what's too much
power or what's too little power for
example I have several messages sitting
in my inbox as I do this recording
asking a specific question of which
graphics card is better X or Y and
they'll name the particular models that
they're currently looking at I'm here to
tell you right now when it comes down to
it the better
card is the higher number so if you're
comparing a 670 to a 680 the 680 is
better if you're comparing a 7950 to a
7970 the 7970 is better
it doesn't lie in terms of the numbers
the shear hardware between the two is
going to be better with the higher
number now the question you should
really be asking yourself is which is
better for me to answer that you've got
to circle back to the first question we
started this video with what games are
you going to be playing if I play
minecraft I don't want to run out there
and get a 680 that's just silly you can
easily get away using a mid end card or
even the low end card depending on what
games you play now one thing I would
like to explain to people who aren't too
familiar with graphics cards on why you
have these varying models of the same
technology and let me explain what I
mean by that the 600 series for NVIDIA
is known as Kepler that's the code name
for the processor that's used inside the
graphics processing unit but at 680
compared to a 670 compared to a 660 and
a 650 are all GTX models of the new
Nvidia Kepler line what's the difference
between them I can tell you right now
they all use the same processor people
right now I know are going what what do
you mean they use the same processor
this one shows X minus Q decors this one
has a higher number of CUDA cores
there's different memory bit memory
bandwidth you know going on there
between 192 bit or 256 bit or whatever
here's the way it works when they
manufacture these cards they have a
particular spec range that the processor
has to fall within to be considered
either a grade A grade B grade C or even
a grade D processor and right off the
bat you have CUDA cores which are like
tiny little processors that make up the
entire processor itself there's no such
thing really as a perfect processor when
you're dealing with nano technology like
that that is so small there is a failure
rate the way it works with these
processors is the entire thing doesn't
fail but some of these cores within the
processor may fail so the ones that
perform the best they set aside and say
okay these are our flagship models these
chips perform as expected or above spec
so we're going to stick them in our
high-end cards the ones that then fail
with inless I'm just around a number
here I don't know the exact science a
lot of this
is actually kept secret let's say
processors that are within a 90 to a 95
percentile on performance then gets
stuck in the B grade and then down and
down CDE so what happens is they
determine okay this processor is not
performing up to spec with all cores
unlocked however if we lock a certain
amount of cores and it runs stable at a
certain number then we've brand it and
we stick it in our lower end graphics
cards the same thing happens with memory
chips so they'll take the piles they
made with let's say grade A through D
and separate them out and they do the
same thing with the memory so then they
match them up and there you go 680 at
670 is 660 and as you go down the line
they have lesser performance because the
processor wasn't up to snuff okay so
that's why you'll hear somewhere along
the neighborhood of my 670 is within 10%
performance ratio of a 680 which is very
true because Kepler has a very great
ratio of performance to failure rate so
what does that mean it means the
processors that they're sticking in the
six 70s we're so close to the 680 that
they're getting very similar performance
but all the cores may not have passed QA
so they had to be stuck in that in that
B grade pile so with that explanation I
hope it makes more sense to what the
difference means between the numbers
they are all the same processor they
just have different components within
them either locked or unlocked and as
the card goes down and the processor
becomes less intense there's less
hardware that needs to support it
whether it be you know the memory bus or
the speed of the memory or the MOSFETs
or whatever are on the board so that's
why you tend to find $100 shift between
each card the final question that people
tend to ask is Nvidia or AMD well I'm
going to tell you right now the way it's
gone in the past is these two companies
are constantly trading blows it's not
like AMD and Intel where Intel has just
been on top for the last six years and
hasn't been able to be toppled AMD came
out with the new 28 nanometer chip
sooner than Nvidia Nvidia released it
three and a half months later however
they took longer to perfect it so
whereas the 7970 was the fastest
graphics card on the planet for about
three months
once Nvidia released their card it was
$50 cheaper it was 20% faster than the
flagship model for
Indy's what at AMD do they reduce the
price of their card now whether or not
you go AMD or nvidia that's truly going
to come down to taste you're going to
have a lot of competition or a lot of
debating regarding which is better and
graphics cards are not like processors
it's not as cut-and-dry you're going to
have people whose graphics cards perform
beautifully and they're going to have
those that mage has gotten a dud so when
it comes to brand go with what fits in
your price bracket and what you feel is
the better model for your money I hope
you found today's information regarding
GPUs useful and it helps you make a
decision on which graphics card to
upgrade to or in the future click the
video on the left to see my latest
production about what I do and a piece
of equipment that I own fails and click

whether or not AMD or Intel is right for
you when it comes to PC gaming and of
