video on a budget bill that we haven't
done in quite a while we haven't done a
a budget bill dry put my own money on
the line
last time I sort of did something like
that was kind of like for fortnight but
I decided to go ahead and do a build
designed for people with a higher IQ
than 60 that are playing apex legends
anyway to see what kind of performance
we can get for almost as little as we
could spend it EVGA offers a full range
of components including video cards
motherboards power supplies cases and
peripherals regardless of your needs
EVGA sure to have you covered to see
what EVGA can do for your next build
head to EVGA comm about 2400 G showed
that we can do decent amount of gaming
with high-end titles that require a lot
of performance even though we didn't
have a video card but what about a title
like Apex Legends what's built off the
old engine that the original titanfall
that's a titanfall was built off of so
the graphics are great and you don't
need a massive system to run it so I ran
over to Micro Center spent about $500 to
see what we could get I went a little
bit over that budget we'll talk about
that at the end but here are the parts
that we chose so we are actually
stepping the processor down one notch
from our 2400 g to a 2200 G we have got
that plugging into our asrock B 450 M
motherboard normally at micro Center you
can get good bundle deals that there
were no bundles for the 2200 G and
rather than step it up to a 2400 I took
the approach of wanting to have a future
upgrade in mind which is the graphics
card which we mentioned so we went ahead
and saved a couple bucks on this to put
it towards our graphics card now in
terms of memory it's 8 gigs of 2666 ddr4
running in dual channel so we're gonna
try and push that up a little bit higher
if we can now we've got a 2 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda Drive right here but
I'm kind of taking a chance here I went
with the inland Professional 240
gigabyte SSD coming in at about $27 now
for a case I went with the Thermaltake V
100 you can go with any case you want
case pricing seems to be kind of all
over the place I couldn't find any cases
at micro Center in the 20 dollar range
this one came in at 34 it's a basic ATX
case no frills doesn't even have a
window so yeah just basically determine
what you want to spend on the box to put
your parts in and kind of put a
placeholder there and then we've got a
500 watt EVGA 80 plus power supply now
this would be extremely overkill for
just a 2200 G
but like I said we want to do no
graphics card and graphics card as those
airplanes flying in ruining our shot
once again now the best thing that's
happened so far in 2019 is the mid-range
GPU battle that's happening here
we talked earlier or late last year
about the RX 590 kind of replacing the
rx 580 and we originally had an RX 570
in our cart until we realized we could
actually get a power color rx 580 dragon
which is an 8 gigabyte card for not 199
bucks was just showing there because of
the competition taking place now in the
low to mid $200 range the RX 580 got
pushed down in price significantly so
that's the card we're gonna be using for
our discrete card now it all came in at
a total including the graphics card with
tax a 567 dollars and 76 cents that's
$40 and 84 cents and tax we got the
graphics card for 168 dollars you can
reduce that from the total cost if it
performs like you want with just a 2200
G with built in Vega then you can do it
for under 400 bucks or if you're like us
and you're a little bit of an elitist
and you want some GPU 567 bucks so let's
go spilled it and see how apex Legends
runs so yeah basically je left me
because you had to go do some house
stuff which yes I'm building this thing
which means
so this is what you get for
approximately five hundred and
sixty-seven dollars from Micro Center
I made one change to this though will
actually feel built it obviously and I
guess it turned out alright considering
he's a noob in an Apple fanboy but I
added a case fan on the front of this
case so the thermaltake case I remember
which model it was what was the V 100
not a bad case for 30 for $34.99 I got
to be honest with you it's got fully
intake filters on all the intakes
including the side which I have off
right now so you can see the build and I
think most people can find a 120 or 140
millimeter fan laying around we just use
the basic fantex case fan here nothing
special about it but that way we're not
dealing with purely negative pressure
which is what we had here because we had
one exhaust fan in the back and that was
it so I'm gonna go ahead and button this
guy up because we want to see how
performance is and house and stuff are
without any sort of influence and by
that I mean leaving the case side panel
off now one thing we didn't mention
though is by getting the Radeon rx 580
we actually get three games with this
and that's something I want to keep in
mind here because who we're speaking to
you in this video is someone that's like
I really need to build a computer but I
don't have a lot of money the apex
legends game seems like a lot of fun and
I want to play it so we're speaking to
the person building a tower specifically
to play that game the fact that you can
get three games on top of the one you
want to play means now you can play four
games with this so we're gonna be
testing Resident Evil 2 as well with
this but of course we're gonna start
with out of the box settings we're going
to do a small overclock on this because
as I've said we overclocked everything
around here it's what we do free
performance take it so we got to kind of
sort of get a baseline here let's go
ahead and do this let's start up
afterburner like I said so that we can
monitor we're gonna run fire strike and
we're gonna be comparing obviously a non
overclocked to overclocked so here's our
baseline with stock CPU and stock
graphics card at 10,000 720 and fire
strike our individual scores that we can
compare a 14,000 five seven one seventy
two eighty eight and a forty seven
eleven now because we're running a be
450 M motherboard this is the asrock
variant we're not going to pushing the
overclocks very far so we're gonna go
from 3.5 to about three point
9 so I'm just gonna bump up the
frequency actually we can do 39 50
because I've already tested this
actually so 3950 just below 5 gigs we're
gonna go 1.4 to their 1.45 I guess and
then we are running the XMP on the
memory so we're gonna go ahead and load
the XMP profile which is our 2666 now we
want to give a little more cooling to
the CPU it's at 2,000 rpm on the stock
fan this is the stock 2200 G fan it's
the one that's really skinny it's like
the what we have in here is about half
the thickness of this so it is
definitely intended for a small TDP when
you start overclocking on a stock cooler
again attack this thickness you can only
go so far so that's all we're changing
here we're not changing any of the power
saving modes any of that stuff just bump
in the frequency up to 30 39 50 2666 on
the memory it was 21 33 prior to that
and we know risin likes faster ram so
we're gonna see what kind of improvement
that gets us along with our graphics
card overclock so we actually gained
performance without even overclocking
the graphics card yet just because the
2200 G was holding back the RX 580
slightly so if we go ahead and pull up
our original scores here you can see we
went from a 10-7 20 to an 11,000 150 but
our physics core came up quite a bit so
72 88 up to an 85 56 this is what pulled
our whole score up obviously so we're
gonna do now is again these same tests
we're gonna go ahead and save this one
and then we're gonna run it with
overclocked graphics card only a hundred
megahertz I'm pushing it plus 100 which
is actually not bad for the RX 580 which
is gonna give us a core speed of about
1450 could probably push it farther but
I'm going to a number that I believe
most people could achieve rather than
running it right ragged edge overclock
which isn't going to be very indicative
of a kind of mass result so that's my
logic there and then we're gonna run
game testing with the speeds at which we
left it over so our baseline was at 10
720 we're now at 11,000 689 the original
graphics card score was a 14 625 now
it's a 15 5 9 8 like I said all I did
was a plus 100 it was 1350 now it's plus
100 maxed out the temp limit and power
limit and I pushed the memory clock plus
50 now that's 50 times 4 so I actually
pushed it by 200 so it makes our
effective what 8200
I think that's how math works yeah fun
fact I said Orwell spoiler I guess I
said the start of this video we were
gonna test it with a 2,200 G only with
the APU Phil actually tested that and I
believe in 1080p he was getting in like
20 to 30 fps and low and then with 720p
was getting 40 to 50 FPS on low so not
great this is where 2400 G would
probably do a bit better but the fact
that we got a discrete GPU in here rx
580 that stayed within our budget we are
definitely gonna be doing all right I
think also I've never played this game
so I'm gonna be completely lost and I'm
playing on Phil's account so that's fine
with me
I know one thing phil was telling me is
when you're above the map like this
looking down this is the worst FPS
you'll ever get because you can see the
whole map the draw distance is huge I
mean there's a lot for it to be handling
here but obviously once you're down
inside the map that's when you're gonna
get you know the they have PS you'd
expect when you're playing so we're
getting 58 hey guns so we're getting
what 90 FPS not terrible definitely not
144 but it's over a hundred do this FPS
is so solid you could not have built
this a year ago for this price no way so
it's like our cards get ready to hit
about a TC but as we can see we're still
solid on our clock nothing's changed it
hasn't throttled down so that's good our
FPS is still sitting in the 90s so no
complaints there it's certainly designed
to run at this temperature so it's
pretty obvious you could play Apex
legends at a hundred FPS with this setup
right here again within the five hundred
dollar price range which is insane hey
you leveled up Phil here welcome so
anyway we're gonna go and check out one
of the titles that comes with it though
like I said Resident Evil 2 probably
gonna be a very similar situation I
think not an incredibly difficult game
to run but a triple-a title that comes
with this card nonetheless so so did you
get it might as well at least check it
Wow look at the FPS so far in this
cutscene okay so this is one of the
extra modes this is the fourth survivor
where you play as one of the Special
Forces that was sent in to get the virus
and we're down here in the sewers wow
that is smooth holy crap Phil look at
that it's 115 FPS but man that is smooth
now even though we're in the sewers this
is still very indicative of what game
performance is gonna be like because
this is how the whole game is you're not
outside in some big large world you're
in dark you know very moody lighting
type of instances so we get in here
another 100 FPS in here I missed his
head yeah alright I think it's pretty
obvious that this dogs Oh jet jet jet
real loud ah no animals were harmed in
the filming of this video except for
those three what's he a piston here 100
yeah I think it's safe to say that
Resident Evil 2 is gonna run just fine
over 100 FPS right how can you complain
and it's this VC precinct adaptive
synced all the sinks kitchen sink it's
all here so yeah it's kind of noisy
right now because the side panels off I
wanted to see if by taking the panel up
if the temperatures would drop we're
from
82 down to 76 so obviously if you put
more fans in this more exhaust fans too
when we had this one on the back it's
very toasty but by taking the side panel
off the temperatures dropped already
down to 76 but that's I mean you you can
add fans for under $10 a piece you don't
need super expensive RGB Maglev type
fans and a build like this you wouldn't
want to you wouldn't to spend $50 on
fans and then not be able to afford a
better component that doesn't make any
sense but we saw that even if they hit
82 we did not lose any
clock speed and what you can see here is
that for this very budget-friendly price
point you can definitely get into gaming
and what we also showed with the 2400
G's you could do the same concept of
what we did here by not buying a GPU
you'd get less performance than this but
you'd probably get 40 or 50 FPS you
could enjoy Resident Evil 2 you could
play some apex legends probably not
super competitively but nonetheless
you'd be playing a game rather than wish
you could play games because you don't
have a computer slap in a very price
competitive rx 580 which we put in here
out of Micro Center for what under 170
dollars and as you can see a hundred FPS
in both games no problems obviously
you'd still need a monitor and keyboard
and mouse and all that but we don't
include those in these budgets nor do we
include operating systems because people
always either have something there
already going to use a TV you can get a
box set for 10 bucks or something mouse
and keyboard those are all very
subjective pieces that you can usually
add about a hundred two hundred fifty
dollars to your build depending on how
nice or cheap you want to go also two
operating systems are very creative ways
to have operating system like Windows
without necessarily having to spend a
hundred dollars plus for it we don't
condone or talk about those ways around
here but anytime I include an OS people
get mad and say why'd you include an OS
you could totally get it for free and
then when we don't include it people say
why didn't you put it in OS because
that's a costs there's options on both
sides of those fences so anyway guys
time to go thanks for watching our
ultimate apex legends budget build which
you can see gets you much more than just
Apex legends if you guys have a computer
system that you want us to build for a
particular title that you want to see us
we like to do the minimum spec type deal
but we also like to do the ultimate
because this is much higher than the
minimum specs on this for apex which
ironically enough said GT 640 which is
like wow I mean okay whatever
I digress I'd rather run the 2400 G with
no graphics card than that but anyway
sound off in the comments below but you
guys thought about this build what do
what you would change if you could
change anything and what do you want us
to do in the future with these ultimate
budget build series thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one
thanks Alaska what we cuz you've got two
that come off the keyboard and they said
plug them next to each other you get
this big old bump yeah
now in terms of cable tidiness huh and
you keep wall yeah are you done man
we're gonna check out a little bit of it
I think it's safe to say battle I think
it's safe to say that resident evil 5
battlefield 2 Rev resident 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
