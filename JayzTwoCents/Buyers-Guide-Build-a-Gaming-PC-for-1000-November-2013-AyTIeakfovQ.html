cents and this holiday season if you're
looking at building your first computer
or maybe asking for a computer from
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or
whoever it is that you celebrate this
holiday season it could be a little bit
daunting trying to pick parts from all
of these boxes and all of these
motherboards and processors and just so
much it starts to cave in on you and you
get terrified and you don't know how to
choose your birds so today I'm gonna
walk you through the way i would spend a
thousand dollars to build your own pc
now of course there are a lot of these
guides already all over the internet I
mean you've got great youtubers out
there already giving you this
information but people have been asking
me for my opinion on holiday builds and
parts guides and the way that I would
spend certain amounts of money so that's
what we're doing today we're taking a
look at the way that I would spend a
thousand dollars now there may be some
parts on here that you don't agree with
there may be some parts on here that
other youtubers have said don't go with
that I don't like it and that's
perfectly okay this is entirely my
opinion there may be some parts on here
you choose to change with something else
and maybe you you like the bill but
there's a couple of things you would
change by all means do that use this is
kind of a backbone or a template to
build your own computer and choose some
parts this holiday season and take it
for what it is this is just the way that
i would spend the cash okay now for the
processor on this build I decided to go
with AMD 8350 no whoa before you start
throwing rocks at me and light and
pitchforks on fire hear me out on this a
lot has changed over the last year when
it comes to processors an AMD although
they had no intentions of competing with
Intel when it comes to the high end
gaming PC market kind of accidentally
fell into the position where they are
now but with the new consoles using
eight core AMD ap use and it really
opened up a huge future market for eight
core and six core processors to where
now developers are really able to tap
into the unused power of hyper threading
and eight core processors today so what
happened with AMD really got kicked up
into the into the higher end market with
these processors and when it comes to
streaming and encoding the 8350 was
already a very strong processor so
before you start saying no AMD's for
poor people jerry AKA bartok leaves i'm
talking to you bro the a.m dat 53-54
less than 200 bucks now is just really
hard to beat and I can't really
recommend an Intel build that's a 4 core
processor without hyper threading in
this price point price the performance
of AMD is just amazing now to keep the
8350 cool which is kind of a notoriously
warm processor I've decided to go with
the hyper 212 evo from coolermaster is
very well tested tried and true cooler
that's been all over the market used on
so many different builds and the reviews
just speak for themselves it's just a
beast of a cooler it's so well proven
just go look at any reviews on newegg or
any other website and you'll see that
you're not going to find any other
cooler that it's this strong for this
inexpensive now for the motherboard on
this build I would go with the asrock
970 extreme3 some people may be
wondering why I would choose a 970
chipset over a 990fx well the bottom
line is if you're not planning on using
multiple graphics cards in the future
then 990fx chips that really is wasted
now this build four thousand dollars
isn't going to be heavy overclock or
friendly so because of that you could
still do a mild overclock with the 970
but you save about thirty to forty
dollars over the 990fx models up as rock
and other competing brands it gives you
all the features you need it's got a
great built-in Nick cards got decent
built-in audio plenty of USB 3.0 plenty
of USB ports and it's got all the
functions that you would want for a
gamer build and has some advanced usage
in there that you may like to use like
the UEFI BIOS and some things to get
familiar with before you start bumping
up to a higher end motherboard for the
price it really can't be beat now for
the RAM in this build I would personally
go with the adata xpg version 2 or v2
RAM and we're going with 8 gigabytes 2 x
4 gigabyte sticks I chose this ran
because the xpg line is a gaming line of
ram and a data's really been pushing
hard on getting their gamer line up and
running and the reviews on this Ram is
actually very decent and it's not that
expensive whatsoever Ram is one of those
things where if you've watched my video
about how much ram do you need and how
fast as you ram need to be you don't
need to go with extremely fast Ram so
that's why in this build I chose going
with 1600 megahertz so for data transfer
and hard drive storage on this build I
decided to go with a main drive it's an
SSD it's 128 gig Samsung 840 Evo an
amazingly fast SSD with 500 gig write
and read speed that's incredibly fast
now because we know 128 gig solid-state
drive is not even a pipe dream for
having enough space for all of your
programs and gain
you're going to want to put in this
build we're gonna have to put a second
hard drive in here for some of the less
common stuff that's used in your
computer and games that maybe you don't
care how fast a load versus a long
loading game like Skyrim or battlefield
so for that I decide to go with the
Barracuda 7200 rpm it's a one terabyte
64 megabyte cash hard drive it's very
very fast Barracuda is a very proven
name 7200 RPM is a very fast mechanical
drive and it's going to be more than the
boom to give you the read/write speeds
you need to access your commonly used
programs and games without really
slowing down your system at all now we
move on to the part that I know you guys
have been really wondering about what
graphics card with Jay put in a
thousand-dollar computer well this is
the perfect time for you to be building
your thousand-dollar computer because
now companies like AMD and Intel are
really starting to fight it out and
compete because there's no longer a gap
between Nvidia being top dog or AMD
being top dog all the cards are out on
the market it's the holiday season sales
are coming up and all gloves are off
when it comes to the aggressiveness of
putting a traffic's card in your system
at a price that's not going to
absolutely break the bank so for this
thousand-dollar build I chose to go with
r9 280x from gigabyte later on this year
when games like Battlefield 4 start
adopting mantle and coming out with
updates that are mantel friendly you're
gonna start seeing AMD inch ahead and
inch ahead at the same price point once
again this is actually good news we need
graphics cards to keep leapfrogging over
the top of each other because it forces
prices down it forces a price
competition which really makes us as
consumers win in the end we got better
quality products at a lesser price
because they want your money and my
money and Barnacle eases money I mean
look at his man room it's got plenty of
money to spare so that's what I would do
I would do the r9 280x from gigabyte and
I chose to gigabyte model because it's
got a very quiet fan arrangement on
there it's got a very beefy cooler and
it's going to give you quiet and very
fast gaming for only three hundred bucks
now when it comes to a case for this
build I'm recommending the n600 mid
tower case from coolermaster now the
reason why I choose this case is that
has lots and lots
airflow you're going to see that on my
channel in a bit as I'm going to be
doing a review of this case but hear me
out on this for 90 bucks it's got more
than enough options it's at plenty of
hard drive space it's got lots and lots
of airflow it's got an amazing window on
the side so you can show off all your
components and it's got more than one
mounting option for a 240 millimeter
radiator if you want to go with an all
one cooling unit you can put it on the
top you can put it behind the
motherboard or not behind the
motherboard behind the hard drives and
it gives you a lot of flexibility for
building a system it's got great cable
management it's all black inside and out
and it's just a very sharp case now with
that said if you want to go with a
different case as long as you keep it 90
bucks surrender you're going to keep
this build at a thousand dollars and you
won't go over choosing a case is very
difficult you have to look at it all the
time you look at it whenever you turn on
your computer and if you don't like the
way it looks style-wise then you're not
going to feel as passionate about your
computer is if you went with a case that
just looked freakin badass so just
choose a case that you feel you like in
that category but check out the end 600
it's definitely worth a look now because
we know that computers use a lot less
energy and then it's actually advertised
on the recommended wattage from a lot of
these companies you know you can get
away with a little bit smaller power
supply than what some of the graphics
card manufacturers actually recommend go
and check out my video on how much power
your computer it's really using wattage
wise if you have no clue what I'm
talking about now with that said I
recommend going with the seasonic 620w
it's an 80 plus bronze rated power
supply it's semi modular you can take
off cables that you don't need for
peripherals like extra hard drive cable
SATA cables 4-pin molex whatever but you
are going to have the 24 pin and the CPU
power pad and probably the PCI Express
cables hard-mounted to the power supply
and you can't take them off but what
does it matter you can't run a computer
without him anyway so it's not a big
deal going with semi modular now if
you're familiar with the name Steve
sonic at all they make a lot of the
power supplies on the market that get
rebranded for other companies so it's a
true tried and tested brand that you can
definitely put your your confidence into
and know that your computer is going to
run efficient and it's a quiet power
supply and it comes
at a great price the last piece in this
build is kind of an optional piece many
people are not using them anymore myself
included and that being an optical drive
so for this build I just chose a basic
asus optical drive that came in at about
20 bucks you want to save 20 bucks and
you know how to install an operating
system off of a flash drive then be my
guest and go ahead and do that but it's
nice to have an optical drive in your
system if you're still trading disks or
programs with other people and in are
you doing disk backup or burning of
movies or whatever you're obviously
going to need an optical drive so that's
a twenty-dollar part that's kind of
optional I may have noticed that we
don't have an operating system listed in
this build and a lot of people may be
screaming at the monitor saying right
now it's not a thousand dollars it's not
a thousand dollars because you didn't
include an operating system well here's
the bottom line you have choices when it
comes to operating systems you could go
to the hackintosh you could go with
Linux you could go with windows and you
need to make the decision on what you're
going to do for an operating system now
Linux is free and it's starting to get a
lot of support from gaming developers
and in the future we might start seeing
some real Linux support so but for now
windows is going to be your best fit so
if you have to go with windows and you
want to add a hundred bucks to this bill
there are other ways of getting
operating systems I will never be an
advocate for software piracy so please
don't ask me how you could get windows
or any other operating systems for free
not going to help you not even gonna
respond so there you have it guys this
has been my two cents on how i would
spend a thousand dollars building a
computer right now in november now
that's not to say this is a first time
builders build or an experience builders
build this is where i think you're going
to get the most bang for your buck for a
thousand bucks so even if it was my
thousand dollars versus your thousand
dollars this is exactly how i would
spend the cash i know you're going to
feel extremely overwhelmed on what to
buy which is why this holiday season i'm
going to be bringing in a series
covering every aspect of a computer
motherboards processors cases keyboards
mice and we're going to do complete
buyers guides on every single piece of a
computer we've got a lot of companies
that are actually chipping in some
product here so i can give you some
first-hand examples and reviews of what
you can expect when buying stuff right
now this 2013 holiday season so i'm
gonna get on out of here guys I've got
some things to do I'm going to
some battlefield 4 and i hope you guys
have enjoyed this video you know what to
do with it if you liked it you also know
what you can do with it if you didn't
like it i'll see you guys next time on
