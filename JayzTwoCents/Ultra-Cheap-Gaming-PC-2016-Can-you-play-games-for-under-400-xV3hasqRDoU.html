the new master case maker 5 from
Coolermaster allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description alright so we're going to do
something here that I've never really
even attempted on this channel I am
going to take 400 dollars of my own
money head down the Micro Center and see
can we build a PC that you can game on
for under $400 brand-new but before we
go there there's one really important
crucial stop we have to make hi can I
get a vente upside down iced caramel
macchiato with whipped cream yeah upside
down come on walk in and out of one side
anything uh yeah just a second anyone uh
let me get one of those as well
make that two of those so we got an open
box carbide spec oh one case from
Corsair this is like 29 bucks oh that's
yours right there he was getting stuff
for his console power supply here we got
a 500 watt EVGA power supply eighty plus
not even bronze with this 80 plus it's
so cute an AMD Athlon 53 52 gigahertz
quad-core CPU the idea here is that
gaming shouldn't take whole lot of
gaming or CPU won't we'll see we got
eight gigabytes a ballistics 1866 no
1600 1600 bits of two times four
gigabyte I got the eight gigs instead of
four I thought if I wanted four we could
save some money but the 4 gigabyte kit
was like four dollars less sound like
four extra bucks it makes sense just a
future-proof a little bit he has a
future-proof feel it a little bit on the
memory a Toshiba 1 terabyte 7200 rpm 64
megabyte cache again this was like 39
bucks brand-new hard drive but the
motherboard here was an AM 1s 2 H
literally like super bare-bones there is
nothing special about this it's a Mike
RM ATX so it's a micro ATX board can't
overclock or do anything with this but
doesn't matter we had an extra case van
because the carbide only has one intake
fans we want exhaust in there and then
for the graphics card we picked up a r9
380 X X effects but proving that I'm
putting my money where my mouth is I own
this graphics card already I have one in
the shop but I bought another one
because you know when when you're
putting your own money on the line on
this you force yourself to think a
little bit differently with tax and
everything three hundred seventy four
dollars and ten cents so when I had
initially put all this together actually
into three ninety but there was a sale
today because it's Labor Day you kind of
take your chances when you buy an
overlock skates from micro Center I
think we did all right it's got our
window so we can show off all of our
mustard and ketchup cables three for $29
casein tall black inside that's cool so
yeah I think it's a good starting point
for our ultra budget build so first
things first though we got to do a test
boot which make sure everything works so
okay so this is the 380 X we bought just
to prove I'm putting my money where my
mouth is right here's what we just
bought here's the one I already owned
it's actually been chilling in this EVGA
750ti box but you can see we hand wrote
three ATX on there that is insanely that
fans like a 40 millimeter fan it's crazy
one thing I want to point out though
real quick is I do have my sennheiser
shotgun mic on the camera let's not
quite this is I am in fat that's cool
it's so light I believe you just said
that neither can the internet so it's
really not that bad honestly I mean you
guys know me in cable management I did
the best I could considering what it is
that fan no that's so it's so cute and
at 375 bucks we even have room for
growth for the five hundred power supply
one terabyte hard drive eight gigs of
RAM and a rear fan this graphics card
will last us a while so the question is
was the Athlon the right choice well
there's no upgrade path there anyway but
like I said it's 40 bucks for the chip
and the motherboard so if you really
want to upgrade this thing grab a scar
to last you a little while you can get
new chip and motherboard now it's time
to load an OS and see if you can even
play games on this don't see why you
couldn't okay so obviously while CPUs
only running at 30 C that is a really
cold chip all right so I know some
people are gonna be like what the heck
you need to account the cost of an
operating system
I personally don't because that's
software and the question here was for
three hundred and seventy-five bucks in
hardware what do you get and with that
mentality to though and in game we're
gonna benchmark you then have to be like
you have to factor in the price of csgo
you have to factor in the price of Far
Cry 4 or whatever we're going to do so
that's why we're not like including the
price of the operating system in there
so anyway we're gonna get OS installed
we're gonna play around and see how you
just wasted money but it kind of did I
guess I don't need this thing but I
thought why the hell not for science
science that that beep was courtesy of
YouTube's new policies regarding
monetization counter-strike go all
settings on high and to SMM s to x NS
AAA so let's see if you could actually
play with these settings and have a good
time
and no making fun of my terrible
gameplay by the way look at look at the
FPS and you guys see that up in the
corner this is online with bots so but I
am I mean look at this now you know
you're more of a competitive Counter
Strike player than I am would you be
able to play with this fps yeah
absolutely
wait what we're caring about here is if
it goes below 60 right yeah whenever
every now and then it feels like there
might be just like I've ever ever such a
slight stutter but then again we are
playing on pretty close to a potato CPU
here Danica's where I filled in multiple
times I'm going to CPU is pretty close
to potatoes I mean 39 bucks for monitor
or for motherboard and budget and CPU
you could be following my budget for
csgo that's like the money you save
building this way say let's go that's an
Asimov up not a lot of folks are really
the best csgo csgo is not very demanding
any people get mad that i don't
benchmark csgo in my Tenaya csgo is one
of the most popular PC games of all time
though and it is the most popular
shooter on PC platform I mean the only
thing that gets more contour more
popular than that as MOBAs Starcraft 2
and League and dota stuff like that I
don't think anyone's impressed by the
fact that we can run counter-strike go
but what about a newer title like Doom
we've got doom here running 1080p
vertical sync is off or running SM AAA
and of anti-aliasing on there motion
blur is on high we've got the Vulcan api
going and overall quality on ultra i
would not have expected ultra
performance out of a three hundred and
seventy five dollar Tower including text
but with that said here are the FPS
right here in the top right corner as
you can see I really really wish you
guys could see
how freakishly smooth this is what all
right Nick what do you think it's
awesome and I'm blown away that we're
running this off of the build because I
was expecting like really sluggish
speeds
I kind of was too I'll be honest I mean
yeah we're not choosing the hardest
games to ride like it's not going to run
Crysis 3 this is going to run far cry 4
at anything like super high end but but
think the point of this build is if
you're in a very limited budget and you
want to get into PC gaming there's an
entry point and I think that something
like this is actually doing it I mean a
$39.00 processor with a free motherboard
ok a penny it cost a penny but still I
had to pay a penny it was free because
about the processor has $40 off the
motherboard the motherboard cost $39 so
but you had to pay a penny more am I
going to monetize because of this
violence boom no gun so this is a pretty
demon heavy area with lots of explosions
and things lots of things happening on
the screen the other I know but I kinda
want to kill these guys before I bring
out 500 more at me
all right
all right so what if I drop the settings
down to say like hopefully visible I'm
going to say medium for the hell of it
just curious
we came up quite a bit we came up nearly
double right with that explosion and
went down to the 40s before but we're
still sitting pretty healthy FPS here
conclusion time is this a computer that
would allow you to play any game you
want at playable you know FPS no it's
not and that's because it's obviously
bound by the CPU the CPU is definitely
the limiting factor here I mean we were
able to bottleneck a 380 X without any
problems with an Athlon in games like
dirt rally dirt rally was pretty CPU
bound we tried to play dirt or at least
coconut monkey or Nick tried to play
dirt and it was in the 30s 20s not great
again a title that when we went back and
looked at CPU utilization was pegged and
we also tried playing overwatch once
again was pegged but on the flip side
though if you look at something like
doom modern triple-a title with Vulcan
we were able to see 60 FPS no problems
on ultra and if we dropped it down to
medium or high we were able to see up to
90 FPS with this system right here you
also were able to maintain about 60 FPS
in csgo which as you guys know is an
older engine right the the source engine
is not very demanding but we got some
very good playable experiences there so
you gotta ask yourself what games you
want to play if you don't want to spend
a lot of money you can build for around
$400 a gaming system that lets you play
games like League of Legends dota maybe
some starcraft some csgo and even doom
without any problems but it really is
going to depend on the title there are
some changes you could make to this
system though that would get you better
experience if you can bump your budget
up to about 500 bucks you could get
yourself something like an a-10 APU or
even something like an 80 320 se or some
sort of a lower end AMD multi-core CPU
that's on a modern socket like am3+ or
whatever and maybe even advertises or
allows a little bit of overclocking
which we couldn't do with this system
here we can reuse the graphics card the
power supplied the RAM
the hard drive but again the upgrade
path here on am one obviously he's got
nowhere to go but for 40 bucks it was a
good starting point and in the future if
you set aside another 100 ish dollars
maybe about 129 dollars you could get a
new CPU new motherboard that would give
you a huge boost to gaming performance
anyway guys there you go you tell me
whether or not you think this was a
waste of money if you had no gaming
computer whatsoever at least this guy
will let you play some games which was
kind of the point here obviously it's
not going to be super high-end gaming
experience but its gaming nonetheless
thanks for watching guys as always we'll
see you in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
