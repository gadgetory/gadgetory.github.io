more polarizing launch than AMD risin
amongst the community especially the
community of gamers I think most people
agree with me that gamers especially PC
gamers and PCM are they are extremely
cutthroat extremely opinionated and they
are very difficult to budge in their
mindset that's what makes Rison so
difficult with this launch of because
it's something new it's completely
different it's something AMD has never
really even done before so of course
you've got an old mentality here
regarding budget and price point and
performance per dollar and entry level
gaming and now it's made a step into the
competitive enthusiast arena and of
course AMD has spent a lot of time
building quite an army of gamers so
gaming is a very valid topic so today
I'm going to try to do the best I can at
least show you some expectations of what
you can look for when it comes to gaming
right now on Reisen remember there's a
lot of optimization that's going to be
coming in the future
but I think right now obviously it's a
valid point because people are sitting
there waiting to click buy on their
purchases but they're still not sure if
this is for them so let's talk about
gaming and let's talk about where the
CPU really fits into the market
sick and tired of all the RGB craze well
don't worry because the EVGA Z 270
classified K is full of all the things
that matter like Intel obtain memory
ready you to nvme SSD support 11 phase
PWM for stable overclocking and a sleek
monochromatic design that is perfect for
any build learn more by visiting EVGA
comm but before we can get into some
real time numbers with some real time
data to kind of show you guys just some
expectations of what to look forward to
when it comes to Rison i've got to
change out the coolant the coolant back
there which some of you said looks like
iron brew it looks like an old man's
piss it looks like tea whatever it might
be it's just distilled water with orange
dye in there which I was using to flush
out the loop while I was getting a think
everything up and running it's all new
radiators and stuff but I'm going to be
putting it now the new formula of pastel
this is the same formula it's actually
running a skunkworks right now although
that one's green this product right here
is derivative directly of the issues I
had last year where I talked about color
shift this is supposed to help with that
greatly so this is also now going to be
my guinea pig system where I'm going to
be putting pastel in here to see if
whether or not the colors do indeed
change I will of course be making it
orange orange is the color of risin
that's why I chose orange especially
with the gunmetal case it looks perfect
rise in so before we get into the real
benchmarks let's go ahead and take care
of that
enter the magic of editing just like
that the new fluid is in there with a
kind of orangey red color really
matching the whole risin color theme I
also heard you guys when it comes to the
cables you guys were like those cables
art ruining the build so I went ahead
through in some cable extensions that I
had their paracord they're black and
I'll have any custom extensions or
custom cable sets for this particular
power supply so I couldn't do any of
that but anyway let's go ahead and just
kind of turn around let's jump in here
and let's just play some game that's
what this video is about let's play some
games and talk about the experience now
as I said to enter this video I will be
doing all testing at 1080p the high
frame rates that you can get with 1080p
really do show whether or not a CPU can
live up to well a task but anyway if you
don't agree with that well there are a
lot of other reviewers out there
probably giving you the information that
you want so complement it with other
information I recommend that anyway
check out all the reviewers and see what
they have to say and try and formulate
an opinion now moving forward Here I am
running my dual type X Maxwell cards
guys these are not pastel cards these
are maxwell cards running on obviously
the Maxwell architecture overclock 210
mega Hertz pushing into about 1440 and
then 400 on the mega of the memory
pushing it up as well we also have of
course core voltage maxed out and power
limit maxed out as well another thing to
put out there no AMD to not message me
about doing this video AMD did not coax
me into doing this I've not been
contacted by Intel in fact AMD guys
remember they didn't even invite me to
the event so yeah it's not like I would
bend over backwards anyway to try and
appease them during this launch this is
100% obviously my own opinions nobody
ever tells me what to say not even
Nvidia they don't have that kind of
money they can't buy me we're going to
go and start here with some Metro last
light because this is still a very
demanding benchmark for DX 11 I will be
showing fps and such on such on the
screen on DX 11 titles the x12 stuff
unless has a built in FPS counter I
can't really show you but we are running
1080p very high settings SSA is indeed
on tessellation is on high and we are
going to be having motion blur off so we
are doing a crazy good stress to the
graphics cards and the CPU do
during this particular benchmark so
anyway here we go graphics cards have
definitely ramped up way past their
stalks speeds but look at this FPS right
here remember guys this is a this is a
stress test benchmark this is not just
hey let's make it go through some stuff
in the game this has a lot of these
features of Direct X happening here
volumetric lighting you've got all the
super sampling turned on all the edge
smoothing shadows all that stuff this is
designed to make your graphics cards beg
for mercy this so seeing this kind of
FPS right here I mean over well over a
hundred fps during a stress test that's
a huge deal I guarantee if you're
running an FX CPU with these same
graphics cards you would not be seeing
any performance anywhere near this SPS
is still pretty damn high remember I'm
running 144 Hertz panel right here so
far I'm not seeing any tearing
whatsoever that's why you would run to
high-end graphics cards like that's on a
1080p panels if you have a high refresh
rate panel and you want to keep those
minimums up also to take a look at the
CPU usage that's kind of an average
between all the SMT s and physical cores
so you can see that the game is doing a
pretty good job at actually utilizing
the horsepower available to it so let's
go ahead and take a look at what that
benchmark run actually got us if you
guys have Metro last light running on
your system and compare I mean that's
what you should do kind of see whether
or not there's improvements to be had
compare it with your systems so got an
average frame rate of one hundred and
thirty nine point one three frames per
second and a max frame rate of two
hundred ninety point eight seven you can
ignore the minimum it's always frame
eight or frame nine that's just the way
the benchmark starts it has a big
stutter in there but I definitely
wouldn't call that number crap by any
stretch
now the heavens free you guys can
download heaven and you can do this test
yourself again it's a DX 12 qualities an
ultra tessellation on normal
anti-aliasing that eight X so let's go
ahead and run the resolution at 1080
this is 170 to 175 fps it's just still
going up it's buttery smooth so you can
see it's not like bouncing all over the
place
typical signs of a CPU bottleneck when
gaming is when you have massive dips in
frames per second or what they would
call that zero
point one percent low where the FPS just
drops to the floor and comes back real
quick that's what gives you this
perceived stuttering and terrible gaming
experience is the huge fluctuation of
FPS but you can see things are extreme
well over two hundred and eight to
twenty to thirty Wow two hundred and
thirty-four FPS there for a second yeah
okay so we are smashing heaven no
surprise there
now Grand Theft Auto 5 is pretty good at
testing CPU usage in games because of
the fact that it's got this massive
world to render Haley Gus we have two
times money and RP right now on Dunstan
races okay anyway I'm getting
sidetracked here so let's take a look at
the settings here if we go to graphics
1080p refresh rates at one forty four FX
a is on MSA x2 is on and video TX a is
on vsync off we want that off population
density everything's maxed out very high
very high high very high shadow quality
very high reflection MSA is on water
halt
so everything as you can see softest
shadows very high settings motion blurs
on just a little bit ambient occlusion
tessellation yeah so as you can see we
are definitely pushing this as far as we
can now instead of doing what the
benchmark run like everyone does I've
got a particular mission that I like to
play and that being the actual first
mission with Franklin where he has to
repose a car alright so keep an eye on
SPS up here on the right hand corner
you'll get a good idea of what's
happening but look how smooth this is
this
there's no stutters whatsoever this
cat's a dick I'm going to go ahead and
you know yeah so even with all this
stuff just like maxed out look at the
FPS yeah of course it's going to
fluctuate depending on where you point
what's happening around you how big the
draw distance is in front of you indoors
outdoors the stuff has a huge effect on
game but I'm telling you right now while
I'm playing this the last thing I'm
thinking to myself is oh those pew of
smokes either when I'm just zooming
through the city right here it this is
just so incredibly smooth there's
jitter there's no stuttering everything
no matter what I do is just I'm not
thinking about the frames per second
when you have a you've all experiences
I'm sure if you have a piece of hardware
that's just not performing as good as it
needs to for what you are doing it's
very noticeable you'll notice dips in
fps you'll notice sudden delays in
rendering you'll notice hiccups I've not
experienced that at all in the last
several days that actually had a chance
to sit down play games on this and just
experience it now yes I know guys this
is not just a gaming CPU but that's
obviously what we're talking about today
this is we already know this is a
production monster we already know that
this is keeping up with the 59 60 X
which is essentially the same thing as a
69 hundred K and that again was over
$1000 CPU you cannot deny that this CPU
is extremely well rounded all right so
this part we got to run from the cops
whoa hello keys clearly they have
modeled LAPD appropriately no offense to
any LAPD officers maybe in the audience
my cousin is a FTO for LAPD so yeah I
can say that I can say that like I say
in the matrix getting on the freeway is
suicide when it comes to trying to get
away from the cop that maintenance gang
cat I mean this right here the perfect
example of just how fast a the CPU is
actually able to keep up with the world
that whoa did he get dizzy I never
realized that before if he actually gets
dizzy like that
ooh yes okay get get Oh he flipped me
off do you think you're doing oh man the
third time this week what are you
looking at into the tree here now do is
one of those games that the Vulkan API
is just freakin amazing I'm going to
turn to the vertical sync off
anti-aliasing is on SMA a motion blur is
on medium field of view that 90 we have
Vulcan everything is on ultra overall
quality I'm not running any of the
nightmare stuff so you can see the FPS
up there in the corner so let's go ahead
and resume this game I mean I am
absolutely obsessed Vulcan I wish we
could get more teams with Vulcan man
everybody would be able to just have
ridiculously amazing FPS assist if you
will look at this FPS appear and I want
you to remember I don't even think that
this game is currently even using both
graphics cards is it no it's not what
you're seeing right now is what is one
graphics card this is so smooth I owe
this big guy so yeah I think upwards of
200 FPS in Doom on ultra is it's pretty
acceptable to me now although what
you've seen right here is just a small
sampling of some games at 1080p with a
couple of high horsepower GPUs in SLI
which I just want to point out to a lot
of people said SLI doesn't work on the
1800 X very well as you can see it's
working just fine but I digress
the a lot of people have taken the
results that some reviewers have shown
who had the time to compare it to a KB
Lake and have said that this CPU does
not hold up to the single thread or
IPC's of something like a 7500 K 7600 K
47:17 4790 stuff like that whatever
that's fine
because that's true this CPU is not as
powerful in single thread performance so
you're going to get better gaming
performance by how much really depends
on the game it depends on a lot of
factors your graphics cards the clock
you're running graphics card at the
clock you're running your seat to use
that but here's the problem with the
proverbial circle-jerk that's happening
amongst haters right now is the 7700 K
cannot come anywhere near
and professional workflow now that
professional workflow being all kinds of
things virtual machines editing
programming live streaming live
rendering video encoding the 7700 K
although is okay at those it is worse at
those than this CP is worse cpu is worse
at gaming if that makes sense the 7700 K
does a worse job at professional
workflow then this cpu does at gaming
has a very marginal difference about ten
percent between the 7700 K and this cpu
even when the CPU is overclocked then
what you're going to get on the IPC
performance of more mainstream but this
cpu gives you something that we needed
for a long time which is a sepia that
gives you a well-rounded experience this
this CPU is like Mario in Mario Kart
he's not the fastest he doesn't turn
best doesn't jump the highest
but dama he's good at all three and
that's exactly what Rison is and that's
exactly what we needed in this community
and I'm really hoping and holding out
for optimization improvements across the
board I already said that in my last
video and it's going to happen it's just
it needs to happen quick because time
now is AMD's enemy how long this takes
to happen is going to determine how much
market share AMD can get back with this
cpu now the reason why I also did not
turn off SMT on this or so simultaneous
multi-threading and turning it into a
rise in five is because this also has
twice the cache of what a rise in five
is going to have rather than five is
going to have eight megabytes of cache
this has 16 so it's still not a very
fair comparison that were real life
comparisons what you're going to get
with rise on 5 so we did have to wait
for those ok those are supposed to come
in q2 not too long from now we're about
to hit q2 pretty soon here but anyway
guys this video was just talking to the
people who were concerned about buying
this CPU because they want to do all
kinds of things and maybe start a
YouTube channel or maybe start live
streaming but they were going to be
concerned that their gaming experience
was just going to be utter because
that's what reddit said it's not it's
not it's not it's not the best but
it's not crap but it's the best CPU that
you can get for 500 bucks right now that
can do it all the way I see it a lot of
people seem to forget to the 7700 K is
also faster
then the 6900 k in games but I don't see
people throwing together lynch mobs over
Intel's price of the 69 hundred K versus
the 7700 K maybe people have just gotten
used to being bent over backwards by
Intel's pricing who knows
time will tell guys thanks for watching
today's video hope it's answered some
questions regarding the gaming stuff
this is going to be an ongoing
discussion for awhile
thanks for watching I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
