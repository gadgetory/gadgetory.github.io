haven't been in here in a while I'm
happy to be back out here because it
means I'm gonna build something I have
it seriously it's been weeks since I've
been out here and you know what I'm
rejuvenated I'm energized again we're
gonna do some cool stuff today because
you guys remember this computer back
here this is the one I did a few weeks
back where I showed cleaning this out
cuz he was having problems with his
system and I talked about giving him at
an 80 and all that stuff I'm gonna pimp
his PC he's been traveling for work for
the last four weeks he's not been home
he's been dying to game this computer's
been aging a little bit the 2700 K it's
about four years old and you know what I
said in my I quit my job for YouTube
video that I had a friend that I always
had coffee with who really helped me out
with making the decision to go
self-employed this is his computer this
this computer belongs to the guy that's
responsible for the channel growing like
it is and me taking that leap of faith
so I'm gonna pimp this PC he doesn't
know this is coming and by the time you
guys see this video he would have
already received hit and I'll probably
take make some video of him getting it
but I decided what better way to pay it
back to him for really helping me out
than to make his PC freakin badass so
that's what we're gonna do today so what
you think you know I'll be honest I'm uh
kind of impressed by its proportions I
know right alright let me show you
something here
I kind of like the thin ones but this
one is about form-factor yeah but mine
can fit in tight spaces with girth you
could open tight spaces it's like a
master key whether you like thick or
thin the ITX lineup from fractal design
is sure to have something that tickles
your fancy remember it's not the size
that matters it's all about how you use
it not it's definitely the girth no
Fitness Garrett David scare
no contest no there's contest it's good
okay so parts why my out of breath I
think I'm excited about this I love
building things to give to people
especially when it's a surprise and they
don't know it like I did for coconut
monkey when I built him the 5820k well
he built himself a 5820k system so I've
got lots of stuff available to me as you
can see here now I thought about giving
him my 59 30 K now that my 59 60 X is
available to put on the test bench but I
think I'm gonna give him a 60 700 K
instead because all he does this game he
doesn't do professional editing or
anything like that and a 6700 K is gonna
be a much better system for him and I
actually Billy or not I've got to
deliver this system tonight I'm having
dinner with him tonight and it's like
almost noon or whatever I haven't even
started this build and I've gotta go to
gym at 4:00 and then going his place
right after I am at a time okay I'm
talking I'm gonna do a 6700 K I'm gonna
give him 16 gigs of DDR 4 he's already
got a 1080 I gave him the 1080 we're
gonna take everything out of his phantom
case that he's got we're gonna put it in
the fractal design defined s I think
that would be a really good build and
for motherboard I think I'm gonna give
him the oh you guys my butt my butt
showing no it's not okay that's fine I'm
gonna give him the z170 classified oh
you know I can't use this board crap the
defined s doesn't support EA t X all
right then I guess that means he's
getting the X power gaming titanium
Edition here this was actually going to
go in the DG 87 build which I'm still
working on my god I'm behind on build so
but I want to do really custom stuff for
that so we're going to take this out of
that system and then we are going to
will put the 59 30 K I think in the DG
87 build so one swap aroo-whoo is
happening here oh and for memory um what
do I got over here yeah we'll do that
we'll give him well give him 16 gigs of
DDR 4G skill right there all right
let's build it okay quick change of
plans I'm actually going with the EVGA
for the wind motherboard because it's a
standard ATX size and believe it or not
he is a bigger EVGA fan than me he's the
guy who introduced me to EVGA back when
I got my first 6000 series GP I think
was a 6600 gtk oh I think
us I know for a fact that a 7600 G TKO
but I had one before that as well so
he's the guy who introduced me to EVGA
and seeing as he's such a big fan I'm
gonna go ahead and give him we're going
getting this guy
and
alrights done pretty simple build talk
about parts here real quick and why I
built it for him as I said he's a huge
EVGA fan he's a guy who turned me on to
the company back years ago so anyway I
just used as much EVGA stuff as I could
that I already had so I put my EVGA 1084
the wind card in there yes the ones
about the thermal pads on all that stuff
but I have confidence it's not gonna
blow up or I wouldn't give it to him
anyway it's got my ek predator 360 in
there which is more than enough cooling
for the 6700 K in there which is
overclocked to four point five gigahertz
nothing crazy I wanted something stable
and reliable for him I put some white
LED BitFenix fans in there to 140 s in
the front and a 120 in the rear my EVGA
1050 G gold or 80 plus gold power supply
more than enough power for this I want
him to be able to add another one if he
wants to later when it comes to graphics
cards 16 gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws
for memory I took the labels off those
that's why they're all black did that
long time ago Z 174 the wind motherboard
from EVGA and then I put in there a
kingston savage 960 gigabyte SSD to
replace his 240 gig SSD which was
completely full and then I moved over
his 1 terabyte storage drive over to
this computer and they'll all have to do
for the other computer now is get
himself a mass storage drive for that
and then he has another working computer
so I didn't take anything out of the
other computer with the exception of the
one hard drive everything else you see
here is completely new and couple
reasons why I did that he wants his wife
wants to play games with him too but
they only have one computer and a laptop
he had told me he had hoped that he'd be
able to keep this computer together when
he built a new one and didn't want to
savage parts from the white build
because he wanted to be able to his wife
use it so that's why I made the decision
to build a standalone computer instead
of upgrading that one I'm going to talk
about the real reason why I built this
for him he is the most selfless person I
know I've been friends with him for
nearly a decade he has devoted so much
time to helping me build this business
on the back end and he never asks for
anything in return
ever he has Crohn's disease he's had
since he was 13 and he's 30 now that is
a terrible disease to have man it I
don't wish that upon my worst enemy but
you
also got like a couple years ago
contracted West Nile
who the heck gets West Nile but he got
it but he never complains he never asked
for anything he does anything for
anybody let me tell you a little bit
about this guy here he and his wife his
wife is a doctor of education they have
spent the last five years putting
together a charter school designed
specifically for group home kids to be a
gateway to college they want to see
group home kids not be left behind they
want to see them be given a chance to
many group home kids are written off as
lost causes because they have too many
problems growing up so they're just not
a productive member of society and they
think that's it's a big deal in
this school is opening next year but
here's the thing for the last probably
two and a half three years I've heard
him say on many occasions he wants to
build a fast computer he wants to build
a new computer and he puts aside the
money but then something happens and he
ends up having to use the money on
something else like so many people the
money usually gets dumped into the
school or things they need to buy or
purchase or do to get the accreditation
for the school so his money is tied up
with that his wife as I mentioned as a
doctor of education earlier this year
she contracted some sort of a inner ear
infection that made her completely deaf
in her right ear and now they're doing
experimental procedures to dry and
brewing her hearing back so the money he
had set aside and was ready to do his
build he's like Jay I got the money we
can do this has now gone towards medical
expenses for that so once again had no
money so you know what it was an easy
decision for me to decide to do this
he's a guy that does everything for
everybody else never asks for a thing
and I just wanted to give something back
to him I'm gonna take this computer to
him and then I'm going to present it to
him I'll record his reaction and I'll
decide during editing whether or not
it's worth putting up he may or may not
want that up there but I'm telling you
nicest guy in the world he deserves this
so hopefully we get a good reaction out
of him but anyway time to go we'll do
that anyway I don't know what I'm gonna
say next so I guess I'm just gonna go
ahead and push the record button on here
all right cool you're back
so you might notice we have two squares
here Oh Mike how what did you do what's
in this it's a new case my god know what
else did you do it it is a brand new
computer
it's a brand new computer what'd you put
in it
oh just little stuff like six seven okay
okay you power supply one Giga SSD Jesus
well screw you thank you buddy
well that one still works yeah it's
still fully functional and I figured
with how much you do for everyone else
it's time for somebody just up nice for
you
thank you ma'am yeah uses are you know
this is an unbelievable thank you so
much so now we have to hook it up and
see what you think about it can i cloned
that computer so everything on this is
already fully functional yeah oh my god
let's do it we hit the hits do it yeah
hey sweetie you're gonna have your own
this song tripper is yours
Wow amazing this is that super fusion
want to build cuz he had for me
you are not putting me on this you're a
jerk deal it thank you thank you
unbelievably submitting this video right
now I just want to say one more thing I
know he looked very awkward on camera he
was not expecting that he was literally
caught off guard and completely
speechless which made me feel that much
better moral the story here guys he
deserves it and if I could make
someone's life a little bit better than
it's worth doing if you guys can make
someone's life a little bit better then
do it alright guys I'll see you the next
