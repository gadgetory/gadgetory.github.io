respond to emails and comments and
things that tend to you know kind of
feel my channel so I know what to make
and I get an idea of what people want to
see and usually I get it well wrong I
don't know I guess content here kind of
sucks even if the comments seem to be a
little bit trollee
if you guys can learn something from the
video then heck I'll go ahead and do it
I'll respond to the trolls
but anyway let's be honest here we're
about to try today could go very very
wrong
and I don't want it to but it could but
I kind of want it to because then it
probably get more views but anyway I
digress
so believe me when I say that you really
don't want to try this at home and if
you do and you mess up your stuff that's
on you not me you've been warned
I'm a professional professional new do
you like custom keyboards and
programming will add some good news for
you because the good folks over at mass
drop have a long term drop going for the
ergo Docs
ergonomic keyboard kit available in
various switch types and is 100% custom
programmable the drop is active right
now and will run until May 22nd with an
expected ship date of August 25th sound
cool well you know what to do check out
the link down in the description so in
my last video which you guys can see
right here if you haven't seen it yet if
you've already seen it you're awesome
watch it again because that'll make you
more awesome I installed the water
blocks on the three 980ti is that are
being installed inside of project red
mist and you guys had a lot of
interesting things to say obviously
about that video was just which is fine
which is good but I think one of the
most resounding things people had to say
was something along the lines of damn
bro
thermal paste much I mean seriously
there were a lot of those comments
now several years back Logan at Tech
Syndicate did a how to apply thermal
paste video in fact I even did one when
I first started YouTube there are tons
and tons of how to apply thermal paste
videos and most recently Luke over at
Linus tech tips also did a video where
he showed the different styles and did
back-to-back comparisons to see if they
made any sort of real difference and the
only conclusion that could be drawn was
the only thing that matters mostly is
whether or not you have too little too
much doesn't hurt your cooling it could
hurt your motherboard components you
know if you were to take a conductive
cool thermal paste and spread it out and
start touching capacitors and other
diodes and solder points and but
for the most part it doesn't hurt your
cooling now the common thread all of
those videos including my old one have
in common is the fact that if talking
about CPU thermal paste and obviously
you don't want to spread that too far
over the edge of the actual heat
spreader because then it could get down
into your socket which is going to lead
to a very bad day so I got me thinking
we should really visit this topic when
it comes to GPUs but with a J's $0.02
twist may have noticed I had a benchmark
running behind me the entire time I've
been doing this video in fact it's been
running for over a half-hour right now
it's a gtx 680 EVGA I believe it's a for
the wind card it's actually the sixth
pin and the eight pin not the six and
six but anyway I digress it's been
running for a while now so that we can
get our baseline temperatures to see how
well the card is actually cooling in its
stock form with its blow or cooler as
you can see right there and it is
running right now at 76 C balancing
between 76 and 77 it's been running for
a half hour it's not getting any hotter
than that
so with that baseline out of the way
let's take the card off let's take it
apart now let's have some have some
science time it's kind of like science
week in January but in April okay so I'm
gonna revise that a little bit the
absolute max temperature at least
according to precision was 78 and that's
where it kind of like peak every now and
then they go beep beep beep beep like
could pop up in there yeah
78 so we're gonna see if it gets any
worse than that I guess transition
I think one of the most alarming things
I read in my recent comments was the
amount of people saying what the amount
of thermal paste you used it's going to
squeeze over to the sides and it's going
to touch the side of the GPU pins and
stuff and it's going to totally short it
out and the reason why that concerns me
is I think the people saying that I've
pretty much never taken a GPU apart
otherwise they would realize that that's
exactly how it is from the factory oh my
god the pace is touching all those pins
no in theory that should be good enough
to prove my point that touching the
little solder points around this GPU
core like that is not going to be a
problem although this is a J's $0.02
video and so I am going to do all sorts
of things that are going to make you
cringe well again for the sake of
science why not
holy hell my fingers are dirty even I'm
touching them I'm touching it oh I'm
touching the prm's oh crap oh eh I've
certainly killed this board now look I'm
even flexing the board like that without
flexing it left flexes it's a flexi
board wobble wobble so I'm gonna do the
exact same you know kind of an X with a
cross method that I did in the video
that you guys were complaining about
because remember this is exactly the way
that UK recommends that this go on with
their block yeah that looks like a lot
of pace right holy hell oh that is so
much bass no I just spit somewhere yeah
I just spit on there there that looks
pretty good this is a J's $0.02 video so
you know it's gotta go all out yeah I
get in there oh yeah yeah nice and there
get in there oh boy yeah miss a spot no
miss was about there - oh man certainly
killed this card now huh and with the
help
look at that oh man are you cringing yet
don't forget the plug in your fan when
reassembling your cards kids yeah I say
kids I know who's watching this video I
know who's watching right now even the
birds are pissed off the birds are like
what the
Jay why did you do that well oh oh oh
thank God I thought to be like crap I
 up you know it's funny about that
that 29c Idol on the graphics card that
went down three degrees down three
degrees from when when I started this
test that's funny
let's do some see some Haven all right
we got the good old heaven test running
same exact test we used last time so
let's let this thing run for a little
bit and see what happens so far we're
sitting at 48 see 49 it takes a little
bit for the the 680 to cool or don't to
warm up that Kepler though man Kepler
for the win all right it's been running
for a while now and I know people aren't
gonna believe me but it came down it
came down in temperature compared to
before it's at 74 see so let's go ahead
and let's quit out of heaven and let's
see what a max temperature 75 you see
that right there
max temp 75 mofos it came down three
degrees Celsius now what okay now I
don't know about you guys but I'm a
little bit interested to see exactly how
far the thermal paste spread out now
there's a point to this whole video so
hang with me and and we'll get there
eventually
oh yeah it's so stringy that's what she
said
well it's pretty obvious that like every
single square millimeter of that socket
is covered in thermal paste now at this
point I'd like to have a serious chat
here obviously this was all theatrics
and a bit excessive to prove a very
basic point as long as your compound is
non conductive you're not going to cause
any damage to the pins around the GPU
and the reason why you want to use
what would probably be considered a
liberal amount of thermal paste on your
GPU is affect that there is no heat
spreader on the GPU that is the cover of
the die which on CPUs you have a heat
cover or a heat spreader that will touch
that to spread the heat out even more
which is why you can get away with the
corners and stuff not necessarily being
touched by thermal compounds on a CPU
but you can't get away with that as well
on a GPU I've had issues before where
I've used two little pastes and not
gotten all the way to the edges and
ended up having to take the entire water
block apart and put more thermal paste
on so I personally tend to get a little
bit liberal with that thermal paste
because I want it to flow over the edge
of the die and get as much coverage as
possible now obviously I showed you even
the even the OEM is when they put these
together have excessive amounts of
thermal paste that touches these little
pins so everyone in the comments that
was screaming like oh my god the thermal
compound is going to be touching the
pins and it's going to shoot out your
GPU and the world is going to explode
that's only partially true if you are
using a conductive thermal compound
which is a lot less today than it used
to be like Arctic silver used to become
conductive it's not anymore but if you
use the thermal compounds that are non
conductive and come with your GPU blocks
they are safe and you're not going to
have any sort of an issue no obviously I
don't recommend this and obviously I use
my 680 because I was too to
try it with one of my 980ti is to prove
the point because let's face it there's
always that slight chance something
could go wrong
thanks for watching today's video I hope
we proved the point and and its face I
know someone's probably already typed
this before watching to the end of the
video which should teach you a lesson
don't comment before the end of the
video I'm aware that the reason why the
temperatures probably came down with all
of this gunk on here is simply because
it was new thermal compound and given
the fact that this graphics card is
going on what four years old very are
three and a half years old something
like that could have very well just been
the fact that the other compound was
hard and this is fresh and giving a
better bond but obviously I proved that
too much doesn't affect that bond as
much does it anyway I'm going to get out
of here now guys check out my second
channel um link is in the description
it's my cars and vlogs channel it's
actually growing really fast I'm really
happy with that where I do talk about
Mizzy and work on the car
just vlogs and random stuff but make
sure you guys tune in next week where I
show you the proper methods of how to
use isopropyl alcohol to clean off the
old thermal paste on your CPUs am i
doing it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
