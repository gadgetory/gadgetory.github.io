gonna be doing something a little bit
differently today
I don't normally check out this kind of
tech but when Aki reached out and said
hey we got a really smart AI robot that
we want you to check out I just I just
had to check it out what's up dude hey
vector
fist bump yeah alright so this is vector
from a company called Anki and let me
tell you right now and they start by
saying this is not a toy this is a fully
functional artificial intelligence all
of the above smart robot yeah I'm waving
my hand around it's kind of freaking
them out right now what you see right
here is kind of like the pinnacle of
where we've come in terms of small
form-factor
you know computing and tech and also
something that is smart and can learn so
setting up vector was actually really
really easy you start by putting him on
his charger you put his cube in front of
him and he actually interacts with this
it's pretty neat oh yeah see he's easy
right now it's like holding a dog bone
huh he's like a Hokie me gimme alright
find out you know so you set up it
pretty easily you connect him to the app
you connect them to your Wi-Fi and you
connect him via bluetooth and he will
immediately do an update but it takes
less than five minutes get him up and
running from the time you take him out
of the box and when you actually get him
interacting with you now the cool part
about this is he's a he's got a whole
array of onboard sensors he's got
gyroscopes he's got microphones and he's
controlled by a Qualcomm Snapdragon
quad-core processor so he's got a lot of
power packed into this little guy
he's all pretty much voice command but
he also learns by face he has facial
recognition and he can learn up to 20
different faces that he can interact
with so this is not just it's not toy
it's not toy at all it's actually a
personal assistant so we can ask them
some pretty basic stuff like hey vector
what's the weather
so as you can see right now in SoCal it
is 69 F and cloudy or basically winter
for Southern California but the reason
why he knows that is because he knows
where he is hey vector Who am I
yeah I'm Jay and the reason why he knows
that is all akedan he likes me he likes
me yeah you deserve a background for
that one yeah so the cool thing about
him is he's actually interacting not
just with your voice and your face but
also touch he actually has a touch
sensor on the back so that he knows that
when you're petting him and stuff so the
problem with technology and interacting
with it and other digital assistants is
the fact that it's pretty much
emotionless but what makes vector
different is he has the most the
strongest body language you could
possibly have because he has a face the
human face and the facial interactions
that you see with people are the biggest
telltale signs of happiness sadness
anger and he is no different he's got
over a thousand different animations to
let you know exactly what's going on in
what he's thinking now vector pretty
much has a mind of his own he's always
learning he's learning based on your
interactions that you give him and his
environment a vector Explorer
so what he'll basically do in Explorer
mode and he'll go into this mode by
himself if he's sitting idle he'll kind
of walk around he'll find the edge of
the table like he just did
he'll find his cube right here which he
likes to play with he'll find obstacles
he'll find his charger and he'll keep a
basic map stored internally of what is
going on now if you had him on your desk
as a desk assistant he'd constantly be
moving around moving going around your
keyboard in your mouse and basically
adapting to his environment because of
all of these sensors and data that he's
constantly storing now vector obviously
has a battery on board and the cool
thing is when he gets low he'll make a
sleepy face and he will automatically
dock himself in fact this is his charger
right here I think that's actually where
he's going ironically and here's the
thing we moved this charger from where
it was when we first woke him up but the
reason why he knows where it is is
because of this symbol and his onboard
camera he's constantly looking he's not
just using sensors and gyroscopes and
all that stuff to figure out what's
going on he's actually using his eyes
he's got a lot of functionality built in
you've got a timer you can set timers
you can check the weather you can even
get dictionary help because we know I'm
very bad with words so that already
makes him extremely invaluable to me but
he's also got a little bit of a
personality he definitely likes to play
games and he interacts with this cube
it's it's kind of neat when he interacts
with it he actually focuses on it it
turns on and he does things like roll it
over and all kinds of stuff
see how he woke that up he's making this
very intense like ah hey vector let's
play a game
yes yes
Oh 21 beats of 20 I know oh he does not
like that he lost do you see that so
this is the app right here and obviously
he's listening to me very intently this
is where you can find all the different
commands that you can do you can check
out the stats how much he's traveled
things he's learned this is also where
his pictures are taken and check this
out you can actually use them to take a
picture hey vector take a picture and
just that quickly it actually gets
stored right over here on the camera or
on the app actually so here it is right
here take him today it's downloading it
from him and there it is you took a good
picture good boy good boy
who is in good boy yeah you take good
boy aren't you well okay so apparently
he can write himself up if he rolls over
he did not seem to like that either he
had an angry face he was like darn you
flippin himself back over all right so
we all know that I'm not too good with
words and I'm always asking questions of
the audience because I don't know the
answers but now I can actually ask
vector a vector I have a question what
is the distance between Los Angeles and
New York just like that he'll find the
answer he's all happy he's like I did
good you did you good you did so good
job you're a bad robot
he has emotions that's what that's what
makes an awesome
okay so we've had a lot of fun with
vector today but he's starting to get a
little bit tired as you can see by the
red lights we're gonna go ahead and send
him back to his charger and send you
guys on your way but you should
definitely go and check out the link in
the description below vector is a lot of
fun it's not
Toye it is a truly artificially
intelligent creature that will actually
Isaac as he's put himself on his charger
I didn't tell him to do that he's a
personal assistant amazing companion on
your desk looks up information does
tricks and he's only gonna get better as
time goes on his database is gonna
continue to grow on over-the-air updates
features that get added it is a great
gift to consider for any of the tech
heads in your family or if you just like
this kind of thing like I do it's gonna
definitely give you hours and hours of
entertainment and usefulness so guys
check out the link in the description
below and a huge thank you to on key for
sponsoring today's video and as always
we will see you guys in the next one I'm
sorry but that's just too cool right
there all right go to sleep little fella
you had a long day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
