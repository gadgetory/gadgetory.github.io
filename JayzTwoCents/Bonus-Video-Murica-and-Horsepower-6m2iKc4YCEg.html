guys said you wanted more car content
and I'm gonna bring you some car stuff
as you can see we've got a really
beautiful one in the background we'll
talk about that in a sec it has been
more than a year since I showed you guys
my zeal 1:1 le and that was when it was
still a hundred percent bone-stock washy
no I take that back it had a roto fab
intake but that's still pretty much
stuck and I did some track stuff with it
but since then and I always said I was
gonna make a video about the car because
of all the mods of stuff we did to it I
just never did so it's been almost a
year and a half since I've had this car
we're gonna talk about it because today
we're over here at red barn racing we've
got my friends behind us here in his
beautiful 68 Camaro drag car we are just
getting a checkup because it's been
about 10,000 miles since we will I say
we since he ripped the engine apart did
some mods the cam all that sort of stuff
we're gonna do some checks some valve
nut ballast springs but rocker bolts and
all that crap
heap up not pretend like I know what I'm
talking about here to make sure all that
stuff's within spec and then we'll talk
about the mods and and what this car
does and why I did what I did so yeah
let's get to it
you know what guys I got new merch it's
available now karma calm /jc sense we
got zip up hoodies we got tri-blend we
got a new logo I digress
since 2012 but the rest logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys we
all kinds of stuff zip up hoodies
beanies polos don't take my word for it
cuz obviously I can't do this edie so
just look in the description below and
you guys will find the link Thanks
alright so this is my 20 1801 1ld if
you're not familiar with what all that
means zl1 is just the trim package
between it's got the LT 4 supercharged
6.2 liter v8 the 1ld is a suspension
slash track package that has to do with
the DSS be dynamic spool valve dampers
for multimatic it's got the additional
arrow in the front it's got the arrow
and the back office lis it's got wire
wheels
fluid wire fender on the front not so
much as the fenders
the mounts for it are so it gives us an
extra inch of clearance on either side
I'm obviously running a different wheel
in factory these are HRE
RC 104 s which is a lightweight forged
racing wheel so I'm running those
obviously four tires these are these are
getting kind of cycled out but these are
Toyo are Triple A DARS
my factory wheels actually have a set of
Michelin Pilot Sport cup 2 s which I'm
not a fan of to be honest at least on
the street yeah and for those of you
that are kind of wondering - yes it is a
manual as you can see right there
because when I bought this car it was
not available in automatic nor would I
have gotten one anyway because I want
the distro driving experience - a manual
with his car but as of today you can get
a 1 le with a manual which I are at
automatic which I kind of feel isn't
atrocity I think Mike might agree with
that sentiment that an automatic one
Elite is just kind of weird Road race
car so anyway when it comes to this car
you can see I've still got the factory
blower it's not ported it's got the
factory sized throttle body but port it
throttle body for airflow not for volume
or opening up that Inlet or the Firefly
on there
we do have American Racing one in 70s
long tube headers which are not ceramic
coated we're probably gonna do that next
it just kind of sucks them in and do it
at the time of the build because then
you have to take them out obviously roto
fab cold air intake gates belt a catch
can here this is a custom catch can that
was made by a company that Cunningham
Motorsports had making these for them
cooling mods we are running a CNR racing
radiator was just quite a bit more
volume than factory but we're also
running a pro type of pro speed right
yeah pro speed intercooler for the
supercharger which is about twice the
volume of the factory but further
testing is shown that that was just sort
of an insurance move in terms of temps
are not really any better than the
factory one this just helps us with heat
soak for long track sessions and stuff
like that in terms of the engine we are
running a custom ground cam I don't know
the specs on it they were just specs
that match the package that was put in
here does have additional fuel load
though because
are running a DSX fuel system with a
flex fuel sensor in here and we do have
85 and we are running 10% ATI lower
pulley to overdrive the supercharger and
the Kim had a bunch of supporting mods
ahead to go along with it so we've got
hardened push rods titanium valve
springs anything else that goes along
the belt ring it's actually a Polish
valve spring of the titanium retainer
okay so Paul files being two teen
retainers that gives it that just smooth
is a slide smoother right that's just
compressing yeah the hard part and push
rods oh right right because as you're
increasing the the lift and duration on
the on the cam and it's got extra forces
on it you don't want those kind of
binding or bending obviously and then we
have the phase lock out before the cam
because the whole cam would phase shift
as sort of a variable valve but not
really the whole cam just sort of move
right yes so we've locked that out so
that's no light that's why idle so damn
loud because it's the same valve and
duration at all rpms right right okay so
that's why the stock car was much
quieter at idle because that valve the
cam was shifting to are phasing - I
guess lower the duration when it didn't
need it open up the throttle the camera
move right yes okay and then it is all
tuned using HP tuners Oh for the catback
it is American Racing we do have
American Racing catalytic converters in
here for the street you can see them
right there because I'm not a fan of the
1971 dump truck smell when I am running
gasoline which I rarely run in this car
but also to to keep the noise down to
smooth it out a little bit but what I do
Road race it I do that test nights that
go in there to remove those cats you
can't check between each one yeah I just
kind of take a random sample look for
anything some of the Sun metal shaving
will always be normal
but what I'm looking for is really
chunks chunks is a bad thing right
especially if you get anything brass
color cuz usually brass colors normally
camshaft stuff or non camshaft but
barring yeah that's pretty good cleaner
help billow up there cool so I know one
of the common question this video is
gonna be is Jay how much power you make
in the funny thing is I don't truly know
the answer to that question because when
Mike dyno the car last year we had a
couple of issues that were happening at
the time that we made the run so
Cunningham Motorsports at the time no
longer in business technically as a
build shop anymore they're tuning
service now they have a Mustang dyno
which is a kind of middle ground in
terms of being heartbreaker I think
dynapac is the lowest Dyna jet is the
gym most generous in terms of numbers
must thing kind of fits somewhere in the
middle but all dinos can be tuned or
calibrated to to look great or look
terrible it doesn't it doesn't what
doesn't what matters is the baseline
versus the after the build so I did have
Mike do a baseline on this and on the
Mustang dyno at baseline 529 wheel
horsepower stock for 650 horsepower car
factory at the crank it worked out to
about 15% drivetrain loss so what we
what do we died no six ninety nine or
seven in the dot after yeah I think it
was six ninety nine yeah but the thing
was it was a hundred and eight degree
day it was a hundred over a hundred
degrees ambient temp in the shop when he
did it and we had a clogged supercharger
brick where the IITs were just going
through the roof during the dyno pull
and on these cars just like most cars as
the intake temp goes up timing gets
pulled because of predetonation so we're
pretty positive that with all of that
fixed and the cooling mods I've made now
and how low my IAT stay I'm probably
making a good solid 20 ish more wheel
horsepower than that day possibly upward
into the 30s because I think the IAT
said something like 180 at the end of
that pool but we do know we picked up
170 wheel horsepower versus the baseline
with the intake overheating so yeah your
guess is as good as mine is how much
it's really making but if we take that
15% drivetrain loss into effect with 170
wheel horsepower so you take 170 and add
0.15 to that we're alike
845 crank which I'll take that's fun by
the way to put it it's fun but it's
starting to feel slow and that's the
problem so I wanted to run a colder
thermostat so I'm running a 160 in here
I know some people can be like why are
you running a 160 what's the point in
that well the oil in this car is cooled
by the coolant so the coolant has some
diversion diverter lines that go to the
actual oil pen on the side of the oil
pan as a cooler core that the oil is
pumped through and so instead of
bringing the oil out of the pan through
a radiator like a lot of cars do and
then back to the pan it just brings the
coolant to the pan
well that's extra heat being dumped into
the cooling system so that's why we have
to bake see in our radiator that's why
we're also running this ls3 style
thermostat housing which bolts right up
to the water pump right here and so we
can run ls3 style thermostats which have
a huge selection versus the lt4 style
where the thermostat is part of the
housing and it's a plastic out of it so
it's just another one of those things
where I took points of failure that I've
experienced in the past especially where
they're plastic and upgraded them to try
and deal with any potential failures in
the future especially for road racing so
when you're visually inspecting right
now what is it you're looking for it
really a lot of it is just for anything
that is out of place like looking at the
end caps here for the rocker arms to
make sure that you don't have one of the
trunnions coming apart well with a exalt
if we're and stuff like that we're gonna
pull somebody's off and take a peek at
and then we also gonna look at the foul
springs to make sure that there's no
cracking breaking any kind of unusual
signs of metal shavings or anything like
that coming from them
so you look at where the rocker end hits
the spring and stuff mm-hmm
let's hang it there it's just shiny and
really what you're looking out doing
right now geing uh excessive heat
anything like that it'll it'll
physically turn the tips blue oh so like
a non-exhaustive titanium yep are these
titanium or aluminum no these are
actually steel oh yeah these are
actually steel so is it just the valves
under titanium in O'Neill t4s yeah it's
just the intake valve and then this is
actually a lash cap here and so and that
protects the titanium tip nicely you
don't put those back on it's very bad
well it also accounts for the thickness
of that too right in terms of all the
measurements
yeah well the titanium is a very strong
material but it doesn't take contact
very well right so whenever it takes
contact like that it basically just goes
right through it so one of the reasons
why I have Mike doing this checkup is
because one like I said it's been over a
year since we modified this car actually
just barely over a year I was at
Computex last year in Taiwan when they
had the car so I was like well the best
way to distract myself from the work
they're doing on the car and being
impatient and wanting it back is just go
overseas so they had the car while I was
out of the country and one of the things
I noticed with the long tube headers and
then with the new cam and all that stuff
was that valvetrain noise is really loud
versus what it was factory so a I don't
know if it's placebo or what but because
I haven't been driving the car nearly as
much the last six months as I did the
first six months driving it around my
brain goes this sounds louder to me like
it got louder or something and I
remember Mike telling me when I asked
him what's a sign that we're dealing
with excess cam where he said you'll
start hearing louder lifter noise and
valve train noise so I just went well
it's time to do the checkup
might as well at least have him give it
a clean bill of health and do this
inspections because this car is an
investment I don't really want to talk
pricing I mean you can look at how much
this car is by itself then you can kind
of figure how much was spent and mods
alone that's a big investment and I want
it to to last me more
than a year we'll talk about the 68 over
here for a sec this is a fully
custom-built ls7 and it's anything it's
its na 99.1 35 and the quarter naturally
aspirated but the crazy thing about this
car there's a lot more steel on this car
than a modern car which makes people
automatically think old muscle cars like
this are just big heavy boats 3,100
pounds with him in it and fuel that's
race weight and so what the way he has
this thing geared the way he has it
dialed the transmission set up most of
that quarter mile time is what 60 foot
and the eight mile is just you're flying
right if you go and watch videos of his
you guys can go you can find him on
Instagram under red barn racing and
you'll find videos of this at the track
and it pulls the wheels up it pulls the
wheels up as an NA car yeah it's full
drag set up drag suspension obviously
it's got it's considered a it's a full
slip right but it's considered a street
tire a small drag tires I was a drag
radial yeah so it's not even a full drag
flick and he's pulling the wheels up
it's got a skinnies up front the hood is
something that's been talked about a bit
whether or not you're gonna paint it or
leave it with that old school when alley
black kind of a deal you know with the
speed and the quarter-mile times he puts
down with this you got to show it off
with a big cowl you know what they say
about guys with big Cal's
they've got fast cars the interior on
this is pretty sick B&amp;amp;M shifter even
smells nice in here doesn't smell like a
junkyard car like some cars even though
they're like nice like this they still
smell like an old car you know I mean
this has that this has that classic
Chevy smell but I assume a lot of this
is probably the cleaners and stuff you
use on the seats all the leather
conditioners and stuff
now speaking of valve springs and size
this is looks easily like double the
size of mine that's because that's a 632
cubic inch Chevy big-block I mean
compare it to his snap-on toolbox and
for scale yeah that's kind of looks like
a Magnuson supercharger sitting on top
of that yeah this right here well I
would twist the tit throw out the ball
yeah so so for the size comparison
that's the 632 right there that's an LS
the engine everyone's always like I'll
put it out last night but I know less
well there's an LS which literally looks
like a supercharger that would our root
style that would go on top of this guy
like if you just look at the size
comparison there
okay so clean bill the health of the car
Mike's gone through it check things like
the oil cope and the oil filter check
the catch can no oil in the catch can at
all no no so it means no blow by and I I
don't drive the car easy I don't drive
the car as hard as other people do so
here's the thing when it comes to
modified engines of modified cars I
think this mantra holds true with
regardless of what platform when you
start adding power there's things you
have to take into account with extra
preventive maintenance and regular
scheduled maintenance so what would you
say is the most important thing with a
modified engine that you need to stay on
top of oil changes and probably more
frequently than the 3,000 miles people
recommended three months 3,000 miles
change your oil it's it's way cheaper
than having to redo it no synthetics
will tell you now you can go 7,500 to
10k but that's not a good idea with a
modified engine exactly that does first
that's for factory stock clearances and
things of that nature and the most
factory oil temps exactly yeah exactly
and then where you really push on these
things like that little changes are
cheap oh yeah yeah if you think about
the investment into the engine you know
what's a hundred dollars worth of oil
you know exactly you know you probably
got probably about
underneath your head right now that you
didn't that suggest would be out of
pocket just replace them out or not
including Labor's and things like oh
yeah I think the BLT for long block I
think was fourteen thousand 999 if I
replaced the engine and heads exactly so
trying to think I mean we we kind of
went over the top with cooling and we
did cooling after the engine build so I
probably with all the cooling mods and
stuff
I know I said earlier I was gonna talk
to fries but I've got close to eighteen
to twenty thousand dollars under the
hood of this car in terms of labor and
everything too if I I I always talk
about DIY do-it-yourself I'm not an
expert and there are some very
particular tolerances and tuning and
setup that has to be done and I could go
in there and very easily know I can do a
cam swap and just destroy the engine
without doing something right yeah so
that's why I pay an expert like Mike to
do all that for me but we ended up going
with all the additional cooling in this
I've got like $5,000 worth of cooling
upgrades in this alone between the
radiator which was 1,100 bucks the CNR a
radiator we've got the pro speed heat
exchanger we got the pro speed fender
tank the thermostat like the thermostat
housing was like four hundred dollars by
itself that thing's insane fortunately
we got that for a lil bit cheaper but so
we got a lot of money in here in cooling
because with higher output of horsepower
higher heat output higher oil temps
higher coolant temps so I basically
every engine I've ever lost in the past
in terms of blowing up has been
temperature related so I told Mike I
said I'm going overboard on the cooling
on this because you there's no such
thing as over cooling the engine short
have taken out the thermostat and
letting it go open-loop right right but
there's no such thing as too much
cooling in terms of headroom but there's
certainly not enough and I don't want to
take a chance with that so anyway I just
want to take you guys kind of along for
the ride like I said if you want to
follow some crazy car stuff he puts a
lot of the builds that he works on on
Instagram so it's at red barn racing I
will put it down in the description
below you guys can click on that I've
showed pictures of this on my Instagram
as well
I Drive an hour and a half each way
every time he works on this car because
when I become comfortable with someone
touching my stuff you make the drive to
make sure that you don't have some
knucklehead coming in here thing
I can do this and then he blows it up so
we will probably later this year be
adding a little bit more power but
intelligently and it's probably just
gonna be through blower porting and and
stuff like that because I think dropping
another five or six thousand dollars on
a Whipple for my use case would be kind
of wasted money yeah so alright guys
we're gonna go if you want to see more
this kind of content then make sure you
hit us up so that we know you guys want
to see it and then go and check out the
Instagram as I mentioned down below
alright guys thanks we'll see you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
