those cases where I've got to get some
work done while also getting some work
done so we're gonna get some work done
today EVGA offers a full range of
components including video cards
motherboards power supplies cases and
peripherals regardless of your needs
EVGA sure to have you covered
to see what EVGA can do for your next
build head to EVGA calm so a lot of you
guys have asked me why the tests been to
start and look like it's being cooled by
a sperm bank and well you know there's
there's a few things to talk about here
so I figured I would do a video about
this because this has kind of been like
a long-term experiment you guys are
immortai built this back in like geez 20
beginning of 2016 the end of 2015
something that way back when this is a
over three years old now with all the
same components never having had a
proper flush there's been plenty of
times where I've just drained the fluids
out runs from distilled water through
the new fluids in its head view in it
it's had what's the other one the so it
started with like distilled water with
some colored dye in it then it ended up
having some of the Mayhem's pastel green
in there then we had some man's pastel
purple and then we went back to green
again and then we went to kind of a
clear fluid and then now we're back to
this this is we're not gonna talk about
a fluid this is though this was a test
product that was sent to me that was
still early early beta temperatures been
fine but we've had some issues with
falling out and stuff so we're gonna be
talking about this because it's not fair
to the product come or the brand to talk
about it because it was never ready for
primetime but what I have to do is I
have to flush the system and let me tell
you right now this is a concentrate I
have already put several gallons through
this system and I can't get it to turn
clear which has me feared that it might
be built up with some of the blocks and
stuff so I figured why don't we take
this opportunity to sort of take this
apart I've got to change out these tubes
so we've got some nice brand new Prima
fix primo chill flex tube here which is
a LRT which is non leeching and all that
sort of stuff so this fluid kind of
obviously is very milky but as you can
see the tubes are still pretty clear and
what's amazing about this is like I said
this is the original tubing I never
changed this tubing out so there are
some parts where it kind of discolored a
little bit you can kind of see right
there it's got some turned black or
something inside don't know exactly when
that happened because that was mostly
facing down so by rotating the fitting I
could see it but anyway I just want to
sort of tear this apart I'm gonna try
flushing it some more before I tear it
apart and then if I can't get it to turn
clear then I have no choice but to tear
it apart start running like hot water
through the loop like through the sink
or something cuz the heat will sometimes
break up the sediment and then start
running all of my cleaners to it all the
detergents and stuff to try and get
anywhere it's built up in this radiator
out of here but if we have to we'll take
the rat out take the fittings off kind
of peek in there and see what we've got
but first we have to see if we can
actually get it to turn clear that's
like step one it looks like it looks
like nonfat milk that's been left out in
the Sun in the summer
sounds like me after I eat some of the
zendaya burritos so if you guys want to
know how I flush my systems and clean
them out like when I'm doing it for
reals then check out my other videos
I've done this a million times I've
talked too many times about how I do
this it's just like it just doesn't turn
clear so since the hot water really
broke it up I'm gonna run the rest of
this distilled water through it and then
I'm gonna fill this jug with just really
hot water from the sink that's the first
time I filled this up right now and it
didn't like turn white immediately huh
but the question is is it gonna be
clearer than it was this is how a will
impregnates its partner we're gonna try
the hot water method it just gave dirty
why everyone's always asked me what
happens if you put alcohol in a loop
well I know if you leave it in there
long-term it's gonna damage the rubber
in the plastic but since we're changing
out the tubes anyway there's always we
don't let it sit there long enough to
hurt the plastics I don't think it'll
help clear or clean
take a smell like soapy vodka Oh
there's electrical plugs you're supposed
to use like a teaspoon all right so
after our weird concoction of dish soap
alcohol and system prep we we're not
seeing anymore pieces like break off of
the block and stuff so I think that
we've gotten pretty much just pouring it
everywhere I think we've gotten pretty
much everything we can break loose with
hot water and all that stuff pretty much
out of here so I'm gonna do now is I'm
just gonna finish flushing out the
system prep now with the rest of this
gallon of hot water and then we will go
ahead and tear it apart and see what the
inside the block looks like and all that
stuff all right we know it's gonna be
gross like you already seeing like the
threads like how much the dirts in there
oh yeah it sounds bad is it like could
have been all right so we got a little
bit of buildup inside the micro channels
not a lot though
I mean it's still there regardless it
comes apart like it it doesn't stick to
the stuff so like so as you can get it
to touch it you know all right I was
thinking I was just gonna throw a new
block on here but this is actually
looking all right we were joking around
off-camera talking about how I should do
a kress sponsorship brought to you by
Jays two cents so this is what the LRT
primo chill tubing looks like after more
than three years of continuous use with
a bunch of different fluids all kinds of
different makeups and not proper
cleaning happy some tell you what it
looks a lot better than I would have
thought but you can see where the bottom
of the tube was because it's discolored
more because a lot of that stuff in
sediment just sort of set on the bottom
so I it's clear on that side and darker
on that side but that's what new tubing
looks like so this this tube on the
right right or your left I guess right
here doesn't look as bad as some tubing
I've used for less than a year that had
bad plasticizers in there that would
leach and turn cloudy so this is
actually this is actually not looking
too bad so we're going to go ahead and
set up the outlet here from the
into our CPU block because it goes out
from the pump into the CPU block then
CPU block out to the rad rad back to the
pump and so we are going to just do that
part and then we'll maybe take the
radiator fittings off and see how it
looks it's gonna be bad though I
guarantee it so I'm actually kind of
surprised that the fittings are as clean
as they are because I mean I've had
fittings get all gunked up with like the
Nano cell fluids and stuff in there and
this one actually turned out really good
and you can see that it's not built up
on the tip of the the tube either like
sometimes you'll see it get really
discolored right there but you can see
where the discoloration actually starts
a little bit farther back alright so it
is inside the radiator to look like oh
wow alright that is not as bad as I
thought it'd be let me get my light real
quick see the discoloring I saw in the
fittings like on the inside because it
looks whitish but it's not like the Rose
look the Rose just look like they've got
a little bit of discoloration from just
obviously being in contact with fluid
but I don't see white in there it's not
built up on the back wall it's perfectly
clean yay that makes me feel a whole lot
better all right we're gonna fill it up
and you know it could turn white I hope
it doesn't but if it does what we tried
let's see what happens it's totally
gonna turn white though it's white still
some of the pump dude oh but you know
what though I could just do like another
flush now cuz that's just I think some
of the remnants like from the pump and
stuff because some gets down there that
doesn't leak out of here cuz it below
that level you know I mean I would say
that's clean would you would you agree
all it took was detergent alcohol
rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol
toothbrush and crest 3d white
oh yeah five feet of youtubing some hot
water some distilled water but you know
the usual now because we are running
just distilled water now we got to put a
couple drops of this inhibitor in there
and that's going to keep us from getting
growth and corrosion and all that so we
decided in preparation for endgame to do
purple for Thanos
mr. test bench I don't feel so good I
don't want to go I don't want to go
anywhere like well there you go test
beds now named fan OHS you know how it's
gonna end yet but once it ends then
we'll change the theme to match wherever
the victor is but I bet you anything
it's not that nose whatever this weren't
a lot better than I thought it was going
to be honest I mean I know who's got the
change the tubes those tubes were
entirely too old away too stained I
thought for sure I was going to swap
this radiator out like I was gonna have
a hard time getting it cleaned I mean we
ran the system prep in here for a little
bit - not the amount of time it said -
but the water ran perfectly clear and
then I end up using hot sink water which
you shouldn't do because all the
minerals and stuff in there so I did hot
sink water for an entire gallon worth of
that the heat really seemed to break up
a lot of the stuff that was kind of
residual in the loop and then we flushed
it again with another gallon of pure
distilled water to clean it all out
we'll put our inhibitors in here added
our dye and now we are just running a
straight distilled water loop but I'll
tell you what it kind of shows that yeah
although some people could use this type
of video as ammunition to be like see
this is where you're shooting water cool
I can use this video on the flip side
and say see how easy it is to recover if
you have to so this wouldn't even been
as much of a problem if it was a
hard-line tube because hardline doesn't
doesn't soak up the the stuff like the
tubes in where we showed you everything
was like stuck to the tubes if we tried
to leave those tubes in here we would
have never gotten a clean because of the
fact that it's just would keep breaking
off the tubes and one little speck of
that stuff just just turn the whole loop
white so once we got rid of the tubes
cleaned out the components took the
block apart and cleaned it just a little
bit of Labor the cost of tubes and some
water is all it took to get this loop
back up or running a hundred percent so
I figured I'd take you guys along for
the ride just give you a I like to do
some really unconventional methods
sometimes like you saw this hope rubbing
alcohol and yeah hot sink water so I
don't think you should necessarily copy
that at least if you're going to you
definitely need to clean it out but it
works you know what they say I want
something about none no dumb ideas if it
works something like that the irony
alright guys we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
