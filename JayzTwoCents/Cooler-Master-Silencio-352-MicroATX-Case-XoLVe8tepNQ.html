here in the flesh mostly I have no idea
where I was going with that I've been
paying attention to my demographics a
lot lately here on YouTube mostly had
the request of you guys the viewers
because you guys want to see more things
that pertain to something obtainable for
you guys well looking at those
demographics I realized that ninety
eight point six percent of my viewers
are male and the age is between thirteen
and twenty four so they got me thinking
most of the people are either living at
home or they're in a dorm and you guys
are going to need small computer cases
and probably something that's quiet
because you have to live with it it's
going to be in your bedroom with you
maybe you sleep with it at night not
like literally in your bed I would
probably sleep with skunkworks if it fit
in my bed and didn't weigh 82 pounds but
quite a few of you have asked me to
review cases that are more small they're
easy to move around and they are quiet
well that's what you're looking for and
you're a 13 to 24 year old male here on
YouTube you should probably go outside
and get a girlfriend or you guys can
stick around and continue to watch this
video about cooler masters new silencio
352 and if you didn't know
silenzio actually means silence in
French or maybe it was Spanish or
Italian I don't know I speak the
American gigabites flex display
technology automatically detects and
connects up to four displays for the
best gaming experience in multi display
Ultra HD click the link in the
description to find out more now in
terms of form factor this thing is
pretty dang tiny it is a mid Tower and
it is for the micro ATX form factor or
mini ITX cannot fit a standard sized ATX
case in this if you want to do a
standard sized ATX you need to bump up
to via Silencio 652 which we will be
looking at in a separate video side
panel as you can see here is solid there
is no window on this particular model
that we're taking a look at if you look
at the back here you can see we are all
black finish here which makes it nice
and sleek and again another solid side
panel on the side and we have a single
120 or 140 exhaust fan grille on
top now moving around to the front this
is the part that people are always most
interested in because the front of the
case is what you're going to pretty much
be looking at all the time
we do have a nice polished van finish
around the front of the case this is
going to look a lot like their n 200
case which was actually a very popular
case for Coolermaster and basically what
they did was if you recall when I did my
CES video I said they're trying to
reduce their portfolio size by making
their product range more narrow that
make more sense so they've kind of taken
the N series of cases and made them
silence optimized and calling them now
the Silencio so we have a more
streamlined cost-effective sleek looking
quiet case that sort of would have been
a separate line but now we're just
taking a look here all the Silencio
stuff is like the end 200 and 600
crammed in to these new form factors so
we do have a swing-away door here opens
from right to left which i think is kind
of unfortunate it's you know just
starting off here with my review because
most people if you're right-handed a lot
of people tend to put their computers on
the right and let's be honest here the
majority of the world is right-handed
there are left-handed people and you
guys put this on the left and you can
rejoice because the door opens the
proper way for you but if this is on the
right and you open this you have to
reach around it take it to the front
your five-and-a-quarter bay may be a
three and a half inch card reader
whatever that is unfortunate I wish you
could switch the side you know a little
bit of a pet peeve there but opening up
the front you can see we do have here a
easy removable fan filter it is on a
hinge here so it folds down you're not
going to lose it and you do have a 120
millimeter fan pre-installed with room
for a second 120 millimeter fan and then
you can close that back up and you don't
actually risk losing the filter because
it's on a hinge
now the inch front intake is a little
bit restricted because the only place
you have air coming in is through these
grilles on the side so you kind of have
a little bit of give and take when it
comes to silence optimized cases if you
have it wide open for air flow you also
have it wide open for noise penetration
noise exfiltration to make it out of the
case whether it be your graphics card
noise hard drive noise fan noise
whatever you're always going to have fan
noise even in a silent optimized case
because the fans are going to be on the
exteriors of the case bringing air in
through the atmosphere and through the
filters so there's always going to be
some fan noise but in this case it's a
trade-off you're going to lose some
airflow for the sake of some silenced
optimization now on the back here the
thumb screws are not self retaining or
whatever that word I don't they have a
specific word for that I first yeah you
can see I just dropped one didn't do
that on purpose I actually fat-fingered
that so they're not going to stay in the
case you can lose them but that doesn't
matter really honestly uh most cases
don't have self retention but looking at
the panel here you can see we do have
some sound deadening foam on here it's
just to help kind of keep the sound
muffled inside the case one thing I'm
excited to see though is as you can see
all of the cables on the inside are
black and that's always been a pet peeve
of mine when companies will use colored
cables because this isn't 1996 anymore
we like things you know black and sleek
and stealthy looking unless of course
you're doing something like skunk works
and you want it to be completely blingy
and look at me and flamboyant or in some
other builds and I'm doing here in the
very near future even brighter and more
look at me than skunk works but that's
where that's a teaser for a future video
which I know you guys hate so therefore
I've had to do it so pre-installed
inside here we do have a 120 intake and
a 120 rear exhaust the rear here is
actually compatible with 80 mil 92 mil
and 120 I don't know why anybody would
remove the 120 to put an 80 or 92 but
it's there as mentioned earlier the top
cover here is compatible with a 120 or
140 and then you do have four PCI slots
on here because it is a micro ATX form
factor and we do have our pouch of
hardware here which has some zip ties
some screws more thumb screws more
standoffs rubber dampening mounts for
your hard drives as well as a
motherboard speaker which I like to see
it's always useful have a motherboard
speaker for troubleshooting and then up
here twist tied in we do have what I
believe this is yes this is the sound
deadening retention plate
the top of the case now some system
builders actually prefer to not use a
top exhaust they like to use a rear
exhaust that way you have a direct cross
flow front to rear of the case so if
that's you you can take this thing and
you can actually mount it on the top
here just like that as you can see it
fits in there and it is magnetized so
there is no need for screws you just
stick it on there it's magnet not coming
off as you can see we can tilt case all
around it's not going anywhere power
supply does mount in the bottom here you
have a filtered air intake for the power
supply on the bottom here as you can see
it's a little guy there and then we do
have on the back panel also that same
sound deadening material that we found
on the front panel and one thing I do
like to see especially on lower tier
cases like this where they don't tend to
have as many bells and whistles as their
bigger brothers is options now when it
comes to the hard drive cage on here you
can remove it it's not riveted in it's
screwed in so you can remove this if you
want to get better air flow in there
because you do have more mounting
options for the hard drives which we'll
talk about in a second but this hard
drive cage does have room here for two
three and a half inch drives and then it
also has on the top right here in SSD
drive mount location so you can put an
SSD on there as well when it comes to
the drive cages on here before we move
in move on to the back we do have a five
and a quarter bay and a three and a half
inch bay here so you end on the bottom
of this
another SSD mounting location so you've
kind of got all over different places
here you can put a ton of different SSDs
or hard drives and still have lots of
room now the back of the motherboard
tray does reveal that we have two
additional SSD mounting locations right
here with the rubber standoffs that you
just kind of slide down in there and you
can mount more SSDs on the back so
that's up to four SSDs we can already
mount on this thing as well as a ton of
tie off locations here for good cable
management you can see the bottom here
is wide open so you have plenty of room
to route your cables over here to the
hard drive tray or up here to the SSDs
unfortunately all of the case cable
management pretty much has to be done
internally there's not a lot of room
here
I'm the motherboard tray in fact you
only have about a quarter of an inch now
as you can see here on the back panel
you do have a little bit of a bump in
there to give you a little bit more
space when it comes to cable management
but it's not much and it's not enough to
make really any sort of a difference
when it comes to cable management
especially with how thick 24 pin cables
are you're not going to fit those looms
behind here so you do have plenty of
room though to hide extra cables down
here if you need to to get them out of
the way but because this doesn't have a
case window on there you don't need to
go too crazy with the cable management
either because you're not going to see
it a case like this is all about
function over form when it comes to that
sort of thing in fact moving those
cables internally into the case allows
it to have a very narrow width so you
can fit this in a lot of computer
cabinets or you know entertainment
centers and a lot of different options
when it comes to where this thing can
fit now lastly on the front one thing I
want to mention here is we do have two
USB 3.0 one USB 2.0 mic and headphone
jack as well as a built-in card reader
so the card reader is nice to see it's a
nice little bonus especially if you're
doing photography or videography you
know sort of like I am you know to keep
connecting into the camera to offload
your photos and such you can do it right
here with the built-in card reader so
guys that is the Coolermaster silencio
352 right now at the time of making this
video it's about $78 on Amazon now the
cool thing about this is even though it
does have a 120 or 140 slot on the top
you could well no actually you couldn't
mount an all-in-one cooler on the top
there's not enough space from the top of
the motherboard and this grille would be
able to fit it however you can fit up
here in the front if you remove this
drive cage right here and use just the
rear option you can fit a 120 millimeter
radiator or a 240 millimeter radiator in
the front so if you're all the one
cooling tubes will reach that far you
could use an all-in-one cooler like the
new silencio series of their 240 or you
could put in a custom water cooling loop
in here as well but all things
considered this is a pretty small space
that you can fit an awful lot of
hardware into that one just sort of
wrote itself didn't it
alright guys I'm gonna get on out of
here if you want to interact hit me up
on that social media that Twitter that
Facebook that Instagram and the forms
only that forms forget I have forms
sometimes form desi sense calm if you
guys want to check out current pricing
on this thing in a future one if you're
from the future please tell me a lot of
numbers I promise I'll build you an
amazing system and to uh go and check
out the Amazon pricing that tends to
give you a pretty good idea of where
things are at when it comes to pricing
as of making this video at $78 on Amazon
you can find a link to it down the
description helps up the channel keeps
things running doesn't cost you anything
extra it's a win-win for everybody
alright I'm gonna get out of here as
always guys thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
