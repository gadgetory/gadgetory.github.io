here as hard drives and SSDs keep
getting faster and faster and faster
it's not hard to actually hit the cap of
the 60 K bit per second bandwidth that's
available on SATA 3 so how do you get
faster performance well you start taking
a look at em two drives and today we're
going to be taking a look at flex tours
128 gigabyte m2 SSD specifically model
number P XG 1 - 8 m 6e yeah they could
probably make some cool names or
something for these anyway that's we're
going to take a look at today with its
improved radiator support and legendary
noise optimization the new define are
five from fractal design is a PC
builders dream come true click the link
in the description to learn more now I
kind of hinted at the start of this
video that SATA 6 gigabits per second is
pretty much capped out I mean SATA 3 6
gigabit per second all modern SSDs are
hitting that cap and you really can't
get any faster no matter how much the
controller is refined there's still a
bandwidth limitation that comes along
with that form factor so that's why
we're going to take be taking a look
today at m2 now I could go into a lot of
detail about what m dot 2 is there's a
bunch of different form factors of m dot
2 different key sizes different lengths
different widths and rather than bore
you guys in information that is actually
already out there I'm going to link you
right now to my good friend Paul over at
Paul's hardware who did a fantastic
video a few months back about m2
standards and what it all means so
rather than bore you guys with that
today I'm gonna link you on over to his
video and if you leave this video to go
watch his make sure you come back that
would actually be preferred but anyway I
digress go ahead and check out his video
if you guys want to learn more about
what the m2 standard is if you're just
interested about how well it performs
and how fast it is and how to get past
that 6 gigabit per second cap that's on
SATA 3 well then you don't want to go
anywhere now what makes MDOT two really
exciting is the fact that we're finally
able to bypass the six gigabit per
second bandwidth that is present on SATA
3 now if you're using the native key or
the native port that you find on most
modern motherboards
seven x99 and even some z87 you were
able to actually plug this thing
directly into your motherboard be very
low profile or through the use of a PCI
Express adapter which in fact my x99
motherboard actually comes equipped with
you can get up to ten gigabits per
second which means very very fast read
speeds now when it comes to fast read
speeds it makes games like Battlefield 4
or MMOs at the load a large world load
very very quickly in fact it even means
faster boot times for your OS so it's
got a lot of benefits all around when it
comes to read speed now the m6 II from
Plextor
actually has an advertised 770 megabytes
per second read speed and a 335 megabyte
per second write speed it's kind of
interesting though considering it's a
slower write speed then you'll typically
find on your two-and-a-half inch SSD but
anyway I think 335 megabytes per second
is still plenty fast in fact most of us
don't do a whole lot of writing to our
SSDs we're pretty much reading the crap
out of them when it comes to our games
and other productivity calling up
different programs and whatnot so save
or write speeds are actually not that
much of a hindrance when it comes to
them being a little bit slower now one
of the other cool things about MDOT 2 is
the form factor is just so tiny it
actually gives people a lot of
flexibility on where they can mount them
in fact on my x99 it actually mounts
straight up and down using kind of a
little post that it mounts on to and it
gives you a lot more room on the
motherboard
but the x99 deluxe also comes with the
PCI Express adapter so I can plug it
into PCI Express as well which I prefer
because it's a lot easier to get in and
out than having it mounted facing up
with next my water block and power
cables and all that stuff but you have
multiple mounting options in fact my x99
classified from EVGA actually has 2 m2
native ports on the motherboard while
there's not a whole lot of say about the
actual SSD itself it's very bare-bones
the chips are mounted directly to the
PCB you stick it in 9 months later you
may get another little baby SSD so let's
go ahead and plug this thing into my x99
deluxe from Asus and that CF Plex course
claim of 770 megabytes by three hundred
and thirty five megabytes read/write
speed is actually accurate so without
further ado go ahead and roll that
transition
roll the transition any day now
you can roll the there you go guys the
m6e from Plextor is a very vast SSD in
fact it lives up to its claims and
vensim so guys it's been J's 2 cents
hope you guys enjoyed this video follow
on Twitter if you have any questions or
facebook or any of that sort of thing
it's actually the best way to get a hold
of me we've got some fun stuff coming up
for the holidays and CES is only a few
weeks away from the making of this video
so stay tuned for that I cannot wait to
bring you guys some of the awesome stuff
that goes on in Las Vegas at CES January
6th in fact I may be in Vegas from
January 5th through the 9th so if you
guys are local to Las Vegas hit me up
maybe I'll do a little fan meetup if
enough people local to Las Vegas we're
interested in hooking up and saying hi I
love to meet the fans you guys are
actually what keeps this channel running
and I love to meet you guys it's a
little awkward sometimes but that's
because I'm an awkward guy now because
you're awkward because I'm awkward yeah
so anyway guys hope to see you in the
next one now because I know about 5,000
of you guys are gonna ask me J what
happened to the front of your hair I've
gone ahead and prepared an appropriate
list of responses I had an unfortunate
run-in with a weed whacker cooking is
hard the hair in the front actually
glued back into my head weird aliens
abducted me and did terrible terrible
things
it's actually just a forehead goatee
it's the latest fashion statement I want
it to be a little bit like Paul's
hardware but just a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
