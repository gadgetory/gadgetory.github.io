no joke that the prices of graphics
cards continue to be a joke it's it's
out of control the prices have not come
down GPUs have not been able to be
restocked and it has been nothing but a
nightmare for people this year trying to
build or upgrade their computers so
that's why I reached out to my friends
at Asus and said hey why don't we team
up and give someone a chance to actually
have a decent graphics card and they
obliged and they sent me some graphics
cards to give away to you guys so what
you see right here are some graphics
cards sent over by my friends over Asus
so again a huge thank you to Asus for
providing me with these graphics cards
for this giveaway otherwise it wouldn't
have been possible but we've got a gtx
1066 gigabyte version and a Strix gtx
1070 these are both hell of a card can
dominate any game you want to play but
we didn't stop there we've actually got
a GTX 1080 as well so three lucky people
are going to win one of these cards
worldwide now well unless it's you know
void or prohibited where you live which
would really suck and I feel bad for you
guys but as long as it's legal where you
live to win a giveaway then you have a
chance to win this now in the
description below you're gonna find a
link to gleam gleam keeps it fair that's
how it validates all the entries and I'm
gonna keep it simple I'm not gonna do 25
different ways to enter we're just gonna
keep it to the simple YouTube
subscription Twitter Follow and of
course the Asus account they didn't even
ask for that I'm gonna put them in there
as well they supply these graphics cards
might as well at least get them some
more fan follow ship followers whatever
and we're gonna we're gonna just keep it
simple not a ton of ways to enter no
we're running this for the entire month
of March starting from when this video
goes live and we're gonna draw the
enters or draw the interest draw the
winners on April 1st probably a terrible
day to try and announce a winner for a
giveaway everyone's gonna think it's a
joke but as I promise it won't be a joke
April 1st and as always you have 48
hours to respond to the email that I'm
gonna send you glean does not send
emails to the winners don't try and pull
that crap every single giveaway someone
tries to pretend gleam sent them an
email because they're trying to cheat
and you are forever banned from
giveaways what do you do that but I
digress guys when I send you an email
you've got 48 hours to respond to it if
you don't respond then
another winner is drawn now there's
gonna be one winner per graphics card
and that's its own little giveaway so
technically there are three giveaways
inside of this one giveaway so if the
1070 winner doesn't respond it doesn't
mean the 1060 gets the 1070 and a new
1060 is drawn each one is handled in its
own fashion so we're gonna keep it fair
that way guys anyway just to recap GTX
1066 Giga 1070 and a 1080 being given
away worldwide link is in the
description below just our way of giving
back again a huge thank you to Asus for
sponsoring this giveaway because trust
me this is a profit this is a profit
right here actually not necessary for
pieces for the retailers that mark up
the price but whatever I digress guys
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
