you a video that I'm kind of fanboying
over just a little bit because it's
something from my computer that I had
never personally owned myself and that
is going to be some custom sleeve cables
to just complete that complete custom
ensemble that's inside your computer but
before we get to that don't forget guys
Jays two cents com is a real thing now
so head on over there register today but
we're going to do a couple things with
this video we're going to not only show
you the cables and the quality whoo I
got them from and how much they cost and
stuff like that but this company also
sent me like an entire kit of how to do
cable sleeping yourself and I'm going to
show you guys just how involved it
really is to do something like this to
your cables and holy shit
is a lot more involved than I ever ever
thought it was
all right so first things first guys
when it comes to these cables I got
these through a company called loot row
customs and a lot of you seem to have
actually heard of this company because I
did a tweet and you guys are really
excited like holy crap we love their
work and so do I man I'm telling you
right now you may be surprised but I've
never owned custom sleeved cables like
this I mean they just give your system
that complete look I mean you guys saw
my cables before and all of you guys
said wow your cables really look like
crap considering how much work you put
into your computer so I wanted to change
that and I contacted these guys and not
only did they you know put together this
custom sleeves set for me these are
extensions they also sent me a whole
bunch of product to kind of show you
guys so that you can understand the
level of quality that goes into their
work so that you can know that when you
order through them you are getting
something that is pretty much unique to
you and your needs so I went with the
complete extension kit which is the 24
pin extension I've got two times PCI
Express extensions you've got 8 pin EPS
power for your motherboard which is this
guy right here an 8 pin power for your
motherboard and your PCI Express are not
the same so make sure you note that when
you're ordering these don't just order
an extra 8 pin for PCI it's not going to
work now when it comes to the cable
quality Lutrell customs the owner his
name is Mike and he basically goes out
and he just kind of scours the internet
to find the best quality products that
he can and he's always finding new
suppliers and always increasing the
quality of his not only the cable that
he uses but the sleeve the connectors
and everything just feels extremely
sturdy now like I mention we're gonna go
ahead and talk about my cables and then
we'll talk about what you guys can get
from them if you decide to go through
them for your custom sleeving now these
are extensions as I mentioned however
you could give them the specs of your
power supply and they can basically if
it's modular they can create an entire
cable sets you can ditch the stock
cables and go ahead and go with full
sleeved custom cables if you wanted I
didn't go that route because as you guys
know I change my stuff out all the time
so I want to maintain the look
without losing the custom cables because
I changed my power supply now the 24 pin
on mine you can see he went with a black
and then kind of a graphite and then a
yellow graphite black graphite yellow
black graphite black so I wasn't sold on
the graphite at first I'd seen it in
pictures but I was thinking myself has
it really gonna look all right and trust
me it looks fantastic I just it looks so
much better than if I had just been
black yellow black yellow so he really
knows what he's doing with that but what
I love about this companies you can get
pretty much any color of the rainbow any
color combination you want now when you
order through them it does take about
two weeks for them to process your order
because everything is made by hand from
scratch now one thing you may also
notice with my cables is that there is
no heat shrink on there this is a heat
shrink list design which looks extremely
clean now there's one other thing I
really wasn't expecting when it came to
their cables that is a definite bonus
and I want to point that out you'll
notice all their cables have a natural
curve to them and the reason for that is
they've gone ahead and made the inside
line of cables shorter than the outside
line of cables and the reason why you do
that is typically when you install these
the cables are going to curve around
somewhere and they know that you know
the orientation of the pins are the
plugs the connectors are always the same
on motherboards and graphics cards are
always oriented the same way so they can
create that curve that way as they Bend
you can see the cables stay together
they don't flare out or fan out the
problem with when you go with something
like this which is a like a ten dollar
you know already sleeved extension that
you can use one you can see the heat
shrink on there is just completely ugly
I mean look at that the heat shrink is
not all the same length where they cut
the sleeve on there it's not all the
same it's all make kind of looks like a
freaking test pattern or something on
there I don't know but as you can see
when you straighten out neutral customs
cables you can see that the outside
cables are longer giving it that curve
now watch what happens when I make the
curve on the ones that are all the same
length like this one here it makes the
curve but you notice how they all fan
have we we've all seen those custom
cables in people's builds where they
kind of look like this fluttery fanny
mess of cables but you don't get that
with loot row customs because they have
gone the extra mile to properly lengthen
these cables so that you get a nice
curve and they stay together one other
thing that these cables have are what
they call their stealth comb and
basically so that you don't get this
mess right here how everything's just
kind of like you know moving around in
there they have these combs on there
there's just basically little pieces of
plastic they get threaded onto the
sleeving so that everything it stays
together nice and tight now you don't
have to leave them in the middle where
they show because I kind of don't like
that you can push them off to the sides
that's why they're called stealth
because they go up against the connector
and you don't really see them but you
can see they allow you to if your cable
sort of get messed up like that you just
run the comb through literally it's like
combing hair you just go back and forth
on it and then everything is back in
place again
I'm it it works really well on the 24
pin unfortunately they're really fragile
and I broke a few of them on my 24 pin
when pushing it through the grommet in
my 900 d so you want to be mindful of
that I only have one on here that works
now but because only that much of it
shows in my 900 E it's not a problem
now these are the cables that I got
through Lu TRO custom but they also sell
all the materials for you to do this
yourself if you want so let's go ahead
and show you guys the materials that are
involved in doing something like this so
that you can just appreciate the amount
of work that is involved with customs
leaving now as I mentioned there's a lot
of tools involved in doing this in fact
these are all the tools involved yeah it
was a little bit overwhelming when I
open the box too and I say that with a
little bit of disappointment because
quite honestly I thought it was Oh cut
the cable crimp it on slide on the
sleeve plug it in band move on to the
next one let's take this for instance
there's 24 wires in this one extension
cable now it took me when I was
practicing this about five attempts and
probably 50
ten minutes before I got one cable that
looked anywhere near acceptable to this
in fact it's so bad I didn't even
putting it on camera now could you
imagine how long it would take me to do
these right here yeah I would still be
doing it I'd probably still be doing it
up until retirement so when you order
custom cables from Lu TRO customs you
get basically a professional that takes
all these materials and creates these
out of this you have two different types
of options here when it comes to
sleeving you have plastic sleeve which
is what I am using and you can see
you've got all sorts of different colors
here I mean jeez it any color
combination you want if I even have
color combos within a single sleeve like
this is the black and red one you've got
green and black for mind you like an
Nvidia but then you also have a paracord
that's available this is apparently a
lot harder to work with according to
Mike because as you can see it's very
soft it's like a fabric again every
color of the rainbow is included in this
paracord is very similar to like the
sleeving you would find on headphones or
a headset or something like that it's
very soft very pliable versus the
plastic here which is you know very very
rigid so yeah anyway there's that's
paracord now you you have heats heat
shrinks leaving or heat shrink tubing
which is this guy here and that's pretty
much what you're seeing on the end of
these cheap cables where in order to
hold everything together they just put
the heat shrink over it heat it up it
shrinks and then holds everything
together but it just really looks bad I
don't like it in fact if you order
cables through Lou TRO customs that you
request heat shrink tubing on they
charge you more because there's more
time involved with that when it comes to
the connectors they use very high
quality connectors as you can see here
and I mean they've got every connector
that you could possibly need I mean
we've got SATA you've got a tub that's a
two four six eight ten pin I'm not sure
about 10 minutes forward be honest with
you
so anyway you've got all your your pins
here that you could constantly or
possibly need and you've also got
available through their website all of
the tools necessary here are the the
the connectors as you can see I went
through one two three four five six
seven eight
went through eight of these pins before
I figured out how to crimp it properly
sorry Mike I did watch your video but
I'm the kind of guy that's like oh let's
try first watch videos later and then
ruin stuff in the meantime because we
didn't pay attention what we were doing
you also have the paracord sleeping
starter thing which makes it a whole lot
easier and then you have your pin
extractors here so what I figured we'd
do is just to show you kind of how
involved this is oh and then of course
you have your crimping tool and you have
your stripper cutter tool and you also
have this thing here which I camera what
it's called but it assists in the
plastics leaving so here's what we're
gonna do we're going to go ahead and
make out of this connector right here
just a little jumper we're gonna make a
little jumper that you would use to
start up your power supply you know if
you're doing water cuts or water cooling
you gotta jump in your power supply to
make it start so instead of how to put a
paperclip in there yeah we're gonna go
ahead make one of these just so that you
can kind of see how involved it actually
is now normally I would use the black
cable but I'm gonna go ahead and use the
white cable so you can see it oh you
know what it would help if I actually
showed you that they use high quality 16
gauge wire all the way up to you or
always low as G's member hello there
gauge goes but you can select and buy
all this stuff through their website so
we're going to do is we're going to go
and take some white cable here I'm going
to just cut off a little bit of piece a
little piece of that and then we are
going to make a little jumper so that we
could start up power supply if we needed
now first things first you need to strip
the ends of the cable and I don't know
if they had a better stripper they sent
me two of these cutters maybe they made
a mistake I do have an actual wire
stripper would you put it on pull a
handle and strips it off I'm just using
the tools that they gave me here you
know leave about maybe an eighth of an
inch on the end there and then we won't
do the other side yet so the pin that
we're going to be using I remember what
the pin is actually called but it's the
one that would go in the 24 pin
connector and this is going to be really
really hard to pick up on camera and
I'll do the best I can and b-roll you
need to use the right portion of the
crimper
and make sure that it's aligned properly
in there so that when you crimp it these
little pins that stick up will turn and
kind of crimp back on itself and clamp
down on both the shielding as well as
the pit the cable itself this was the
part I was fuckin up on royally because
I was just doing this entirely wrong so
the first thing you do is you find the
gauge on here that matches yours in our
case we're going to do the it's on here
labeled as the 18 to 22 gauge wire and
you're going to stick it in here you're
going to stick it in to beginning to see
this here get it lined up right on the
edge right there and then click it twice
so it kind of opens up and now it's
holding the pin in there so all you have
to do now stick the cable in there until
the shielding hits the end and crimp it
down and there you go you have a
perfectly crimped pin on the end of this
wire now if we were going to sleep this
and I'm not going to sleep it because
this leaving is not the right size for
this particular wire I don't think in
fact it looks really big compared to it
and they've already glued or melted the
ends so I'm going to do that so now what
you would go ahead and do is do the
other side so we're going to go ahead
and strip the ends I'm gonna go ahead
and now get it ready put it in there
crimp it down boom see I'm I feel good
at confident at this now because I
wasted an entire sleeve of pins trying
to figure out how to do it so now we got
to do is go ahead and face this up when
we go one two three four pins in make
sure the little there's like a sled in
there make sure that's up pointing up at
the top shove it on in there that's good
and measure to the fifth pin in push
that in there and there we go we have
now got ourselves there we've now got
ourselves a little power supply jumper
thing so yeah guys it's really not that
hard if you take the time to practice
and do it right but as you can see
there's just so much involved in all
these different connectors and
the reason why I was sounded a little
bit disappointed when all these tools
came was because I was like this is not
something I have the patience for and it
made me sad because I realized is this
is better left to the experts
quite honestly all right so there you go
guys the custom sleeve cables from Luke
TRO customs complete the custom look for
your computer I mean this right here
just yeah it's just not I wouldn't but I
may put it in my test bed who knows but
these guys right here
so guys head on over to loot row customs
like I said it takes an expert to do
this but you can do it yourself if you
want to and the pricing of the materials
and stuff over at loot row customs quite
honestly shocked the hell out of me
because they're not nearly as expensive
as I thought they would be what do you
think about these cables have you ever
used loot row customs have you ever seen
them before check out their information
it's down in the description he also has
videos up showing you how to do it
properly and if I had watched those a
little more in-depth prior to doing this
I might not have wasted 8 pins anyway
guys I might get on out of here thanks
for watching the video thanks for
supporting hope you head on over to the
website and as always I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
