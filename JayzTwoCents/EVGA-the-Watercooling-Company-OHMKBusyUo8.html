MSI and the new Z 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
what's up guys JC cents here at CES 2017
and you knew I wasn't going to come all
the way out here and not check out my
friends over here at EVGA so we've got a
couple things to talk about here no
surprise kb lake motherboards z 270 is a
thing and they've keeping it going with
their stinger line the further win k as
well as the classified bring some new
features on there like you to connection
if you guys don't know what that is look
it up it's a new interface for mass
storage that doesn't use cpu PCIe lanes
but still considered a PCI Express IO so
you guys can learn all about that if you
check out some accumulate coverage so
motherboards there is no big surprise
we've got a new laptop here to be taking
a look at this is the SC 15 this is
their 15-inch 120 Hertz g-sync gaming
panel at 1080p panel in a 15 inch form
factor all aluminum unibody case right
here absolutely love the form factor of
this I mean it's it's it's thin it's
extremely sturdy even on the bottom here
if you look it's got like an anti slip
pad so it's not sliding all around on
your table I love that you know laptops
is one of those things you either are
into and appreciate a well bit lap or
well-built laptop or you're just kind of
like whatever I don't care about it but
you have to appreciate this whether
you're a gamer or just a someone who's
traveling for work and you need it for
productivity it looks good it's not in
your face but it's got a GTX 1060 you
know it's a Pascal GPU in there
full-blown 1060 temperatures are well
under control we will be taking a look
at this in the future I know you guys
are still waiting on some su-17 stuff
we'll figure out where we're gonna go
with that but the form factor of SC 15
is also really well what you guys know I
like water cooling well EVGA likes water
cooling now too so come look at this all
in one water cooling units are there no
surprise to the market but who would
have thought that a GPU manufacturer is
now creating all-in-one water cooling
loops here with a very interesting fan
design in fact I don't have a lot of
information on the span yet I don't even
know what it's called hey anyone know
what this fans called the name for it
Jacob
we'll just call it the super spoopy fans
that's kind of what it looks like here
but the design here is it's high static
pressure it's on a radiator noise
optimized here they've got some channels
kind of carved into the frame of the fan
which is also going to channel air in a
more straight fashion rather than a
because I've seen the way air flow goes
through a fan that's not straight it's
very angled so that's a based on this
design that's what I'm assuming they're
going by we'll take a look at that in
the future but all the one cooling unit
here it is an ASA tech pump in there so
you've got that quality and it is also
RGB but here's something that I think is
very very interesting you guys have seen
the hybrid cards I've showed those ever
since they debuted we've now got the
hybrid qrg this is a quick-release
system here so if you've got any of
these eco system parts here we're about
to show you you can piece together your
own completely water-cooled system and
not ever have to touch the fluid because
it's all prefilled so this right here is
a qrg hybrid card prefilled and you can
see you've got your quick releases on
there so what you do is you grab your
card to say okay I've got my card you
decide I want to go ahead and throw a
CPU loop or cooler in there too so you
get the you know the CPU cooler itself
separately and then you decide well I
need a radiator and you've got a lot of
sizes to choose from here they got 120
they got 142 40s to 80s 360s you name it
they're also pre filled with quick
disconnects on there you bolt these all
up in your system and you just plug them
in they're prefilled there's no bleeding
to worry about there's no leaking to
worry about and you have the performance
of like a full custom loop with your GPU
in there and you never even have to
touch the fluid I looked right at them
when I said what are you trying to do
you trying to put me out of business I
know I don't approve EVGA now this is an
awesome design here water cooling the
benefits of water on your micro
processors is it's proven you guys know
it's it's one of the best things you can
do to keep your systems cool and keep
the longevity they're what people are
afraid to do it this is an awesome way
to incorporate that into your builds I
think we'll take a look at something the
future will piece together a loop well
put it together and we'll see how the
performance really is on that so this is
something new
last year EVGA
kind of made a splash in the chassis
market with the DG 87 very big case it
can accommodate a lot of components a
lot of hardware a four-way SLI if you
wanted to fully water-cooled but they've
now kind of toned it down a little bit
here with the new DG 7 series so this is
a mid Tower that can hold all of your
components but as you can see it's gone
the way of tempered glass side panel I'm
gonna leave this one on we have a build
over there we can take a look at so this
is the DG 7 here that's been fully
outfitted it's got a 1080 classified in
there it's got one of their all-in-one
Kawara cooling loops it's got a intake
fans here on the front but plenty of
room to be able to incorporate front
mounted radiators if you want to go
water cooling we have a cutout here that
allows for the routing of cables and/or
water cooling reservoirs whatever you
want to do but it also has a shroud here
to separate the PSU compartment from the
main compartment of the case more so
just making it nice and streamlined now
it's important to keep in mind what
you're looking at here though is also
eight early sample these aren't going to
be probably make it to market until
around Computex time so we're looking at
you know a few more months before we see
these but it's always exciting to see
these these early samples of what these
chesses are going to look like so
consider this as a very early sneak peak
can't come to the EVGA suite without
talking about graphics cards check this
out we are looking at the new icx cooler
found here on the 1084 the wind - now
it's got a new backplate on here as you
guys can see it's got some vents in
there to allow heat to dissipate where
it needs to aesthetically it's very
pleasing it's a satin finishes it looks
very nice on the surface kind of looks
the same but they've changed something
here with the way it mounts together
we're instead of only the four main
screws on the GPU holding on the entire
heatsink which could create some of that
sag everything's actually very rigid now
where the perimeter screws on this
backplate are holding the entire
heatsink to the PCB which is huge
because I hated feeling some of that
flex when it wanted to separate because
the only screws holding the heatsink to
the backplate
were these four right here so big design
change there I'm happy to feel that cuz
now when you hold it it just feels like
a big solid piece of just gaming meat
and I like that so the a CX RC v the IC
X I'm gonna say a CX probably for ideon
for a while here they're moving forward
with their cooler design
and that's actually good to see so you
learn more about that later in the year
some of the changes coming here to some
of the coolers but now we have moved
from a CX to icx on the for the win -
and that's something definitely you know
I'm gonna take a look at you guys know
graphics cards I've like turned in the
GPU channel somehow anyway guys that is
it here for the EVGA suite at CES 2017
again a huge thank you to my sponsors
for getting us here official motherboard
sponsor is MSI and of course EVGA our
trusted graphics boards partner and make
sure you guys are subscribed so you
don't miss any of our coverage plenty of
it I mean working myself into the ground
to make sure you guys get all this
coverage so with that I'm gonna get out
of here and we will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
