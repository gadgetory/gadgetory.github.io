insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys Jays two cents here hanging out at
the convention room floor here at CES
2014 and just like you saw in the intro
we are brought to you by Sennheiser
they're helping cover us equipment wise
here on this trip I'm joined with Scott
here at the Sennheiser booth and he's
going to talk to us about some gaming
headsets that are coming out for you
guys and you know that's so new I don't
really know much about it so I'm gonna
go ahead and hand Scott the mic and
we're gonna learn together what it is
Sennheiser's bringing you guys the
enthusiast gamer so Scott don't take it
away thank you very much well to start
we have introducing for 2014 it's our
game one so this is a open air headset
noise cancelling microphone integrated
volume control there's also an
integrated mute so when the microphone
arm is lifted and mutes the signal from
the mic a really nice feature that I'm a
big fan of is the braided cable so less
tangles less issues with breakage things
like that a velour cloth earpiece it's a
very light headphone very naturally
acoustic sounding
they are not changeable no the a big
thing this year for us is definitely
designed so you see big a lot more
colorful designs this year so we're
introducing the white with the red trim
and we'll see other colors coming down
the line later this year the really nice
thing for this headset is because it's
an open air so you're gonna want to use
it in a very quiet environment but for
gaming on you know very soundtrack heavy
type games things I like we have AC
Black Flag going so for those kind of
sounds the music the theatrical sounding
this to it is amazing so it gives you a
lot more of that very in-depth
you'll feel almost like you're in the
movie theater almost right and and I I
demoed this before we met up and first
thing I did notice was that these were
not friendly in a loud environment like
we are now like the sound was clear but
the volume seemed low because it is not
noise cancelling so what do you guys
have for noise cancelling options and
then running parallel with that is our
game zero so this is a closed back
headset a very similar feature set so
still have the noise cancelling
microphone mute volume control so but
this will be sealed so this will have
more isolation for outside noise
leatherette style ear pad with a memory
foam so it's a much more comfortable
feel especially for longer periods of
wearing so think of the guy who's
playing in a tournament and one thing
that you just demoed is is the folding
yes it comes with a storage case for to
protect it so you can throw it in a bag
with no worry and take it to wherever
you're going whether it's a friend's
house to play doing the next big
tournament I'm gonna assume because it's
Sennheiser and you guys are you know
known for audio quality as well as
microphone quality as you can see here
noise cancellation on the microphone is
it pretty good at you know having a pop
filter built-in to block a lot of the
pops and things and a person speaking it
can but for the noise cancelling it's
looking more at the environment so if
we're in an environment like this it's
gonna be seeing a lot of this noise like
from the the booth next to us things
like that and have much more focus on
the users voice so that the chat is
clear there's no reason to yell and be
loud for the people listening you'll be
able to speak at normal volumes and it'd
still be very very accurate okay now one
last question do both of these work on
cross-platform they can through
different adapters they're primarily
designed for PC so they have the dual
3.5 Milkha nectar so one separate one
for a headphone microphone and then we
have an adapter that'll be available at
the end of January that will allow you
to connect to a ps4 controller so that's
very exciting for us that we have
something that is going to be introduced
for the gaming console as well they have
guys the game series the game one and
the game 0 here from Sennheiser
you guys are a gamer and you love the
name Sennheiser and when it comes to
audio and video and audio and video I
like to say video what are you guys
gonna start making TVs no what when it
comes to audio and microphone quality
you definitely should take a look at the
game series here from Sennheiser guys as
always our trip was helped in part by
Sennheiser here make sure that you
follow us on Twitter so you don't miss
any of our CES 2014 coverage and as
always I will see you guys in my next
