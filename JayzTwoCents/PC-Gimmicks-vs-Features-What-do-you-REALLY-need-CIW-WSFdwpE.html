statistics have shown that the
summertime are leading right up to
summer usually is when people build
their computers it's when the most
people out there buying looking for
deals because maybe it's graduation
sales or something I don't know but we
find that we like to try and head off
some of the questions people have on
building new computers and today we're
going to tackle a topic we've not
actually done on this channel before and
I'm kind of curious to see how well
receive this is as well as you guys has
use your feedback and that is going to
be gimmick versus feature take
overclocking reliability to the next
level with the new Z 390 dark
motherboard from EVGA the Z 390 dark is
built for extreme overclocking utilizing
features such as a 10 layer PCB 17 phase
power delivery triple BIOS and 150
percent more gold content meaning you
get more of what you need to build the
ultimate Intel based PC to learn more
about the Z 390 dark in its world-class
features visit EVGA calm so we're gonna
actually use some of our products here
on the shelf to sort of talk about this
because here's what happens let's
pretend we're at Fry's or we're at
Microsoft I mean God knows we've got as
much inventory as one of them what tends
to happen if someone goes huh looks like
a neat board and then they kind of look
at it and they start reading the box you
know why they read the box cuz they
don't know what they're necessarily
looking at or what the features are and
stuff and so this is where a lot of new
people can certainly get in trouble so
we're gonna do right here is we're just
gonna grab three brands of motherboards
to try to see kind of the different ways
that these brands do their marketing so
we've got three of the big players here
we've got EVGA asus and msi now EVGA
we're gonna go and start here because i
am a huge fan of their packaging they
tend to be more minimalistic as you can
see there's not a bunch of crazy logos
everywhere there's not a bunch of
branding all over the place it's not
like busy it's not ugly that makes sense
so what your eyes are immediately drawn
to is just what's immediately like
important so there's some some stuff
missing from this box that we're gonna
kind of talk about and what I mean by
missing is my opinion what's missing are
the gimmicks they don't put in here
gaming they don't put in here via
already they don't even have
RGB on these boards I mean technically
the newer I think this one might
actually have RGB but it's not
controlled through like mystic light or
any of that they don't even have RGB
headers on the boards you can't expand
it so if you're not a fan of RGB and
you're one of those that are in the camp
like anti RGB I'm gonna stick it to them
by not buying anything with RGB this
would be one of those boards so if we
move up to a soos it's very similar you
get a picture of the board in fact this
box is kind of nice because it even
opens up there's no board in here but
even opens up and you'd be able to see
everything in there although in the
store wouldn't open hopefully got your
basic branding on the bottom these are
actually required by Intel if they're an
Intel board because it's kind of like
Apple with their you know Apple earpods
and iPod was iPad iPod iPhone ready or
whatever like the accessories so because
they are Intel brandon intel whatever
they're obviously they're in bits
chipset that's it yeah they've got to
put on here all these logos because
that's part of the licensing since they
are Intel product but as you can see I
hear it's very basic it just kind of
talks about now it does say gaming
motherboard it's there it's teeny but
it's there I mean you can technically
use this motherboard for anything
besides gaming if you wanted to but
they're gonna call it gaming centric
because it's got the lighting on here
it's got RGB it's got a lot of functions
gamers would want like lots of fan
headers obviously there are DB expansion
ports or headers on there this
particular motherboard actually has
water block built into the vrm but
there's not really anything on here that
would truly make it gaming I mean to be
honest it's got wireless Bluetooth lands
and there's nothing that makes it gaming
so that's kind of gimmick versus feature
number one anything that is branded
gaming is 100% a gimmick now let's how
about MSI I think that make great
hardware but I really think they need to
work on their advertising / branding
department because they kind of double
down on the gimmick marketing in my
opinion so for instance performance
gaming the reason why they have this one
here is because it has a little knob you
can turn that's supposed to
automatically overclock we'll talk about
in a minute here misuk light RGB we'll
talk about RGB separately in a second
here but V already this is the one we
saw everywhere in fact I'll even did an
amazing little skit about VR ready
tempered glass which was freakin amazing
if you haven't seen it you need to go
watch it he does it as I think that's
one of the early Lyle character days
look at the back of this oh my gosh VR
already as you see as guys got better
compatibility for better conformance on
performance on VR ready here's the
problem with anything branded VR ready
on a motherboard the motherboard doesn't
do in determining whether or not
it's VR ready
that's everything to do with the CPU and
more importantly the GPU the graphics
card is the single most important piece
in being v already so something else
that's a bit gimmicky that is going to
up the price on something like this is
we've got little name plates here that
you can change to put your own name on
them I guess said personality add
personality to it mystic light RGB again
we'll talk about that in a second audio
boost what this is basically saying is
that they've got an amplifier built into
their headphone output because a lot of
headphones like studio-grade headphones
require a lot of power to drive them
because they're high ohms high
resistance and so this is just saying
it's got better output for the amount of
power and they might have headphone that
it can drive with the factory or the
motherboard but most people who are
serious about sound anyway don't use
onboard they'll use a DAC or something
like that
what is this lightning USB okay that's
fine lightning ESPYs alright system
saver so it says three easy-to-use
options and boot system successfully
again so they've got some really bad
English on the back I wish they'd paid
someone to actually make sure this was
operating romantically correct the irony
of me saying that but I digress
basically it just means it has double
BIOS so if you flash a BIOS incorrectly
or shuts off during updating BIOS you
can get it back oh yeah right there what
the fast try death VR it's windows
compatible that's a good one and it's
gaming certified it's right there
gaming certified so the next thing we're
gonna talk about here is RGB now I'm
gonna I'm gonna be one of those people
that subscribe to the unpopular opinion
that are
g/b is not a bad thing what sucks about
RGB is the marketing behind it there has
been such a ridiculous push about RGB
that what was an amazing feature because
of choice it's been it's been soured by
the amount of just stupid marketing
behind it everyone's sick of the RGB
rainbow puke that at the shows like
Computex and CES and these just freakin
disco dancing and going crazy but let's
be honest that is the right way to
advertise what RGB is that's clearly not
a mode you need to leave it on it's nice
because RGB is not in my opinion a
gimmick because of the fact that you can
personalize it and make it what you want
but back in the day you could get white
green red or blue if you decided later
you want to go from red to green guess
what you're buying all new fans are
buying all new lights and it was kind of
a pain in the butt so being able to do
that when you want is a nice feature
what you guys are confused on being mad
about is the marketing behind it and I
agree hate the marketing because it's
terrible so I mentioned earlier gaming
and the problem with the word gaming is
that the word itself is a bit of a
gimmick because what we have right here
are four examples of graphics cards
where one is labeled gaming and one is
not and it's it's its competitor for
instance we've got the MSI gaming extra
hairy chest gaming in the name it's a
1650 which is slower than the Radeon rx
570 down here which doesn't actually
have gaming in the name anywhere another
example here where we have these Strix
gaming Vegas 64 versus the founders
edition 1080i which doesn't say gaming
anywhere on it and the 1080 Ti is faster
and it's one of those things where if
you were to kind and they're and they're
very similarly priced match to on these
graphics cards so if you were a new
buyer and you're building for the first
time and you're standing there looking
at these boxes he might be like to go
well I want to build a gaming computer
so I want the gaming one and that's
where the packaging itself and the
naming of some of this stuff can
completely confuse and disorient and
also mislead the buyer into thinking
they're getting something better simply
because it says the word gaming on it so
why do they say gaming typically we're
talking about aib cards which are add-in
boards which means these are third-party
manufacturers for the main designer of
the graphics card so in this case we've
got an Nvidia founders Edition 1080i and
two custom options here available from
one from MSI one from EBG
so what's changed is where all of these
GPU cores used to go to the
manufacturers to put into their graphics
cards where they would then bend them
and come up with their tiered system of
graphics card so for instance both of
these brands have a expensive model like
a medium model and a more entry-level
model where some of the feature sets
between the cards change they were all
Bend which meant the higher more
expensive cards would perform better and
potentially overclock better than any of
the lower-priced cards that all changed
when nvidia entered the space because
nvidia obviously kept all the best gps
for themselves why wouldn't you they
designed it they're manufacturing it of
course they want to be the best because
it's their name on it so they keep the
best which means the binning that the
AIB is received now is a lot less gapped
if that makes sense they're much more
similarly specs now in terms of what
their max frequencies and crash rates
and stuff were versus what Nvidia kept
so what happens now is you've got a
standard founders Edition card right
here complete with blower cooler and all
of that which in almost every single
case performed better when overclocked
then even their overclocking
counterparts from the AI B's and that's
no fault of theirs that's simply because
the way business is being done now with
Nvidia but what you're gonna find here
is a lot of even the overclocked
versions and this is where I'm kind of
moving on to gimmick versus function yes
it is functional it is indeed 20 to 50
megahertz faster than the the base model
but ever since GPU boost was introduced
as well they tend to go farther than
those numbers anyway and what you find
is when you start manually overclocking
these graphics cards they are within one
to two percent of each other from max
lock because you kind of find a more
consistent crash rate where they all
tend to sort of crash right around the
same frequency plus or minus like maybe
20 25 megahertz so where the difference
in performance between them is not
noticeable but what you do get with the
AI B's though is obviously very robust
coolers versus this the founder's
addition card at least back when we had
a single fan now they have dual fans
were significantly louder and hotter
than these cards where although these
cards may not have performed necessarily
any better than this when it comes to
performance of fps would they perform
better at
acoustics and thermals so what you found
is that there was still a lot of value
to have to these cards even though they
were a little bit more expensive than
one that could potentially overclock
farther in just about every instance
like I said though the founders Edition
cards that we received had the best
overclocks then even the cards built for
them there's that RGB again but that
brings us to our next kind of topic here
which is gaming mice in my opinion
what's more important than the level of
dpi which is you know sixteen thousand
versus eighty two hundred so that should
mean this one's twice as better as this
one right at twice as good I mean that's
that's not the way that this works in my
opinion which you should truly care
about is the weight of the mouse the
type of grip it is as are the claws of
the palm these are magnetic they come
off you can add weights which I've added
them in there like a heavy Mouse you can
use this tool to sort of change the
height of the pad in the back plus it's
ambidextrous like I said it's got the
same buttons on either side so these are
neat features that are not gimmicky in
my opinion but what is gimmicky is like
a lot of them muff they put on the box
right this has a 16,000 dpi sensor was
this has an 8200 with a 150 IPS or inch
per second do you know how fast you'd
have to be moving this mouse to cover
150 inches per second you'd be gaming
like this one of my favorite mouse mouse
mice mice nieces that I've ever had in
the past was just the basic Microsoft 3
button laser mouse that's it I
counter-strike day in and day out with
that Mouse then the Logitech came out
with their optical mouse which had that
kind of a crazy like dimpled looking
design on it and I yeah I the 518 I went
through like three of them what only
differentiates a basic office mouse from
a gaming mouse is a gaming mouse
actually has a crisper set a crisper
optic in it or sensor or laser that
gives you a little bit of fine control
so the last topic I want to talk about
here is gaming chairs you know you know
what these companies have done and the
reason why there's so many of them
popping up they're all they're all made
in China they're all made by the same
manufacturer with just different
stitching of name on there they took
cheap cheesy racing chairs like you
would find it like Pep Boys and threw it
on a base of like any regular office
chair
and called it a gaming chair sitting in
an office chair like a true office chair
like a Herman Miller or even in the
autonomous which I personally sit in at
both home and here at the studio which
is only three hundred dollars I say only
that's that's very cheap compared to
like the price of like a Herman Miller
or something like that the way chairs
are rated is in a twenty four-hour
rating and you have your twenty
four-hour chair you have an eight hour
chair for our chair six I mean the our
rating is where it's basically
considered economic and comfortable and
good for your posture at that time
reading if you guys have never
researched that going look at it's
actually a lot of science behind chairs
in their design there's no science and
no design behind a gaming chair
whatsoever and they've even gone as far
now to start putting RGB in gaming
racing chairs that is probably the most
triggering thing I've ever seen is like
these these gaming chairs and I've sat
in a few of them I have some that so
I've one sitting up there no one sits in
it at this studio even when guests come
over they'd rather sit in our IKEA a
little metal frame no pad chair than
that because they sit in it and they're
like this kind of sucks and I'm sure
plenty of you are sitting in your racing
chair right now watching this video
going hey hey hey I like my chair you
know it's your but you put it wherever
you want at the end of the day but I
find racing chairs to be extremely
gimmicky and that's why I'm only putting
this out there because if you're
shopping for a set up and you're putting
a new office together or our man cave or
a gaming room or whatever you owe it to
yourself to at least go and sit in some
proper ergonomic chairs because trust me
when I say you're but in your back are
gonna thank you at the end of the day so
anyway that's just some I don't want to
make this video for a while and because
it's gonna spark discussion it's gonna
spark arguments too but it's gonna spark
discussion and I'm really curious as to
what you guys think as the consumer on
what the true gimmicks versus features
are every see every single gimmick is
pretty much based off of a functional
feature but features can also be
gimmicky too so guys tell me what you
think down in the comments below or head
on over to Twitter at JC sense let me
know what you guys think is a gimmick
and what's an actual function you can't
live without
thanks for watching guys and we'll see
you in the next one I really hope I
didn't break this mouse I really like
