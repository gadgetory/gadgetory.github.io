gonna continue our summer months of
cooling series something I do every
single summer and something I've always
wanted to test I've never had the
opportunity to now is a cross-flow
radiator versus a standard dual pass
radiator in which one is actually better
or does it make a difference at all
hopefully we can find out today and put
all of the guesswork to bed is that
right so how you say that stuff I don't
know we're gonna test it today's video
is sponsored by audible and these summer
months are known as the travel months
and that has definitely been true for me
this summer in fact next week I am
heading on vacation to Washington DC and
that is a five and a half hour plane
ride so I'm gonna be listening to a new
title personally I'm a huge fan of their
self-help section and I'm gonna be
checking out barking up the wrong tree
by Erik Barker it's the surprising
science behind why everything you know
about success is mostly wrong but
audible has a huge library of pretty
much any type of book that you can
imagine self-help romance Science and
Technology fiction and the best part
about audible is every single month you
get credit for a free book that is yours
to keep regardless of price right now if
you sign up for audible using my link in
the description below that's audible.com
slash Jays two cents you get a free
audiobook and a 30-day free trial and if
you happen to be an Amazon Prime member
and sign up in the month of July
you get three months for the price of
one swear you guys waiting for head to
audible.com slash Jays two cents or just
text Jay's two cents to five hundred 500
okay so huge thanks to alpha cool for
sending me of these radiators both of
these are I believe s t 30 there are 30
mil thick rads they're the same thin
density they're the exact same core the
only difference here obviously is the
end tanks and the way that the fluid
flows now for you to understand what
we're testing here basically a cross
flow radiator you can see all the fluid
goes in one side it goes through all the
different rows at the same time and then
exits on the opposite side so it makes
one pass through the radiator where a
dual pass radiator which you see right
here which is what like 95 percent or
more of the radiators on the market are
enter in one fitting they go through
half of the radiator they make a
90-degree turn down here at the end of
the radiator and go back the other way
and then exit so basically the fluid is
only actually running through half the
rat at one time in either direction and
so basically if you took this radiator
split it down the middle and stretched
it out that's what the cross flow on it
would look like so theoretically what
you're going to get here is also two
different pressure drops this would have
a lot less pressure buildup in the
radiator because you have way more flow
whereas this is going to have a little
bit more pressure but the fluid is going
to spend a little more time in the
radiator so the true test here is
whether or not having half the flow rate
but twice the time spent in the radiator
versus twice the flow rate and half the
time theoretically I don't think the
math is linear like that but pretty
close we're gonna see if there's any
sort of differences but first we've got
to actually fill these rads and that's
the best part about having quick
disconnects like this is you can easily
just change out components and stuff now
one of the things we're gonna be testing
here is not just CPU with my 8700 k
we're also gonna hook the Poseidon up to
it and see how it does when we actually
saturate the radiator I don't think
either the Poseidon or the CPU on its
own is going to exceed the thermal
capacity of either of these two setups
so that's why we're gonna try both
independently and then we're gonna put
it all together as one loop and we're
gonna see how well it actually does and
then maybe we'll put both radiators
together and see if it makes a daring
the temps down even more
that's we'll see how that goes but now
we're just gonna fill up this rad nice
and easy that's the best part about
having these quick disconnects as you
can see just how easy it is to fill
it's nice see you can easily get all of
our air out of there so we're just gonna
do this now for all of my components
which is gonna make it really easy for
me to obviously switch out these parts
for these tests okay so we're gonna
start off with our baseline test that's
gonna be with these standard cross flow
or not cross flow but dual pass radiator
that we're all used to I'm also using
two Corsair SP 120 quiet Edition fans
which are max at 1200 rpm
they are running 100% because we are
testing the full cooling capability and
thermal capacity of these radiators in
their current configs I'm also running
just the 8700 K in the loop right now
we'll add the GPU to it in a moment
we're gonna let the temperature and the
fluid temp equalize over here using OCC
T medium data sets on our sit 8700 K
that is technically not overclocked but
it does have a sink all cores going
which means all cores are running at the
turbo clock not just the the two cores
that are being tasked with the core
whatever the most intense threat is so
it's a slight overclock just in that all
the cores are allowed to ramp up so
we're gonna let the temperature kind of
equalize see however long that takes and
then we're gonna hook up the GPU to it
and that will be our baseline with just
the standard type of radiator now I
usually will recommend a single 120 per
component if you just want water cooling
and you're not planning overclocking you
want for the sake of being quiet that's
why you also see GPUs will ship with the
a iOS attached with a single 120 read
because four GPUs - that's just more
than enough so having a 240 on here is
kind of the upper limit of where I would
push the thermal capacity of radiators
so that's one of the reasons why we're
doing this test - so if we do both CPU
and GPU on one radiator and then we get
a significantly different result on
another type of radiator that's the same
size with the same components well then
we can draw our conclusions from that so
that is our methodology we're gonna let
the temperatures do their thing and
we'll come back when we do our switch
all right so it's been running for just
under 20 minutes if you look at the max
temps right here these are the spikes
every now and then if you take a look at
the chart right there see how that just
spiked up really high and came right
back down
these are those spikes and the
isn't really indicative of the the total
experience I mean you can see mostly
these are in the upper 80s one core is
in the low 81 C but all the way up to 89
C on one of the cores but if we look at
the real time this is what we care about
and just like I was expecting it's
sitting anywhere in the 60s to the mid
70s and then our actual CPU socket is
sitting at 72 C so these are the numbers
we care about right here and it's been
running long enough now for the loop to
have equalized in fact the radiators not
even that warm it's just because we do
have more thermal capacity in that rad
than what's actually making it out of
the CPU and we talked about that how
deleting and that's why people do it
this is not ideally that CPU this is
still very indicative of what buying one
and just putting in a PC would be like
it's one of the reasons why I happen I
do not deal it my stuff when I do these
tests because then that doesn't really
tell you the whole story so we're gonna
do right now is we're gonna add the GPU
to the loop and we're gonna see what the
max GPU temp is gonna be I'm expecting
it to probably be in the mid to upper
40s possibly even the low 50s I'm not
entirely sure this is a Poseidon so it's
not like your typical full cover block
it is a full block on here but it's not
like an ek water block or anything like
that which is usually gonna be a little
bit better with the reason why we're
using the Poseidon it's the only way
we're gonna be able to do a direct
apples-to-apples comparison because if
we don't have it hooked up into the loop
like if we took one of my just full
water-cooled cards then we'd be
switching GPUs back and forth all day
long and I think if we're just using one
set up that doesn't change it gives us a
better example of what to expect now I'm
gonna try and actually do this with it
running I'm wondering if I can do this
fast enough okay here we go and
turn back on oh and never even got past
like the 40s
okay well now the GPU is in the loop you
can see it all flowing yeah so quick
disconnects all right so look at this
right here you see all this crazy
up-and-down something ran in the
background for a second there but we're
back to normal
47 C is where we kept out on the you
flow by a double pass whatever radiator
you want to call it I mean it's pretty
standard rad and remember our CPU was at
high 60s low 70s so now we're gonna run
the exact same test on the cross flow I
think it just hit 48 right now so I'm
gonna go ahead and just let this coolant
come back down though I'm gonna turn
this off I'm gonna let it cool off and
my predictions I really do not think
anything is gonna change I think we were
gonna get the exact same results and I
kind of hope I'm wrong but that's my
prediction I think we're gonna get the
same results
yeah something else worth pointing out
though is we stayed well below the
temperature threshold where the fans on
the Poseidon will actually turn on so
everything cooling wise was down
specifically to the radiator all right
now we can switch it been running for 20
minutes and I gotta tell you it looks
pretty much the same actually if you
look at this I'm seeing more 60s and 70s
if I recall maybe Phil can put up a
side-by-side but this appears to be
maybe just a couple of degrees lower but
if we look at the spikes in temp so one
of the cores did actually hit 90 and I
think the spikes might be overall
slightly higher but this is not enough
for us to actually be able to draw a
conclusion does cross flow cool better
or worse than a standard double pass
radiator so you know the routine we got
to put it under load with the GPU we
know that graphics cards will saturate
and have much more focused heat because
the block is in direct contact with the
GPU die
we're talking way more wattage 250 plus
Watts on this graphics card versus about
a hundred watts or so on the CPU so
that's what really makes these tests
more beneficial to do with a graphics
card so again I'm gonna try and do this
with it running so that's the end that
gonna be unaffected this is the out and
I need to turn off the pump that would
have been bad you were hoping you were
gonna let me do it okay go go I'm
getting good at this they need to be
eight there's be a competition for this
so you can do this faster and better
it's tough same drill as before heaven
benchmark for K 8x MSAA it's been
running now it's not going up any higher
and we are at 47 see the exact same
clock we're at before a hundred percent
on the GPU and here is the cross flow
radiator so you know I think here here's
the deal maybe a 120 radiator might show
a slight difference I don't know I don't
even know if they make a cross flow 120
if you wanna know the truth but here is
kind of my takeaway from this you cut
these end tanks off the core between
both of these radiators is identical
they are the exact same core which is
ultimately what's going to be giving us
our thermal capacity of the loop now
this being within margin of error the
exact same number as this one tells me
that the nice thing about the Crossville
radiator is you have an option if I were
doing a small form-factor build there
are times I would love a cross-flow
radiator because the radiator itself
becomes the relocating of a fitting so
you don't have a tube going across the
case to bring it into another component
or to your rat or we're not your add but
to your pump or your reservoir or
whatever I would love to use this in
small form-factor the only caveat to
that is if you look you have a much
smaller end tank on the side of the
standard 240 versus the cross flow these
both stick out the approximate thickness
of where the fitting is which could then
kind of count be counterproductive and
the whole concept of using it in a cross
flow or a small form-factor case now my
theory on why this is I think has been
kind of proven here is that yes we are
actually spending less time in the
radiator because it's flowing through
much more quickly but you have much less
pressure drop which means that the
actual flow rate is increased so if you
flow through the radiator less per pass
but you get more passes per minute it's
still the same so that's that's my
theory as to why this doesn't show any
difference so the reason why we did this
video is when I asked alpha cool if
there was any thermal difference to this
or any temperature difference they went
we actually don't know why don't you
test that for us so that's why we did
this so guys thanks for watching
summer is one of those times I love to
do a lot of cooling videos and since
I've inspired so many people to water
cool I want to get as much information
out there as I can so if you have a
suggestion for a video that we should do
regarding summertime temps and keeping
your system in check put it in the
comments below or better yet tweet it to
me at J's two cents on Twitter guys
thanks for watching and as always we
will see you in the next one like I
can't even find a pixel like okay be
running best attempt again I mean what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
