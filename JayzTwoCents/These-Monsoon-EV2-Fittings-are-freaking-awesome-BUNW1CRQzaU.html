California and that is a abnormal to say
the least by hearing all that water
trickled down put me in the mood to do a
water cooling video actually where I'm
talking specifically today about
monsoons new eb-2 fitting performance
pcs has sent me a smorgasbord of these
fittings to check out and I thought that
this would be the perfect opportunity to
go ahead and do that since all the water
is falling from the sky which is rare it
just puts me in the mood boy oh boy oh
boy oh boy oh boy it's Christmas can't
wait but wait wait wait will you wait
guys he came he came what time is it
guys I got a fractal design Calvin s 36
oh no it is like way too early for this
I'll get the coffee okay huh jeepers a
custom built by J's to set aside a
fractal design and define an OS pedal of
the holidays golly a fractal design core
500 yeah
guys look my party for days this is what
makes it all worth
this season's for the ones you love with
the gift of Awesomeness happy holidays
from fractal design we go and tell you
guys real quickly why I'm excited to
share these Eevee two fittings with you
guys we live in a world where the well
pretty much the entire world uses one
unit of measure and the United States
uses something different yes of course
I'm talking about Imperial versus
standard and here's the problem you've
got two manufacturers out there and
you've got parts coming from all over
the world but the problem is you've got
half inch tube and you've got sixteen
millimeter tube and thirteen millimeter
tube and three eighths too but the
problem is if you guys know anything
about measurements 3/8 and metric or
whatever don't actually equate they are
not the same size and depending on the
manufacturing tolerances of the fittings
that you choose they may not fit if you
take say a 13 millimeter tube or fitting
and try and made it with a half-inch
tube or vice versa
yeah it's not always going to fit you
guys remember that's why I didn't end up
using glass be skunkworks which I'm
holding a 16 millimeter glass tube my
hand right here but I didn't use glass
specifically because as I showed it
didn't fit it didn't fit in the damn
fitting and I had a lot of problems
there but Monsoon solved that problem
and here's how now what I've got here is
a little bit of a smorgasbord when it
comes to fittings here because a
Performa species actually sent this to
me and they do have an engraving service
to where they can do they can do custom
engraving on these fittings like this
one right here we're looking at this is
actually a J's two cents engraved one
they did that on their own that's kind
of neat I always want to show me how
some of their engraving works because
he's our brass fittings though you can
see they're kind of a goldish color
underneath there so it looks kind of
neat against especially darker colored
fittings like here's a brass collar here
as you can see it's sort of a zebra
print there's another design here that
they did so if you guys are doing a
custom build and you've got a logo or
something for a channel or whatever then
you guys can really take this to the
next level and customize here we got
skull that's a skull that's cool
but there are a ton of colors available
now this kit also comes in two different
sizes and we'll talk a little bit more
about that specifically in a minute but
we've got
so many different color options here
it's really neat uh so any themed bill
that you guys are doing they've pretty
much got you covered a few different
white ones there yeah he's just like I'm
not kidding when I said they sent me a
smorgasbord of fittings my goodness they
just keep coming
most of these are colors actually by hey
Wow okay this is fun now we're just
gonna just do it I like the gold too
that's kind of a neat color when do a
gold build someday so we've got a black
chrome here as well
it's really sharp looking as you can see
compared to silver here or nickel this
is what the black one looks like now
installation this is pretty damn simple
so you've got this little card that it
comes with right here and as you can see
it says insert tube into slot obviously
we're referring to our water cooling
tube guys keep it clean the reason why
you do this is you want to see if the
tube touches the red area or the white
area right there on the card so if I
insert my 16 millimeter glass tube right
here I can see that it touches the red
area only and does not overlap into the
white area the reason why that matters
is they send two different sized o rings
while overing kits that go with these
fittings the red and the white so since
it only touches the red I'll use the red
bag and the reason for that is they are
two different sizes now these fittings
here actually cover a range there's two
sets are just two sizes you can buy from
monsoon the smaller size covers eleven
point eight to thirteen point two
millimeters so as you can see that
doesn't matter if you've got an imperial
tube or a standard tube a twelve
millimeter a thirteen millimeter tube or
half inch outer diameter tube you'll
have to worry about them not fitting
inside the fitting the bigger size which
I have right here actually covers 15
point two to sixteen point two
millimeter because we're now starting to
see bigger rigid tubing being used in
builds copper tubes this is a 16
millimeter glass tube that I'm using for
the sake of demonstration here but you
could use this for copper tubing metal
tubing anything that's rigid that is
within that size range is going to fit
in these fittings that's what I think is
really cool is it kind of solves the
issue of oh crap I've got standard
fittings and Imperial tube yeah you
don't worry about that anymore since I
have a tube that fits in the red I'm
going to be using the red here now
inside the back here you've got these
little tapered collars you've got more
than you
we need to give you a few extras which
is kind of neat that way it's not like
you have six fittings in here and you
get six of these you lose one you're
screwed nope there's extra probably cost
them only a couple pennies to put
together these kits at cost so who knows
but anyway it's got a tapered side right
there you want to be noted mindful of
that we'll talk about that in a second
and you're going to use two o-rings per
fitting the reason why is our two
grooves inside of the fitting right here
that you're going to be putting the
o-rings in so that your tube has
something to seal against they're
actually pretty easy to install they
they sort of want to work their way in
the groove all on their own you don't
have to really finagle them too much
they kind of do their own thing anyway
so I just got that one it's stuck there
we go so that one's in there now it's in
the first groove so then we'll go ahead
and take this o-ring
and it will work its way into the second
groove so then you end up with something
just like that so the next thing I'm
going to do is you're going to take now
ideally this fitting would already be
installed on whatever it is you're going
to be you know putting it on a water
block graphics card pump whatever you're
not gonna be doing this freely in the
air like I am but for the sake of
demonstration so next you're gonna do is
you're going to take your tube but just
sort of give it a gentle twist as you
insert it ladies did I have to do that
yes absolutely
I absolutely had to say that so that's
locked in and seated all the way at the
bottom of the compression fitting right
there and then we're going to take this
tapered collar which I showed you
earlier and with the taper facing the
fitting so facing down we're going to
slide it over the tube down to the
fitting like that then we take our
compression collar slide it down and
then we can tighten that down so like I
said if it was on a water block or
whatever would be tighten it like that
and then if you want to get a really
good if you wanna get nice and snug they
also include this tool and then these
grooves on here that you can use to
tighten as well but I I don't recommend
going too tight one you don't want to
crush the tube and two you don't want to
Mar up your pretty anodized fitting and
then last but not least because you
don't want to get a leak at the bottom
of your fitting this is this should
actually be done first with whatever
you're stalling it on you take one of
the small thick o rings and then you put
it over the bottom of the fitting like
that there's a groove that it fits in
and that is so that the fitting
then seal against whatever it is you've
installed it on so there you go you guys
can see there's a compression fitting
that now in club covers both Imperial
and standard sizes and now you're not
left thinking to yourself aw crap I got
the wrong sizes but you might be left
with yourself going well that's a
handsome fitting right there like I said
this isn't a J's $0.02 edition fittings
or anything like that this is just
something that they did to show that
custom builds have custom options if you
go in order that through performance pcs
so this is actually the first Monsoon
fitting I've taken a look at in about
four years the last time I used any
monsoon fittings was for soft tubing
there's a very similar design to this
actually for soft tubing and it was on a
really high-end custom client bill but I
had done I'm really impressed with these
fittings and I think because of the
especially the options for the custom
engraving like this and with the whole
Old Spice name bill coming up for Terry
Crews and the color options available I
think we might have actually found our
our fittings anyway I know I'll think
about it but these might end up being
the fittings I decide to use on the
Terry Crews build but anyway thanks for
watching today guys let me know what you
guys think about these fittings the dual
or in construction as well as that
locking our tapered collar it's very
very unlikely that you would develop a
leak with these fittings now that
nothing is a hundred-percent leak proof
but the concept of getting a leak with
these fittings is a tough one because
there it's got like I said double
insulation on the o-rings and it's they
fit so snug and because the fit is
custom with the fitment of the o-rings
you don't have to worry about trying to
jam a tube that's a little bit too thick
for the hole and worry about cutting or
damaging the o-ring by just trying to
get into place which is usually where
leaks will occur sometimes cutting the
o-ring inserting the tube into the
fitting anyway guys thanks for watching
hope you guys enjoyed today's video hope
you've learned something here a little
bit smarter now when it comes to water
cooling and you definitely go and check
out the EB 2 months in fittings price
wise - they're very comparable to the
other fittings on the market but they
give you options and custom fitment
alright I'm yeah Murray now time to go
guys
thanks for watching I'll see you next
