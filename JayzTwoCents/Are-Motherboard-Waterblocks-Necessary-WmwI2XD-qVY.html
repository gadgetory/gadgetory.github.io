I want to point out yes I do know that
my GPU loop is a little bit lower than
my CPU loop it takes longer for this
loop to bleed because I have two
radiators on its side and then once it
completely bled I just haven't topped it
off yet today's topic is something I'm
actually asked a lot about in my inbox
especially since doing the build block
on the latest skunkworks
4.6 to 8b I don't know I lost track of
what version we're on and that's going
to be motherboard water blocks are they
necessary do you need them should you
use them or are they all just for show
April is creative rewards month over at
videoblocks and for a limited time they
have a special offer where you can get a
one-year subscription for only 99 bucks
that's 90 percent off the normal rate
but it doesn't stop there because not
only do you get access to their
unlimited download library of a hundred
and fifteen thousand Adobe After Effects
Clips backgrounds templates motion
graphics you also get a 1-year access to
their audio blocks library of over a
hundred thousand sound clips
royalty-free music sound effects to make
your content just as good as it could
possibly be a one-year membership to
video blocks including a one-year
membership to audio blocks that is a
no-brainer for content creators
now those two videos I want you to check
out if you haven't seen before we
actually do this and that one is going
to be the how to install a motherboard
water block and you're going to find
that right about here and then the other
one being the final build log for the
skunkworks version 4.36
to be or whatever version I said it was
you can find that right here that way
you're up to speed on what parts and
stuff are being used but I get this
quite often and any time I make some
sort of a main change to skunkworks my
inbox on all of my social media
platforms and stuff which you should be
following by the way especially with a
giveaway coming up here is is it really
necessary did you have to put in a vrm
water block did you see any differences
why would you want to do that so today
that's what we're going to cover because
it's not something I've ever really
talked about in depth now before you can
understand what the vrm blocks are doing
you have to understand what a VRM is
on your motherboards and your graphics
cards vrm stands for voltage regulator
module now you have 12 volts being sent
out of your power supply I actually have
a 12 volt side a 5 volt side and a 3.3
volt side but we can talk about that
later when you've got 12 volts being
sent over to the CPU socket trust me
your CPU is not using 12 volts in fact
my CPU right here is using 1.3 volts
which is over volted for an overclock
typically it's going to be more like
1.09 5 or 1.1 when it comes to intel's
you know turbo speeed step on AMD it
tends to use a little bit more about 1.3
5 to one point four and overclocks get
closer to 1.5 volts so clearly 12 volts
is not being made its way to the CPU if
it did your CPU would go top just like
that with a nice little puff of blue
smoke and that unforgettable smell of
fried electronics fried hopes and dreams
and green money that you should have
just burned because it would have been
more climactic than hearing the little
pop of a CPU explode I've done it before
it's kind of fun but that smell it
lingers and it's a reminder of failure
so the vrm or the voltage regulator
module is responsible for stepping down
the voltage to the level at which it
needs to be used so in the CPUs case
you're stepping 12 volts down to 1.3 or
1.2 or 1 foot 1 or whatever now the
amount of phases you have as we talked
about in a different motherboard video
that you guys can check out on my
channel each one of those phases is
another filter for stepping down that
voltage you get nice steady supply you
don't want that voltage fluctuating a
whole bunch you want it to be steady now
because you have to take all that
voltage and step it down that energy has
to go somewhere and what happens is it
translates into heat the module the
module gets really really hot the
voltage is turned into heat and then
it's basically dissipated into the
atmosphere
it's literally wasted but that heat has
to be handled and it has to go somewhere
now normally on the motherboard you have
a heatsink and me and there's no fan or
anything on there what's responsible for
removing that heat from the case are the
case fans or any fans you place inside
your system blowing air onto them or the
motherboard or whatever the problem is
VRMs can get very hot and then the heat
sinks can become very inefficient and
then sending that heat into
your case can heat up everything inside
your case especially things on the
motherboard around the VRM and even the
CPU itself so when you add a water block
to the VRM you are taking all of that
heat and adding it to your water loop
usually what your CPU loop is connected
to and then you are sending that to the
radiator and out into the atmosphere and
most of that heat is not actually making
it inside the case which is keeping
things cooler as a whole now one of the
common questions I get associated with
VR m-mother now one of the common
questions I get about VRM water blocks
is do they aid in the stability of
overclocking well I think that's really
going to depend on your particular
situation if you live in a very hot
climate and your vrm start to get too
hot they can become unstable and not do
a good job at filtering that voltage
step down to whatever your ending
voltage is and what leads to instability
is not so much the V RMS are hot but
because the voltage is fluctuating and
CPUs don't really like fluctuating
voltage when they go under load they
want that power delivery to be constant
and they don't want it fluctuate
fluctuating around because sudden dips
or V droop can lead to instability
because when your CPU is under load it
needs every bit of power that it feels
it needs and if for sudden suddenly it
doesn't get it you either will get a
random restart shutdown blue screen
whatever form of instability you might
have the higher the overclock usually it
can lead to just a flat out system
freezer crash now vrm water blocks are
typically not needed they are the V RMS
are designed to run hot I mean when the
engineers designed this stuff they know
it's going to run hot they tried to put
adequate cooling on there but what
really helps in vrm temperatures more so
than just water cooling them or having a
BP heatsink is how many phases there are
because the more phases the more split
that power is that power step-down is
and as a whole they can run cooler but
most people will put vrm other blocks or
even chipset water blocks like here on
skunkworks more of an aesthetic thing
I'll be honest I did it because I think
it looks cool I like to water cool I
like to do custom stuff with water
cooling so I want it to look as blingy
as possible but it is something that can
help overall in overclocking stability
if you live in a very hot client
let's say you live somewhere like you
know in Australia or India or North
Africa or whatever wherever you are guys
everywhere has hot temperatures some
hotter than others but the as the air
temperature is hotter going through your
case the less heat can actually absorb
and remove so that's where water cooling
as a whole would be more beneficial than
even just water cooling the VRMs now
chipset cooling to me that's just the
niche that's just a hey we've got blocks
going everywhere why don't we just throw
a block on the chipset as well the
chipsets tend to not get too too hot in
fact some mean chipsets have a very thin
heatsink on there they're underneath the
graphics card half the time most those
graphics cards are even blowing hot air
on top of the chipset heatsink and it's
not really going to be a problem that's
really ultimately just one of those
things that really comes down to the
bling factor is our downside to running
motherboard water blocks well it really
depends on the motherboard for instance
my gigabyte board here didn't have a
monoblock or one block that's designed
to mount to the CPU that also touches
the BRM EK i started making mono blocks
for many motherboards where it's one
block that handles BRM and CPU now
they're a little bit more expensive but
they're cheaper than getting a CPU block
and a vrm block and chipset block all
together in fact on ITX boards they've
made even monoblocks that touch
everything on the motherboard chipset
CPU and vrm which cuts costs down even
more but in my case here with the
gigabyte SOC champion it was an
additional 115 dollars to get the
motherboard water-cooled typically
that's not going to be worth it to most
people but if you're doing some sort of
an aesthetic build then it definitely
helps make it look better and if you're
doing you know enthusiast builds like
this looks our chest is important as
practicality now ultimately you have to
make the decision on whether or not
that's something that's interesting to
you or something that's worth it to you
it's your money I can't tell you 100
bucks is worth it to you when it might
be to me that is purely subjective based
on your situation and only you can
answer that but at what I wanted to
address in today's video was the
practicality and the necessity of it
versus the bling and just the eye candy
and I do find motherboard water blocks
to be more towards the spectrum of bling
and eye candy versus you know a
necessity or practicality
guys I hope today's talking head video
where we talked about motherboard water
blocks was helpful to you again this is
a topic pulled straight out of my inbox
if I get enough requests to do certain
videos I will definitely do them as you
saw today so if there's more things you
want to know about water cooling pcs
overclocking gaming graphics cards
whatever make sure you put it down in
the description also too down there you
can find links to Amazon affiliate codes
which really do help the channel I know
everyone says use my Amazon use my
Amazon but I'm going to say using Amazon
affiliate code for the youtuber you
think deserves it most even if that's
not me but if that happens to be me the
links are down there and every little
bit helps and I certainly appreciate
that
