of the video I just got back from New
York City on business and look what
arrived while I was gone
daddy never block it could be for
mommies to carry block decided to go
ahead and send us a couple of nerve
blocks this one's mine it's got the
adult stuff in there remember grown-up
stuff not adult stuff the girl nerve
block and the boy nerve block no we were
kind of surprised by this because they
saw our video last month and they saw
how when you thought it might have been
boy stuff in there how you said you like
boy toys can be like boys but they don't
like girls toys so I thought it was nice
of them to bring me a boy nerve lot to
this kid wasn't even rehearsed today
we're gonna take a look at girls nerd
box boy nerve blocks adult nerve blocks
and a surprise for you guys so since
you've been waiting all all week while I
was gone I figured we'll go ahead and
get started
and we will open up which one you want
the boy wonder the girl won all right
we're gonna go ahead and start with the
boy one so I'll take the girl one and
we'll just toss that aside I'm gonna
open it up and then wait what we have
one to send to you and Danny didn't
wanna even though it was a boy one so I
hope you're happy cuz we're sending one

surprise was that there was one to give
away to you guys I might as well go
ahead and show him now
they sent us foreign hurt blocks this
month one for me and one to give away to
you guys so we'll talk about that at the
end of the video thanks for ruining the
surprise booger I just want to say this
real quick cuz there was some confusion
in the last video

including Europe Canada they're based in
Canada America and you can go to their
website nerdblock calm and you can
figure out where they send to but they
send all over the world so there's no
question about whether or not oh I wish
