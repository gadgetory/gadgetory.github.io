reservoir custom GPU block or a complete
loop and a box output Kools wide range
of products can make your next water
cooling adventure and easy one click the
link in the description for more details
and we'll go ahead and start right here
in the front of the case which is
probably one of the biggest differences
is it has a piano finish here for the
control panel I call the control panel
because it's got your audio mic input
reset button power it's got three USB a
USB type-c connector as well as fan and
LED control buttons it does have
built-in fan and LED modules and we'll
talk about that in a second but check
this out right here on the front it does
actually have five and a quarter
expansion bays and the way you access
them is not by a swinging door which has
always kind of been a point of
contention amongst cases that have doors
people either love or hate them and the
reason being is depending what side of
the desk they might be on the door might
open in such a way that it blocks your
access to it or it might not even have a
chance to open if it swings out at all
if it's in some sort of a cubby then the
door just as a problem and I've actually
doubled that in the past with some of my
older cases that I used
so what Coolermaster has done is they've
made this a little flip down and as its
flipped forward it gives you access to
the two five and a quarter expansion
bays as well as access to the grill so
you can blow out dust from your fans and
whatnot and the thing actually comes off
pretty easy too with just basic push
tabs and think pops off you can clean it
and stick it right back on but that's
pretty neat because no matter where the
case is now as long live access to the
front of it you have access to your
expansion bays and your fan filters now
we're going to go ahead and move on to
the top of the case which was another
point of contention on the original case
mastercase 5 was the fact that it had
enough height to support radiators in
all one water cooling loops but it did
not come factory that way did not come
with the bracket that you needed to
mount the radiator you could mount fans
in there if you wanted Coolermaster is
now supported this out of the box and as
you can see this top piece right here is
actually just held on by a magnet and
here is the top of the case once again
you also have this little cover right
here that opens up a filter so if you're
not using top mounted fans which
actually is not the way this comes
pre-configured there are no fans on the
top it comes with the bracket right here
is you
can see allow you to mount your radiator
to it or if you have the existing master
case five not the newest version you can
upgrade your old one to these new
features same thing with the front piece
right here this door that flips forward
you can buy this piece right here
separate if you want to upgrade your
older case as well so that's kind of a
good thing in my opinion but it does
come with the radiator bracket on top
pre-installed but no pre-existing fans
it does come with two 140 millimeter
fans in the front and a 140 millimeter
exhaust fan so it's supporting positive
pressure the way it ships as well now
moving on to the inside of the case this
is where it's going to be pretty much
unchanged there's not really anything
different going on here with the
exception of the fact that it now
includes an LED light bar that is by the
way magnetic so you can mount this
pretty much anywhere you want because
this is a steel case so it will stick to
the top or the bottom wherever you want
to put it now when it comes to drive
bake your drive cages you can expand
these you can buy more to put more and
if you want you can see right here
there's more room as I make the chicken
arm there is more room right here for
you to put another drive cage if you
want but I pre-installed this here with
a X power motherboard from MSI it's the
titanium version it's a full sized ATX
motherboard we've got a full size GTX
1080 in here
I even included a master watt 1200 power
supply in the bottom here to show that
even though it's a mid tower case you
can fit full length high wattage power
supplies and still have plenty of room
for the full modular cables right here
as well as have enough room for the
bends and even to put excess cables down
though that you don't need and because
the case is sitting so far off the
ground even if this was sitting on
carpet you could have the fan on this
pointing down
so that the power supply is pulling its
own air and has its own little air
environment without it affecting
anything else in the case which is kind
of neat but you can see right here
there's plenty of room for SLI graphics
cards you've got your mounts right here
for your SSD cages you know if you've
got nice SSDs you're going to mount them
here and you're going to show them off
let's face it but you also have grommets
right here that allow pass through for
your PCIe power cable so you don't have
to try and route them through the back
of the motherboard and then make a funky
Bend you can come straight up out of
here with them if you want to keep the
cable routing more direct and a lot less
if you will if you've got a power supply
that's got real stiff cable sleeving
then you know that trying to make sharp
bends with them can sometimes be a real
pain in the ass so they've definitely
taken care of that but in terms of water
cooling support because without
something I like to take a look at you
it does support a 120 on the back or
potentially a 140 radiator if it's not
too thick if it's too thick it might
interfere with the side right here so
you definitely would want to check
clearance before you do that on the top
it will fit a 240 millimeter radiator
and some 280 millimeter radiators once
again if they're really thick not in
terms of thickness but in terms of
widths sometimes they have extra width
on them then it may not fit so once
again you want to check your clearance
on that but if you do remove this drive
cage right here then you have access to
install another 240 or 280 millimeter
radiator on the front so you can
actually fit two 280s in this thing
which means you would have more than
enough radiator to actually cool a CPU
and two graphics cards if you want it
and then you could even mount your small
like laying DDC pump
down here on the bottom run tubes up
through here if you wanted or mount them
right here on this mid tray and get rid
of the SSD trays if you wanted to so
there are some flexibility options on
there when it comes to water cooling
given how much you can actually fit in
here that it's even though it's a mid
tower case is I think kind of a big deal
I might actually have to try doing a
full custom water cooling loop in this
in the future just to see how much you
can fit in there now in terms of
graphics card support you can see right
here I have a full length 1080 in there
and it fits no problem but it does get
kind of close to the hard drive cage so
if you are going to leave the hard drive
cage installed you're not going to be
able to fit big giant behemoth graphics
cards like this ZOTAC amp extreme
because as you can see it does impact on
the cage and I cannot install it but if
you did get rid of this cage and say you
only had your SSDs here and a couple of
hard drives that you can mount down here
on the bottom you can take this cage out
and then you can put any length graphics
card in there dual length graphics cards
like the 295x2 the Titan Z whatever long
graphics cards would fit in there
without any sort of problem now moving
on to the back of the case right here
this is where you start to see some
really nice built in features they've
got a recessed channel right here with
velcro straps allowing you to run your
cables through here without binding up
and getting too thick
the back panel to actually slide back on
if you've ever built a computer and you
know that you have a lot of excess cable
if there's not a lot of room between the
motherboard tray in the back case panel
then you know that sometimes getting
them to fit could be a problem you've
also got plenty of room right here to
actually put cables if you need as well
or you can stuff them down here in the
bottom but as you can see right here it
also can include this module which is a
LED and fan control module which is used
by those buttons on the front of the
case which I already showed you so it's
got specific LED mountings right here
you've got four of them so you can add
additional LEDs to this as well as one
two three four five six fan slots that
are going to support three pin fans so
you can control the fan speed on the
front of the case without having to use
software or anything like that this is
also something that's available separate
from Coolermaster if you want to add
this to another case so you can
definitely keep that in mind but look at
the size of this motherboard cutout
right here there's going to be no
problem getting to the back of your
motherboard to do things like cooler
installations waterblock installation no
problem whatsoever
but all of that is nice but none of that
is what I think is the coolest accessory
yet for this case and let me show you
that right now
now like I said earlier in this video I
like side panels but the problem is
usually they're made out of some sort of
acrylic or soft plastic and they scratch
really easy you spray them with Windex
you wipe them with even a soft
microfiber or cotton and they scratch
over time there's swirl marks everywhere
and then your LED lighting all it does
is light up and accentuate all of the
scratches in your side panel
well coolermaster has actually come up
with a replacement side panel here that
you can purchase which is a tempered
glass this is actually a glass side
panel and it looks freakin amazing
because you know or maybe you don't know
glass side panels actually do not
scratch very easily and it even has this
key right here that you can use to lock
the panel in place so it's not going to
accidentally fall and break and as you
can see then your entire side panel is
become glass and not just the the
portion of the window that shows like on
the plastic side panel because as you
can see the plastic side panel here
still has that frame the tempered glass
one does not and this thing looks
phenomenal yeah I I'm actually going to
now probably look at doing two
for glass for skunk works because it
looks amazing
unfortunately it weighs like a metric
but tonight not that heavy obviously but
it is heavy now it is a tempered glass
which means if you drop it it's going to
shatter so be careful with it we're
going to take a look at the whole line
of maker products I've got keyboards now
they've got the power supply which I've
already showed you got some really neat
smart app functions so you can actually
see what's going on with the computer
and power usage live on a smart phone if
you've ever wondered how much power your
computer is actually using so we're
going to take a look at all kinds of
stuff and because of this tempered glass
I wasn't sure if I was going to actually
do a full build in this but the temp the
tempered glass side panel alone made me
go that that that's an elegant bitch
right there I definitely need to build
that so I guess we're gonna see I think
this with good LED lighting and some
sort of like a rigid tubing Bend and the
nice bright fluid maybe something like a
bright purple or something might look
really and not not purple because that's
color masters color but pink has already
been done by Kyle and I've already done
things like red and orange and blue and
I'm doing green and skunkworks
I know we'll see this is a bad look in
case once you put that tempered glass
panel on so I guess we'll go from there
anyway guys sound off in the comments or
hit me up on Twitter to let me know did
they nail this one did they hit it out
of the park or do you think there's
still some changes that need to be made
sound off obviously they're listening
thanks for watching guys and as always I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
