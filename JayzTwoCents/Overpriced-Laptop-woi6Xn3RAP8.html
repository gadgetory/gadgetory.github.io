here since you forgot I'm even wearing
my shirt this will be available soon
don't worry every guys have been asking
me about my shirts they're coming I
swear today we're going to talk about
razors new flagship laptop the razor
blade Pro 2017 edition I've had my hands
on this now for a couple of months about
two months actually I use this at
Computex that rendered all of that
footage and even some videos since then
so I just felt like editing at home or
on the go
so anyway huge thank you to Razer for
sending this over but yeah let's go and
just get right to it sick and tired of
all the RGB craze well don't worry
because the EVGA z2 70 classified K is
full of all the things that matter like
Intel obtained memory ready you to nvme
SSD support 11 phase PWM for stable
overclocking and a sleek monochromatic
design that is perfect for any bill
learn more by visiting EVGA calm now I
could spend all day talking about specs
and a laptop and it's obviously a very
subjective conversation - on what you
need what you don't need what's overkill
but let's at least run down what's in
here it's got an i7 78 20 HK processor
sets a quad core with hyper threading so
eight active threads 2.9 gigahertz as
the base block it will automatically
turbo boost Intel turbo boost up to 3.9
depending on the workload and
temperatures and if you turn on the
performance optimized in synapse app
then it will go all the way up to 4.3
again if temperatures will allow but
once you put in performance optimized it
does also increase the fan curve that
way it can keep things as cool as
possible now for memory we've got 32
gigabytes in this model of ddr4 2667 so
that's going to be nice and fast and
keep up with your workloads and in
storage there's three different versions
of this there's a 512 a 1 terabyte and a
2 terabyte all sporting PCI Express m2
SSDs so this particular model right here
is the 1 terabyte so that's to 512
drives in a raid 0 all three variants of
this the 512 the one terabyte and the
two terabyte are supporting raid 0
configuration so the 512 is to 256 and
ra0
the one terabyte to 512 and then the 2
terabyte obviously is to one terabyte
again all in raid 0 so read/write on
this is extremely fast but once again
because they are MDOT
- keeping it cool is paramount so yeah
the fan profiles and stuffs definitely
have their work cut out for them given
the amount of hardware that is shoved
into this machine and then of course for
the GPU it's got a full-size desktop GT
X 1080 chip in there obviously it's on
it's not a full size card in there but
it's a full-blown GPU on here for factor
why is it zero point eight eight inches
thick it's got lots of i/o two USB 3.0 s
on the Left it's got and again a THX
certified headphone jack so it's going
to have a very good noise floor it's got
very good powered billowed push
professional headphones which is
sometimes a problem especially with
laptops so you can run your high ohm
headphones and have no problems with it
whatsoever on here a full-size are rj45
network jack on the right side we got a
full-sized HDMI port another USB 3.0 a
Thunderbolt 3 as well as a full size SD
card reader so that's nice especially
for content creators like me if I want
to put it straight from the camera to
the computer I can do that let's talk
about the keyboard it definitely takes a
little bit of getting used to it's going
to be a love it or hate it relationship
it's sporting a low profile mechanical
keyboard now they're saying that this is
the world's first I can't validate that
but they are saying its world's first
with a their Chiclets keycap which is
common on their laptops but it's got a
very cliquey can hear that it's got a
very very clicky feel to it it feels a
lot like a blue but obviously with a
much shorter throw which in the
beginning made it very hard for me to
get used typing on this I could not type
an email on this the way I would
normally type I literally was having to
like to finger type it because I just
couldn't get used to the field but after
using it for several weeks and now a
couple of months I can actually bring up
writing on this with no problem it just
took a little bit of adjusting and
getting used to but something else you
might also notice is this does not have
a trackpad down below the spacebar which
is the more conventional place to put it
it's on the side where you typically
find a number pad so what Razer has done
is they've kind of gotten rid of the
number pad which is some people want it
a lot of people don't but on a 17.3 inch
laptop like this allowed them to have a
massive touchpad over here that works
with the trackpad so it's touch
sensitive and it does gesture so for
instance if you were to just to finger
touch that's like doing a right-click
and of course of course if you click on
the bottom left and bottom right corners
the same as let's pick right-click on a
mouse so I feel it's really sensitive
I'm accidentally touching and clicking
on things when I'm just
trying to move the cursor which is kind
of a pain in the butt something else too
is it's got an actual scroll wheel for
volume which is nice to see rather than
having a function key up and function
key down you've got all your function
keys that you expect on the F row and
that's enough about that you guys you
guys kind of get the basics when it
comes to the keyboard
now let's going to talk about the screen
here this is a 17.3 inch u HD that's 4k
a THX certified panel they're saying
this is the world's first THX certified
panel and a laptop I can't validate that
but that's what they're saying
so it's check for things like color
accuracy resolution accuracy smoothness
of playback it's guaranteed to give you
a very good viewing experience now the
problem with it though as you can see is
its glossy so that's going to be a love
it or hate it
some people like glossy screens I'm
personally okay at that it tends to make
the colors pop a little bit more make
them a little bit more vibrant but if
you're in a bright environment like this
as you can see it's very very reflective
so it's definitely one of those things
that you have to ask yourself if that's
going to be okay
but something else too is it is a touch
screen so I don't know if I don't know
why it won't use this considering it
doesn't flip back into a into a tablet
but it is actually a touch screen and I
think the last thing I would really want
to be doing though especially on this
glossy screen is be touching it so it's
a neat feature that's there but I will
never use it now that I've touched it I
gotta clean it
now speaking of dirt and mess this
chassis although beautiful and it's
matte black anodized finish is a
nightmare to keep clean if you think
about touching it finger and skin oils
appear on it if you even consider moving
it it's just going to look like a big
smudged smear a mess and if that bothers
you like me then you definitely want to
make sure you have a rag nearby at all
times now in terms of performance I'm
going to start with content creation
because I think that that's where this
laptop would definitely shine now we use
this laptop to render all of our footage
from copy text this year so that's how
long I've had this and it you know
working in the timeline especially in
Adobe Premiere it takes advantage of all
of that CPU horsepower to advantage of
all of that RAM and having the full size
1080 in there makes the GPU accelerated
Mercure playback engine very very smooth
when scrubbing through the timeline it's
not stuttering whatsoever and we can run
it at a hundred percent resolution and
have no issues whatsoever now in terms
of exporting though it feels an awful
lot like rendering on a 77
a desktop system 1080p footage which is
what we rendered at Computex rendered in
about real-time so if it was a ten
minute video took about ten minutes to
render same thing with you know longer
video take about the same amount of time
to render of course that's going to
depend on a lot of things on your
timelines there a lot of color
correction is there any sort of resizing
is there a lot of overlays
transparencies transitions things like
that can all slow down render time but
in the basic type of workflow that we do
on our videos at least my videos here
this has no problems whatsoever allowing
me to stay fully functional while on the
go now this brings me to the last part
of our review which is obviously gaming
and I think a majority of you probably
care about that most now as I've already
said the GTX 1080 and it performs very
similar in games like rise of the Tomb
Raider you're getting 52 FPS average in
4 kms with all of the effects on high
including the hair effect stuff so if
you turn that off actually plumps up a
little bit more but if you go down to
something like 1080p and turn off the G
sync which is built into this panel then
you can actually get well over a hundred
and forty fps in a game like rise of the
Tomb Raider then those Metro last light
which brings it down to about the mid
40s at 4k but it's a very demanding
benchmark it always has been that's why
I keep it in my rotation but once you go
into 1080p mode then it definitely jumps
up a whole lot higher and a very
respectable framerate but what about
acoustics well unfortunately because
razor is gone with more an aesthetic
approach versus a functionality approach
they went with very small minimalist
expand and vent design I feel like if
they just put a few more events in there
we would have had a lot better thermals
because the 1080 in here will reach all
the way up to about 83 C under load now
that's not too hot for this core I mean
that's what the founders edition card is
set to run at but in order to keep the
83 C it sounds like a 747 in fact let's
go ahead and give you a demo of that now
if you take a look at the fan design and
yeah I remember what I said about
fingerprints earlier yeah if you look at
the fan design you can see it's just
these two tiny little fans down here on
the bottom
I feel like razor could have done a
better job at thinking about acoustics
and thermals at the same time and still
maintain a minimalistic factor or form
factor I mean it's on the bottom you
don't even see it in fact even just
sitting at the desktop the GPU will idle
somewhere between 50 and 53 C depending
on your ambient temperature now it's
going to be completely silent while
doing that it just gives you an idea of
how warm things can get and just putting
your hand near the laptop you can feel
heat coming through the keyboard
so anyway guys that's been my review of
the 2017 revision of the razor blade pro
laptop their new flagship and it's
performed all of the functions I needed
to do with no problems whatsoever we
were doing gaming while at Computex we
even showed some Instagram photos we
were having a little mini LAN party at
the airport we were waiting to head over
to Taiwan and it's very powerful and
there's it should be for the price I
mean it come it starts at four thousand
US dollars that's that is not a cheap
laptop by any stretch of the imagination
now whether or not that's worth it guys
only you can answer that I can't answer
for you whether or not it's worth it
value is subjective and it's only going
to pertain to the person considering
spending the money only the person
looking to spend the money can determine
whether or not it's worth it so that's
that it's time to go again a huge thank
you to Razer for sending me this laptop
to take a look at if you guys think I
should look at any other laptops on the
market make sure to let me know down in
the comments below or hit me up on
Twitter at JS to sense it's without a
doubt the easiest way to get ahold of me
thanks for watching guys and as always I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
