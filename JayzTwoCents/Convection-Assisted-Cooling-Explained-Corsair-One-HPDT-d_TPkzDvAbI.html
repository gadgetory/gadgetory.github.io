by Corsair and the Corsair one eye 40
eye 68 Corsair one pro eye 80 which is
this guy right here this is my first
time getting hands on with it and I got
to tell you I'm pretty impressed first
and foremost we've we've seen this this
change where brands go or even buyers go
from wanting a big case and then people
want small cases and then what big cases
again and then they want small cases
again what we tend to find is as as
performance really starts to you know
get packed in smaller packages as
performance really starts to scale up
you find that the size of it also tends
to scale down making small form-factor
stuff very possible now this is the IAT
which is the the Corsair one Pro this is
an X 299 it's got an ass Rock Mini ITX
motherboard in there using quad channel
so dim memory it's also all crammed into
approximately a 12 liter chassis these
is what they're calling convection
assisted cooling let me go ahead and
show you what that means real quick so
on the top right here you've got this
fan that's got this metal and this is
metal that this metal sort of grill on
here and the fan is an exhaust fan so
it's pulling heat up because heat
naturally rises right so it's a weak
force but it's a force of nonetheless
that exists now on the side you'll find
that you have these perforations is one
here and one here and these sides can
open up I can do this without breaking
it and as you can see we have this
little baby-baby kind of an AIO
cooler in there and then we've got one
over here too and this one's for the GPU
now these are not conventional sizes
this is not a 240 and this is a 120 this
is proprietary specifically to this
chassis you can see how they have the
fittings coming off the side they do
rotate but as you can see this is not a
standard 120 or 140 it's also pretty
slim if I had to guess it's about 25
millimeters about the thinness of a thin
but there's no fans on it as you can see
if we affect rotate this this way you
can see the motherboard with the sodium
slots
this particular one has a 1920 X in it
so that is a 12 core extreme processor
that is also running the other water
cooler on it very similar HIO cooler to
might find like the h 100 pro or one
the i-pro and on the GPU side of things
this is also running a 20 80 TI with
another fairly proprietary cooler on it
so again the same type of a i/o pump but
it also has a heatsink and a fan blowing
down directly on the power delivery now
that's what makes one of the questions
that I had sort of answered before I
could actually ask Demetri I had
actually asked at the keynote that we
were at couldn't you just make this a
bare-bones system if people wanted to to
use this build it up themselves the
problem is with the way everything is
very meticulously thought-out in terms
of wire routing the wires that are
pre-installed because the GPU solution
is not it's not universal you could put
an air cooler in here technically but
then you're you really are gonna be
choking it off even though it has this
perforation right here they did say they
tested it in fact the first Corsair one
version of this last year did have offer
an air cooled solution but even the
blower style cooler it just was not
optimal it was having so less than
desirable thermal performance so these
blocks and the cooler and the vrm and
all that is pretty specific to the
graphics card so if you had to gate with
a graphics card already in it and
exactly this motherboard those are two
components you have control over which
takes away the whole idea of a
bare-bones typically bare bones is
chassis power supply and maybe a couple
of other features in there and that's it
you have to build out the rest of it
so because you would have to go with
this cooling solution in this graphics
card and this motherboard and this power
supply then you technically are not bare
bones at that point but you notice I
said there's no fans on this because
once you close it up and you've got this
large fan on the top and it is held
together by screws which we don't have
here so I'm having to kind of like
area so we are going to be doing some
videos on this we are going to be doing
a review of it we initially passed it
through view last year because I was
kind of like you know it's another
pre-built system yada yada but I think
that there's a lot of unique nifty
features in this that warrant at least a
teardown upgradability all that sort of
stuff
interestingly its using so dim memories
sodium is laptop memory if you're not
aware is just that's the format of it
and you can get some pretty fast sodium
the problem is fast so dim those two
words together usually have a pretty
premium cost to it versus like regular
you know ddr5 or ddr4 sticks
so yeah ddr5 and a PC to be nice but I
digress so getting ddr4 so-dimm that's
fast let's say like forty eight hundred
megahertz or something like that you're
gonna pay for it
so it does come in a premium this
particular model retails for 4999 taller
so it definitely has a sting but it's
amount of this amount of performance
packed into 12 liters yeah someone out
there wants this I'm sure which is why
it exists so you can see that on our
Channel later on but guys thanks for
taking a look at this video of the
Corsair 1 pro semi teardown I mean Steve
and Kyle aren't the only people that can
tear things down and - or whatever well
Kyle technically built something up not
a teardown we sort of toured it down but
not really whatever yeah I'm losing my
train of thought doesn't matter so guys
anyway thanks for watching again a huge
negative Corsair for sending us out here
and as always we'll see you guys in a
couple of minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
