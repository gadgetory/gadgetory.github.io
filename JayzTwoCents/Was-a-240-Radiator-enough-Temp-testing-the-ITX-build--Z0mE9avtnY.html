anymore
what's up guys J is two cents here and
don't let the pause hardware t-shirt for
you I am in fact J ste sense at least
last time I checked now my last video I
uploaded I showed off my new Mini ITX
build with glass tubing inside of my
fractal design to find Nano s and I
showed some of the complications and
doing some builds in there some things
you have to keep in mind and one of the
compromises I made to go with a longer
card was going with a single 240 red you
guys in the comments told me that that
was a bad move and I made the wrong
choice and today we're gonna find out
whether or not that's really the case no
pun intended
actually the master case 5 and
mastercase 5 Pro from cooler master
combines modularity with creativity
giving you the freedom to build it your
way make it yours by clicking the link
down in the description now like I said
in the intro today's video is all in
response to comments and questions that
were about this build on the video I put
up a few days ago now although this
might sound like one of those things
where the manufacturer fractal came to
me was like a.j could you mention a few
things or clarify a few things no that's
not the case in fact they'd have
anything to say other than the build
looks sweet we really liked it that was
it there's never been any input from any
of the manufacturers or anything when it
comes to my videos I just want to make
that clear now because I know some
people are going to be stupid enough to
be like oh obviously the manufacturer
wanted him to make this video not the
case every time I say case it's gonna be
like pun intended
I guess so the two common things I keep
hearing are J you should have used a
front mount radiator and in order to
make that fit the other most common
thing is J you should have used a fury X
or a fury card or something shorter now
the point of be putting a long card
inside of this case was not to say oh I
didn't want to use the fury it's to show
that you could still fit a long card in
there and still fit fans in the front
and a big reservoir which I chose to do
obviously the compromise was that I
couldn't fit a front-mounted radiator in
there anymore unless I was something
like slim fans or whatever which was not
something I was actually interested in
doing a lot of slim fans have to make up
for their lack of static pressure with
higher
and I don't really feel like doing that
anyway the other thing like I said
people keep telling me is I should have
gone with a fury card because they're so
short yes I could have I have one right
there that's actually a fury x1 I didn't
have a custom waterblock to for it
so wouldn't have worked in this build
anyway let's have a wait to order the
block and wait for it to get here and -
I wanted to show that you could fit a
long card in here because obviously if
you could fit a long card you could fit
a shorter card as well so it's kind of
like showing the max fitment and then
you can shrink it the size now a lot of
people have been telling me J I'm
shocked that you didn't go with a
front-mounted radiator which is kind of
funny because the last time I did a
front mounted radiator radiator everyone
was like Jerry I'm shocked you did a
front mounted radiator because now
you're putting all that heat into the
case obviously you just can't win around
here so anyway here's what we are going
to do today I have overclocked my 4790k
to 4.6 gigahertz I'm also using the GTX
970 g1 gaming again because it's the
card I had the block Hardy attached I
thought about putting either a Titan X
or a 980 TI in there but I just didn't
want to utilize that card for this build
and I thought small build there's a
perfect perfect graphics card to fit in
there and really it came down to the
fact that the card was already attached
but anyway we are in my shop right now
and to go ahead and validate some of the
testing that you're about to see the
ambient temperature right now is 75
point - let's see if you can actually
get that to focus get in there
seventy five point two degrees right
here in my shop that's Fahrenheit and
for all you Celsius users that is twenty
four C so that gives you some validation
here as to what the ambient temp SAR
like for the testing you're about to see
so anyway let's go ahead and turn the
camera around and let's get this in here
and show you guys exactly how well this
is actually performing both in CP huge
performance GPU performance and then
hammering both with a single 240
millimeter radiator with a lower fpi a
lower fin per inch count it's not even
the best 240 you could even put in here
alright guys here we go we got the that
really ghetto pointing the camera at the
screen thing so I'll eventually get that
fixed you know to where I can actually
screen cap this properly but for the tie
being I think you guys get the idea okay
so we've got a couple things going on
here I've got real temp up on the left
so that we can see the core temperatures
and as you can see right now with the
ambient like I showed you at about 75
degrees Fahrenheit or 24 C we are
sitting in the 30s for the idle which
should be fine obviously we're just on
my idle right and then the graphics card
here is idling at 29 C obviously this is
on water so the first thing we're going
to do here Liz let's just go ahead and
get the loop warmed up a bit I am going
to turn on let's do Haven heaven I keep
calling Haven heaven benchmark
everything is pretty much set to ultra
the anti-aliasing is at 4x and 1080p so
let's go ahead and just let that loop
that's what the temperatures warm up for
the graphics card and let's see where we
max out now I'm not going to sit here
and let it just you know point the
camera out there and let it go forever
and ever and ever I am just going to I'm
gonna let it go stop the camera and it
will cut over to see what the results
were because you know that's how you
make good videos you don't bore people
by letting them just stare at a loop
that goes and goes and goes and goes
alright we'll be right back alright so
the loop is completely stabilized we're
sitting at 45 to 46 C depending on what
part of the tested it's on so let's go
ahead and take a look here at the the
graph as you can see maximum temperature
for the CPU or the GPU was 47 that was
just like tiny little spikes but you can
see right there it was completely flat
it wasn't going up it wasn't going down
stabilized that's what you look for when
you do a temperature test now don't run
it for just a specific length of time
some people like to just let test run
for Oh 15 minutes and then that's our
max temperature no let it run until the
loop is completely equalized in the
temperatures maxed out and not going any
higher however long that takes 5 minutes
10 minutes an hour let it go so that's
what our max temps where you can see the
temp drop down pretty fast too we're
down to 37 already but there was a core
clock 1524 forgot to mention that this
was overclocked plus 170 on the core
plus 400 on the memory power limits at
112 and our core voltage is a plus
eighty-seven millivolts so we are
overclocked that's obviously something
important to mention max CPU temperature
so max CPU usage was about fifty percent
that's pretty normal for a synthetic
benchmark like that doesn't lose use a
lot games don't tend to use a lot of CPU
either well depending on the type of
game but our max CPU temperature was 59
so you can see the CPU was doing
something it wasn't just sitting there
completely idle but that brings us the
next part of the test here which is
going to be a 264 and we're going to go
ahead and run this thing we're going to
stress test the heck out of the CPU
which again as I mentioned is indeed
overclocked and then we're gonna we're
gonna see how those temperatures do but
you can even see on the graph right
there that right there that was when I
started the benchmark and you can see
the temperatures equalized again so
that's important to mention the other
thing too is I also don't have the fans
on the CPU header ramping up unless the
CPU was under load so the temperatures
you just saw with the graphics loop or
the graphics card under full load was
with the fans at 40% speed so obviously
we have more cooling Headroom in there
as well
so now we're gonna let this go and we're
going to see how it does alright so
there's no point in letting the CPU test
go for very long that the CPU actually
puts out less heat than the GPU and it
doesn't take as long to equalize so you
can see by the chart right here this was
the GPU test and you can see the CPU
wasn't under that much of a load CPU
under 100 percent load we're plateaued
that coolants not getting any hotter and
you can see here are the core temps
right here on the left this program is
called real temp I like to use this for
the cores so we are sitting you know a
long way from TJ Max and you can see TJ
Max is where the thermally thermal
throttling is going to happen these are
this right here on the bottom underneath
the core temperature is how far we have
till we thermal throttles we've got so
much Headroom it's not even funny but
that's at 4.6 gigahertz it's not too far
of an overclock but anyway like I said
the amount of voltage it took to get 4.7
and higher stable was more than I really
wanted to push but anyway here is that
CPU temperature is maxed at 75 was as
high as it went and again thermal
throttles at 105 so we we've got quite a
bit of head
there but J that doesn't tell us
anything because running the CPU
separate in the GPU separate isn't going
to test the actual capability of the
load you need to do gaming why shall men
do one better I'm gonna run a 264 while
running the looping benchmark which is
going to put this loop under more heat
stress than any game would push this
loop and then we'll see once and for all
if a single 240 was a bad move or if it
was perfectly okay I think you already
know where this video is headed though
okay so I am going to leave a 264
running and everything's still
overclocked with the graphics card as
you can see everything is still
overclocked with the CPU as you can see
nothing's change the test is still going
no interruption and we are now going to
load the heav'n benchmark so take a
little longer to load obviously because
the CPU is under full stress but we are
going to let both of these utilities do
their thing and just hammer away at the
at the loop yeah that's what we're doing
that's that's what this video is about
hammer the loop don't don't actually
take a hammer to your loop though that's
that's counterproductive what I find
really cool though is even with a 264
running and the CPU being in 100% load
which you will see when we're done with
the test if you look at the top right
corner up here though the FPS really
hasn't suffered that much temperature is
sitting at 39 C right now like it's
going to take time for this loop to
completely you know equalize like I
talked about but yeah the FPS you can
see it swings up and down quite a bit
when it goes to the max FPS it's like
whoo went between 110 and 140 just swing
it up and down but other than that you
really can't tell that the CPU is under
100% load while the benchmark is putting
the GPU at 100% load so if we were going
to have any sort of cooling issues this
would be it I'm gonna let this run run
for about 20 minutes and then we'll see
what happens
all right so we're running for nearly 20
minutes now we've stabilized at 47 C and
it kind of it hits 48 for like a split
second and comes back down to 47 so
let's go ahead and quit this test here
and let's see so you can see here the
CPU was still running right here a
hundred percent the entire time and it's
been running for 27 minutes now as you
can see right there yeah this was when
the CPU was running and then this was
when the GPU was running so you can see
temps came up slightly when both were
running and that GPU loop was adding
some heat max temp on the CPU was 80 so
we went from 75 to 80 with the GPU
running so the GPU dumping all of its
heat into the loop and only a single 240
didn't actually change all that much
the last thing worth pointing out is
right here the maximum temperatures on
the cores 75 80 81 and 80
overclocked and that's still about 25
Celsius away from thermal throttling now
something else I had going here was my
thermometer here testing the air
temperature leaving the radiator
as you can see 92 degrees what's going
down now because it's not there anymore
92 degrees Fahrenheit or 33 degrees C is
the temperature leaving the case now
what did we learn here today besides the
fact that a lot of people really like to
make comments without actually knowing
anything about what they're talking
about well we've learned today that
radiators are all rated in a watts
displaced what that means is how much
heat can the radiator remove before the
heat continues to exponentially climb
because the radiator can't remove the
heat fast enough well there's a lot of
factors here at play there's fan speed
there's fam CFM there's the static
pressure there is the ambient
temperature and then there is of course
the radiators rating itself the most
radiator manufacturers don't actually
put on the box the amount of heat that a
radiator can display some do some don't
but a rule of thumb here as I've said
before as I recommend at least a minimum
of 120 millimeters worth of radiator at
30 millimeter thickness for each
component in a loop now for the amount
of overhead that I would usually like to
see a 240 for each component
would be nice so I would have obviously
fit a second radiator in here if I could
for having cooling overhead but as you
can see right now in an extreme
situation with the CPU loop or the CPU
at 100% and the GPU at 100% and only a
single 240 rad in this case the Alpha
cool st 30 or the Nexus st 30 was more
than enough cooling with the fans that I
have on there now if you live in a hot
climate and a place that gets really
really hot let's say you were in
Australia or you were in India or
someplace that gets really hot or
Southern California as well or the
Arizona desert you are going to want to
put as much radiator as you could
possibly fit so in your case you might
have wanted to go with a smaller GPU and
then end up going with more radiators
and by smaller I mean shorter PCB
something like a fury X or a fury
something like that but when it comes to
my situation here in this case and the
fact that it's always going to be
indoors and in air conditioning as you
can see more than enough cooling
now the one thing I want to point out
too is that the ambient temperature
where I am when I did this test actually
rose five degrees Fahrenheit from when I
started the test and when I finished it
right now we are sitting at eighty one
point five so six degrees actually one
of six degrees Fahrenheit we're at
eighty one point five degrees right now
and be a temp in the room so that can
account for some of the slightly hotter
temperatures that you saw as well but
all in all guys I wanted to make this
video to address the fact that no I did
not make a mistake by going with a
single 240 I knew exactly what I was
getting myself into because there's more
at play on how cooling works then simply
the size of the radiator if you were to
take a giant radiator but put fans
on there that aren't turning and moving
enough air then it won't matter how big
the radiator is eventually it will start
to get really hot because air flow is
just as important over radiator core
then these sides of the radiator or even
the core material itself anyway if you
guys want to see more about this topic
let me know down in the comments section
hit me up on Twitter or Facebook and
also too if you guys are into the car
stuff my vlog channel was relaunched as
a vlogs and car channel I actually put
up my first video there just recently so
you guys can check that out the link is
in the description I don't know where
there and hit subscribe if you guys like
the car stuff and the me just babbling
about you know god knows what I like to
just get on there and be super super
stupid sometimes and well that's okay
because I'm a
/ stupid guy obviously because I used a
single 240 red in this build what the
heck was I thinking obviously I know
nothing all right guys let's go ahead
and get on out of here thanks for
watching today's video I hope this edge
of some questions and as always thanks
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
