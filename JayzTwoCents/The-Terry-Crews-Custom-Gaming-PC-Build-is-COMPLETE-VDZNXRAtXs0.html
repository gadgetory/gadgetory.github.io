charity cruise billed by Jay to fit you
did it
anyone even you don't want you to do
some they're actually just bumps on my
arm do you see that they're just popping
up it's chicken skin an actual chicken
skin oh but now I'm about the witness an
amazing thing here we go we're going to
go deliver this to some guy you guys may
have heard of him every now and then
there's the thing on the on the TV thank
Terry Crews the PC gamer would have
thought this has been a labor of love
and like any bad relationship you've
been in for too long time to be someone
else's problem Becky told me when I said
I feel like I was married to this
machine he's like well don't worry she's
about to be your ex-wife we are we I did
a little bit of rearranging in the truck
so the PC will go in the back seat
buckled up for safety you know we're
sitting in the back it's your job if I
have to hit the brakes to just grab this
thing with all your might because I'm
going to buckle oh there's no hand holds
on this anywhere so I've gotta grab it
like under the power supply and under
like the front IO panel because there's
like a weird bottom plate on this thing
and everything else is glass the cat was
divided laughs so it is awkward to say
the least
ah
I need to do this key without damaging
the left her in the car but it's a
rental like I could curl sixty pounds
without a problem we put 60 pounds in an
awkward or matte week time as week is
hasta focus book through rose rose which
left numbers of the MSI gaming laptop
packed out for that CUDA accord
guardians of the galaxy to a shot on red
we got you Jays two cents on red good
point
you know I'm just going to go back to
using a Bloggie Bloggie touch man all
right CJ's that are looking at Chris
press oh you know down where they Chris
Pratt got a little bit of a man I got a
man crush for Christian so I'll take
that well I already has a man crush on
you get whatever like Cola we need a
feed your hand
see there can feel like a star posing or
Sabac in Gigi
I don't know what I'm doing like crane
that does not meet the crispy standard
Wow all right we have just put out the
fueler don't leave you be like I changed
my mind
I bought a Mac
we got John over there with the kudos to
John for stepping in unfortunately Ken
could make it that's okay
I prefer John anyway he's prettier sorry
Ken and about our camera and Katherine
here is that subjective
all right
I'll go on whenever
okay so we just got here where I outside
Perry's place where to meet him is just
a few minutes so I'm pretty excited I
think he's really going to like this PC
we're talking about it more when we get
in there it was a design challenge but
there we go another helicopter coming in
for downtown just get in there and see
how it goes
literally are ruining my day
you
you
I'm expecting a beast and first of all
I'm also expecting something way better
than what I did you know again my cable
management is and I was just so happy it
worked I had a lot of people that were
like it those cable and I was you know
but my thing is I was learning and I'm
still learning it kind of became like a
Lego set for me yeah I was happy to get
the Legos I was happy that it kind of
formed the form but now I've seen what
you do I mean and I like the water cool
and I feel like contribute what these
guys do over here I am like the
beginning but I think this is the the
cool build because it's it's
personalized yeah but it's something
that really my channel keeps the people
you can do this so you could do this
yourself - Wow anyone could do this but
we'll talk about it in there there was
some challenges we're almost six months
into this yeah we started talking in
September although I didn't November now
here we are April but I think that I
think it was worth the wait
for now it's better than nothing
happened like you said it's my ex-wife
now because I'm done oh well I had that
experience where the was I'll press the
power button it didn't go off mm I
freaked out that night freaks out yeah
and ran to Best Buy girls always open he
told me about that
and literally the guy I didn't see at
the Geek Squad bar
he just says oh you're pressing our own
button efficient recently yeah and it
turned it on I was like oh god because I
freaked out you know I
it was just immediate panic all right I
had this almost think I did everything
wrong and actually I did everything
right but yeah I just did right but of
all these like little sudden I can't
count how many systems I've built and I
still get a little bit
anxiety when I go to push the power
button for the first time especially
when it's water cool yeah so I'm sure
all right let's do this okay okay whoa
oh wow before we unveiled it okay we're
going to talk about where we left off in
November yeah okay we decided on Old
Spice the audience decided Old Spice
80/20 split on that straw poll and there
was 21 thousand votes so they were cool
with that here's the problem I had when
we left that day I had this challenge of
researching you to determine what how do
I get to know this guy's style when I
don't know him on a personal level
that's hard to begin with - I looked at
your space and I went you're into design
you're in the furniture everything in
this office has a purpose and a place
and it's there for a reason
yeah and I'm going this isn't about how
crazy the build is this is about how I
make this build fit in this space
without sticking out but also sticks out
enough to be a centerpiece
yeah that was the hard part with all
this okay I took a lot of design cues
from your office here there's a lot of
glass we're talking floor-to-ceiling
glass you've got a panoramic view of the
metropolitan LA area so I think we
nailed it so what I'm going to ask you
to do right now is go ahead and take the
cover off of that and then turn it on
okay here we go
do I just push that power button on the
front on the bottom right there oh my
god wait wait right here on the bottom
Oh in the butt everything let that other
power button inside here we go
oh look at this baby wait wait wait you
got to see the old price logo that shows
up a lot better at night trust me dude
what my bear glove Oh
buy it no look at the details this is
absolutely insane
hold on hold okay I'm sorry you're
kidding right
just to react we do it again we didn't
get it the windows are really really
really bright it what happened what
happened he didn't get the reaction okay
okay it's okay it's okay
I'm inaccurate but I told you I told you
when Ken wasn't available turn it on
again no okay
hey we're doing it now seriously dude
you're kidding me right
wait wait please this is gonna be great
just try it we say try you think he's
going to be able to do that reaction
again that was what that was wrong
no it was wrong it was wrong but we're
good we will do it again man is how it
is I don't fucking believe this
like like like five months leading up to
this moment for five seconds of reaction
and guilt catches cut most of it where
did you catch it right I mean what'd you
cut we'll just try it one more thing
we did it blackout as I'll have it he's
using a beta software on this camera
crew yeah uh you know it so you know
read right he's using a beta software
that's not field tested yet and it
didn't get work yesterday
do you actually look at the photo like
are you sure
can you replace I'm trying not to like
freak out no it's okay it might not it
might be there if it's there it's all
good let's check it up we want anyone
okay okay it's okay it's okay man it's
okay okay it's all good
we're just messing with you all good
just messing with you oh yeah no we all
right
now we why we watched care Crusades
Christmas we saw the great are you I was
doing a lot in the world
Oh Lord is a mother watch somebody get
this smackdown okay but you thought you
thought I was a peacemaker I chosen epic
you were going to do know all I told
myself like no it's cool no it's all
good no we got a real important we get
your action right okay okay
you know it could help me i hocked you
[Laughter]
can what happens we need to break soon I
know if you get rank tonight oh no I
died with a big one good oh no see I was
hoping you were far enough photos from
Terry Crusades Christmas if you forget
the pranks about it so yeah and I am and
I am but literally I was like I'm an
actor I can live a lie I'm good
let's do it again all right so let's do
this I might take a side panel trick at
19 that nitrous is really bright so the
goose boat now that last work on this Oh
before Suraj helpless because I'm not a
glass worker they have all the tools and
all the resources to do this so we
thought I thought I saw this case at CES
now way I have to have this case this is
not a normally read case I want is read
to be the main color because of the Old
Spice red but we needed the we needed
the custom Terry Crews feel to it so
that's why I baked custom edge at last
so at night it shines through on the
front is just like that the front that
way too so as you can see here okay it's
gold it goes to dinner but it's got your
name on there where it would normally
sales by some eleven oh my god oh my god
not now I did sign it you have to
deliver that fine I find my bills yo yes
that looks like chicken sketch because
it with a little butter that man look
oh my God look at you just oh man
beautiful man so let's talk about what's
in you okay let's talk I love the
excitement go ahead I'm sorry I
screaming as we go now if you were just
like oh that's cool out of infest no
juice come on the level of detail in
this just little things that you
wouldn't know can we're told so you
already know what the RAM its RAM number
92 s yeah 500 limited edition of the one
500 moon so you've got number 94 in
there the graphics card number 94 you
know yeah number 94 is the number I wore
when I was drafted by the LA Rams right
back in 1991
so that's why when Corsair saw that we
were doing this they sent over
specifically number 94 and they ran so
the graphics cards that's what I was
talking about okay so we did the Titan X
peas in it will tell you next writin
enough time went by to where they came
out with a new type next last week
so what was it Thursday or is there a
Thursday of last week they came out with
a new Titan part that's faster than
these the older ones in every way okay
so a video stepped up last second
swapped out these cards I redid the
water cooling for it so that these are
the fastest cards on the planet and
you've got two of them
and trust me when I say that I'm jealous
because I don't have these oh and these
are much faster than I thought they were
going to be he's been become beautiful
they are like my god gtx titan eggs yes
this is like so I mean and it came out
literally days everything that's
Thursday yeah so one week ago and I
didn't get my hands on until Saturday on
a real yeah
Romeo will tell you that I was I was
less than stellar attitude towards this
last-minute slot okay it's funny because
my videos I actually had a beard
I had a goatee and it blew my puggalski
away right yeah the idea with this is
the power of old side is linking the
power of tight next Pascal to just
hopefully I won't catch fire because
it's so powerful
okay but all the water cooling the idea
here is the blue matches the blue of the
rolls the stick inside the gel you see
we have the silver plate in the back we
match the color perfectly we actually we
actually use the computer to match the
color for the powders in the powder
comes perfect look look at that it's
actually the gray here is the actual
tone the red everything is right there
this is a true old spice we've even got
a little bit of brown in the cables for
the bearglove bracket all it ties in
with the brown here I was born on using
the teal color the blue green cut like a
see miss color for the fluid but I
wanted to go with the stick color so
yeah yeah yeah ah cute yeah because if I
soul to the lighting now you like refine
thing but I know that right the lighting
here it's all touch panel controlled so
you can use this touch panel here to dim
the lighting and you just move your
finger to the right to brighten it up if
you want oh my god so I actually
disabled just higher button though
because it was too easy to bump it after
you played it would turn off this little
side right is I guess I just turn that
off but I had to rewire all of this okay
so the imagicon the surface it looks
like to a lot of enthusiasts it looks
fairly basic but there's a lot of little
things into this that aid up
more than 100 hours with a bill time oh
my God look at this
so and look at the wallpaper at the star
wars ah ah thank you sir thank you so
long
yeah I'm not sure what else there is
really to say I mean brah I'm glad you
like it
that's an understatement I am speech you
know what you're funny
yeah the whole gaming experience is
awesome but I could actually just sit in
this chair and look at nice get a look
at it it's just right up at night that
this will light up this whole room I've
got a picture of what it looks like
tonight because obviously I can't show
you that right now because that's what
look like an oh my god
we're good doing that night the I have a
side panel off but nice the Terry Crews
shows through a lot and this is imagine
is this with the lights in it with the
life of LA that was the idea that's why
they're all white I didn't do any RGB
stuff any colored stuff because I got a
lot of white in here and white is just
elegant right yeah yeah and I knew where
you were going to put it against this
backdrop of the city I would fit
perfectly this oh no that it it does
look at that but even the RAM stick
light up light you see that this is a I
don't know this is actually the first PC
I've ever seen a class upper room well
how was the Johnson yeah it's usually
some big you know monster all right we
got machineries in the basement we're
good you know but this is actually the
most beautiful piece in this whole room
there are a lot of beautiful pieces you
got Italian stuff your chandeliers no
that was no pressure no pressure on me
at all yeah yeah I guess you did it man
but this a leaving this room it's so
special to me because you see I hope you
got movie props how the artifacts have
movie props spare no expense
watch it oh yeah I don't want myself it
I think it Romeo make another one no no
no but there's Jay I'm floored man well
I could like more I couldn't have asked
for a better response I'm telling you
it's more do you are the best I've ever
seen
no no no far from the best but the best
I could do do
holy cow let's see that this is cable
management and I actually don't like it
oh my god what's that wait wait okay
talk to me what about is you did like
why we're we're so I look out perfect
then well down here the cable links are
specific but some of the guys that take
this to the top level okay it will
actually measure each strand and cut
each strand specifically so that it's
perfectly radius bent and there's
nothing that crosses over it which is
something I've never been ill I don't
the patience for that amount of time and
effort because these leaves are all
custom-made uh some type Studios
actually made those sleeves and they're
out of Texas and those were handmade by
a guy who literally I he did them for me
overnight because I didn't get the links
for him until last minute and he
literally did this job in one night and
he wore all the skin off his fingers
running those leaves but wow I'm telling
you that's why I surround myself with
the best at what they do
yeah machine is the hold water cooling
thing look at how beautiful mmm all
those pipes are hand bent they're heated
and bent oh my god
yeah yeah I have never had a
water-cooled PC okay is there anything
special that I should not already done
anything actually I'm already done all
the prep for the system already cleaned
it
it's all ready to fully bled there's no
air in the system this fluid should last
you to use okay and then what happened
to two-year going two years as we said
it what we set up time I can come out
here and I can swap the fluids myself
because it's got a drain right here okay
and so I'll just bring my stuff with me
swap the fluid it would take half hour
tops okay I've been running oh my god I
Love You Man out okay whoa we're talking
months months we talked we
conceptualized we first of all be
hitting each other up saying if this
could happen and I'm like a night there
was no for me but two people want to get
something done
you are truly unstoppable that's the
truth and my thing was paid can it
happen can we work it in I said I'm
going to make the time I'm going to you
know give them you know
the prep video that we did the whole
thing and to get to this spot man they
would have never believed this is gonna
happen if we didn't do that video yeah
yeah yeah no no one will believe it was
happening it is Rho Rho naught but let
me tell you something right now when I
tell you this world the world of gaming
I'm not going anywhere this is it's just
as exciting to me as doing a movie as a
commercial as a TV show because it's
entertainment this is what the whole
thing is this right here is it's like
you know it looks like a Ferrari Oh me
if you ever get to change if you need
that yellow Avenue confident yellow
accent for the Ferrari put that all
right good yeah I didn't think a yellow
match but fortunately there's a switch
to turn that on and off maybe at night I
look better with the cityscape you know
oh man there's something about it again
I'm a designer I like to design things
and I also admire other designers and
it's good inspiration to say I do it on
a diet what could I say
I want to thank Jay I want to thank all
the people that were involved in making
this when you talk about people
stripping their their hands and making
this thing work at the last second yeah
man thank you thank you thank you let me
this is an icon right now you know this
is an icon this right here is going down
in history you you have number three
there's only 500 of these chassis made
you have number three the first one was
a show build that stayed with the
company the second one was given to
another mater and you were the first
person in the public scene to get it and
you're the only one with a red one
because we made it red oh my god this
man with the Old Spice logo on the glass
my name it's on the front tube and you
can't really tell what angle is that but
it's also right here in the front
dude I see it yeah holy cow
man I'm gonna tell you brother wait
first of all we got a tweet Instagram
all it is people gonna flip I can't wait
to watch whatever Facebook video you do
later
oh no but I'm doing a Facebook live
right in front of this thing I let
everybody know Eddie got down like I
told you sir I mean this had nothing to
do with exposure
this had nothing to do with that this
was just about giving you a welcome that
you deserve in this community because of
what you've done for so many charities
and stuff like that so this was this was
a gift to you it's just a token of
saying welcome to this world we might
regret it but it's a fun world if you
find out Terry Crews stop you stop
acting and you just playing games all
day it's his fault
it is wrong and but don't come on
because we're going to do we are in
shape gamers we're going to do all the
things we need to do outside and we will
come in it now we're gonna play our game
now I'm going to tell the Internet I'm
going to hold you to to what we talked
about the first time I want to I want to
see a set I want to see a real working
set I wanted to be a director
photography when I was a kid I want to
see a real working Hollywood set you
gotta make that happen
hold on it's going to happen that is
going to happen I mean do we quit that
can have it very very quickly it's not a
problem
my schedules more open than yours so
let's do we will make a average all
right guys I'm gonna let him close it
out there it is
five almost six months and that's it I
mean there's nothing else to say there's
nothing epicness we're coming in it came
it is the epic epicness of this Old
Spice bill by Jay to said Terry Crews
builders does because that oh my god the
pecs just feel the power the energy is
guard it's museum quality which is not
and I think that you know it's kind of
represents me because for one I'm very
very crazy and wild but I also like to
be refined and I'm very serious and very
funny at the same time I can go as far
as you know talking about human rights
or just talking about you or that new
Dave Chappelle you know comedy that I
saw the other day you know I mean it's
like a help I see no difference than
that and I could be very serious and
very funny this thing really typifies
that you see the seriousness but then
you see the fun well I think it's safe
to assume that Terry
PC almost as much as he loves yogurt but
I digress guys he loves his build he's
already started gaming on it he sent me
text about it he's so excited he's a
gamer through and through which is just
awesome to see I'm glad he loves his PC
guys thank you for your support and this
has been a long drawn-out process but
then it kind of really accelerated at
the end of course - this couldn't have
been done without your support as well
as support from the sponsors you guys
will find a full list of sponsors down
below in the description of this video
please open it up this couldn't have
been done without them a couple of
honorable mentions Intel for sending the
69 50 X ASIS resetting the motherboard
Corsair for sending the special edition
Dominator number 94 Ram which he fell in
love with because remember that was his
number on the Rams he was one of the
original picks for the original Ram NFL
football team so he was extremely
excited about that in win for sending me
that case which wood was the only case
that I thought fits the needs of this
build I was right he absolutely fell in
love at the case the second he saw it
thank goodness for that
all customs hard-coded you know the Old
Spice red so that's a good thing and
then of course NVIDIA for sending me the
to Titan XP literally just days before
the build was to be delivered so
last-minute changes there's always fun
EK waterblock sir send me the water
cooling parts I needed radiators pumps
rad primo chill for sending me the
fittings and tubing that I needed to
connect it all together and of course
performance pieces before sending me the
you know the things I always tend to
forget in need last-minute with a rush
delivery overnighted of course those
guys always come through for me so check
them out performance - pcs comm and I've
got to give a major shout out to Joe at
senpai studios guys he did probably one
of the fastest turnarounds of custom
sleeved cables that I've ever seen it
was practically an overnight job and he
definitely came through and also shout
out to him for spending at least two
hours with me on FaceTime when we
realized there was a last-minute rewire
job we had to do because of the touch
panel thing anyway he came through for
me guys check them out senpai studios
same guy that's an almost leaving for
all my builds for like the last three
years definitely go and check out his
work it is literally top shelf quality
also - a huge thank you to Jonathan
Morrison with TLD today and Austin Evans
obviously with Austin Evans
krispy guys who lent me their expertise
and their production ability in making
this video they did all the behind the
scenes they did all the shooting and all
the editing for this I hope you guys
enjoyed it it definitely raised the bar
and I've got a standard now that I'm not
sure I can hold up to but anyway it was
worth it you guys did a fantastic job
and of course thank you to all of you
for watching because I literally feel
like I'm accepting an Oscar here but I
just want to say thank you to all of you
because this was a fun build and he
can't be the only celebrity that's into
PC gaming it's gotta be someone else out
there someone else that can build a PC
for Terry if you're watching this you
know I'm sure you got a friend or
someone that does PC gaming kind of what
about Dwayne Johnson does he like the
game I don't know anyway thanks for
watching guys hope you've enjoyed it
and as always I'll see you in the next
