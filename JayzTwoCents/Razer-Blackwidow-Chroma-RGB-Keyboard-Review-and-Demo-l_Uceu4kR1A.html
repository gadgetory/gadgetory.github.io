pretty things to hook up to your
computer then you're not going to want
to go anywhere because today we're
taking a look at razors BlackWidow
chroma RGB mechanical keyboard I saw
this thing at CES and I had to have it
gigabytes flex display technology
automatically detects and connects up to
four displays for the best gaming
experience in multi display Ultra HD
click the link in the description to
find out more
all right if you've been following the
channel for any length of time you guys
know that I've been a little bit hard on
Razer in the past considering I've had a
couple of mice that didn't last as long
as I would have hoped so here we are now
in 2015 and we're going to kind of
circle back and see what's changed with
the company in the last few years since
I've used one of their products now the
last keyboard I had I will say has
definitely held up and that was the
Black Widow ultimate with a cherry MX
blue switch it was with the polished
finish in the blue backlight in fact
that was a pretty rare keyboard and a
lot of people have hit me up for that
keyboard quite a bit it was one I use
when I first started my channel I've
since given it to my dad who's a
programmer and it's held up very well
through the test of time I'm going to go
ahead and start in on the switches here
now they advertise that this is a 50
gram actuation wait for this mechanical
switch but I'm going to have to call a
little bit of shenanigans on that
because it is way heavier than 50 grams
in fact I would say it's a lot closer to
the 80 grams that is on the Cherry MX
green switch now 50 grams is the same
weight as the Cherry MX blue and when I
put this side by side with my switch
tester which has Cherry MX blue switch
in it the blue was much much lighter as
well as the Cherry MX blue mechanical
BlackWidow keyboard that I have from
2012 which is also significantly lighter
on the touch which is a 50 gram switch
so if you guys are a light typist you
might have a hard time pushing these
buttons until you really start to
strengthen up your fingers and start
mashing on the keys so it's advertised
as a 50 gram I really really personally
feel that it's heavier than that I've
typed on every single
switch that is out there well with the
exception of gray gray is like yeah
that's like a industrial switch but
anyway
alright so it's going to take a tour
around the keyboard here and talk about
its physical properties here it's a
matte finish which I definitely like you
guys have heard me say before I don't
like polished finish
I don't like piano finish it takes it
makes it gets all greasy it gets all
dusty it just looks nasty it scratches
so I really like the met the matte
finish on here it does have also to a
USB 2.0 past year there's only one but
at least one is better than none and
that puts it ahead of the Strix keyboard
which had none it also has an analogue
3.5 jack for headphones as well as your
microphone I like to see this because I
like to change out the headphones that
I'm using so now instead of having to
reach back behind the computer
constantly and fumble around to find the
right cable I just plug it in here and
then this passes through the amplified
headphone cable that I have plugged in
to the other end so that works really
well and then the microphone I don't
really use a three and a half analog
microphone but if you or twitch streamer
or something you could plug it in right
there and have easy access to it now on
the bottom it has what I feel are under
sized rubber feet I do like to see large
rubber feet that you know run the good
length of the bottom because it keeps
the thing from sliding around and these
tiny little feet like this the adhesive
eventually on the omni's will peel up
and then they won't stick anymore that
happened to my other keyboard and so I
would have liked to have seen larger
rubber feet on this now it does have
pretty decent size flip-up feet which
are also rubberized here if you want
your keyboard on a more upright angle
but other than that it's the exact same
physical properties as their other
keyboards the other Black Widow
keyboards the only difference is it's a
non Cherry MX switch with RGB
backlighting so what we're going to do
now is we're gonna do a quick typing
test and we're also going to take a
little demo of the software to show you
how easy the software is to use which is
what I feel really gives this keyboard a
competitive edge now one of the things
that's hard about typing test is it's to
be hard to determine how loud it is for
you on your end it's only going to be as
loud as my microphone can pick up which
is a lavalier mic but they are clicky
keys the green if it
I mean it's basically just like the
blues and the other Cherry MX greens
that they were they were mimicking their
their a clicky sound so if you're a
twitch streamer or a live streamer and
you're doing typing or gaming that can
get a little annoying to your audience
over time but if you're like me I love
the click I definitely love the click so
it's going to do a little test here this
is me doing a test of this new razor
oops
typing like a doofus here the Razer
chroma RGB mechanical keyboard and I
think that once you get used to the what
is heavier than 50g switch then it is it
is something that is pretty easy to type
on once you get used to mashing the
keyboard yeah so when I get on my cherry
and it's brown keyboards which are
pretty much all my other keyboards I
find myself typing really heavy on it so
these are certainly what feels to be
heavier than 50 grams switches now it
could be entirely wrong I was comparing
it like I said to other Cherry MX blues
that I have in the room in the office
here that are 50 grams actuation weight
so whatever I digress we're going to do
now is we're going to go ahead and jump
into the software here we're going to
show you guys how you can customize the
lighting and how easy it really is to
use all right here we go guys razer uses
a program called Razer synapse to do all
of their control of all of their
peripherals today we're gonna take a
look at the keyboard and specifically
we're going to look at the lighting
because macros are pretty easy works the
same as all the other macro keyboards
but obviously today we care about
lighting now you have your base effect
right here which is where you can choose
as you can see breathing let's say green
white so it's going to actually now
start breathing different colors and
effects and stuff on here you can do
reactive typing so when you push a
button it lights up momentarily and then
turns off and you can to choose how long
the duration is it's making it longer
so you can see those keys are going to
see on for longer we can make it shorter
the skis are going to be on shorter
you've got static so I've got yellow on
here it looks orange on the little chart
here because well the RGB is imperfect
side to do orange to make it look more
yellow and then you can do well you know
we need to make it white white always
looks good I like white keyboards too
and then let's say we want to do
something custom though right custom is
custom is what it's all about so there
we'll just make it just making kind of a
blue color there so now that's blue but
let's say we want to do something custom
on here so it's going to remove that
wave effect let's make this a yellow
keyboard there there's our yellow
keyboard but we want to do something
custom that happens when we type on it
solo we can add an effect think
Photoshop here you can add an effect and
let's do a reactive effect so you want
to leave the static on the bottom that's
the color we have right here as you can
see that you'd even turn the eye off but
it's the static color because that's we
chose as our base and we're adding a
layer effect on top of it so you have to
choose the keys you want to affect so if
you only wanted to affect those keys or
maybe just those keys or you can break
up the keyboard or even just the macro
key so you can do that but I'm going to
make it all keys and when I type on it
they're going to turn pink for a long
period of time kind of a dark pink BAM
so now as you can see we turn on our
static effects there's our yellow but
now when I type on it as you can see
they turn that color and then they go
back to yellow you can even make it
instead of lighting up a different color
during reactive that it turns off the
keys when you type on it so as you can
see right now folks I made the static my
bed BAM so remember it's like layers so
on top we're going to make all these
keys turn off when we type on them so
you can see it's still on it's still
yellow but now we're typing and the keys
are turning off as we type on it we can
make the duration long as I'm doing all
kinds of things over here my goodness
there we go so yeah
you see the keys are turning off as we
type on you can delete effects that you
don't want on there you can do
pre-selected quick pics here quick pic
all you can make it spectrum cycling
that's where it just kind of slowly will
rotate through all of the different
colors of the rainbow and with yellow
green red blue all that sort of stuff
it's not really doing anything right now
though because I have a static color
selected as the base so you wouldn't do
it that on top of a static but you can
play with it quite a bit you've got your
ripple effect here
let's do ripple and a color of now you
can do that so now when you type on it
as you can see ripples out and you can
change those colors you can see we just
have yellow and green here but let's
make yellow red and let's make green
let's make that white oops
done BAM so now you have red and white
as you can see and you can say how fast
or slow so we can make it more of a
medium speed we can make it affect wider
keys and we can say how many keys per
second we want to affect it happens on a
key press you can even make it go three
times if we want bam bam bam so yeah you
can do a lot of really cool stuff with
this I think black red white actually
looks good we'll do red and white build
in the future all right so the Razer
mechanical keyboard the BlackWidow
chroma RGB I think it's a fantastic
keyboard now I know I've been a little
bit hard on Razer in the past but I
think that they have a clear winner here
now even though it's not Cherry MX
switches I got past that pretty damn
quickly it's got a decent warranty the
rating up to sixty million clicks as
long as that holds up I don't see
anything going wrong with this keyboard
the software is extremely easy to use as
you guys saw it is just stupidly easy to
use which I think gives this a definite
competitive edge so it's got the same
layout and and aesthetics that everyone
likes with the Black Widow keyboard but
it brings in that custom RGB function on
top of it which is really making it
compete with the Corsair k70 now I know
I've mentioned
k70 a few times in this video and I
think that this is definitely worth
mentioning compared to that because this
is the only keyboard going toe-to-toe
with it with better software as far as
I'm concerned it doesn't have a
phonebook size manual and require rocket
science and a PhD to figure out how to
use everyone I know including Barney
Cleese has said that the software on the
coarser side is just stupid so I love
the fact that this is extremely easy to
use it's all on the fly you can access
all of your settings in the cloud so if
you go somewhere you're traveling and
you have all the settings saved on what
would be a local client you don't to
worry about that you can access
everything from the cloud and it saves
to the device itself so there you go
guys
the Chrome RGB keyboard is going to be
sitting here on my main station probably
for a while it has all the stuff I was
looking for and more when it comes to a
mechanical keyboard now I finally have
the RGB custom matched keys to go with
skunkworks a nice and it's kind of a
pee-pee yellow here like a not like a
dehydrated pea but more of just a
regular like healthy okay you know what
I mean anyway head down to the
description if you guys want to check
out more information about this keyboard
there's a amazon affiliate link down
there if you guys want to buy it and
support the channel at the same time
otherwise buy it through your favorite
vendor or favorite youtuber affiliate
account that's perfectly okay to head on
over to Twitter Facebook or the forum's
forums Jason or forum JC sense comm we
got a huge community there or
approaching 3000 members now and you
guys are awesome for that it's always
been a dream of mine to kind of have a
Tech forum where people can just kind of
come and talk Tech and be civil to each
other and so far that's happening so you
guys are freaking awesome and amazing
for that
there you go tell me what keyboard you
guys are also using down in the comments
I'm kind of interested in what you guys
look for with keyboards it's always hard
to do peripheral reviews they're very
very subjective when it comes to feel
texture size color as with a lot of
things in life it's all perspective and
subjective anyway I'm going to get on
out of here guys I hope you enjoy hope
you've enjoyed today's video and I'm sub
mangling on mega
you guys can't understand what I'm
saying haven't been drinking I promise
alright we'll see you the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
