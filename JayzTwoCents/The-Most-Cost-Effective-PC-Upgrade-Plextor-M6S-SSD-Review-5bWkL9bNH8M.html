single day I get tons and tons and tons
of messages from people asking me how
they can make their computer faster but
without breaking the bank
I see messages from people saying
they've got great motherboards great
processors lots of RAM and a great GPU
and they don't know what to do to just
get that last bit of performance out of
their computer and I think the answer to
that is gonna be got an SSD bro now SSDs
are one of those things that I think a
lot of people have not really caught on
to just how much bang for buck there is
and how much you're gonna really speed
up your system by considering going with
a solid-state drive now solid-state
drives have been dropping dramatically
in price over the last 12 months in fact
a couple of years ago most people would
not have been able to afford even a
small SSD around 128 gigabytes now today
we're gonna be taking a look at the
Plextor m6s this is a 256 gigabyte
variant it is available in 128 256 and
512 Plextor you need to make a one
terabyte version seriously
everything's getting so cheap there's no
reason not to have one terabyte get on
that please now this does feature the
true speed sustained high performance
technology which is basically there
that's what they're calling their
firmware and we're going to talk about
the specs real quick now the 256
gigabyte version has a read speed of up
to 520 megabytes in sequential read a
412 402 a goal for an intregal byte
that's that's a new that's actually a
new terabyte it's a total byte 420
megabyte sequential write speed and it's
got up to 90,000 write random reads for
your eye ops of 4 KB that is pretty fast
for a SATA Drive now this does get the
best performance out of a SATA 3 6
gigabit per second port but it is also
compatible with three gigabit per second
and 1.5 gigabit per second but I
definitely recommend hooking this thing
up to a 6 gigabit per second on an Intel
controller in fact we'll get a little
bit more to that a little bit later this
drive does feature a nice
really attractive aluminum around a
little mininum a little iminium if
you're over across the pond case here it
is a two hundred two hundred it's a two
hundred inch form factor guys geez I am
just not able to talk very good ER today
now it is a two and a half inch form
factor just like pretty much all SATA
SSDs that are out there and it does have
a very stylish aluminium aluminium
aluminium
I can't even say aluminum any more
properly so many people from across a
pond or like it's aluminium it isn't an
aluminium we really Americans the
aluminium yeah it is an aluminium shell
on here very attractive it's most of the
time it's not going to show but at least
you guys know you have some bling in
there and it does have of course your
SATA power and your SATA 3 connector
right there now it's not a whole lot to
say about the looks of an SSD but I know
what you guys want to know and you want
to know how well this thing performs
when I first hooked it up to my system
behind me here in one of my hot swap
drives I was having some very sporadic
performance in fact the first bit of
performance that I had was a about 250
megabyte by 250 megabyte read/write
speed and sequential which was quite a
bit lower than advertised so I
immediately took a look at my
connections and of course the hot swap
drive I plugged it into was a three
gigabit per second port make sure you
have it in a six gigabit per second port
guys most motherboards today have at
least one or two or in my case six so I
moved it over to a six gigabit per
second port and I was only getting
speeds of 386 sequential read by 276
megabyte sequential write and that was
still much lower than advertised and I
was scratching my head going what the
heck is going on so I looked up and I
looked up the BIOS and the manual of my
z77 OC formula which is right there
behind me and found out that I was
actually running on the Marvell
controller and it's recommended to run
these guys on the Intel z 77 or newer
chipset controller and once I did that
our speeds went through the roof 532
megabyte sequential read by 460 megabyte
sequential right now when it comes to
the advertised speeds they advertise
that the 256 megabyte
for the 256 gigabyte model what is wrong
with me here that's a super small SSD
256 K
my model is capable of a 520 megabyte
per second read by a 420 megabyte
sequential right so we actually got
faster than advertised speeds of course
this was not the operating system drive
it was just sitting there waiting to be
read and reading and writing and doing
all that kind of stuff so you guys can
see it is extremely beneficial now I
wanted to go ahead and see how this
thing writes in a multimedia environment
so I fired up dxtory to see how this
thing handled DX Tory's live-streaming
writing capability actually has a
built-in benchmark well it will test how
fast it can write to the drive in a
gaming situation where its encoding and
writing directly to the drive and we got
a 442 megabyte per second multimedia
right speed so guys we are definitely
getting advertised speeds here with this
Plextor m6s now if you guys want to
really speed up your system and you want
to do it very cost effective and you
were not using an SSD I highly highly
recommend the Plextor m6s the price
comes in very very competitive the 256
gigabyte model might be a little bit
small for some people especially when
games like titanfall are taking over 50
gigabytes of space battlefield for
taking well over 30 gigabytes of space
yeah I do recommend getting a 512
megabyte if you can't afford it but at
the very least getting yourself a 128 or
256 putting your operating system on
there and getting a couple of your
favorite games and programs on there you
will be surprised at just how much your
processor is being held back by the
read/write speed of a standard hard
drive to put things into perspective
when we compared this Plextor em success
in dxtory
to standard Toshiba one terabyte 7200
rpm 32 megabyte cache drive it was
getting just over a hundred and ten
megabytes per second right speed versus
four hundred and forty two of the SSD so
you can see four times the speed of a
standard traditional hard drive so guys
if you want to speed up your systems and
you are not running an SSD by far the
quickest easiest most cost effective way
to do that is to go out and get yourself
an SSD now it's not going to actually
make your frames per second and games
any better but it is going to it is
going to dramatically reduce the load
times
in fact on games like titanfall I'm
usually the first one in there and
waiting for everyone else to load it is
just that fast so guys go and check out
the Plextor m6x m6s links are down in
the description as well as other links
that you guys can use to help support
channel Amazon links coupon codes for
different sponsors and of course all of
those things are to give you guys
discounts when buying I don't really get
any kickbacks from any of those
affiliate codes it's just to save you
guys some money which is what Jay is all
about making you guys smart prosumers
instead of being consumers and just
making you guys love your PC's as much
as I love mine don't forget guys I do
have project skunk works that is still
currently in the works and this long
weekend with the 4th of July holiday
coming up I'm going to be working on
this bad boy and I hope to get as much
bit done as possible and of course this
Plextor drive is going to be making its
way in to that bad boy so as always guys
I hope you can see you in the next one
follow on Twitter if you want to chat
with me or hop on Facebook or Google+ or
all of that multimedia stuff and as
always I hope to see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
