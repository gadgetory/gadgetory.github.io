watching your local tech guru tech
addict computer geek J's two cents and
today we're going to take a look at how
to connect all of those pesky tubes when
it comes to water cooling you got all
these bins you got spaghetti and stuff
but how do you put it all together we're
going to take a look at some really cool
fittings today sent over by alpha cool
don't go away now when it comes to hoses
and such there are a lot of different
sizes so we're off to bet I'm going to
let you know that these fittings were
taking a look at are going to be four
half inch inner diameter three-quarter
inch outer diameter which is pretty much
the biggest tube that people tend to use
in water cooling but there's a lot of
different sizes and the fittings and the
definitely get tailored towards the size
of your choosing now when it comes to
connecting the hoses to your different
parts you're going to need a fitting and
by that you have different types of
fittings you have barb fittings
compression fittings and basically a
barb fitting would look like this - the
threading on the back and the hose
pretty much just pushes right on to that
and then you would need some sort of
clamp to hold that together but we're
taking a look today is the alpha cool
half inch inner diameter 3/4 inch outer
diameter compression fitting these are
very high quality fittings they're made
of brass they are chrome powder-coated
but they are available in as a matte
black as well as a polished copper and
when you take the fitting you get this
lock washer here which basically secures
this hose onto the clamp but make sure
nothing's going to come up and this is a
very tight fit right off the bat but
once you screw this down you get a nice
secure fitting so now you can see I've
got it pretty much here on both ends so
this then would go into your block or
your pump or whatever it is that you're
connecting put your pump or your hose on
pull the clamp on and there you go now
one thing I want to point out is a lot
of people with compression fittings
think that they have to
in this nut all the way down they've got
to get it all the way flush or they're
not going to get a secure connection
that's not true if it came if it
threaded all the way down that tells me
as a water cooling expert that this
fitting is not tighten up on this hose
which you give you a possibility of
leaks or popping off or something along
those lines so you want to tighten it
down as tight as you possibly can with
hit by hand and with that you're not all
of that pulling I can't get this hose
out you can see it went a little bit
crooked but how much pressure are you
planning on putting on this inside of
your system okay now here what you're
saying you're talking you're saying okay
well there's lots of bends and things
and you know hose has only been so far
you know you don't want to kink it like
that that's a problem well it's okay
because alpha pools got you covered with
a couple of different options when it
comes to bends we've got a 90 degree
elbow here which has a threaded portion
here on the bottom it's a swivel so this
threads into your block and then this
can swivel to angle wherever you need it
like this and then on the top here it's
also a swivel so it's a dual swivel so
if you were to take your compression
fitting hook it into here or your Barb
or whatever you're using you can now see
if you were to lock this in and this is
locked in somewhere without an on
kinking basically this is a non kink
swivel as you tighten this down you can
see you get a twist in there and that
makes Ben's kink automatically well with
this swivel built into the apical ninety
degree you can spin this hose all day
long and as you can see it doesn't kink
the only thing I don't like about this
fitting though is they didn't give you
very much threading on the bottom right
here so you can almost impossible to get
your fingers in there so you have to use
some sort of a needlenose pliers which
then gives you the chance of possibly
marring or scarring even the fitting or
the part that it's screwed into I do
wish they gave you a little bit more
thread room like they did here with the
45 degree anti kink swivel fitting
thing see how this has much more on the
bottom here for you to grab on to and
thread so this one you can screw in my
hand speaking of the 45-degree angle
fitting let's take on our compression
fitting here as you can see this can
swivel around and go in any direction
that you need it so this is very handy
if you don't need to make a very tight
Bend you don't need to make a 90-degree
Bend but you do have to make up you know
you want to route your tube around
something or get a nice clean Bend the
alpha cool 45 degree angle here comes in
real handy now what if you need to make
a 90 degree Bend but you don't have room
to make a sharp bend like this let's say
you got to come out from a CPU block and
go up over the RAM or something
well alpha cools got you covered there
too with their dual swivel 90 degree and
what this is is it's got two different
swivel portions here let me go ahead and
put our compression fitting on here you
can see there is a 90 degree Bend in
that but it gives you some height so
with that you can move it around like
this as you can see you know it's it's
also not kinking you can also bring it
up and out like that so you can get as
you can see right here you can get a lot
of different combinations of bends
inside it's very very cool even if you
didn't need to use a pin let's say you
needed an offset you can bend that up
like that and there you go you've got no
Bend at all but you have yourself a nice
little offset a lot of people use this
when they want to get a straight piece
of hose between something but the pieces
don't exactly line up you can eat
yourself an offset a lot like this or
you can even take it and add other
fittings to that like say this the
45-degree fitting and you can get
yourself some sort of custom you know
little jig jabber thing here and you get
even more custom ability customers and
Buzz abilities to hook this up however
you need it
so alpha cools really got you outfitted
with a lot of different types of
fittings and they are definitely
competitive when it comes to the pricing
they are usually about sixty percent of
the cost of the competitive other brands
that are making swivel type fittings but
with that comes a couple of things that
I don't like and for instance I'm going
to come off right off the bat and say
what I don't like about the dual swivel
90 degree fitting if you look at the
finish here it is something happened in
the finish where it doesn't look like it
got the coating didn't get very even on
the end so it's kind of dull you know
it's not a major problem it's a
something that I seriously you know it's
cosmetic so you definitely want it to be
young uniformed but you know out of an
entire box of fittings that they sent me
only one fitting of all the types of
fittings look like that so that's just a
little bit but how much do I think that
these fittings are worth it well I think
the quality is there I think the seal is
good I think the price is right and I'm
using them in my high-end gaming system
as you can see if I didn't think that
these fittings were worth it if I
thought that there was any chance that
these were going to destroy my high-end
gaming rig these would definitely not be
in my machine so there you go guys this
is the Alpha cool different types of
fittings here and if one last thing if
you don't want to buy compression
fittings separately they do sell these
fittings with the compressions already
attached permanently attached but I
already attached to the fittings so you
can get this hole like you could get
this you know 45 degree Bend swivel
fitting here pre attached with the clamp
on there in the size of your choosing
for one low price so there you go a lot
of you guys have asked me about water
cooling stuff and how you connect all
the hoses and how you keep from getting
you know what looks like the freeway
interchange system in Los Angeles into
your computer and get nice clean routing
as you can see with my system there you
go so there you go guys to spend Jay's
two cents bringing you a review of the
Alpha cool compression 45 degree 90
degree dual swivel and nine
degree swivel anti cake fittings big
thanks to aqua tuning for sending these
to me go and check out opportunity
opportunity WS and go and check out
their Facebook page aqua tuning UK with
that guys I'm going to go ahead and get
on out of here and we've got some big
news coming up like I've said don't go
