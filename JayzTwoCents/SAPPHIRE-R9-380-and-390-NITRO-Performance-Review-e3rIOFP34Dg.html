is anyone willing to work for long hours
and no pay I'm just kidding please don't
send me your resumes people actually did
that last time I made a joke thanks
Linus for having to actually hire people
on a YouTube channel alright I think
we're in focus there okay so I'm gonna
apologize ahead of time because I have
got a head cold little Jay went back to
school last week and you know what kids
do when they go back to school
they bring home germs lots of them and
I've had all summer to just not have to
deal with the germs of other kids at the
school that my daughter just happens to
be a host and a transportation device
for so guess what I'm getting sick but I
have a video to do I have to do this
video and I cannot just lay in bed and
play games on my laptop which I would
love to do because I have work to do so
anyway the only way I'm getting through
this video today and I might be talking
really fast and I just realized that
it's because I am all hopped up on drugs
chip I actually have taken mucinex I
have taken saline nasal spray and I have
taken a Snickers bar I haven't had I
don't really eat candy bars but I needed
something and I just don't have an
appetite and monster energy drink it's a
zero calorie one though so don't judge
me feeling a little bit out of body
experience right now if you know what
I'm saying so I apologize if this video
is a little bit weird you guys might
actually enjoy it even more so with that
said let's go ahead and get in to the
review Wow when I turned my head right
there it was like a delay it's crazy
the new z170 classified motherboard from
EVGA features 8 phase PWM 4 Way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want a badass motherboard with
no compromises click the link below to
learn more
first up r9 380 nitro from sapphire now
sapphire has kind of taken the approach
of well we hear you folks you don't want
to orange graphics cards you don't want
blue graphics cards you just want nice
jet black graphics cards so guess what
they did I mean a black graphics card so
they are 9 390 and the 380 nitro are
featuring black with gunmetal accents
which is really nice I don't have any
blingy LEDs shining all over the place
no glowing name plates no frou-frou type
stuff which other brands are known for
doing they are just giving you a hot
mess right here where it's just black
and it looks good no matter what system
you put it in there is no backplate
unfortunately on either of these two
cards and I know
no Sapphire is probably like die jail
you'll get off your high horse about the
back plates we're trying to keep the
cost down well you know what I like back
plates and that's not gonna change
anytime soon not to mention I gave
everyone else crap for it so I'll go
ahead and do that too I guess I wouldn't
have expected one on this price point
but I probably would have on this price
point but anyway they shave 10 or 15
bucks off there by not putting a back
plate alright we're moving on now we'll
stop talk about the back plates you got
what looks like two 100 millimeter fans
on here giving you lots of static
pressure over the heatsink running the
length of the card two 6-pin PCI Express
power connectors on here for power
delivery and you do have a multi bio
switch on here now this isn't their
normal push-button bios which for like
their UEFI bios that's just a toggle but
you are going to have some bios to play
around with on there and then for
connectivity you have got DisplayPort
you've got HDMI and a DVI II or DVI I
and DVID what is DVI II don't even know
DVI e is DVI efficient I don't know
anyway this thing has got nine hundred
and eighty-five megahertz which is a
factory overclock from sapphire and I
believe it was 14
five megahertz on the RAM on this thing
it's also got two gigabytes of vram
which is going to place this card right
around the 1080p performance range
depending on the title you might get
away with some 1440p gaming 4k gaming
not an option on this card period in
fact you will see it in the benchmarks
but that's only because I was just
running the gambit of sweets that I
normally do pretty much ignore the 4k
numbers they're just kind of there
because it was like why not but you
really should pay attention to the 1080p
numbers and some of the 1440p depending
on the title when it comes to the 380
now the 390 on the other hand this thing
is a little bit more capable of 4k
gaming sorta and I'll tell you why in a
moment but first let's go ahead and do
the walkthrough try x3 fans on this bad
boy keeping things nice and cool five
copper heat pipes again trying trying to
keep the core as cool as possible
actually does a really good job of it
and you'll see that in the charts it's
got a cooler that runs longer than the
length of the card by about an inch and
a half so you've got a ton of watts
that's capable being displaced on this
cooler in fact the temperatures stayed
very respectable on this card
even when overclocked look at the chart
if you wanna know what those numbers
were the card is sporting eight
gigabytes of vram running at 1500
megahertz also overclockable which I did
overclock it to 1600 megahertz for my
testing and it's got at 1010 megahertz
core clock from the factory again an
overclock over the reference 390 which I
pushed all the way up to 1000 125
megahertz comfortably I was able to push
it all the way to 1150 however it didn't
pass some of my tests so I backed it
down to 1125 for a guaranteed stable
clock that made it through all of my
tests so other than that you do have the
standard bios switch up here which is a
push-button UEFI bios it's going to glow
blue that's unfortunate because
everything about this card is black and
then you've got a really bright glaring
blue LED if you happen to an enable that
bios so maybe if they had made this
white or even just tone down the
brightness a little bit I think would
have matched the aesthetics of the card
a little bit better code activity is
different though on the 390 you've got a
DVI and then you have got one
you three display ports and an HDMI
again sporting the solid black with
gunmetal accents on here looks fantastic
at any angle that's how it's going to
kind of look in your system like that
you can see all those fins on there all
those fins normally I would take this
cooler off to investigate how the vrm
and power delivery is being addressed
but it's not my card I don't get to keep
it so therefore I am NOT going to take
it apart but I can tell you that they do
have vrm cooling addressed on here at
least with it looks like some heat sinks
kind of stuck on there as well as the
major heat sink in the back here is
touching the vrm through like a little
transfer plate it's not a direct copper
heat pipe transfer of heat but it is
addressed anyways it's not like they
just glued on a couple of heat sinks and
we're like best of luck PRM hope you
don't blow up so they did address that
let's go ahead and do the benchmarks you
guys can look at the charts and like I
said kind of ignore the 4k numbers on
the 380 I mean like I said it's not a 4k
gaming card it's not even really a 1440p
gaming card
so definitely ignore that all right guys
let's go ahead look at the benchmarks
and I'll see you after transition
okay so this is going to be a little
different I figured instead of just
flashing all of the charts across the
screen and expecting you guys deposit
that will just take a few minutes here
and we'll talk about each chart I think
that I'll answer some questions allows
me to sort it and play around with it
and actually present to you guys the
charts in the way in which they're meant
to be presented all right so first up we
have core clocks as I said I use the 970
SSC at sapphire 92 r9 380 the 390 and I
use the r9 290x matrix Platinum from
Asus because currently that's the only
290x that I currently have currently
current currency currently like 15 times
in this video probably that's the only
card that I have fully benchmarked right
now in all of these so I'll be working
more on that in the future but as you
can see the 970 is clocking up to 1440 -
that's actually conservative most 1500
plus but that's where this particular
card kind of crapped out the 380 and the
390 nitro both hit 1125 now the three
80s and 980 5 megahertz so it's got a
bigger overclock than the 390 but the
390 s got a bigger chord and more stream
processor so it's gonna be more powerful
anyway even though the processor is the
same speed and then the matrix Platinum
stopped at 1075 because well if you
watch my review you'll know that this
card really didn't overclock very good
at all temperatures we have got this
sorted highest to lowest and obviously
lower is better and as you can see once
again the 290 matrix platinum 79 degrees
at that overclock that's that's kind of
hot in my opinion I think it should be
cooler the 970 SSC OC hit 77 so what's
awesome about this is look at this the
390 nitro 72 degrees Celsius overclocked
and then the 380 hit 71 overclocked that
is super low that's one of the lowest
I've seen AMD cards actually max out at
I mean that's fantastic temperatures
obviously that cooler is working so next
up is fire strike and we sorted this by
the normal setting here and then we
could play around with extreme and ultra
but as you can see here a fire strike
doesn't tell the whole story and this is
why it's important that you don't only
use synthetic benchmarks to draw your
conclusions of graphics card performance
and here's why the 970 SSC OC is hitting
the highest scores
almost well pretty much all around for
the most part I guess but what's
happening here is this isn't giving you
a true real world gaming experience and
I'll show you why but you can see the
three 90s right on its heels of 13 204
versus a 1375 and then as you could
expect we go down the list here with the
290 X then the nitro unlocked or stock
speeds 1970s SC stock you can see was
was quite the jump when she overclocked
it and then the 380 nitro OC and non OC
you can see there down here kind of
where they'd be expected to be if we
sort this by extreme numbers you can see
things don't really change much but once
you go to ultra you can see we only get
some things playing around you know down
here in the lower range a little bit
things don't move a whole lot as you can
see I mean things really aren't changing
very much now moving on to Witcher this
is why I say that the entire picture is
not painted with fire strike because if
we took fire strike and said well the
970 is performing better than everything
therefore we can draw the conclusion of
the 970 is better well guess what
obviously that's not the case here
the 290x matrix platinum for whatever
reason was getting the most FPS on
witcher 3 on the ultra settings with the
high post processing preset with hair
works and all that crap turned off as
you can see the 970 was 1 FPS below that
but if you look at the 1440p numbers you
can see the 970 did beat them 290x but
matched the 390 nitro when overclocked
now if we sort that by 1440p you can see
the 390 moves up to second place and if
we sort it by 4k well look at that the
390 moves up to first place
so obviously the vram is doing its job
in the 390 versus the 970 because as a
resolution goes up you can see the 970
starts falling down the charts Grand
Theft Auto 5 once we sort this here by
1080p as you can see the knight 390 and
the 970 are neck-and-neck at 96 FPS
average but you can see the 390 is 66
FPS versus 64 at 1440 and they both hit
32 at 4k once again the 380 is kind of
down here where you'd expect
but if you look at these 1080p numbers
65 when overclocked or even 57 when
stock these are very respectable numbers
for 1080p with 2x msaa turned on once
you turn on MSAA you get a lot of load
added to the card because basically it
has two kind of super sample the image
multiple times which takes a lot of
horsepower to do I'm moving on to Metro
this is a canned benchmark and so it
just it runs through basically the
engine and like a little battle scene so
you get the same stress as you would get
during the game so that's why most
people will use the benchmark utility
super sample is off tress effects is on
normal motions on normal and physics
which is an Nvidia technology is turned
off we don't want to unfair advantages
here so as you can see once again 1080p
102 FPS for the 390 and the 970 trails
it again only 1 FPS lower but if you
look at the 1440 and 4k numbers you can
see where you got 3 FPS more at 1440p
and 2 FPS more at 4k it may not sound
like a lot it you know 2 FPS 4k but
believe it or not that it takes a lot of
bump to get two extra FPS on on that
load it's four times the pixels of 1080p
but when you look down here again at the
380 nitro is just chugging along at 60
and 69 42 and 37 or 19 and 17 that's
that's why I said ignore the 4k numbers
really 380 at 4k mm-hmm it's not gonna I
mean like a twitcher right 15 likes
anyway Crysis 3 alright so as you can
see here 1080p once again 63 vs. 62 of
the 290 and you can see the 1970's
fallen it's starting to fall down quite
a bit here 1440p let's so it oh and then
you know obviously the 380 51 and 44
again respectable fps doesn't hit that
magic 60fps not in crisis anyway but I
want you to look at how close the three
80s are both you know the OC and the
standard AR to the rest of the numbers
versus say GTA 5 you see this gap right
here how far this has to go to match up
with the rest of these the fact that
Crysis 3 it's much closer this shows
you've got more of an engine
optimization thing happening here rather
than graphics card performance so I just
wanted to keep that in mind if we sort
by 1440p you can see the 290x is a
1fps ahead of the 390 and then the 970
and then 390 stock so you can see the 3
the 970 overclocked is matching the
stock 390 nitro so 970 overclock versus
390 nitro same exact fps here but once
you overclocked the nitro obviously it
takes off a bit past the stock 970 Far
Cry 4 you can see here again a very
narrow margin especially at 1440p I mean
all of them hit 53 53 53 that was kind
of amazing for K 28 27 27 but 81 then
390 pulled out ahead quite a few FPS and
then three ATS down here at 52 and 45
and these numbers again not the magic
60fps but if we took off some of that 2x
msaa
and the edge h bao which is technically
an nvidia standard unfortunately i've
benchmarked with this on so we'll have
to maybe run this again in the future
but you can see here that if you took
off 2 X MSA and moved ultra down to high
these numbers would clearly get the 60
FPS number and last but not least
battlefield this is Direct X not mantle
if I ran mantle then I wouldn't be able
to actually you know directly compare
these or measure the numbers very well
so 970 s giving us the best performance
in 1080p by a couple of FPS but you can
see the 390 at 1440p gives us a little
edge we've matched each other in 4k and
you can see down here the 380
you know 77 and 68 good numbers for
1080p on the 380 I'm pleased with that
1440p once again bump ultra down to say
you know high or medium and you get even
1440p would easily be up in the 60s
maybe even higher than that so there's
that I want to talk about these numbers
rather than just show them to you so
tell me how you guys feel about this
format maybe we'll keep it maybe we
won't
back to you J in the studio all right so
those are the numbers tell me what you
guys think I still think the r9 390 is a
fantastic fantastically positioned card
if that makes sense it doesn't destroy
your wallet it doesn't destroy your
budget it gives you great FPS and games
especially if you're not like an FPS
Nazi and you're ok with you know things
that are not you know 100 FPS or 200 FPS
which is you know honestly a bit
ridiculous even though I do like those
fps
is FPS is I don't even if that's real
whatever I'm sick now if you're on a
lesser budget I think the 380 is also a
fantastic card for 1080p gaming at you
know medium to high settings one thing I
want to point out and it might seem
unfair for those that would say well
it's not fair that you took the 380 and
you ran it on ultra settings with MSAA
well the numbers that you're seeing that
are still extremely respectable or at
settings that were a bit higher than
this card is really placed and aimed at
so that means that your numbers running
something like medium or high settings
and not ultra and bumping down the MSAA
or even turning that off in some games
depending would only give you better
numbers so you're kind of seeing what
the worst case scenario would be with
this card depending on the games that
you play there you go guys the nitro
series cards they also do have I believe
a 390 X in there but we didn't take a
look at that I've actually not looked at
any 390 X's yet might have one coming up
here very shortly on this channel stay
tuned for that but I'm gonna go ahead
and get on out of here guys
r9 390 nitro r9 380 nitro I think great
cards they do exactly what they're
advertised to do which is give you a
great gaming experience in colors that
you guys have asked for at least some of
you some of you may have been like I
like orange I'm I don't I want black on
one orange finally go buy an orange one
alright it's time to get out of here
thanks for watching guys and thank you
for 400,000 subscribers that's crazy we
just might have to get up and do
something special for that alright see
you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
