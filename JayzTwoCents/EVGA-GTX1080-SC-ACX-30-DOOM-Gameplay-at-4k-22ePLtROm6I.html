coming at you with another gtx 1080
video and your inbox is probably going
to explode with these videos because it
is official launch date for gtx 1080 and
for the last several weeks you have been
teased and pretty much showing
performance for all the founders edition
cards which people are like whatever
okay it's reference we're tired of
hearing about that and the fact that
even cost a hundred dollars more really
kind of deflated the entire height
balloon
I don't know pipes usually bloom but
anyway it was pretty deflated Computex
just happened or is happening right now
technically and I'm gonna be taking a
look here at the EVGA superclocked GTX
1080hd X 3.0 two new cooler on the
reference board so what exactly does
that mean well we're going to find out
today looking for better sound while on
the go then head to mass drop because
right now they have an amazing drop
going for the centrist DAC port slim
delivering big sound and a small two and
a half pounds package that fits
comfortably in the palm of your hand all
while delivering enough power to rock
your favorite headphones click the link
below for this exclusive offer only at
mass drop alright so this as a founders
card and this is also a founders card
what does that mean it means they are
the exact same board layout there's
nothing custom about the PCB on the e
BGA board in fact it even says in video
right here on the PCI Express socket so
what that means is these two boards are
pretty much identical but what's
different here is the fact that we have
the AC X 3.0 cooler on here and because
we're going to get better thermals we
are going to get better clock speeds out
of the box
in fact the base clock on the AC X 3.0
is seventeen hundred and eight megahertz
up from the 1607 found on the founders
card and then our boost clock on here is
eighteen hundred and forty seven
megahertz up from 1733 on the founders
card and it's going to do it a whole lot
quieter one other thing to note is
because this is a founders Edition card
means we are not going to see any
additional power limit above 120 because
of the limitations of the vrm design
that's on here so you're going to wait
for custom boards to be built like for
the wind classified and all of the other
brands before you're going to start
seeing
increase power limit which could help
with some of your overclocking now let's
just spend a moment here on the new a CX
3.0 cooler which is quite obviously the
most radical redesign of their a CX
series coolers since it started several
years ago I posted a picture of this up
on Twitter the other day and there was a
lot of mixed reactions some people
thought it looks super beastly other
folks thought it looked gaudy now
obviously looks are subjective and one
thing I want to point out is that this
is real aluminum accenting on here which
looks white on camera but in person it
is not it is very aluminum colored with
a nice black accents all over the place
so it's got a really good contrast going
unfortunately cameras just don't pick
that up as well as the human eye desk
but starting on the face of the card we
have the same swept fan blade design as
you can see right here some folks think
that this looks like it's pulling air
through the card it's not it's still
pushing they started that with a CX 2.0
but we do have these grilles right here
with the white backing these actually do
glow white and they're going to give you
a little bit of I know I guess a little
bit of JDM under glow if you will when
it's mounted in your card this way now
looking at the top we've got a giant
EVGA GTX our GeForce GTX 1080 logo which
does illuminate white my personal
opinion is this is a little bit big I
would have liked to have seen it a
little bit more small and kind of subtle
rather than just kind of be like boom in
your face just like 1080 especially if
you put a couple leads in SLI that's
gonna be really big but again that's a
little bit of subjective if you will of
course there is a backplate you guys
know that EDG would have been reamed if
they didn't put a backplate on a car
that cost over $600 well there it is
again vents nice brushed aluminum looks
very very nice and it's going to look
great in your system because this is
obviously what you spend most of your
time looking at now there are a number
of heat pipes that are actually s
channeled along the length of the card
so they're not just straight pipe like
found on the 970 they do have a curve
going on here and there is a ton of heat
sinks or heatsink fins in here that are
going to help generate a mutt as much
heat dissipation as possible and then of
course the typical backing plate which
you'll find that's touching all of the
g5 X memory
in here eight gigabytes of it and of
course the VRMs because this is a
founders edition card I am NOT going to
go through and redo all of my benchmarks
it's 100 megahertz faster out of the box
but obviously that's going to give us a
slightly faster score or higher score in
fps and all of our games today we are
going to focus on overclocking this
thing keeping an eye on the temperatures
and we're going to do some doom in 4k
max settings as high as everything will
go yeah the anti-aliasing is going to be
maxed out I'm even going to max out
motion blur I really want to push this
card and see exactly how well it
performs in 4k on a new title a few
moments later all right so I've settled
on a 2000 88 megahertz overclocked 5500
and eight megahertz on the RAM so 11,000
megahertz on the RAM affected that is so
freakishly fast well over 200 fps and
some scenes here in the heaven benchmark
completely maxed out with tessellation
at extreme that was 1080p I just want to
show you guys what the clock was
actually running at leaving the fan
profile exactly as it ships out of the
box 120% plus on the power target 91 C
temp target offset claw our clock
offsets plus 220 and that's going to be
plus 220 above the GPU boost clock
that's already from the factory not from
the base clock one thing to keep in mind
and in memory offset plus 500 I love the
doom franchise I've played doom since I
was a kid they'll throw back levels in
this game where you can unlock accent
you know find secrets we go back to an
original level just make it a lot of fun
to play now I do know that this game has
some issues with AMD's that's why I'm
not doing any AMD comparisons with doom
or wait for some optimization on that in
fact doom I believe doesn't even have
SLI profile right now at least last time
I tried it didn't it might now but at
the moment that I tried it it didn't
work we are going to go ahead and start
at 1080p just again for the hell of it
this card should not be used for 1080p
unless you have a really high refresh
rate like 144 Hertz panel but all the
settings you can see tssaa a is at 80 X
or 8 times
motion blur is even on high I'm really
trying to stress this card out I'm going
to move the gamma up just
little bit so we can see the dark scenes
a little better we're going to save
those settings advanced settings you can
see everything is as far as it will go
to the right even the film grain is up
to 3.9 now let's even move the
sharpening up shall we just for the hell
of it
I don't even know what that's going to
do but we're going to try it anyway the
other thing I need to do here is I am
going to well you can see the frames per
second right up here in the top right
corner because I've got the overlay
going hopefully you guys can actually
read that yeah it looks like you can so
what we're gonna do here is continue to
gain so as you can see right there the
FPS is wow you know I'm gonna do I'm
going to start up fraps real quick just
because it's a little bit better counter
that one moves way too fast there we go
so you can see right there on the Left
sharpening is on it everything is as
high as it will go to the right so 1080p
obviously not a challenge for this card
whatsoever but I don't think I don't
think anyone really expected that to be
the case
now I'm really bad at this game so feel
free to laugh and mock and point all you
want more so than you guys already do
I'm cool with that
oh that's the theme of this game there's
so many brutal kills my gosh making
explosions
well shotgun to the rescue
boom
there's a lot happening right here
alright so let's do the same battle here
real quick let's go and switch it up to
1440p all the same advanced settings
remember sharpening is also as high as
it will go Oh God
I use your arm to break your head do
some explosions there so you can see
even a 1440p all settings completely
maxed out well over 100 FPS on the
averages this little gun its weak on its
non-powered mode but you know it's
actually a really good weapon me see
your head boom alright
4k let's try out some 4k here there this
low that FPS in 4k we're still chilling
now all we care about obviously is that
magic number of 60fps can we stay above
60 FPS because that's kind of like just
explosions there that's like PC
master-race right all the 60fps touting
we can do 60 FPS well can it so far the
answer is yes it can lost at the moment
it's been a while since I played this
level 2 explosion in the face it still
stayed over 60 FPS holy man but see
doesn't matter for indoors or outdoors
right now the draw distance is still
seem to be very very yeah 4k is just
like whatever Wow
I want to point out too I can't even
hear the card because the fans are not
running very quickly at all right now
temperatures hit a max of 78 the thing I
want to point out about that is if we
look at the fan percentage here the fan
tachometer neverwood above 1300 and our
actual fan speed never went about 44
yeah so if you played with the custom
fan profile which unfortunately because
this is a beta version of precision I
can't do custom profiles yet it was
really the fan was super low speed so if
you bumped up the fan speed just a
little bit to give you an idea of forty
four percent on noise level I'm just
gonna stop talking right now and I'm
gonna hit apply on that fan speed so you
can hear that with my mic
yeah you're probably going to notice
that there's no additional noise because
there isn't any so if you were to bump
this up you know on a fan profile let it
go up to say 60% you can you can barely
make that out so let's do this real
quick let's go back into the game and
with the fan profile set manually to 60
and remember this is an open air test
bench inside your case you still
wouldn't hear that
let's open up doom again and let's see
what the temperatures do after the fact
everything's still exactly set up as it
was 4k film grain through the roof
sharpening through the roof and we're
just going to do some explosions and
things here we want to make the card
kind of stress a bit we want to check
and see what happens to the temperatures
I'm feeling they're going to come down
quite a bit if you're noticing tearing
and stuff yeah this screen at 4k above
60fps does tear quite a bit but I think
with what you've seen so far now you can
see that you can easily lock this
particular but you can see that getting
the magical FPS number is no problem of
locking it at 60fps in 4k that's a big
deal to me
alright so let's look at temperatures
now our temperatures oh geez yeah see we
were sitting at 66 67 66 yeah so we kind
of capped out right there at 66 or 67 C
while the game is running it's still
running right now we're chilling at 67
that is yeah that's an amazing cooler
right there regardless how you feel what
the way it looks well now I hope you
guys understand why I didn't go back and
redo all of my pinch mark testing with
this card because it pretty much would
be the same results as this one only a
little bit higher because of the extra
100 megahertz compared to the founders
edition card because it is a reference
PCB layout with the exact same design so
what I wanted to instead show you here
today with some of the live gaming with
doom again not
they didn't even recommend I use doom I
just used doom because I've been playing
it lately I love the franchise played
doom as a kid probably led to a lot of
the issues I have today I guess but you
guys wanted to see some live benchmarks
so I went ahead and did that
now I also did some battlefield 4
testing at 4k how is kidding like 90 FPS
with all settings maxed it was
absolutely insane but one thing I want
to point out is this card right here is
seven hundred dollars six hundred and
ninety nine dollars from Nvidia even
though this is a reference PCB layout
with the custom cooler on it there right
now it it's six hundred and forty nine
dollars so it's fifty dollars cheaper
than this guy here you get better better
thermals and a lot less noise and just
as much overclocking ability
unfortunately on Twitter I saw a lot of
people complaining about the fact that
it only has one eight pin power
connector just like the reference card
here now what you have to understand
though is the amount of power that
Pascal is not requiring in order to get
these massive clocks people are saying
either 1080 is going to be a shitty
overclocker because it only has one
eight pin power connector are you
freaking kidding me this thing is
achieving 2100 megahertz my reference
card is achieving 2100 mega Hertz when I
played around with the overclock and
it's doing that with a single 8 pin
power the additional power connectors
are going to give you cleaner power
delivery for exclusive high-end water
water cooling yeah technically but phase
change in ln2 cooling from breaking
World Records and things like that it's
not going to change your mate your major
overclocking ability on air-cooled cards
and unfortunately a lot of people are
out there just kind of regurgitating
this whole adds only got one power
connector so it must suck I'm sorry but
the GTX 1080 regardless of the brand
achieving 20 100 mega Hertz is a big
deal and to discount that it's just to
kind of slap technology in the face
which I don't know if your PC Gamer
that's just that's just wrong in my
opinion okay so that's enough ranting
let's talk about price real quick this
guy as you know the founders card is 700
bucks 600 $99 gtx 980 from EVGA the ACX
3.0 superclocked
is debuting at six hundred and forty
nine dollars so it's the same PCB layout
and it's $50 less which is exactly what
we expected to see when we saw the crazy
price plan that Nvidia unveiled with the
founders edition cards that's it guys
we've enjoyed today's video we've pretty
much got every single brand maker of
custom PCB boards coming into the office
here we will be checking them all out
it's going to be like GT X 1080 season I
apologize ahead of time but you know
every year we go through this it is like
graphics card crazy time of the year
anyway time to go guys hope you guys
have a good Memorial Day weekend if you
celebrate that if you don't then just
have a good weekend in general and if
you don't even get a weekend will then
just have a good day
and if you don't have a day I understand
I should I get very little time to
myself so anyway let me go play some
doom after I edit this hi guys
see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
