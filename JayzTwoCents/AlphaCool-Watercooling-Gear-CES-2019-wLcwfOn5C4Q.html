we're here at alpha cool now at CES 2019
and we're going to talk about some of
the products are showing here in terms
of their water cooling line because this
is a brand I've actually worked with now
for about seven years and we've seen
quite the about-face and 180 in terms of
kind of like the ideology and in a good
way we're gonna talk about that because
this is this is exciting especially
they're interested in water cooling but
first we've got to thank our sponsor and
of course that is Corsair in the Corsair
one high performance desktop PC the
i-140 I 160 and I 183 found in the link
in description below let's go and start
with server grade stuff because a lot of
people forget server grade is where a
lot of things are kind of pioneered and
engineered because there's a huge power
demand as a huge heat that you know
output that has to be controlled and
we've got right here are what looked
like some very funky formats and these
are like 40 mil technically 40 mil fans
that would go in here and I seen people
go yeah what would you do with this well
these are designed for server racks and
these are what some different sized 1u
radiators would look like this is a one
kind of plumbed up right here using some
of their what they're calling alpha cool
reservoir technically these have a DC LT
pump in there which has had some
revisions over the years a very small
but powerful pump at believe 2.2 meters
of head pressure and so you can see how
it's it's designed to be very very flat
this is a blocks right here that would
also support like tr4 or like thread
dripper type to socket but this is a
server grade with multiple input/output
so you can connect it however you need
but you see how everything here is
obviously very flat so optical is very
very busy in the server space you can
see we go all the way up to to you here
and I believe you could even find some
4u stuff if you look hard enough but so
that's why you've got these what looked
like very funky formats so if you've
ever been to a data center and you've
seen what kind of you know HVAC or HVAC
units that have to keep those things
cool it is insane also how loud it could
be if you get like ultra Kazi or like
Delta fans in here you know blowing
across the the blade server then that's
a lot of noise and a lot of air that
just gets exhausted into the space that
has to be cooled well you can keep the
server cool through water cooling
obviously which means there's a lot of
R&amp;amp;D and that makes it into your
personal PC let's go and talk about this
this is the ice bear this is technically
a closed loop a IO but it's expandable
so you have some quick disconnects right
here on the rubber tube I am a huge fan
of rubber tubing
I hate fep I'm glad to see no one's
really using fep anymore it's which is
the flexible tubing that's very ribbed
for no one's pleasure in this case it's
also guy right here the ice block but
you'll never guess what that stands for
yeah so the ice block this is a well
obviously your CPU block and it would
support your you know your rising
sockets your Intel sockets but what
you've got right here is it all goes
into this kind of a self-contained unit
which has a this is a 280 millimeter or
double 140 millimeter fan setup it's got
your reservoir it's got your pump in
here this one is prefilled but you can
actually get this independently as well
so if you want to do a water-cooled
build and you can fit theoretically a
420 size radiator because there's a lot
of you know excess size on this you
could buy this as a unit separate put
this in your case and then all you have
to do is run your own block in your own
tubing or to a graphics card or whatever
and you can spend this so you have a
radiator pump and reservoir combo making
it very simplified less connections less
points of leaking oh and the fans of
course they've teamed up with teamed up
with be quiet so these are the silent
wing fans great optimized pressure
they're silent hence the name believe
these are fluid bearings so you have a
very good longevity high static pressure
I mean it's just a good collaboration
instead of trying to make a competing
product they reached out to a company
that's really sort of cornered that
market and said hey why don't we work
together and that's what that is those
people that are form over function and
function over form wherever you are it's
nice when you can get both so we've got
three different blocks right here
different variations of their blocks
these are the ice block again the GPX or
you know GPX graphics cooling you name
it so this is almost like a clamshell
where the edges of the PCB are covered
with this this is metal it's not plastic
so it hangs over the side and you can
see eggs too got a partial cover here so
if you were doing like a vertical mount
this is what it would look like side
mount it's all blacked out you can see
it's got this real sleek design it's a
matte black this I believe is a 20 atti
yeah 28
ti you can see how clean that looks it
is nickel-plated if you want to show it
off and go with full cover block you can
see right here this is the acrylic
version and there's the nickel-plated
block you can see it's full cover again
420 80 TI very aesthetically pleasing
you've got your fittings that obviously
are on both sides of the the terminal
here so regardless of which way you're
facing it you can get it to flow the way
you need to and then this is basically
the same block but just with an acetal
solid cover which i think looks amazing
i i'm really kind of finding myself
transition to this whole this whole
clint you know clean aesthetic now the
radiators have gone through a bit of a
redesign to we've we recently did a
build actually using alpha cool
radiators and are editing rig and a
couple of other systems but they've
changed their ads just a little bit this
is a 45 millimeter thick radiator but
you you can see that they change the way
the end tanks are a little bit so
instead of having that sort of a tapered
design where it sort of narrows out you
can see now it's gone with a very flat
squared-off design now this is probably
this isn't gonna really do anything for
performance it's more of a just an
aesthetically pleasing thing i can tell
you there's a high copper content in
this because this is a fairly weighty
radiator this looks to be about a 10 or
12 FP i find yeah so it's not incredibly
dense on the fin stack which is why the
extra thickness will give you you know
the additional cooling that you're
losing in terms of finding city but this
also means that you can use lesser
static pressure fans lower rpm fans to
get decent cooling without having to run
a lot of RPM or noise because you know
often times when you run fans through a
radiator the air that comes off a fan
doesn't come straight out it goes out in
a cone shape and so what happens as it
heats these fins and then it's forced
into another direction again and starts
bouncing off these fins it has to flow
through so you get this really turbulent
sound and so when you have a very dense
thin stack it kind of amplifies that
sound a little bit so this means you can
slow the rpm down the surface area isn't
sacrificed because it's thicker and so
you can get virtually the same cooling
as a higher density fpi thinner red and
by just sort of kind of adjusting the
way you get that surface area so these
are some new reds coming from well I
guess already available from alpha cool
but you know I asked him I said what are
you what are you kind of most
sited about in this show like what it
they've got this called the ice ball
this is a pump reservoir RGB combo thing
it's kind of like let's just make
something crazy for the heck of it I
feel like this is this would become the
centerpiece of the build and you build
around it in some way that I imagine
like some sort of like a bb-8 custom
thing on this or something we talked
about this at Computex and why I'm
falling in love with out cool alpha cool
said we need to be better how do we do
that
will we hire the modders we hire the
people that have been using our products
we hire the people that believe in our
products and want to see it get better
so they've hired a team of modders to
that now help with designing this stuff
testing this stuff marketing this stuff
so it's literally the brand that is
liked by modders for everyone not just
modders so they take the stuff and they
design it to if you had like
pie-in-the-sky ideas what would you do
well you get stuff like this we have
seen a huge improvement in quality of
the fittings the copper grade the
finishes the acrylics are absolutely as
clear as glass which is nice to see
because they're to make a krill look
look good it requires some finishing
work and a lot of in the past
unfortunately some of the early stuff I
talked about with alpha cool was there
was there was a lot of defects and and
blemishes and stuff that really just
sort of put a black eye on a product
that otherwise was performing very well
but it was like performance first
aesthetic second now it's performance
and aesthetics together so I felt it was
important to come to CES and see what
they had to show because alpha cool has
invested a lot of money in making this
product line appealing to everyone both
modders and general users so you can
guarantee you're gonna see more from us
as we move forward like little things
like this this the where to go it's over
here somewhere we'll just use this guy
because I kind of stacked up a bunch of
product around me so the DC LT pump
that's mounted here to the Alpha cool
reservoir it's gonna come up with a name
later this is new so this is the pump
right here that's mounted to this little
block that has input or in in and out
fittings that you could put rotaries on
double males and mount it anywhere so in
this case you have a pump pressurizing
the inlet and a pump pulling the fluid
out so you don't have a pressure drop
across across the resistance you can use
these in your own builds small
form-factor builds you don't have to
mount
to pump in a reservoir somewhere you
just get this in line somewhere
you can fill it through the extra
fittings that are showing on here and
then you can just this is the kind of
thing that I think would have come in
handy when we were doing our ghost s1
bill unfortunately you know this wasn't
available at that time but I think we're
gonna have to come up with some
interesting concepts to utilize this
sort of stuff because I think at least
the brand deserves us to go in there and
really kind of mess with it so anyway I
hope you guys have enjoyed this video
it's nice to see water cooling sort of
make it a very mainstream representation
now amongst mini brands founding brands
like alpha cool that's been around for
years and years making it so that the
average consumer can use this stuff and
feel comfortable with it so please look
for this in the future and again a huge
thanks to everyone watching this video
and a thanks to Corsair for bringing us
here at CES 2019 I know I've kind of
gone on and gushed and fanboy and
chilled enough in this video but I
believe in this product line so that's
why you guys gonna see it moving forward
all right guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in a couple minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
