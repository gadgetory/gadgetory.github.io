you see some pretty cool s ir system
integration builds and all these builds
are about to show you right now are
actually available to you as a consumer
now this is what orange and PC showing
off here at the msi booth we've got a
fully water-cooled two gtx ten atti
seahawks looks like no it's gonna be a z
series platform but that's using the msi
enthusiast board it's but really good
representation of what you can do you've
got a 120 rad in the back you got a 360
up top let's take another 360 here on
the bottom moving back over here we got
the xytec system this one's really kind
of cool that was a flex tubing system
this is all rigid tubing unfortunately
there's a lot of air in this system is
that happens when you ship these though
they get toss old and turn and air is
trapped so it's it's really kind of
bugging me that's doing that I want to I
want to fix it right now but I'm not
gonna touch their stuff but again rigid
tube bent system it's got a fill port
right here which is kind of nice it goes
to the back of the rig right there so
this is refill your system that's cool
it's got some alpha cool radiators in
there again incorporating some MSI
components motherboards this looks like
an X 299 rig right here we've got two
1080 T eyes now this right here is cyber
PowerPC is implementation of a custom
rig but this what's different about this
it's using all metal tubing it's not
bending PE T G or acrylic it's not going
with soft tubing as you can see it's
very very slick we've got all our bends
happening here with fittings what colors
this fluid looks like it's just a clear
fluid but you could do something custom
here in the reservoir if you wanted this
is a glass reservoir this is gonna be
from excess PC I'm actually running one
of these in my personal rig so very
elegant-looking
this right here from iBUYPOWER this has
always been kind of a showpiece if you
will it's got this transparent LCD
window not the first time we've seen
this we've seen this this is a couple
years old now but it just always gets me
every time when you look at this because
there's tempered glass there's you know
see-through panels plastic panels but
now that you've got transparent LCD it
just takes everything to a whole new
level in fact you can even see your
icons right here it's it is a basically
a fully functioning screen an additional
screen to your system but you get some
sort of animated graphics going and
that's what you get and of course we've
got this in this very nice white and
black build so this is main gears
implementation right here of some SI
components we've got some Samsung SSD
showing on the side it's a very narrow
and tall chassis we
also got dual GPU vertical mounted GPUs
so we've got dual GPUs in SLI
configuration fully water-cooled any
voter vertical config but this allowed
them to get a very narrow footprint and
of course we've got our PCIe riser cards
right there
very slick build we also have a 960 Pro
nvme drive running things I'm assuming
this is running some sort of a raid
config we got some ek water blocks and
bit power fittings here but they got the
pump integrated right down here in the
bottom which is nice easy filled port to
access very slick bill the lumen
embrasure lumen 'm looks very very
classy now this is over here this is
computer upgrade King this is probably
one of my favorite right here we've got
a triple parallel config right here so
they just ended up filling out this
whole this whole space with three pipes
and they've got these I don't know if
these are 3d printed or not but they're
obviously custom-made these little
brackets right here to hold everything
together they've got this really
cool-looking lighting system built into
the water cooling pump or the water
cooler water block and then as you can
see out here we've got this sort of a
terminal parallel terminal right there a
lot of work and thought went into this
even the reservoir has red anodized
aluminum caps and then on the front as
you can see we've got these blades that
stand off with the tempered glass front
we've got three LED fans right here very
small footprint - this is actually a mid
tower case so as you can see a lot of
work and thought went into that this is
CL X right here we've got again a 1080i
Seahawk mounted vertically rigid tubing
this is running so this looks like it
might be the UFO fluid looks like it's
the white / clear so you've got a little
bit of that translucent sort of effect
happening which is kind of the way a lot
of people are going right now you've got
the view fluid right Aurora has been out
for a long time and now you've got UFO
getting in on the scene some g.skill RGB
memory which is fairly standard and this
is all sitting in a fan Tex evolve which
has a custom wrap on here with some MSI
logos very clean very clean build and
then of course it kind of gets bigger
from there this is the digital storm
event on three they did be this last
year I think it was with a soft tubing
build once again but at very large
chassis a custom made chassis for they
make this themselves in-house as you can
see you could fit a fool - and
50 millimeter radiator tons of storage
options and it's inverted right this is
a this is a backwards case where
normally you would set it on the right
side everything's right side up this is
inverted and it's designed to be a left
side chassis vertical mounted radiator
right here on the bottom as well as you
could mount radiators up top there's
radiator up top I don't wanna set my
finger in there and find a fan so I
decided to check first normally I would
just do that but I won't put the lehto
over there they're seen and then we've
got of course exotic PC and this is fun
because I'm actually doing a giveaway
with exotic PC after CES so stay tuned
for that this is what they're showing
off right here this is all custom and
everything you see right here is custom
built by them we've got these brass
fittings right here these are probably
painted they could be bits power I'm not
sure but we've also got a black fluid a
black fluid in here which is very
interesting because normally black fluid
doesn't transfer heat very well but
obviously they've done it custom painted
fans very very classy build again -
vertical mounted GPUs all water-cooled
vertical mount reservoir right here I
know it's dark it's hard to see but it's
a vertical mounts and the these are this
is awesome because these are the kind of
builds that make the work that I do look
like you know chimpanzees made by
systems but that's awesome because every
single one of these s I started as a guy
like me who's just into building pcs
wants to build for the public and then
starts a business and then here it is so
all those all maybe sis they're all
built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts so
it's kind of want to take you guys on
this little tour of what they were
showing off here at the msi suite with
some of the SI or system integrator
builds and tell me what you guys think
there's some pretty sick work out there
so I thought you guys needed to see it
alright guys see yes 2018 brought to you
by EVGA thank you for sponsoring our
chip go and check them out in dbgap um
as always guys we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
