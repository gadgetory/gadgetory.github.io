piece of wearable tech by a company
called real wear this is the HMT - one
which stands for head mounted tablet
it's actually this is a would you call
this what's the rating on this bump cap
this is not just a hat
not just the thing to attach it to you
can see they obviously have some hard
hats and stuff here the idea behind this
piece of wearable tech is that you are
to be hands-free as hands-free as
possible the idea here is that you're
dealing with field technicians people
who need their hands off maybe need to
record their work or even get references
in their work you can even do video call
with this because this is basically
running Android it's a Android 6.0 point
one so it's a full bluetooth on it Wi-Fi
2.4 five gigahertz but this right here
is actually the display so you can kind
of move it around to have seven arm axes
you can move it off to the side orient
to how you want
right now I actually had the camera on
so I can see what this camera appear is
seeing but so can the camera if we're
recording if you're doing can you video
call yes yeah so video calls with this
but I was sitting here while I was kind
of watching the demo wondering what's
the use case for this and something like
us where we're doing tech and computers
and whatnot and I think to myself
imagine you guys had one of these
they're not really cheap they're 1,500
but it's a it's a serious piece of
equipment it is not it is it is not a
toy by any means this is designed to be
to survive construction sites
electrician work sites but what if you
guys were like Jamie really want you to
help me build my computer and you put
one of these things on and I'm the voice
and I'm the guy in the ear right this is
this is like a special ops operation I'm
the guy in here I'm telling you what to
do back home and I'm seeing what you
guys are seeing at first person
perspective but it's also
voice-activated completely
voice-activated I know you can't see
what I'm seeing right now so I'm gonna
say navigate home so now I see a menu in
my right eye I can say my programs
here and if cool things as you turn your
head is how you navigate through the
menu so the menu is wider than the
screen this is a I don't know if the
resolution of the screen is to be honest
it doesn't really matter it's right here
in front your face so it's pretty decent
size but if I turned my head I'm sliding
through the menu which is kind of neat
select item one so I get this little
kind of a chirp I'm a year minds me of
like the old Star Trek next generation
sound by now I'm seeing information
about the device so there's obviously a
lot of really interesting use cases for
this and others I just saw this and I
thought wow this this is this is a very
interesting piece of text if you want
know more about it check out real
where's the HMT - one heads a
head-mounted tablet and yeah thought you
guys should see it so I said we're on a
mission to find the strange and unique
tech here at CES and what I've come kind
of come across here is Sigma's project
meteor this what I initially thought was
an autonomous driving big rig is
actually not it is a 4G LTE connected
big rig to a wireless command seat we'll
call it that think of like a remote
pilot in the Air Force flying drones and
stuff you can have a remote driver
driving a fully loaded big rig allowing
for several things one to keep the
driver close to home if you've if you
know a big rig driver or you're a bigger
driver yourself and and on the road
trucker has a very hard job not just
driving the truck but being away from
family the sacrifice the time and the
effort and the money involved this
allows the driver to actually stay close
to home and drive from pretty much
anywhere but what they've got right here
is a full motion sort of a simulator set
up because this is kind of what the
driver would be experiencing while
they're driving in this surround setup
now this is actually a recording they
took from this vehicle as they were
testing it at their home commercial park
just kind of doing loops driving just
the tractor there's no trailer on this
just the tractor around there commercial
establishment but it's just sort of
testing things out but what I thought
was really unique it's not just the fact
that he's driving this thing
not being in the vehicle it's the fact
that you see the full motion here - you
have sensors in the truck almost like a
yaw sensor that can feel the vibrations
the motion the tilt of the truck you're
going down at grade it leans forward to
going up a grade it leans back you turn
fast it starts to lean so the driver is
getting that visceral experience of
being inside of this truck while he is
nowhere near it so this is a this is
something they've established and built
in and prototypes to try and solve a
problem and if you if you know a trucker
or you are trying you know exactly what
that problem is so this is interesting
I'm gonna keep my eye on this but the
thing is I asked the question about
redundancy I'm like what is the
redundancy on this we all have LTE and
we've all had a dropout so what happens
it's going down the road 80,000 pounds
loaded suddenly the driver gets a
disconnected or a frozen screen now what
well that's when they're going to be
falling back on autonomous driving
autonomous is the that's obviously been
a huge focus autonomous autonomous
autonomous is what people are talking
about so it's got a redundant backup for
an autonomous driving to keep the
vehicle under control until a
communication is reestablished so the
driver could also set autonomous driving
in certain circumstances where it may
not be safe for instance inclement
weather fog you can't see through by our
cameras and we're in another heat
signature cameras can't see through fog
and inclement weather making it safer
for autonomous driving to do the driving
instead of the driver but you still have
him here kind of in control of the
vehicle now this isn't ready yet this
obviously isn't isn't out yet and
neither is the autonomous driving very
yet when it comes to this but this isn't
insight into where the trucking industry
future might be and I basically had a
comma devil does this put truckers out
of business and basically the answer was
no it's not it's designed to keep the
trucker in the seat but doing it here
rather than in the vehicle and I thought
that that was a pretty neat piece of
tech so yeah if you guys tell us what
you think about this it's a it
drive-by-wire remote system with
autonomous backup you tell me well guys
that's gonna wrap up our first day here
at the actual Convention Center I'm
gonna ask something of you guys let me
know if there's any weird tech out that
you guys have seen in articles or other
people have covered that we want that we
should go and check out so in the
comments below if you guys saw a weird
piece of tech or something cool and
put it in the comments below we will do
our best to go and look at it and give
you our opinion on that we want to we
want to cover the really unique stuff
here at CES 2018 so that's a rep for
this day guys thanks for following our
coverage today our coverage was brought
to you by EVGA comm they sponsored our
trip to CES 2018 this year go and check
them out now guys we're gonna get out of
here I don't repeating myself but please
weird tech you know what it is send it
our way so we can go and cover it guys
we'll see in the next one thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
