bringing you one vlog update on this
custom AMD build that I'm doing for a
friend and then it will actually be done
so the next time you guys see it after
today's video it's going to be
completely done and it's kind of fun
it's almost like going back to my roots
considering I haven't done a custom
water-cooled AMD build since before I
started my channel if you guys were
Watchers of my channel years ago you
guys would know that you know everything
I did was based on my AMD system back
then so this is kind of fun
and I figure right now we'll just kinda
take a tour we'll talk about some of the
parts why we chose the parts and then
we'll we'll get the system done and then
we'll do like a complete review of the
system did what it's so small you really
think so what does the wife thing well
she says it gets the job done
- all that smell the fractal design node
- OH - it's not about how big it is but
all about how you use it well here she
is right here if you guys can't tell
this is obviously sitting in a case labs
case it's not the SMA 8 but it is the SM
8 I've always wanted to build in one of
these cases and this is the first time I
got an opportunity to do it you know
it's got a feature that I didn't expect
and I didn't even realize it is
completely symmetrical I guess would be
the word what's on the top is exactly
what's on the bottom so you can flip
this case over and you can make it an
inverted case by simply swapping the
bottom and the top pieces which is only
a four screws so you can see or it's
more than four but it's only a few
screws but you can see how the grommets
and everything are exactly the same it's
pretty neat so it's not one of those
cases you have to order necessarily and
say I want it to be a left window
you know inverted or a right window
inverted or whatever you just do it
yourself and you just put so putting the
feet on the bottom you put them on the
top and you can see you've got two
two places to mount the power supply
unit so that's a really neat feature I
didn't even know that when I got the
case alright so obviously this is an AMD
build we are sitting here in an asrock
970 performance motherboard
some people might frown upon this
motherboard because it's not the
greatest overclocking board on the
planet that's okay because we're not
going for the biggest overclock on the
planet we're going to be going for a
pretty I'd say a modest four point three
or four point four gigahertz 24/7 on
this but I like the color scheme and
considering this computer is for a
female and she really likes red mist in
fact she's a friend of the owner of red
mist so she kind of wanted the same
color scheme going so it was the perfect
board for red that didn't break the bank
because yeah we could have gone with a
crosshair formula motherboard but those
things are still over two hundred
dollars and they just would have had a
ton of feature she wouldn't use on there
so for the block on here we do have the
new what is the ek supremacy Evo and it
does have I do have in there the
optional insert as well as the flow
plate so it is optimized for AMD and I
converted it over to you AMD bracket and
then we've got primo chill white
revolver fittings which is going to be
going you know with my PT G tubing you
can see I've got it going right there up
the wall and so works when we all PE T G
tubed now for the reservoir and pump you
guys know I kind of like to do reservoir
pump combos it keeps things tidy there's
less tubing needed and in this case
right here you can see that I actually
have it you know mounted up off the
ground it's kind of floating there and
we've got a two hundred and fifty
millimeter bib it's power reservoir so
it is connected right there if you can
see it's just got a standard fitting in
there that's with basically a G quarter
thread on both sides and then it's just
thread it together and on the top it's
got one of those multi res fittings so I
can plug up the holes I don't need I can
use one of the holes for filling when
it's time to fill that's going to be
going over to the radiator
then that on the back is just a separate
fitting now when you use a top return
like this you have to use a push down
tube I've seen people before try and use
returns that were not pushed down tubes
and just a waterfall effect one that
makes it noisy too it introduces a
bubbling and air that can get back into
the system and it's just it's not very
tidy so as long as you keep the fluid
level above the return line and you're
good that always returned down into the
fluid and then the air will make its way
to the top for radiator I am using an ek
this is one of the X teeth I believe
it's an XT read it's one of the big Reds
45 millimeters thick only has one set of
inlets and outlets right here on the
left it's a lot it's very similar to the
Alpha cool radiators only it has one set
of you know fittings on there it's not
all the way around like the Alpha cool
are they don't actually make this
radiator anymore and this has been
sitting in my closet since I did red
mist because he gave me this radiator as
well as some we ordered some alpha cool
stuff and he ended up using the Alpha
cool and said well hang on to this
radiator in case we ever need it well
here's a time when we need it now so
we're going with a 480 ml by 45 mil
which would be more than up to cool the
CPU and the GPU it is a GTX 980 it's not
an AMD graphics card which made a lot of
people kind of sad when I tweeted that
out or showed Instagram pictures of it
being a 980 because it kind of felt like
well it's an AMD build a Shiv an AMD GPU
well it's a couple reasons why we're not
using an AMD GPU one I already have
three of these things laying around so
it's already water blocked up the 980 is
a very powerful GPU and it's still
powerful in the 300 series and it you
know it was very affordable I could you
know let this go pretty cheap too the
only other AMD GPU I have in here with a
water block as I reach for it here is
I'll put this right here is my cryo
venom r9 290 which is sitting right here
now there's nothing wrong with the 290
it's just this card versus that card in
terms of performance whereas this one
looks really nice it just wouldn't be
giving us the performance numbers that
we're looking for
she won the 980 was sitting right here
and was an option so that's why we went
with the 980 on that the pump over here
is kind of a hodgepodge really it was a
alpha cool d5 top which I had unused and
so I got the ek d5 and I put those two
together I still have two sleeve the
cables as you can see that's one thing I
still have to do and then the power
supply unit this is the bits power or
bits Phoenix 650 power supply unit it's
the same one I loaned to Paul that he
used in his blue build so it was
actually already slated for this build
so this is the power supply here reason
why I chose this one it already has all
the priests leaved cables as you can see
all the cables are pre sleeved in kind
of the paracord material and so I
thought it looked really really good oh
and then I forgot to mention the memory
this is the XP gv1
from a data I chose it again obviously
because it's red and I think it looks
really really good
now one of the things I did different
with this build is normally I'll do all
the tubing and stuff and then I'll wire
it up at the end but as you can see I
went ahead and did all of the wiring on
this first so with the exception of the
fan cables and the pump right here
pretty much this system is entirely
wired up and the pump is going to
actually route behind the pump and
through this hole I'm not going to drill
any more holes in here I to drill two
holes to mount this that's it and then I
want to drill any more holes so it's
going to route through here and so let's
go ahead and take a look at the back so
you guys can see just how neat and tidy
this is I know a lot of people ask me to
do you know a video about how to do
cable management I honestly don't know
how I would do that video because I kind
of feel like no matter how I do it it
would almost be condescending because it
cable routing is kind of common sense
you just have to look at it and say oh
this path makes sense and then you put
it there and then you zip tie it down
and you try and find the route that
utilizes the length of the cables most
efficiently and plan it out and do it so
I don't know I really don't know how to
do that video maybe I'm maybe I'm just
overthinking the video I don't know but
it's a highly requested video and we'll
see about do
but anyway it's going to take a look at
the back alright so here's the back it's
not the tiniest of jobs but it certainly
gets the job done you can see here how I
kind of pushed back some of the extra
length for like the USB cable and and
routed it in there some of its behind
the SSD there's a SATA cable going that
way but you can see because the lengths
of the cables actually that thing came
unplugged because of the length of the
cable sometimes you have to get a little
creative on the way that you route them
you know you can see I have some spares
like this the two the plus two pins for
the PCI Express power they're down there
since the 980 only uses two six pins and
then there is the power cord for the CPU
now the only other thing I still have to
do in here as I mentioned is the pump
and the fans but as you can see
everything is pretty tidy there's lots
of plenty of room here for making sure
the panel can close and stuff the drives
as you can see this is a Plextor m6 m6s
256 gig SSD and then up here we have a
Toshiba 2 terabyte hard drive 7200 rpm
64 Meg cache and you know I've been very
happy with the performance of these
drives so I had no problems using these
products here inside this build it's
going to perform very very well for her
and you can see we do have room here for
more to more hard drives another hard
drive up here if we need to
and another SSD in here if we want to
expand the storage you can also see here
the screws where I mounted the reservoir
it's going to be you know very very
issues right there it's very important
to make sure that you guys before you
drill into anything that you kind of
plan out where things are going to go
because I knew that I had these drive
cages on the back of the case here that
I had to be mindful of so basically I
kept I looked at it and said where's the
most logical place to put these screws
now when ah well next to the
pass-through holes there's nothing there
so I might as well just drill next to
that and that's what I did and we go
that cable right there but that's not a
problem
so definitely want to plan ahead before
you start drilling in anything because
if I had just willy-nilly drilled I
could have drilled right into the SSD
mounting plate which would technically
have not been terrible but I didn't want
to
that obviously so you can see right here
on the top of the case it has these fan
cutouts here so that not only is it for
a radiator but it's also for top
fountain fountain top mounted fans if
you were just doing air cooling the only
problem with this is these do introduce
some airflow restriction when it comes
to getting air through the radiator but
it's pretty minimal especially if you
use static pressure fans but you might
have noticed there's no radiator fans on
here yet I'll go ahead and tell you why
so there's no radiator fans on here yet
because I haven't decided which fans I'm
going to use in the front here I already
have some bits Phoenix white LED fans
but I don't think they match the build
very well I've actually reached out to
Josh at fractal designs to see if he's
interested in sending over some of the
venturi fans I'm very impressed with the
venturi fan I know you guys saw that
video recently so I would like to put
four static pressure fans up here and
three airflow fans right here
now you might notice two things here on
the rear one it looks like there's a big
giant hole where the power supply would
go behind the radiator the block off
plate
I just haven't reinstalled it yet
because I want to have easy access to
getting to those fittings and as you can
see by leaving that off I have a pretty
easy access to getting to those fittings
to tighten up you know the PT G tubing
when when I'm ready so I can get into it
for behind and get into it from the side
I just have all access with that there
it would be very it's not comfortable
getting to the rear fitting here
especially when the fans are installed
because they're going to add 25
millimeters of thickness so this is
always this was a nice option when I saw
that I was like oh crap I'm taking that
out and we're leaving that out until
we're done you might also noticed I use
the block off plate back here for the
rear fan the reason for that is we're
not going to put a rear exhaust fan on
this thing now those that are astute
will already know why I'm doing that but
those who are here watching this video
to learn I'm going to tell you right now
why you can see up here we have a power
supply unit that is drawing in air from
the main compartment of the case mostly
because there is no hole down here
there's no hole through the floor to
pull an air through
and exhaust it out so it kind of has its
own airflow path so it has to take air
from the inside of the case so this is
an exhaust we're going to have four fans
up here in the top even though we're
going to have resistance going through
the radiator there's still four fans
with high static pressure moving air
through the radiator and we only have
three intake now yeah I can balance the
airflow by slowing down the radiator
fans and speeding up the intake fans so
that these three fans are making up the
airflow more airflow than the rear or
the top exhaust for the radiator and get
myself positive airflow but because I
have one two three four five 120
millimeters worth of exhausting and only
three 120 millimeters worth of intake I
would have to slow down the radiator
fans quite a bit more than I want to in
order to keep positive pressure in this
case and we want positive pressure so we
don't pull dust in through all the other
vents and things so I'm going to be
looking at getting airflow fans like I
said I want the venturi as if I can get
my hands on them in the front here so I
have nice airflow with a quiet and lower
rpm and then I can run like 50 or 60%
speed on the radiator and keep positive
pressure and I put in the back block off
plate in the back just to try and help
keep positive pressure where I can even
though you know we have these vents up
here in this vent back here it shouldn't
be too hard we're actually going to
force the airflow to go like this you
know it's going to come in the front and
it's going to go up that's the idea so
anyway that's where we are so far in the
AMD build and next time we see it this
thing will be done and running and of
course it's going to have red fluid
because you know project red mist at all
anyway guys I'm go ahead and get the
heck on out of here thanks for watching
next time you see it would be completely
built and when this system is done then
I can get started on my land rig though
the white and green land rig I talked
about doing and I still undecided which
GPU I'm going to put in that I might put
one of the nine ATS I also have water
blocks and stuff for either tighten or
980ti I might put one of those in there
I just haven't exactly decided yet
sometimes having choice and actually
having the freedom of choice makes
things a lot more complicated
it I liked when I just had to buy
whatever I could afford because that was
so much easier to figure out yeah
first of all problems I know all right
guys I'm going on out here thanks for
watching couldn't do these videos
without you guys and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
