but I think already before I could even
get the camera going I was already at
like ten thousand and one so what am I
feeling right now each and every one of
you are crazy and insane including my
wife and my daughter sitting over there
um man it's only been about eight months
in two days 10000 and that the great
we're going we can hit 30 by the end of
the year so I just wanted to say thanks
to each and everyone of you love you all
you guys they're definitely what keep me
going and keeping the videos and stuff
coming I appreciate all of the support
and PBS that you guys give both channels
because I'm just as excited about being
so close to hitting a thousand on the
vlog channel as I am about hitting
10,000 on the on the tech channel or
whatever you know it's it's fun while
it's lasting who knows how long it's
going to last but while it is we're
going to see how far we can grow this
thing together and I'm going to continue
to do what I can to give back to you
guys because that's what you do when you
have appreciation you give it back and
not sure yet what I'm going to do is a
thank you for the 10,000 but I'm going
to find some way to get it back to you
guys thanks each and every want to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
