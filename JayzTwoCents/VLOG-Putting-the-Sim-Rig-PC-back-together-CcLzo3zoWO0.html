built the rig I got the simulator rig
all together like the actual frame and
seaton all that stuff like I said I
don't have a computer for it so this is
the system that I took some parts out of
not a lot actually I think it's mostly
just like the GPU and stuff but we are
gonna put this thing back together get
it working again and we're gonna get it
all loaded up and do some scenes later
driving and stuff with the coconut
monkey or just Y the reason why he's
here
I forgot my helmet I got mine okay the
new z170 classified motherboard from
EVGA features eight phase PWM four-way
SLI support along with top notch
components to offer gamers and
enthusiasts more of what they want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more
so the specs of this rig here are
nothing special quite honest and I know
people are going to be looking special
but quite honestly it's not like custom
water-cooled or anything like that
it's dusty as hell as you can see I have
got on here the inner max lick tech 240
water cooler on a 4770k plugged into a
z97 and MSIM power which is all super
dusty now just realize I have no memory
in here it's gonna be interesting but
yeah this is super dusty so we're gonna
do today's we're going to clean it off
sure you have the front quick disconnect
no the quick you know bays as I use
right there the hot swap base for the
drives makes it stupid easy to get
everything going
but yeah it's gonna pretty pretty much
up and running in no time what's really
gonna take the longest here is getting
the I also have a UPS power plug in Wow
I stole the ETS cable and everything out
of this this poor machine that's gonna
put back together dusty it's like fuzz
on the fan so gross it's just nasty
oh that's just nasty
now here I originally had dual nine 70s
and that's probably what I'm gonna put
back in here to be honest with you I can
detect I can actually remove that bottom
fan it's gonna be going on carpet I
don't think it'll suck me in again there
are spider webs in here I should be
completely ashamed at myself shouldn't I
kinda like graze STI huh there's no mold
though I kind of wanted to just build a
whole new system for it and I think
ultimately I'm gonna end up doing a like
a custom case mod I think considering
this is going on the racing simulator
that it would be cool to have like a
case mod that either looks like an
engine or something like that I know
it's been done before but I think that'd
be fun like put a valve cover up here or
something I'd like the radiator hanging
out the front
you know serpentine set up now and go
ahead of myself there yeah I think it
could be fun
though you had on the phones pretty cool
though I do that the what radiator in
front yeah well then it would be in
heaven end up being a custom that were
cool I wanted to get a wheel and a tire
and like build a system in the wheel but
that I went on the internet and I found
people did that already - there's
nothing you can do first anymore nothing
we keep slamming it's a make we could
use dance life on yeah it's like
negative camber yeah we should have
achievements for everything that we do
in this house first putting hardly
anything on this so I don't need that
much hard guys based on ski this is a
one terabyte Toshiba Drive here six
gigabit per second
you know SATA so yeah we'll be using
that and then we'll just use this 128
gigabyte a data SSD I don't need any
more storage than that because I don't
plan on putting really hardly anything
on this machine to be quite honest with
you what was that sound
oh you know that's me so I knew that
this system was going to end up kind of
getting pillaged
for other rightward pillaged village
like a Pirates do or Campbell is you can
even turn it off right there so this is
actually an enter max hotspot drive and
even has the fan controller in here to
throw the phobia that controller head
went
so that I could take the drives in and
out easy I knew this system was gonna be
cannibalized at some point and I wanted
to make it easy to get the drives in and
out so that's why I use this guy here
I tear it and then hard drive by ow in
and that's it then they're installed and
when you want out a.m. that's it you can
use them somewhere else I did twice
achievement a lot actually
when you push it is like slams shut the
SSD one doesn't really do that I think
anyway better work now here's my dilemma
I have the two nine seventies in here
which was fine I did get some micro
stutter with I racing for a little bit
there and then I ended up updating
drivers and it went away or not i racing
project cars so I'm kind of torn around
all I put two nine 70s in here again I
kind of just wanted to do one powerful
nine eighty or ninety atti but the
problem is that three panels that this
is hooked up to doesn't don't have DVI
port outputs or inputs on them they have
DVI and VGA on the back of those
monitors 980ti is only have one DVI port
on there so the problem is that I'm not
going to be able to because I don't have
right now at this very moment I only
have one DVI to HDMI cable if I had more
of those I would do it I would do a
single 980ti so yeah that kind of stinks
on the world see the oh you know what I
think that gigabyte 980ti is have dual
DVI so I forgot okay goodbye it
completely like dominates when it comes
to input/output this air cooler for it
right here oh yeah my 98 or my 970 is
water-cooled right now still can't use
that guy
little first rate problems here huh yeah
I'm not complaining
well you totally get complaints matter
what I do
yeah I'd give something away it's like
why didn't you give away this it's like
you are so bad from the same way you
know I think I actually at the 90s he is
do have I think they do have to 9 to DD
eyes so let me check and then if they do
then I have a water-cooled one right
there I can't guess boom this is why
gigabyte cards kind of rock because they
don't just follow like the standard
Nvidia input or output or you know setup
they do it the way they want to do it so
this could work
this could work we'll put this over here
it's a maybe second sphere we got the
water cold one out there I might be
kinda neat huh mm-hmm
hey Reds I don't know if I have enough
room here with this I might barely have
enough room front down it like it either
cooler yeah total qartheen tone when you
really go with the plastidip from room
it might fit right here
let's see you don't notice hard that
would actually a good contender
that's the classified for the classified
again windy be alright
tight necks the MSI Lightning has to
yeah I'm pretty sure that the Lightning
only has one DVI output that would match
the whole colors it would it would yeah
this one reason why I look at this you
can't even really see it though you know
cuz I will know oh your windows tinted
yeah this is totally restarting has
already you know that's why LEDs only
when you get pulled over you'll be able
to see it yeah
fairly certain that MSI lightning only
has one yeah only one on it and it
totally would have gone with it was on
the theme right oh yeah
but it only has one okay what's this
flashiness
oh well because I didn't have a box for
the 380 X they sent me sorry I put it in
a EVGA bow all right yeah any media box
sorry guys mmm the devil's p90x also
does not oh it does that's amazing
shots fired I mean I kind of want to do
to nine seventies again today is to
sensing his mentioned epithet covered in
surrounded by ready starts not knowing
what to use for his next Butte no I just
I would hate to tie up both of the
nights those nine 70s but then I've got
two others shut up stop great problem
real with you
excuse me I don't really want to take
this apart but I really have a choice
oh no well remember this was an ideal
anyway I had to take the part because I
used the wrong heatsink on it because I
didn't have proper one for the 4790k
because whatever I buy a processor quite
honestly I just I just ditch the stock
heatsink
I literally just chucked that crap in
the trash and then like oh man the only
one I have now is for an i3 so I stuck
an i3 heatsink on a 4790k mistakes were
made
they got the job done and it didn't
overheat that's what I was most
surprised about so I kind of did a worst
case scenario we're coming with this
note - of - I did the other thing was
remember I had the wrong kind of
graphics card in here - so I guess I'm
okay with pulling it back out of here
because it really deserves a blower
style card I've already said it needs
the problem it needs a proper style card
on here it's a sense of cool builds oh
yeah it does quite honestly need this
style card with the blower I'm not
necessarily a Titan but enhancer blower
card I could get another SFX power
supply in here like a 600 watt one from
Silverstone problem is I like this form
factor but I don't want to use this
particular form factor I want to use
this guy right here as you can see the
note 605 for my home theater PC because
it looks just like a receiver
I guess brushed aluminum finish and
stuff so similar
nice believe it or not all the stuff you
see here I have no spare ddr3 where did
it go I know I had some well I would be
a complete waste three complete weights
to put a next 99 for the similar ear as
it is right now it's kind of a waste to
even use a 4770k but that's the with the
exception of the i3 and I've got that
all right here this is my i3 ice yet
setup I think I want to build some some
small form-factor like media PC with
this hmm or even play around with like
flex or something for that so I don't
want to utilize that see the question is
do I want to utilize to nine 70s in a
single build like this remember it's
three-way it's a impedance around three
panels three 1080p panels to nine 70s if
you guys have looked at my my video I
did where was 980 TI vs. 970 vs Titan X
jump all the 970 kicks the single 980
eyes button a lot of test cases but not
a null and I didn't test that in
Eyefinity or or indeed around so I kind
of feel like the dual GPU would give me
the best performance however I only have
three point five gigs of usable theorem
on this where the dining ATI would give
me six gates oh no hear this you know
what would make like the ultimate
getaway
but the grand prize is you get to pick
one item from here you know this is like
the only place someone would pick from
yeah right it's - than it take Nexus you
know quite honestly they would only pick
on you right here or maybe if you're a
shoot guy Hardy and Ethan you might pick
that guy he reacts but I don't know if
anyone would take like say ddr4 Ram or a
power supply you know then it's pretty
clear heads up yeah these are all the
headsets
someone might be like I picked this rack
that's a legal move no I'll just take
everything off the rack and I'll send
you all the metal if I can salient every
one of my subscribers at PC and just
give it to them I would
how much have I given you give me Allah
gave me a whole new computer technically
dude you totally just oh my you're fine
just turn the fan I'm dying on the
inside dips power I was having an issue
where one of the one of the panels I
remember you dealt with this to every
time you would go inside a game or
something one of the panels would turn
off yeah you'd have to like power it off
the power back on which was really
freaking annoying I would say quickest
build ever but it was like 3/4 of the
way I already put together does you guys
Bridget still haha good call
yeah wait and have a great oh my god
wait I got this never the bridges come
with the motherboards nothing graphics
cards go out might see 170 classified I
feel like this should be like an
accounting spreadsheet like you take if
there is a bridge in there have to make
a note in the journal you know remove a
bridge something z170 oh wow it's
brand-new in bugs
oh okay I see how it is you want to know
why you're hearing the burnt bra bra bra
writing I was making sure nothing else
is gonna come out though you know it's
cool that you VGA gives you posters with
every graphics card it just sucks that
they're folded up yeah so this one's
done pretty much memory cards bridge
thanks for point that up
I really wish in video would get on
board like AMD does where you don't need
a bridge anymore just a PCIe my don't I
shouldn't take that
down with other cars hey guys I hope
you've enjoyed this video of us just
quite honestly screwing around putting
the system together I actually built the
system a long time ago over a year ago
that's where I had a 4770k CPU but yeah
once the rig is all together we'll do
the official review we'll get coconut
monkey to help out with that video as
well thanks for watching and as always
we'll see you guys in the next video and
no you can't have a graphics card get
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
