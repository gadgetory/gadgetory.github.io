I've forgot to charge the batteries for
my lab mic and so now I've got a I've
got to deal with a dead cat in my face
as a lot of people like to call it old
dudes hairy balls but anyway if you guys
haven't heard sapphire launched their
new try xx app tricks try XML GRI X X
however you want to pronounce that which
now allows for overclocking of the fury
X and unlocks to things that people have
said needed to be done in order to see
the full potential of fury and that
being voltage control and memory speeds
so obviously that's what we're gonna do
today and you guys can see that's why
that's why I don't sell or give away all
this stuff because I can't go back and
revisit you know subject matter like
this if I had given this away or sold it
like people said I should do then I
wouldn't be able to do this video now
would I the lik max to 120 and 240 from
enter max is another awesome choice of
AI Oh liquid coolers for gamers and
enthusiasts without breaking the bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more
everybody said that fury X is true
potential won't come out until voltages
unlocked and memory speed is unlocked
although I
I always doubted the memory speed thing
immediately because it's already running
such fast memory you know HBM obviously
high bandwidth memory at such a
freakishly large bandwidth that I didn't
say that there could be much improvement
there but anyway today we are gonna
accomplish unlocking the voltage and the
memory by simply installing the new
sapphire try xx tricks now this is call
it tricks the sapphire tricks software
or no snap our try X whatever
so I guess sapphire is the first company
to come out with any sort of unlocking
utility it this is this is very similar
to like MSI Afterburner or any other GUI
based you know graphics user interface
overclocking utility the difference is
this immediately unlocks your fury card
by doing nothing more than installing it
it recognizes that it's a fury and it
and it gives you the functionality right
here now from left
to write this thing is very automotive
looking and by the way I'll put a link
to the descriptor in the description
this video I will put a link to this app
so that you can just simply go there and
download it without having to try and
find it although Google is your friend
and you can usually find anything or
anybody using Google I won't I won't say
how I know how you can find people using
Google I've already said too much I
would definitely recommend using the
sapphire utility here / MSI Afterburner
or anything like that because this is
really streamlined it's really easy to
use and MSI Afterburner has a lot of
buttons and functions and things that
tend to overwhelm people initially when
they're first getting started in
overclocking so I would recommend using
this let's see so the Settings tab here
you've got some things that you can
click on you guys can check that out
yourself clicking on card info here will
tell you all about your cards so
obviously it says that I am running on
AMD Radeon r9 fury suit it's cut off and
you can't expand it so the they do need
some work on this anyway
VG GPU tells you everything about it if
you ever wondered about your card it
will tell you everything including the
BIOS version that you're currently
running hardware monitor this is going
to show you various things going on here
with your graphics card you know maximum
or minimum core clock max core clock GPU
memory clock min - max temperature which
is very important and your fan speed so
it's gonna tell you all about that log
now it's got internal logging so that
you can start logging things when you're
overclocking and see what's going on
then you've got reset and an apply
button for any of the settings that you
set up here now it's a very automotive
looking I think it looks neat it's kind
of like a dashboard on a hot route or
something but on the left here you've
got your GPU core clock in the middle
you've got your GPU voltage and on the
right you've got your memory clock and
then right in the middle on the bottom
you've got your power limit which is
obviously you know pretty important so
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
run three tests using the meadow Metro
red X benchmark wood and I like to use
this benchmark for several reasons one
it's very demanding - it is the actual
graphics engine running the game so even
though this is a benchmark it's not a
synthetic like Heaven or Valley or fire
strike where those have some
optimization stuff going on specifically
for their own benchmark this is very
indicative of how the game would run so
it's very similar to doing a con
trolled real-life test that's why I like
to use Metro the other thing I want to
point out too is that the card that I'm
using here is the vision tech fury X but
one thing to keep in mind is all of the
fury X cards are built in-house by AMD
so although the name on the card or the
sticker on the fan may vary between free
X's they're pretty much all going to be
the same so but as with anything when it
comes to overclocking your mileage will
vary it's not may vary your mileage will
vary as every single card is going to
have a different amount of headroom when
it comes to overclocking so the three
tests we're gonna run here are base
which is the card as it shipped with
those settings then the initial
overclocking that I was setting as I was
able to achieve during my initial
testing of the card so that we can see
how much improvement we gained which we
already know I did that video but and
we're gonna do it again here in case you
didn't see that and then we're gonna go
for broke we're gonna see how far we can
really push this thing with voltage
unlocked and memory unlocked and see if
it even made a difference so anyway
let's go ahead and kind of fast-forward
through those first two tests and then
we'll get to the overclocking well the
first two tests are done so now it's
time to start getting to some of the
overclocking now if you guys want a full
tutorial on how to overclock it doesn't
really matter what utility you're using
the methodology is gonna pretty much
remain the same so go ahead and click
the card that's gonna pop out right here
it's gonna take you to my how to
overclock a graphics card video and you
guys can watch that in a little more
depth even though it's not this exact
utility like I said the methodology of
how to adjust things and how to test
pretty much remains the same now the
very first thing I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna go ahead and crank the power
limit all the way up and then on the
Fury here they're allowing us a 50%
additional power limit for a hundred and
fifty percent total that's that's kind
of a big deal now I know for a fact
11:28 already works because I've tested
that over and over you guys even saw the
results for that now what I would
typically do is I would try and set a
number I want to kind of shoot for it
for in this case let's say I want to try
for 1200 I would probably start by
cranking up the voltage as well now some
people would say you shouldn't crank the
voltage you should find your max stable
at stock voltage I already did that
that's what the 11 28 was now I already
know that 1200 megahertz is not going to
work
I already know this card is not capable
of 1200 megahertz which is kind of
disappointing
quite honestly considering you know the
voltage a lot of people were really
hoping the voltage was going to allow we
obey go over clocks and I am D
unfortunately their cores have never
been known for big over clocks but they
have been known to show decent
improvements for marginal increases in
megahertz speed and one of the things I
do like about the Sapphire utility here
is that it will it can actually tell
when the system crashed
and so when you boot it back up after a
fresh reboot like I just did
then it's gonna ask you if you want to
load the previous settings because it
detected that it crashed she could say
yes you could say no in this case I'm
just gonna say no it brings us right
back to the default all right so it's
going to try 1180 there it is right
there save it and let's see if it loads
up we've got 1180 on here let's go ahead
and see if we can make it through our
Metro last light benchmark at this
frequency I don't want to push it higher
because I know what 1190 I had tons of
instability issues in 1185 I was getting
some incremental incremental freezes so
I'm back to about 2 1180 and we're gonna
go from there
also to if you want to know what
settings I'm using for Metro so you can
kind of compare your own graphics cards
to the fury then just look in the
description where I I basically listed
out all the settings that are right here
so you guys can kind of mimic these if
you want but let's see if it makes it
through the test or if it crashes or if
it decides to update steam just kind of
randomly
GG gaben all right we passed yeah all
right so as you can see here we let's go
and bring up the other images real quick
and I'll I'll put this up on the screen
so that you guys can actually see them
the first test here with stock speeds we
had an average frame rate of 75 point
nine six and a max frame rate of 253
when we overclocked that to the 11:28
that jumped up to seventy nine point
three nine
however the max frame rate reduced to
249 so that's kind of interesting right
but then again there there's all the
fluctuations that could cause that
minimum frame rate 14.99
on the overclock and around the standard
and then the overclocked minimum was 11
point oh one so as you can see we had
some drops on the minimum
kind of take that with a grain of salt
though with Metro where the first few
frames that render on Metro are very
stuttery that's why the minimum is
always really bad with Metro but anyway
there's that so when it came to our
overclocked to 1180 we jumped up to 81
point five three average our max frame
rate still stuck right around 249 and
the minimum dropped even further to ten
point eight but again like I said frame
of take out the grain of salt my
three-way config system on skunk works
actually shows a minimum frame rate of
four so yeah even with with the SLI this
drops even farther so it's really weird
the way that benchmark works but it's
these averages that we're really
concerned with and as you can see here
by looking at the charts there are some
dips in there but that again that's part
of the benchmark but as you can see we
gamed we gained a total of six average
FPS but anyway we gained an average of
about 6 FPS by simply overclocking this
thing a little further unfortunately it
doesn't look like the additional voltage
or power limit or memory overclock
really gave you any sort of higher
Headroom that a lot of people were
really hoping that the fury X card was
going to see which also means
unfortunately the fury X even when
unlocked voltage doesn't come anywhere
near an overclocked 980ti
even though they're at the same price
point the Nvidia cards just really like
overclocking and they get a lot more
percentage of overclock let's how much
of a percentage did we actually get I
don't know where's my calculator here
now ultimately we only got an 11%
overclock by getting you know unlocked
voltage and realistically it was even
less than that the additional overclock
that we actually got at least in my card
was eleven twenty eight divided by one
one eight oh we only got let's see
that's minus one we only got an
additional four point four percent
overclock by having unlocked GPU voltage
so as you can see there's more at play
here than just voltage and in fact some
graphics cards depending on their ASIC
quality more voltage it doesn't help at
all so anyway those are the numbers and
unfortunately it doesn't come anywhere
close to an overclocked 980ti
which I to be honest was hoping that
this would have pushed up there I was
hoping for at least like 1250 on
or maybe yours will maybe mine's just a
bad sample when it comes to that silicon
lottery so there you go guys
unfortunately I wasn't able to achieve
any real impressive numbers with the
fury X and we only achieved about an
additional 60 megahertz actually what 52
megahertz with the unlocked voltage now
temperatures also too I want to point
out we never exceeded 54 degrees Celsius
on this card and it is a warm room this
room did get up to almost 80 degrees
Fahrenheit in fact today it's gonna be
about 85 degrees Fahrenheit outside yeah
I know fall right what women will fall
freakin come to California but anyway
the cooler on there still does a
fantastic job of keeping all of that
crap nice and cool you know it hbm can
get pretty damn toasty considering it so
much heat in a very small space but that
single 120 thick rad is doing an amazing
job at keeping it cool so this is pretty
much the top of the tier lineup right
now when it comes to AMD the fury X with
their HBM you know older cards like the
295x2 were probably raw performance beat
this card however this is currently
their top 2 your car this the 295x2
isn't been produced anymore so finding
one is gonna be difficult but if you
guys are a team Radeon or team red then
this pretty much is the best that you
can get right now at the time of this
video was hoping for better overclocking
unfortunately you didn't get it but if
you have a fury X I would love if you
would do me a favor
download this utility play around with
your card and let me know how far yours
went I'm curious if maybe mine's just a
silicon lottery dud or if this is kind
of normal across the board when it comes
to how far these things are willing to
push that's where I need you guys to
chime in down in the comments and tell
me if you have this card don't pretend
like you do if you have this card in
downloads utility how far did yours go
anyway time you get out of here guys
thanks for watching and as always I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
