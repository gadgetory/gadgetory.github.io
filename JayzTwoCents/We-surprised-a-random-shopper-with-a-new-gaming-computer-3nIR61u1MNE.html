got this huge care package that came
courtesy of ek waterblock specifically
for this guy which I've been you guys
have been asking me to start this just
get this bill done already trust me I
want it done just as much as the next
guy bubble woo better wristband
you like those who want that I put it
see I forgot I had that I forgot I
ordered the monoblock
and I put the CPU block on there already
yeah and I guess you know I I'm gonna
postpone this because I have a better
idea it's Christmas time it always puts
me in a little bit less salty mood
cheers what I want to do I want to go
over to like Micro Center fries or
something and I want to surprise someone
we see those TV shows right they'll do
it like Walmart and other stores like
the secret santa thing or if you ever
the Secret Santa at Walmart people will
like go around and pay off layaway gifts
and things and then the person goes to
pay for they're like oh my god I didn't
no idea that's so great she's like
spirit of Christmas yeah I've been
wanting to do something like this for a
long time and I think what I want to do
is I want to go to the micro Center I
want to find someone that's there just
shopping for like whatever reason but
we've we tricked them into thinking
we're filming a video and in the video
would be something along the lines of
like helping us pick parts term like a
consumer perspective because I think
people assume we've kind of forgotten
what it's like to go and buy stuff which
is absolutely not true by the way we buy
a lot of things we get some of that's
willing to be on camera with us and have
them help us pick parts for like a dream
PC kind of thing yeah but then it turns
out at the end of the at the end of all
of it it's a gift for them they didn't
even realize they were getting that's
pretty perfect right yeah let's get
Brian though we need we need Brian Micro
Center has like this policy we're not
allowed to film in there Kyle did that
that kind of got noticed but I think we
I think want to covertly do this I think
we're gonna have to reduce ourselves to
using our cell phone for recording don't
worry all right
you
the all-new mastered liquid 120 and 240
l RGB coolers provide an easy and
reliable way to keep your processor nice
and cool they're all new dual chamber
pump and low resistance radiator offer a
higher transfer of heat for both Intel
and AMD CPUs while six preset lighting
effects an RGB ensure that the 120 and
240 L seamlessly match your color design
choice make it yours by following the
link in the description below today I
was just walking into my course I needed
to pick up a Wi-Fi card because I'm
doing a build for my cousin for
Christmas and then I see Jays two cents
so I go up and I say hi
it was just pretty crazy what was your
name Sam Sam okay Jay
obviously we met Sam came up and was
like hey I like your channel so we're
gonna do like we talked about we're
going to we're gonna build a system and
I thought it'd be neat because I got to
play with a lot of cool stuff right so
it's hard to pull yourself down back to
like the buyer perspective because when
we play with so much hardware it becomes
hard to shop so I thought it'd be neat
if we were shopping for a system that
we're gonna build and test for the
holidays but actually go through the
buyer perspective first things first we
need to pick a platform so would you do
AMD or Intel I've done three AMD builds
because it's just for me is just bang
for your buck like rides and stuff to FX
sponsors and then I just got a rise in I
think a 1,700 1,700 X as a hell of a
deal given if you want to go for like
future compatibility and still have the
eight core 16 threads both overclockable
how you feel about that would you would
you go with that CPU if it was in the
budget if it was in the budget for sure
but like my most recent build it was so
backwards to a lot of the way people
build stuff and I went I put more money
in the aesthetics okay
all right no I I think I I agree with
that I do that a lot I'm gonna go 1700 X
on this one how do you feel that I think
if you got the cash then this is where a
lot of people kind of get hung up right
do they want an X 370 or do they want to
go with a be 350 be 350 can still
overclock the Strix be 350 it looks like
a good deal at 115 the the Strix is
me on this site a lot of people are like
buying those or any of those right now
because it's really affordable
especially so you'd go with this board
yeah that was some if if I had more
carrots that was one that I had like in
my cart like ready to go so let's go
look at GPUs and if you guys think that
the system's imbalance will blame him
so GPUs are finally normalized in
pricing it's kind of come back to where
it belongs would you go within yours
right now actually my friend he upgraded
to a 1070 he gave me a 770 for free okay
so you have a 770 right now yeah this is
a 1080 strix right so we've got a 1070
TI and that's kind of the confusing part
now you got 1070 1070 TI 1080 and all of
them are within like the same like the
same hundred dollar range is where
you're gonna find these three cards if
you could buy any crash Carter now what
would you get and why out of my
decisions are based on the budget right
how much I'm gonna allocate to different
parts I think everyone's decision should
be based on budget I want to go for 1080
like I stood by that's too hard for me
for like my price points I really think
through 10 70s I would I would go for
you have none at all and they will go
with this one yeah although this one I
like I like the silver and black right
cuz my biggest complaint if you've ever
heard in my videos I can play about
people who put red and all that stuff
it's true that's actually all the
decisions I'm making all right we're
over here at Ram the part that hurts I
mean look at these prices if you have
the money to buy those parts together my
device 16 games that's probably fair Wow
so best deals on 16 gigs right now I
actually just picked up
the Kingston HyperX Fury's not it's just
like black heat spreader white paint for
the lettering is that these guys right
here yeah okay so you'd go with this
it's two eight days eight gig sticks
yeah let's go like a storage yeah so
I've done a video in the past where it
was like the most the most performance
impacting upgrade you can make in your
system period is IO on your storage for
this price point I would never recommend
not going solid-state if I had to go
with like nvme or m2 and I have to go
with half the capacity for more I don't
think that's a decision that I if it
came down to that I don't think that's a
decision I would make I'd probably go
for the largest SATA drive I could find
yeah it's still very like enthusiasts
yeah just kidding
I will usually actually Joe hold on we
might do that's a very good point
and I've done this on almost all my
builds I'll go with more of a more
modest-sized SSD and then get like a 2
terabyte spinning optical or the
spinning drive
2:56 it's good price and if it's got an
extra ten bucks off that would be stupid
not to
so it's 59 bucks okay let's grab one of
those what's the brand on it Toshiba
it's a 7200 yep okay we'll do that case
cooler power supply I still think I'd go
for at least the bronze see I've had
real good luck with EVGA but like we
said there see Sonic and super flowers
so they're like high-end high-end oMG
yeah we'll do that I always watched like
you know tubers build in the case that
I'm looking at mmm see how easy would be
to build in that and you know what the
chassis actually looks like how do you
feel about cases like this this guy
right here right the big the glass why
it's big LED fans you care about that
thing or would you rather save money on
the case and get better components
because I feel like if you buy a better
case upfront that case is gonna go with
you as you upgrade NZXT h4 40 that's
always a good go-to case you do like
NZXT personally have you ever looked at
them and they're it's like this one up
here they're fairly compact the h4 40
really opens things up do you have do
you like white or black but now I have a
black black one but I think white is
really good for like this this is kind
of neat because this is the first like
viewer recommended system we've never
done this yeah let me if you have the
white one grab it otherwise maybe grab
black one what I just upgraded to was a
fantastic clips okay the p300
a cheaper one right I mean new wages in
California so we're at the one-day
shipping flight 15 bucks and those cases
it's like tempered glasses where sheep
is like mostly steel hmm I feel like you
know that's I wanna like tell people
about that deal how it's so like cheap
right now there's nothing more
subjective than a case what cooler are
you using now first of all right now in
H 110 okay of course they're for sure
and XT the crackin serious has really
proved proved well see the RGB stuff do
you care about RGB you do okay
69 that's this one the ML 240 l RGB
seems like worth taking a shot it comes
with everything right here yeah it comes
this is a controller to control the
lights or you can plug it into our
mystic RGB let's recap what we got here
case the H 444 men's XT very popular
case 650 watt g2 power supply this is a
gold we've got our be 350 Strix F gaming
which is a asus rise another board 1700
X you have that right we've got 16
gigabytes of hyper X ddr4 I don't the
speed is but either way it will
overclock 2400 will get at least 29 33
out of this probably 3000 when we
overclock it we want that with Rison
2 terabyte 7200 rpm spinning drive
because we agreed get a smaller SSD and
get your mass storage of your games and
files on here so we also got the Intel
250 gigabyte SATA SSD I've never
experienced an Intel drive so that's
going to be interesting and then we've
got our cooler master ml 240 lr d be
cooler and then we went with the MS MSI
MSI titanium 1070 TI the only 1070 I you
had in stock huh
so we just wiped that out alright Sam so
here's what we got all those parts added
up to a 1624 dollar system that's with
tax and that's with that's what that's
with the bundle deals but also with an
operating system like you so I didn't
say it you did you I just torn it so
there would have been another 120 bucks
right but yeah that's that's actually a
really well-rounded system for that
price so you said you're building a
computer for your cousin
that's from parts that are left over
from when you upgraded your system okay
so what we're actually doing here today
is a pay it forward video where all of
this is actually for you because what
you're doing I think is great you're
helping somebody else get in the PC
world so we wanted to do something for
our viewers and all of this is for you
so that you play me right now no
seriously this is this is yours
so congratulations bringing in I'm gonna
be hidin it's awkward let me give you
how you kids know this is yours Rona
bite right now and you're gonna take
home you know in a bike right okay so
that's why I kept asking you like would
you change this would you change that if
you want to change the case tell me
we've been here all day since they
opened so like like me you know like you
you were one of the few people who was
like I'm doing I'm here to do something
for someone else or is that you know you
were shopping for something but you told
me that you you know you upgraded your
system but then you give all your parts
to your cousin so what you can do you
can upgrade your cousin again or you
know you have a second computer and this
is yours you know I have like a pile of
parts and then where you got more parts
now I could just tell my cousin like no
J you hooked it up yeah in whatever you
want to do that man C or if you want to
read it fit you want to keep it give him
yours it's it's all yours it's not gonna
bother me one bit what you do with it
but yeah this is yours so Joe isn't on
it he knew we were gonna be doing this
so thanks Joe for running around
grabbing all that stuff for us for these
last six months I've been upgrading my
build to to be where does that now and
then all my old parts I was gonna put in
a in a system for my cousin to get him
into the PC game too so and busy today
was the last part that was gonna buy
before I finish it up and then shipped
it I was gonna ship it today actually
Sam told me he was doing something for
someone else it's one the first things
he mentioned before he had any idea what
we were doing we kind of played a little
trick on you right
you made you'd made you think you were
helping us build a computer
yeah do some testing with turns outs for
you but I also heard in your interview
too that you received the GPU because
someone paid it forward to you when they
upgraded and that's what I love about
the PC community is is the the true
community of PC and PC enthusiasts is
about helping each other and growing the
community yeah that's the whole reason
this is here today we wanted to do
something for the holidays that was cool
for someone that had no idea what was
gonna happen today when they walked into
the store
I'm glad with you man thanks for being a
part of this oh and thank you for
letting me be a part of this man guys
thanks for watching and if you guys know
someone that can that you could help hey
step forward they all told me that they
were doing a video to pick out parts
that I just like a normal consumer would
buy then what ended up happening is that
I picked the parts together with Jay and
Nick and Brian and at the very end of it
they just told me all this stuff right
here that we just picked out as for you
I was like I was crazy man I was in
shock you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
