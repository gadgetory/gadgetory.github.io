have an intro still on here Wow
we're gonna read agree doing all this
stuff I'm just gonna run the intro right
now first might get that out of the way
all right
tick tock tick tock tick tock this is
probably the latest we've ever been you
know that oh no my camera stuck on
autofocus oh it's okay breathe can I
figured can I fix this while I'm here
okay yes there's a few tense moments
there where I thought I was gonna hear
Nick died like just just because you
needed somebody to murder
I was raging pretty hard like I threw my
own 50 X's across the studio I threw my
feeling like there might loan I think I
got I got the stairs in it like to the
top step and I threw my phone across up
here oh you were just you're just an 3d
technology guy you know you understand I
don't like when things don't go right I
mean I know you've seen that no one no
one can make you can make good content
out of what things don't go right but
not a live stream when it hasn't started
that's true you have to at least have
something streaming for it to work I
thought there might alone I forgot to do
something and that was actually like go
to the stream where I could watch it
I've had to do that such an amateur at
this
well I'm looking to you right I mean
your video looks good at that lights on
the back are a little blown out but
other than that you look good there
blown out because they're lights
it's a WebKit so I had I hadn't had a
whole set ready to go downstairs I'll
turn the camera on show you guys like
yeah here shows what were missing out on
so we had a whole set ready to go down
there lighting was set up
I had my key I had my fs5 ready to
capture and so the first problem we had
was to the old caption there Gatto
capture el gato is a piece of crap first
of all okay
c6 it was so first we had like el gato
HD which we hated and then we got the 60
and that's still Apollo garbage in order
to get the audio to sync the mic I had
to delay the mic by 1.1 seconds to sync
it to the video that's how long the a
gato takes to capture the process well
tell me this where you capture was that
1080p or 4k
1080 that's
god that's up well yeah that
all's got to HD doesn't do 4k just
destiny at 1080 60 got it
so anyway I'm just I'm gonna tweet this
out guys we are will talk about why the
shows back we're talk about some changes
that we're making to the show cuz Jerry
9 we had a long time long talk about
this remember when he was down here yeah
we did and I really feel like I'm Way
out of my element which is funny because
normally like you can you see me make
videos and stuff you see I'm in my
element and I'm good to go
streaming as I totally your forte right
now yeah but the truth is that's that's
kind of what makes Tech Talk good though
is that it doesn't go so smoothly and
flawlessly no you're absolutely right
ok gotta like rage rage and J like
honestly one out of three tech talks in
the past we would start the show with
literally just rage over some technical
problem no and that's fair but I not
okay with it being thirty minutes late
no I got that that will not be the norm
but I'm just saying it's actually kind
of funny that we brought the show back
in the very first show is us literally
doing West tech talk about what people
don't realise I think is that I started
at four o'clock that was an hour and 35
minutes ago setting up okay I thought
that was gonna be enough time but the
problem was then we couldn't once we got
the camera and everything to work down
there we couldn't get we couldn't get
the capture to work for getting Jerry's
feed now we're actually using discord
video for this and Jerry we good just so
you know we can hear all of your PM's
every time it goes door don't go dunk so
I just thought let you know
what's that picking up on oh you know
what it is well I think I'm gonna push
this button ok did that Jesus all hear
me I hear you okay I think I had the
button pushed on my mixer that basically
takes all the channels and ties them
together so now it should just be my
microcut I just want to make sure so if
you hear em in the future just let me
know so I don't think anyone should
expect anything great out of today's
show but I tried to make it look pretty
but you know what maybe Tech Talk
doesn't maybe maybe it's something I can
leave unpolished in my life I mean you
could well you can Paul it I'll be
Mythbusters proved you can polish a turd
but it still doesn't have the greatest
of shine I almost feel like this show
would suffer from too much polish
probably it would yeah I think so okay
so let's talk about Tech Talk
if you guys look in the description of
this video it's important to me that you
guys read that because what happened was
it turned into donation talk like all we
did was talk about the comments that
were being donated and we appreciate the
donation as to trust me but we're at a
different place and where we left off
where I'm incorporated giri is
incorporated the money flow is a lot
easier to happen now where we world will
be sinking in agreed sponsors for this
show to help pay for the time like
because I mean I've had I had family
time set aside for Thursday nights which
has now been adjusted and we're back to
now a night taken away of that but I
want to make it worth our efforts
because this show was missing the raw
factor it was missing the raw meat and
trust me I liked it I like to rub it raw
if you know what I'm saying okay so I
like the rod J nothing's changed in that
aspect I just I I miss tech talk too
because it allowed me to just get down
to earth with our core audience and
that's who I make videos for every day
what about you what did you miss I just
miss you J there's no nice you work all
the time and I never say don't give me
your
hey and to be fair and to be fair J
actually was the one that approached me
about bringing back tags on I didn't say
 about it and that right I came down
there you were the one that brought in
yeah you didn't mention it even once and
it made me happy it made me happy
because I was glad that you wanted back
because honestly this is a one of the
things I looked forward to and the
reason I look forward to is one it was
time for me to hang out with you and -
its raw yeah I mean I know that I know
that you want to bring some structured
you obviously have to bring some
structure to it make it worth our while
yeah which we talked about since we're
both incorporated and now we don't have
to do the whole back and forth between
our channels and stuff like that but uh
but I like the idea that it still
remains raw at least even if it's
structured the banter I want to remain
raw I don't want to over process it yeah
someone in chat said I stole your shaver
I did not I went in the room after Jerry
left and I sat down on the chair
that was in the by the window and Nicks
and I sat on something hard long and
black and I was like what the heck and I
was afraid to open it I didn't know what
I was gonna find because it's just a lot
of you it's just no no listen it was a
leather pouch right this is a lot of
pouch thing and I was like oh my god did
I find Jerry's drugs do I find Jerry's
extracurricular device I opened it up I
was like oh thing guys just a shaver
there's no I'm old school this is my
extracurricular device okay
you know you know when you take my
little hand no I do miss that shaver
though I missed it horribly it looks
like an expensive one do it is that the
Kevlar karna bought that for me back
that's like good so you know it's more
expensive one that I'd ever pay for yeah
mine mines like practically held on by
tape I'm gonna get it back and there's
gonna be a bunch of gray pubes in there
hey my pubes if my pubes are not great
yet holy cuz use the five-minute hair
color oh here we go
this is this is tech-talk degrading into
everything but tech speaking just um a
little bit about like how you want to
change the show yeah well I don't want I
don't necessarily want to change it I
just want to guide it does that make
sense that's what I got guide is a good
word so go that we're gonna free up a
lot of time by not sitting here focusing
on like all the donation you know
comments and stuff which don't don't
think me wrong we highly appreciate
those every dollar of that goes towards
you know us making content hopefully
Jerry it gets more active on YouTube but
he does his morning coffee twitch and
that takes up time and effort and so
it's but the problem was we we
underestimate how many people actually
had money to donate to a show like this
and so we ended up having to read
something like sixty comments a show and
trying to comment like respond to those
and then what was happening as the
standard chat is going away like we
weren't able to interact with that we
couldn't get the topics either because
we felt bad like these people donated
money to talk to us you need at least
answer that so now we're gonna be since
we're gonna be seeking some sponsorships
on this we are going to not be focusing
as much on those comments we may pick
some out here and there if they're
really good one and speak to them but
we're gonna we're gonna structure up
this show in segments and it doesn't
mean that segment is gonna be completely
hyper focus to an outline that we have
to follow it like for instance tech rant
of the week
I've got one ready to go okay and I
think everyone already knows what it's
about I think Jerry should pick a
section that he wants to kind of control
we find one we both like so it's like
third right we'll find one that we both
agree on
like for instance I'm awesome hardware
they have their they have their sword
fight right so something like that
whether it's it's designed to pit both
hosts against each other and kind of see
where it goes and then I think there's
an interact with the odd
and portion in there and then just
literally the last portion of the show
is the anything-goes section we talk
about anything we want we get as crazy
as we want whatever but we follow that
format and that format allows us to at
least keep it structured enough to where
you feel like you get some entertainment
value out of the show but then we can
kind of follow the bullet points if that
make sense no no I completely agree with
that because in the past Tech Talk would
generally even some shows just start
with something it just blow like three
hours and we're like wow we never really
came off of that right we just endless
rain you know me man I will I will just
go follow a tunnel to its end right so
you can place the out of this if
you just settled me down so so like a
tech rant of the week yeah I mean I'm
sure you can find one thing that
happened during the iPhone acts hands
down okay fine so I'll let you take the
I'll let you take rant of the week away
with iPhone X first or iPhone Tan I
think it is what you're actually
supposed to call it I'm gonna call the
iPhone X cuz piece of that's dead
and it's like X's and Y's x marks the
spot
bury it on the ground okay all right so
here's my rant for the I the iPhone 10
my my biggest problem with iPhone is one
I love iPhone okay let me let me let me
just kind of like start this and
predicating with I do have an iPhone 7
plus and I do love my iPhone 7 plus
except for that it doesn't have the
headphone jack which that kind of pisses
me off the fact I can use an adapter I'm
okay with and I can live with what I
don't like about the iPhone 10 is that
now Apple's trying to support two
completely different Hardware ecosystems
up until now and you had a little
version of the big version what well
that's what we always kind of disliked
about Android yeah because if the
hardware ecosystem is too big the
software starts to suffer right when
when every piece of every program on
every device has to have in it like
50,000 if deaths and switch statements
the that's like if I'm on the SA if
I'm on an LG g4 if I'm on it something
30 do you think it's better now than the
beginning oh massive I think in the
beginning it was really fragmented Oh
fair enough I think I think that the
developers themselves have become more
accustomed to developing for a larger
ecosystem and I do believe that the the
libraries themselves like unity and
like that have bridged the gap between a
lot of this hardware matrix but it's not
a perfect system
the one thing that Apple had though is
because they always had one hardware
ecosystem everything was the same base
they had a bigger in a little device
they were the same thing they both have
the same
same capabilities in everything you
refinement now you got the iPhone 10 and
the iPhone 10 doesn't have a physical
button that has this weirdly shaped
 screen that isn't like normally
shaped and isn't of a normal resolution
and now they have to support all that in
iOS which means you're getting all that
 garbage on the other platforms -
including the iPhone 8 which arguably I
think is the better device but my
problem with that is if they go down
this path where they start creating all
kinds of different versions the suit
everybody's needs and they're all
radically different all the way down to
the screen and the capabilities we're
gonna see the software gets slower and
slower and slower we're gonna see the
battery life get lower and lower and
lower that's my opinion I think Apple is
kind of trying to chase Android and
that's gonna be a problem
I think they're doing the same thing
that Microsoft did Microsoft tried to
chase Apple and it started hurting their
own device and started hurting their own
ecosystem and now I feel like apples
doing the same thing with Android I
don't understand why because they
already have a amazing market
share we commented on this I don't want
to say predictive but we definitely
commented on this several years ago when
Steve Jobs died me know well there goes
the the compass you know and how many
years has it been do you know how many
years it's been since Steve died is it
for because cuz remember he said that
the plan that he left for Cook was 5
years I bet you if you go look
he literally like died five years ago
sometimes yeah the wheels are coming off
I don't remember to be honest my big guy
I think it might have been five years it
might be because literally it seems like
the second the pulls off the table they
were like let's make devices that are
different I'm look at this now has a
toaster oven in it Wendy if you type
when did see yeah October 5th 2011 there
you go that was six years ago so longer
longer than PI B so the five year plans
gone
Steve Steve Jobs leadership just died
out it's done so now now cooks just
throw it on the wall Wow
so rip Apple we're having us we're
having kind of a derpy connection though
between discord every now and then
you're kind of like you're kind of going
Pengy like buying paint my squirrel
factored in ADHD making me move it like
lightnings means
it's just the audio side of it that is
we'll figure it out we'll figure it out
later guys this is like the first dream
after like eight months Jay almost had a
heart attack trying to get it set up so
how was I was premiered I was texting
you a lot of expletives dude you were
very angry I could tell I was like I was
literally like a fury
I was gonna call like the police would
be like there's a person in danger right
now in the in the studio please go help
no it's fine I can't I can't get SOS is
from Nick on my phone it's like if I saw
I can't hit Nick it's a hate crime Nick
I wouldn't hit you anyway Oh Nick plus
you never get your electronics Figg I
don't think I don't think Nick's caught
up yes I said I wouldn't hit you even if
it was a hit wasn't a hate crime he said
oh he was a your safety alone I can't
even say thank you ready just that Oh
anyway it's so easygoing that's the
funny thing the contrast between you
guys especially coming down there like
seeing in the studios Nick's just kind
of like like completely level like
sociopathic level give you that one like
almost never you never really get super
exciting never gets mad he's kinda like
mmm and you're just like like you look
like a heart attack advisor that's true
I think it's very true man so is iPhone
10 I was debating trying to get my hands
on one just to play around with it but I
don't think I would daily drive it
honestly I think okay so just to be
clear I do think it's a cool device in
that it's industrial design is clever
I've never seen a device before in the
eye in in any space where it's weird
like pixels are literally deleted the
screen is a weird shape right mm-hm now
granted they're just rendering it
they're just probably cutting those part
obscuring those parts of the LCD but at
any rate it is a cool piece of
technology but I think that going that
route is really gonna confuse apples
developers and I think apples developers
are gonna start slipping and I've
already seen a huge decline in
performance and quality
ever since iOS probably two generations
ago would that an iOS iOS 9 or 10 uh it
was it was going downhill it's already
like hanging the device she'll be typing
and think about the first time they
introduced the plus I actually noticed a
the back yes let's say when they
introduced the five right when it was a
longer screen go long all the apps had
black bars on the top and bottom because
the apps weren't being updated fast
enough to write I remember that yeah but
I don't know I think I think they've
gotten better I'm gonna be devil's
advocate and say I think the developers
will adjust quickly because they've had
to does they've had to deal with two
different resolutions now for a while I
don't think it'll be that hard for them
to
map to 1/3 I mean it I don't think it's
that far right it still scaled up it's
just a game you are I think they do the
the top parts of the stream that are
kind of weird and segmented at the top I
think those are those are cut off from
the app developers I think the app
developers are still seeing a perfect
aspect ratio right so yeah I don't know
it's but I still I still think the
hardware ecosystems changed enough now
that they have to cater to two pieces
hardware that are radically different
yeah well my tech rant of the week is
actually the NVIDIA attend a 1070 TI now
I've known about this card for weeks and
this card doesn't need to exist it does
oh and I have and they're on the way I
have them on the way they're coming
they're on their way they'll be here
tomorrow why does this sound like a
familiar argument I feel like you've had
this argument before when it came to was
the Titan well I said that the 1080 Ti I
probably wouldn't exist because I didn't
think it needed to but that was top tier
it slid in between the Titan okay fine
that makes sense but how are you gonna
stop gap a card between us 1070 and a
1080 and call it a 1080 Ti when those
two cards are already so close together
in performance now a birdie told me this
and I can't say who this was because I
don't want anyone in trouble but a
birdie told me that every single card
being shipped by the AI bees will be
shipping at the exact same clock speed
there will not be a variance between any
of the Strix or the the further wind
twos or the what is the MSI one if I'm
not sure whatever the gaming the gaming
X right
they'll all be shipping with the exact
same core clock and NVIDIA is forcing
that why because if you slightly
overclock these then guess what they
catch up to you at 1080 for a heck of a
lot cheaper now the MSRP on these is
four hundred and forty nine dollars ok
the MSRP on the on the ten seventy is
379 I think it was 399 three two one
hundred dollar ish difference no like 80
bucks right you say between 80 to 100
depending but it's like for 49 versus
379 versus a 1080 which is like 500 ish
dollars now granted they're all being
marked up slightly because of custom
board designs and stuff so ok this is
this is the current lineup right now
with this is the current lineup right
now with the video you ready and we're
GTA series not GT GT 10 30s or any that
stuff GTX okay 10 50 10 50 10 let me
start over
1050 1050 TI 1063 gig 1066 gig 1070 1070
TI 1080 1080 TI Titan XP why do you have
10 cards because that's how many fingers
we have some work Titan X X 4 10 iPhone
10 OH Illuminati confirmed no I mean
okay you know what now here's now here's
the devil's advocate to me this is them
going for AMD's jugular okay because
we've already seen that in terms of
gaming performance right if is if we're
talking gaming we're leaving if we're
leaving Bitcoin mining and all that crap
at our cryptocurrency mining and all
that crap out of there we're just
talking about gaming the $399 Vega 56
which they're finally starting to come
down in price somebody actually linked
me to a new egg Vega 56 that was $400
okay I was like finally you know have to
how many months if the 1070 was trading
blows with a Vega 56 at that price point
already at 1070 TI for $50 more kind of
obsolete so Vega 56 in just about every
way if you think about it I don't know
what power consumptions like on it I
don't know if it's a single power pin or
a dual power pin or what I don't I won't
have my cards until tomorrow how much
head room do you think well yeah I know
you don't speculate on these things but
there'd have to be a significant amount
of head room on the TI otherwise you're
just gonna overclock the 1070 you get a
similar speed unfortunately because I
have all of the vape because I have all
of the founders edition cards yeah I can
play with that and see but of course
they're the custom cards are coming
right the custom cards yeah are going to
overclock and meet and exceed founders
edition base clock 10 80s but no of
course you can overclock a 1080 and
you'll pass it even farther but the
thing isn't videos get themselves in a
pickle here Nvidia is confusing their
own stack I mean yeah but they're like
you said they're so close together now
with the 10 cards that it's like you can
buy this card overclock it and surpass
the card that's ahead of it or you can
buy the card ahead of it there's no
guarantee you're gonna get a chosen
perfect card that's gonna overclock as
well as even the previous chatter
they're so close together it seems like
your odds of just buying the cheaper
card and overclocking it or going
similar proof oh I see I see comments
and they're saying well you can flash a
56 be a 64 or you can flash the 64 and
pass a 1080 that doesn't matter we're
talking about NVIDIA sliding a card in
here where it's a really weird place and
I didn't realize the four words were
that flexible they're pretty flexible on
Vega they're crazy flexible um so I
still think in terms of a pure gamer
aspect of it I don't I don't think Vega
makes a whole lot of sense to a gamer
given the performance you get versus the
power draw alone the power drill you
have to keep in mind that NVIDIA has
been around longer in that space so
there's the outside of the brand loyalty
if I was somebody who's just coming in
and buying something then people
presented AMD and NVIDIA I'd be like
okay this one's been around longer it's
been more heavily tested then the price
point would be the only reason that I
would go after AMD if I wasn't a fanboy
on either side I'm trying to be play
devil's advocate here what are your
thoughts on that um I don't know or
which direction would you go if you if
you didn't like if you didn't have a
brand loyalty to begin with you were
just like wouldn't wouldn't the AMD
being the younger kind of new kid on the
block wouldn't you kind of expect it to
be cheaper if it performed in the same
ballpark before you'd even consider
going that direction you know Paul did a
really good video about why it sucks to
build a PC in 2017 and I'm glad he
deserve it I'm glad I'm glad he did that
video actually went viral it got picked
up a lot it's earned ten thousands of
subs and he deserves every single one I
kind of wanted to do a video like that
but I just never did and I'm and I'm
kind of glad I didn't because it gave me
time to really sit down and think about
his perspective of that and okay it's
got a lot of great perspectives memories
more expensive than it was last year SSD
yeah why why is that memory coming back
down and in price I don't understand
what the factories still like not
rebuilt and it seems like they've
had a lot of time I don't know it's
volatile but I mean Nant 3d NAND an nvme
is more expensive than it was video
cards were more expensive than they were
because of you know cryptocurrency
miners I'm sure I look at it Lee was I
look at it come from a little bit
different perspective than what Paul did
Paul was strictly I'm on the pricing
side of things which is a great factor
but I try and look at it from the
perspective of I'm a buyer that has
money to burn okay and that made it
really hard to choose parts I find
myself having a hard time choosing parts
when I'm building builds for people or
or just doing these videos trying to
grab them off my little Micro Center
shelf
right because it's kind of like if I'm
trying to reenact what I think the
average buyer would be experiencing in
the store there are so many options now
I feel like that makes it hard because
you because of the issues like this now
we're we have 10 GTX graphics cards
there's twice as many as there are AMD
Radeon cards available it's like how do
you know what to choose right it becomes
confusing because it's like okay you
would think just based on the numbering
sequence that yeah blah blah blah is
gonna be faster than blah blah blah but
it's very likely that a 1070 Ti out of
the and that's why they're being locked
out of the box right because if these if
these manufacturers get good Pascal
chips and they're just go in there and
overclock them and they're gonna they're
gonna completely diminish the sales or
dilute the sales a sale ability of a
1080 because then it could be performing
well better than a 1080i out of the box
and then you have people figuring out
where those chips are coming from and
charging a premium but as a new buyer if
you're a new build or a new buyer
doesn't that confuse the out of you
if you're not a power user and
understand all of that if you're
generally does it confuse me but the
other problem that you run into is
cohesion between all the parts one thing
I learned working with Puget systems is
just because parts can work together
doesn't mean they work well together
yeah so you look at you going to buying
a motherboard that was designed factum
eyes for Nvidia graphics cards and
slapping an AMD card on it and then
going with that type of memory that's
not it's hardware compatibility list
yeah technically you can get it all work
together but it's not guaranteed to work
flawlessly together and before it was
like you had pretty clear options right
if you're going with Nvidia get an Intel
processor get an Intel motherboard kind
of at least in that ballpark now it's
like is that really the fastest is there
a situation where you could buy an Intel
proc until motherboard and throw one of
the bag of cards in there
well there should get a problem is that
rumors been around forever right if you
build an all AMD ecosystem computer it
will run better than if you mix and
match Intel and AMD but how do you I buy
into that myself too because they always
talk about all this CPU has optimized
 the graphics but how do you truly
test that how do you find the 100% Intel
equal how do you do that you can't
really you can't and this is the stuff I
think a lot of people who like to
criticize the way we do our videos don't
understand is there there is no there is
no cut and dry way of doing what we do
which is why there's so many of us doing
it because the more angles and
perspectives you can see this
information for our from the better
equipped the buyer is going to be at a
viewer
a buyer is going to be to make their own
choices there's because there's not one
number right that's there's not one
number one card could presumably be
faster or one thing whereas the other
card could be faster at the other thing
same goes for processors memory all that
 right yeah yeah so so how do you
come up with that one and you can't
right I mean I think we're both saying
you can't but how do you come up with
that one magical number that says this
is better than that when this user only
cares about this game running fast and
this user only cares about this app
running fast they're both gonna think
theirs is the fastest but in reality if
you swap places they wouldn't be right
I'm gonna respond to a comment real
quick Daniel 27 says barn not letting J
speak much stop the cutting man look
Jerry and I both are loud mouths we have
to stick we have to cut in to get our
words in sometime so we're not cutting
each other off we're not being rude just
deal with it it's probably the way you
talk to your friends in real life 2 plus
plus we deal with a slight delay - a lot
of people don't realize that it's slight
but it's enough that with how fast we
talk we do actually interrupt each other
but we're also dealing with a slight
delay over the internet as well yeah so
yeah I guess that's that's my rant it's
like why is the 1070 t I exist with I
mean other kudos for the Pascal
manufacturing process though right did
you hear me woody what do you mean about
the manufacturing process if they're
able to bust out this many these many
chips to just flood the market with
these this many cards kudos to them
right cuz to be fair I don't think they
are though that's the this this is what
I think they're doing is the same thing
as the CPU manufacturers do where
they're literally spitting out like 99%
of the same component just depending on
how fast it goes they slap it on a
different card yeah but we are a year
and five months into Pascal that is low
that is that is a long life cycle and
for them - now this is the other side of
the argument for them - now in October
26th of 2017 when on may 5th 2016 was
when the 1080 put launched the Pascal
series Jerry sorry I need the chat needs
to wait okay I'm talking to you you're
my coast listen you got me you got me
bro may 5th 2016 Pascal launch with the
1080 okay
October 26 2017 they launched a 1070 TI
that tells you the Pascal line ups not
going anywhere anytime soon we're all
ready yes
Brodie's now they're not gonna end a
life it right after that you know what I
think they're gonna do is just stretch
it through the holiday season then the
second the holiday season's over they're
gonna move well here's what we have guys
we have the Intel situation it's just
now happening with NVIDIA where every
year Nvidia was this like BAM new card
new card new series new card kepler
maxwell whatever right good Fermi kepler
maxwell pascal and they just every year
was like boom boom boom and just
literally they were like mike tyson
uppercutting you know 1980s mike tyson
right not not 90s Mike Tyson but anyway
they're just going crazy uppercutting
AMD with all these cards and AMD
couldn't really keep up that well AMD
does have as big of a stack but now
we're seeing here the lifespan of the
series
stretching out because there's no
pressure for them to start releasing
things like Tesla P 100 and all that for
the gamers or their HBM to because of
the fact there's no pressure so now I
think we're gonna start seeing the
stagnation like we've been seeing with
Intel over the last decade happening on
GPUs which is one of the reasons why I'm
disappointed that Vega itself did not
perform toe-to-toe at the same power
requirements and stuff as Nvidia because
now I'm scared that we're gonna see a
stagnation of DP performance tell me
this though do you think that the
graphics cards manufacturers are getting
so fast now or the graphics cards
themselves are getting so fast now that
they're starting to approach the
limitation of PCI 3 and they're
literally all working on the next
generation they just don't have a bus
for it yet I don't think so I still
think we're our limit our CPUs are still
our limiting factor because here's the
thing I can take my 1080 Ti and
overclock it sure and I can take I can
put it on something like my 780 700 K or
7700 K that's like overclocked to 5 gigs
right normally that would have no chance
of bottlenecking a cpu period i pcs are
too good it wouldn't bottleneck a CPU
but now I'm saying there's still
Headroom what I'm saying is now if I
overclocked my CPU until it crashes I'm
seeing improvements in fps all the way
up to that max point so that tells me
the GPU is still being held back but the
1080 Ti is still being held back by even
the fastest IPC CPUs right now that's
crazy
well and Jen's son said something
recently I think was Jensen don't quote
me on this but I did see an article that
talked
Nvidia making a claim that they are out
to obsolete the CPU which good ties back
into something you said a couple years
ago on this show yeah you're like why
does CPUs exist if GPUs are so much
better yeah
no no in that I think the conclusion
that we came to that on that was mainly
that Microsoft is so heavily embed and
tied to the Intel x86 next 64
architecture in the funny thing which
are ancient extras actually created by
AMD right a lot of people realize but
how old is it how old is that now very I
mean I couldn't tell you the exact date
but god we were working on AMD 64-bit
stuff back in 2002 2003 at Microsoft if
game so it's Rita Rita bellman on chat
says if games could do better with
multi-threading would that reduce the
bottleneck possibly possibly but the
problem is it's really hard to multi
thread a game right and that's that's
unfortunately a fundamental problem of
how games work and how a world loop
world loop works yeah yeah it's just
hard NVIDIA needs to make a CPU they
kind of believe that they already are
it's just no they already did yeah they
did remember the god what was it call
the tablets that tests the Tegra
yeah the Tegra processors yeah granted
they were still I think there was still
based on x86 architecture but they were
there it was like their version of Intel
Atom stuff like super small factor stuff
yep so so the thing is I think in order
for a GPU to become a CPU because
they're so fast right but the problem is
the per core speed is so low that's
that's where you hit a wall but the
thing with the GPU is like you said if
the multi-threading stuff could scale
and they could create a kernel that was
really efficient at taking single thread
operations and breaking them up and
making them parallel mhm like without
you having to like custom build
everything for it
I could totally see a GPU just taking
over hands-down right because you have
literally what how about how many cores
around a 1080 oh I don't 3200 3000
something I remember there's so many
even if they're running it like a
hundred megahertz if which they're not
but even if they we're running at 100
megahertz they would still clock for
clock punch way above any x86 processor
that exists today for like 1/10 the
price yeah there's so many right now I
can't remember let's see there are full
specs and it's not only it's not only
just the how many the core count oh
there's only 20 560 cuda cores on that
one it's
the 1330 840 coup de corazon the new
Titan XP well just funny about that they
literally have the CUDA cores like
matching resolution specs identically I
wonder if that's okay I guess we're
dealing with factors of was it 16 so I
guess I make sense but yeah it's really
amazing had the speed because you my
Titan XP that I have here granted it is
not it's been matured in the
manufacturing process because the Titan
XP came out right early this year like
yes April or well there's three variants
right there was the tight X tight XP mag
Titan X little P right past but this
they only sell the little P right now so
I'm just referring to that one because
that's 130 140 the other one had 35 60
was the one that matched the 1080i core
for court but anyway uh it's it's a it's
amazing how far I think an overclock I
can still reach over 2000 megahertz with
that mini CUDA cores I mean that's
insane
you know in reverie West facts you made
a really good comment over here he said
GPU instruction set is incredibly
limited and it kind of reminds me
remember the old RISC processors okay
they're reduced instruction set process
these to use like arcade machines and
stuff back in the day they're really
fast because they didn't need a super
high clock speed because they didn't
have to run so many instructions they
were incredibly lean and mean they did a
couple of things they did addition
subtraction and whatever same thing with
GPUs GPUs are almost exclusively built
to just be floating-point calculators
yeah that's what they're good at that's
what they're really fast at so in order
for them to be more viable for an
operating system for instance or memory
management and stuff like that it seems
like they would have to grow their
instruction set which would lead to a
whole nother set of problems but still I
don't see why it couldn't happen there's
no reason I can think of in my head
other than the multi-threading and the
developers having to get better at
multi-threading to make that viable
another be fair to we're talking about
this level of performance and 1080p
resolution which I mean the future is 4k
and beyond but the but if you go look up
as steams Hardware pull survey you can
see that there are millions more users
using 1080p than there are using 1440 or
10 or 4k so it's still use 1080 for
gaming like I usually okay for
everything else but 1080 is gaming for
me so it's still gonna be a long time I
think until we see 4k means
dream gaming oh okay let's change our
topic here just Luis I was my rant there
and with it and even though I'm ranting
about it I'm still doing the reviews and
I'm gonna bring up these questions in my
review like I guess why why is this here
you know I actually agree with you I
don't have a devil's advocate on that
one because I agree with 70 seems like
it's just wedged in between two things
that are already really close together
so so here's the thing are they are they
Bend up 10 70s or been down 10 attrs
right go look at the core count I bet
you they're identical I bet you the two
one of them is gonna match the other
right you're gonna know exactly which
one it is
or it could be shaved a little bit
member the 210 60s have different
amounts of RAM and different amounts of
core count but they're both called the
1060 and that was my rant on that one
was how you can we call it a 1060 if the
core count and the RAM counts different
you're right and I believe that the 1060
because of the way that the RAM was
accessed the six gigabyte card was
actually much faster it was a lot faster
it was a lot faster I remember that
because of how it accessed the memory oh
god there are so many little weird
things going on behind the scenes that
the average consumer will never know
when they're buying off the shelf
so hallucinatin says it sounds like the
world is getting greedy and we are
expecting too much too fast look how far
we've come and no one is satisfied still
we're never gonna be satisfied this is
human nature human nature is to continue
pushing right it's it's evolution that's
never gonna change
the world will never say we're happy
with where we're at yeah and the truth
is you get mad when well not now because
you're like a tech reviewer and you got
all this stuff coming in but let's let's
talk about you back when you were just a
pure consumer right when you're a pure
consumer you would get mad if you bought
something like a 1080 and three days
later the next big thing comes out right
and this and this happened to us all the
time every computer I bought all the way
back to 46 same damn thing happened time
I got around to being able to afford to
build a 46 goddamn Pentium comes out but
the thing is used to move faster in my
people right it did it do well did it
really I think it did because it felt
like every six months we were dealing
with some major upgrade but here's the
thing that the claim and I remember I
recall this now from reading the article
the claim was actually Jensen referring
to Moore's laws dead that Moore's law is
dead and that we are actually
progressing faster than Moore's law so
yeah I mean it's one of those things
where I remember my
building his systems for his machine his
business all the time and it seemed like
every couple of months he was like
completely upgrading because it was
coming along that fast but remember it
we were dealing with like such small
improvements as well write the 486 66
megahertz and it was the 486 100
megahertz and it was the 46 166
megahertz you know so it was like small
granite three times the speed in the end
but plus news never traveled fast right
that was the other thing back then the
internet wasn't you know the second
comes out yeah you had to look it up and
PC Magazine you know that's true I
remember there was a big gap between 386
and 486 for me but I think that that gap
was illusionary because I literally
couldn't even look into 486 right
because how long after it already exists
right because what came out what came
out right after 486 the Pentium the
Pentium that was 60 and then the 90 I
remember because I wanted one so bad and
then the competition just died after
that was a cyrix had they're offering a
piece of and then IBM do you guys
remember the IBM Blue Lightning I don't
know okay so the IBM Blue Lightning was
basically the competition to the Pentium
Pro they came out like later on and I
wanted one of those so bad and it like
died or horrendously like it's so
expensive and so cost and affect him
back then everything had different buses
now we just have PCI right yeah back
then remember when there was VESA local
bus ISA and PCI right well that's when
the CPU used to be on it's a little
adapter into the PCI slot yes and it
said like better off it's set up right
like a graphics card I remember that
yeah we are much better off now a much
better off no it's funny though as I
find myself now that we're doing Tech
Talk like thinking about upgrading
skunkworks again which is something that
I had not cared about like I have not
cared about that I mean it's running a
69 50 X which is a 10 core 20 thread
right it's got all of its PCIe lanes so
it's it's based it's essentially a 7900
X that's out today it's 64 gigs of ram
and it's got to Titan X's in there the
big peanut little P so they're not even
the latest and greatest graphics cards
and so it's like to be you know I kind
of don't care to be honest with you I
mean I'm running 1080i as and my systems
here I wrote in video email asking them
for the little P so I could use it for
my server that we talked about for our
GPU pass through but I'm not gonna even
be using that for games I finally am
starting to feel for the first time in
my life it says
doing this YouTube thing where I'm like
content with not having the absolute top
echelon of anything you could build and
the irony of that is Kyle's building a
ten thousand dollar PC right now cuz
this is kind of like the first time he's
actually sort of been able to do that
which is like it's fun for me to watch
cuz it's like more power to him dude
enjoy it build the out of that that
ain't that into elite case I do it I do
it so yeah I know I was supposed to do
that but I ended up just never getting
around to it but there's a new there's a
new case coming out from case labs that
I want to build it and I feel like that
would be the skunkworks update but I
would probably end up doing something so
stupid that it would probably hurt my
actual need for skunkworks because I
only play games on it now just kind of
it yeah it's supposed to be in my
opinion that can be just kind of special
to you too right skunkworks as far as I
know is probably like when you hit the
peak of your building right I mean you
still have Headroom to go but I'm just
saying that was the one you were most
proud of from the way you talk yeah but
every year I hit that peak again because
the whole idea was as the as the
technology grew and as a channel grew so
did the build so it was kind of like the
Winchester mansion of computers just
keep building on it right got it
and but I haven't touched it in a year
it has a gorgeous machine though I got I
got to sleep with it and I thought about
doing terrible terrible things to that
side window you know I you know I didn't
have a password on that computer until
you came up went on like the morning I
picked you up otherwise it would have
been full of porn instantly or you were
to find oh you were found mine in a
folder called not born oh I think I know
what's not in there then if I'm peeking
guys I'm sorry I keep it just in the mic
but the Yeti bro I would've used
incognito okay just so you know what do
you think I mean but anyway I want to
upgrade it and I think it would probably
be something ridiculous right the 79 80
XE rampage extreme or something like
that right just a stupid up
balls-to-the-wall build but the problem
is like I like I started to say I game
on that system now I don't render on it
hardly ever anymore I think that video I
rendered with you in there that the car
brake video was the first time I used
that computer for work in like I don't
know months and so even that was
rendering one-to-one 4k right so I'm
yeah yeah well that was a 1080p video so
it rendered about 50 percent of the
length of the video
okay so yeah but if I go with a semi 900
or 79 80 XC
I'm gonna lose gaming performance
because
we grow laterally rather than core speed
in IPC right yep so it will it would be
an amazing streaming machine and for the
first time are you ready for this how
many times have we reviewers said okay
yeah they talked about the fact that you
could encode a 4k video and you could
play a game and you could live stream
and you could blah blah blah with all
these cores we're like yeah that's not a
real-world scenario yesterday while we
were encoding a 4k video we were making
ever playing World of Warcraft did you
ever see the the review video that I did
of the piates build William when they
first gave it to me like way back when I
had their original Titans in it oh then
she's like just load it down with all
kinds of multi-threading I had 4 VMs
running one on each of the 4 monitors
and two of the VMS were actually running
3d games like I was running
counter-strike
I think global Offensive and I had like
some other game playing on this then two
other ones were running a benchmark
which we're using a hundred percent of
the resources that were allocated to him
yeah and it all ran flawlessly because I
was just like here have some cores on
this one have some force on this woe to
GP is here use this when you use this
one and it works great yeah sorry I'm
just texting the wife because I would be
a little bit later expected to be you
know the nice thing is though we got a
video recorded today that's actually for
a sponsor I don't think it'll be out
till next week though so tomorrow I got
a I gotta take some tires over to my
wheel guy cuz I don't know
remember remember them te 37 but yeah
that that stupid deal that we worked out
while you were down here yeah they're
off getting they're off getting their
their special treatment Volk
came out with a very with a new color
wheel I can't change your mind did yeah
I can't wear what they call it it's a
it's a no what's that gray color I
showed you that gunmetal color okay
super deep gunmetal color and I dropped
it off and I got to see that color in
person oh my god it's so nice I cannot
ask you is that what you're gonna do
then that one oh yeah yeah absolutely
it's happen that's happening hey when
they stripped that one wheel though let
me know let me know if they find
anything under the paint we are no I
already I already had the tires swapped
remember because of the the guy want to
buy back my old wheels and his tires it
gave me for free right but I'm wondering
if there's anything under the paint on
him when they strip um like if there's
any damage restored
no he's already he's already taking the
tires off and started the work and I
have not heard from him so I think there
was like a hey you should know about
this I would have heard from him
okay so it's just the one thing I'm
curious and when they're done cuz those
those are some pretty awesome but
Jerry's talking about is one of the
wheels look like the lips had been Rhema
Sheen used to be a polished lip and
whoever Rhema Sheen dumb cut him real
deep and so it was really scored looked
like almost like like machine like
machine marks right it's exactly what
they were
it's just they never smooth it out and
polished it so it look like the work was
half done but the the nice thing was it
was bare aluminum so we could see if
there was any straightening or bondo
work and there wasn't so I doubt there's
anything under that black paint yeah
actually the irony is you're taking
you're taking your wheels and I have to
take my car and get the wheel bearings
checked tomorrow I was supposed to take
him in today but my mechanic got busy
and he said hey can you bring it in
tomorrow but uh my car ever since I got
to put on the dyno and I got all that
extra torque and I decided to tune it
around a little bit now my now my front
wheel when I move is making this Shh
noise like it's rubbing and it's kind of
like slowing down and surging as it's
doing it but the engine and transmission
still smooth as butter so it's either
it's either a wheel bearing or an axle
so we'll find out more either of them
are easy though
no Alex son Alex and Simba says bringing
back Tech Talk needs to be a channel
announcement not a message on a terrible
spamming website what are they talking
about terrible spamming website I have
no idea what they're talking about I
don't see referring to like Twitter or
something I don't know I know we
announced it there I mean the seven 3726
people in here I mean someone got the
notice some gum yeah so why are there
not at least three thousand likes on
this what is wrong with you guys come on
we're back it's only seven hundred and
sixty-four likes what the hell's wrong
with you why are there twenty-seven
dislikes there's 27 people in here just
like angry watching
like I hate this I'm gonna watch it more
just like it hate it you know if they
were in the mood I was before I actually
went live I would probably have disliked
the stream too because I hate that I
hated the whole world I want to put the
Internet has Asperger's J is hot no I'm
not I've got the air on above me I've
got the fan going I actually click on
the immense sexy you diggin sexy it's
the it's the hair it's the gray hair I
think you'd have the George Clooney
going on you know what really kind of
grinds my gears what what grind your
gears J I'll put out a video today that
Nick and I made a couple days ago that
is close I guess close to us something
another youtuber did and we got accused
of this I got you thing yeah it's like
yeah first of all it's a channel that I
had never even heard of I had never even
heard of this channel until like
everyone in the comments was was like
telling me I copied this guy's idea
basically all it was was we we we took
destiny to because I just launched and
then we I'm sorry my headphones come
unplugged we check destiny to built a
system based on the minim specs and then
played it to see what it was like and
then we built a system based on the
recommended specs to see how much he
gained that's all of us I don't think
that's an incredibly original idea and I
even called it out in my video saying I
has anyone ever done this before like
yeah I probably but whatever I'm still
gonna do it
but yet the accusations still fly it
still to me that I can't remember the
last video I made like I'm surprised I
didn't get called out for stealing
somebody's idea like hooking a
cheeseburger on a Bible no hotel room I
figured that somebody else priority did
that but yeah there is no original ideas
anymore day I mean I gave you credit
during twitchcon when the wife and I
were in the hotel and I was like man we
got no microwave and hearing up but we
got a hairdryer the most about that is I
just spent like hours having drinks with
you and you're sit there like eating
your dessert and it's like I could tell
you were like pretty tipsy and you head
back to the room person who's got the
pizza box yeah I had that I had the
whiskey I had the what was the other
drink I had oh it was like that um
ginger strawberry thing it was a very
girly drink did you did you drink the
rest of Miss James two cents to the one
that she didn't lie no because she
switched her drink so they took it back
all gotta they took her back all right
we were so bad before him we were so bad
on that vacation in terms of food
bedding care it was only like a three
day vacation and and I keep adjusting
guys I'm sorry I have a bad back and so
I have to keep moving but anyway um we
had for breakfast that next morning when
you were like no it's Sunday you were
still in town right you would left
Monday okay yeah Sunday morning before
we left town we went down to the lobby
and had a Sunday brunch going on and you
know we don't we had we had that we had
chicken and waffles but it was a thick
Belgian waffle with bacon built made
into the batter with a giant like super
thick crispy fried chicken patty on top
of it
[Laughter]
dude that was so good I wanted no no
damn it as you're describing it was like
manna
thing in my head and my mouth believed
it my mouth is watering right now I'm
tired I had never had a waffle with
bacon like mixed into the batter that
was I feel bad too because I've only
ever had chicken and waffles once it was
horribly horribly done and it was gross
even the other person was eating it was
like yeah don't let this like ruin it
for you and now it's like every time I
think chicken waffles I'm like man yeah
I need to have real chicken waffles
well we so I took Nick though when we
went to drop off the wheels because I
told him at those chicken and waffles
now he wanted chicken waffle so we went
to Roscoe's chicken and waffles I've
heard of that I've actually heard of
that place and I live in Washington so
so I like to have them so I like their
waffles more than the one actually had
at the hotel because they're thinner and
it's like a different like a special
batter that they use it's like just
their own recipe I don't like their
chicken as much so I kind of wish I
could have taken the hotel chicken and
put it on the Roscoe's waffle I've
actually had that thought about
restaurants to like I loved popeyes
chicken right I love popeyes chicken but
I love KFC's famous bowls and I don't
like their chicken sausage I like get
their famous Bowl with just the mashed
potatoes and the stuffing and then go
break up Popeyes Chicken and stick it in
there everyone's like oh my god waffle
talk wait and probably before all the
comments are about like weight loss and
fitness and southern style gave me says
Jay what do you think about Raven Ridge
and will you review it absolutely once
like once I get my hands on it Raven
Raven Ridge what is this so Raven Ridge
is basically AMD's new apu that's kind
of like really shave down vega apu built
into it so basically it's a risin ship
with a vega apu built in i still don't
understand the apu market i mean was
that a popular thing or did that well
this is specifically for ultra-thin
laptops okay well why does that even
make sense because even the ultra-thin
laptops seem like they're getting
 like 9 70's and chitin or 1070
well what if we could get a laptop the
thinness of your surface with the power
of at least like let's say a 1060 okay
I'd be I'd be in for that cuz you know I
hate my surface terrible you couldn't
even stream like no games right dude who
puts a screen that's that high
resolution on it that's using like Intel
onboard graphics come on what the HD
graphics ain't good enough for you it's
so terrible yeah he pissed me off i
Internet are not interesting or edge
basically internet explorer see
uh you're an exploder edge edge Scrolls
around perfectly the Adobe video plays
like per the flash video plays perfectly
don't ask how I know that but my
video please perfectly but any other app
outside of that like you drag it around
it's perfect one-to-one any other app
like Photoshop or you open up any Adobe
thing or anything like that it runs like
absolute garbage you see screen tearing
as it's drawing and I don't
understand that why was Microsoft able
to optimize their to work on that
Intel graphics but everything else just
shits the bed I don't get that yeah I
don't know on developers you know new
chrome chrome Scrolls like on it
but but edge Scrolls like glass what did
your what did your laptop say when you
were trying to stream when it gave you
that error about it couldn't stream do
you know it said it was like too
encumbered or something to pop up that's
like you've exceeded like the maximum
processing power and it just stops the
street yeah that was that was when it
died off that when we were trying to do
that because it's got a core i7 with two
cores J a core i7 with two cores well
Apple does that it's still stupid my
MacBook Pro has has an i7 with for
actual cores in it for course and it
probably even has a real GPU in it huh
well Radeon 480 I was before said there
might be a 470 it was a back when when
it first came out there so alright dude
a Geforce 580 would be faster what I
have in this thing right now
like it was really hungry now I know we
were talking about chicken and waffles
and I just want to stuff my face and we
called fatty you know you want to stuff
your face you know it's funny though I
need to work on the lighting
everyone thinks and I talked about this
with the everyone thinks I'm fatter than
I actually am because our lighting is
really good in terms of like overhead
product lighting but it's really bad in
terms of body shadows so like I use the
same excuse I'm actually really skinny
guys serious is the shadow comes from
this light watch watch I'll turn it off
see now it looks skinnier Jerry no I'm
quite serious I remember I told you
about this like it's with the overhead
lighting and the side lighting it
creates body shadows that makes you look
really lumpy like I'm okay I'm a lumpy
guy okay but I'm not quite as lumpy as a
look at my videos and it's starting to
piss me off because I actually work out
really hard at the gym three times a
week and and we're you're pretty swell
bro it was funny that I usually get a
girdle you should go
tight clothing and like shoot a video
looking like the skinniest guy you
possibly can be in I bet you but I'll
have them up but I like but I would have
a muffin top like under my armpits right
anybody who squeeze in some wipes like
yeah you know though to be honest I've
worked out with my personal trainer long
enough now that I really don't care what
my body looks like I care about how I
feel and I've got no lack of energy so
well my personal trainer is my wife and
I can get her to work me out three times
a day I'd be happy so we're we're
working our way up to that I've just
been doing I've been doing this now for
five years now but I only took lifting
serious over the last year or so so what
are you up to what can you bench now
well I don't know we don't actually do
bench press we do all isolation what the
hell is isolation isolation is where we
do a lot of single arm workouts so like
when I'm doing like and you're like
incline chest press I'm holding one in
place and we're and we're alternating
right on the on the incline bench on the
flat bench and stuff I do know that I
can do 90 pound dumbbells though on the
incline press program bro so I mean but
that's still not as high as it like it
to be but we're actually been doing a
lot of isolation right now though on on
my triceps because my triceps have done
limited how far I can go my chest is
strong enough to press that weight my
triceps are not strong enough to set it
myself
and so my trainer basically is like well
if you can't get the weight in position
yourself you're not strong enough to
move the weight even if we can help you
in position that's still not considered
strong enough to move that weight
yourself so now we're building up a lot
of my secondary muscles and for weeks
we're gonna switch back to heavy pushing
again so it's a route I treat it like
like a game like I'm leveling it up you
know what I mean do you eventually get
over the soreness from it cuz that's the
problem that I always had Moreau went to
the gym is the lifting would tear my
muscles they're like oh it's okay to
hurt for like a couple of days until you
heal but it never stopped hurting and it
just almost kind of got worse that just
a shitty personal trainer I have a
personal trainer plan it's about
conditioning and it took me a long time
to get to the point to where I could
recover in a day but the thing is I've
I've been pretty sore over the last
several weeks cuz we switched up the
routine again which is exactly what you
need if you're just if you're pushing
really hard and you're going to failure
but you're not getting sore you're
actually not getting as much benefit
because the soreness is from the tearing
down and rebuilding of the tissues
that's how you build and so you have to
find a way to actually shock your body
that's why we changed my routine every
six weeks
we changed we did we did upper body and
lower body and the problem with that was
is by the time we got back to upper body
again I still didn't feel like I was
fully healed yeah so I was still like
pushing against pain and it's like the
personal trainer was like yeah no no
that's it that's actually normal as long
as it's not like SuperDuper
uncomfortable I was like dude I'm never
actually feeling good and that's that
that discourages me right so he just
feel the burn and that's like a good
thing but if you heard everyday and you
try to get up out of bed and you got to
push yourself up and your arms like uh
you know it's like that's not very fun
ya know III like chasing that pain and I
have never riding my bike nearly enough
but I've just been so I love liftings
like yesterday was a good session oh
wait a real good session I was I was
super swell we'll call that right I get
a lot of I get a lot of my wife just
texted me and said spandex full-body
ones I think she's telling me any no
where's Mannix at the gym no I love
launch dream and your dream here's
what's weird about this when I'm resting
like this I get I get soft right I get I
get soft and I get squishy but when I
workout man do I get like swole I asked
my my trainer about that you guys have
seen pictures I posted on Instagram and
stuff at the gym I balloon up like crazy
and he told me that that's just the
difference between lean mass and
somebody who's got who's got a lot of
fatty mass
fatty mass doesn't shrink as much and
elses as well as much because the fats
all marbled in your muscle right but
when you have lean mass when you're not
swole and you'll have all that blood
flow going to your muscles they shrink
down and atrophy quite a bit until
they're needed again and then H blow up
that's why aren't always talked about
the pump you up that's what pumping is
right so there's a lot of fun but I also
like the resting tension and the muscles
too like what about back when I was
lifting I liked it after you did it for
a little while even when you were at
full relaxed rest you still felt some
tension mm-hmm you know in your muscles
like you're fully rested state wasn't
like gelatin laying down you actually
felt like sitting upright and stuff like
that was a lot like just i'ma tell a
funny story so my chest likes to puff
out a lot you saw in that picture right
oh says ladies he's I said chest I know
I saw that I saw that were somebody
screen capped it you were like well I
was I was actually I was actually doing
a bicep in it like a chest flex right so
I was holding my I was holding my arm
down and I was flexing against it and
then I was intentionally like like
spoofing out my chest and that was when
I realized like how much swell
there is in my body but I didn't realize
like how much separation I was finally
starting to get in my chest is I have a
lot of body fat but underneath that it's
really really bulky and so I was kind of
I was at the gym and I work out at an
athlete's gym that's it's a private gym
that only personal trainers and their
athletes can go in there so it's not
it's not public gym where anyone could
just come in and be you know Bros in the
gym at the same place I went to you I no
no no it's a new place and it's same
trainer new place though and so everyone
there is really cool and supportive like
I workout there's a girl there who's a
personal trainer but she's also a
bodybuilding contestant and she can move
as much weight as I can and she's like
half my size so it's really impressive
yet scary at the same time but we're all
real supportive of each other so I was
sitting there in front of the mirror
sitting on the bench press and I had
that and I had the 80 pounds like
sitting on my my thighs right the
dumbbells and I was get ready to sit
back and press it and I was sitting
there and I notice that every time I
like started to lift up the weight a
little bit my chest would like like we
started jumping and I started like okay
right arm left arm right arm left arm I
was actually making my my pecs do the
Terry Crews thing but in a very very
smaller like amount and actually using
the weight where he doesn't even need it
he's like well I wasn't picking the
weight up and down I was putting tension
on it but I was sitting there in the
mirror and I was like hey hey hey Rob
look at this Rob's my trainer I was like
look left right left right left right in
my chest was like and I was like Terry
Crews I'm coming for you and everyone in
the gym started laughs started laughing
because I mean lot of them know that
that I that I know him and so there was
just kind of funny that I was sitting
there like look look what I can do is it
was kind of like the first time but
anyway I think you need a t-shirt that
says this says I met the man that you
got a picture Terry Crews in the bag all
right damn 370z private gym that's where
our money is going smart man
actually I don't pay anything to the gym
the gym is free I pay my trainer you
should see the druglord mansion where he
parks his helicopter it's awesome and
and just so you know oh the wife said to
get the spandex and wear underneath so I
look skinnier yeah basically a girdle so
no like I like what do they call them a
compression garment yeah yeah suck all
that stuff in I'm so tired of people
telling me because I have a 370z that I
must be rich you can buy one for 15
thousand dollars dude that's a poor P
now here then here's the thing on the
flip side something's gonna go fifteen
thousand where I come from that's blah
blah blah you could feed a whole team I
Roby you could buy six palaces and a gun
dword and you can go to Switzerland in
fifteen thousand dollars will buy you
like a backpack there's always
relativity right so yeah it's like stop
stop saying blah blah blah that's
expensive to me it's like guess what the
only person who really actually cares
about your perspective is you to be
honest it's come to the conclusion that
there is not a single person on this
planet that just gets a free pass from
the internet like the Internet is just
as a whole
pastor harass everybody for something so
it's like once you accept that it's a
little bit easier to get over it
someone said I met the man became at the
legend Jay is it J'son big boy I want to
change that to chub si-hu BB I'm chub
I'm not think I'm chub job dude I'm fat
pH 80 bet Phe T you're fit little boba
little boba fett mmm neck we know Jai
Simha kills doors lol it's not a race
between Z's Nick just got his Z he's
just starting at that and it's gonna
take him a while to build that up why
does it have to be a race why is it be a
competition it's not it's his car hey as
long as long as we acknowledge the in
the dirt you would just give my my STI
would just decimate you yeah and you
want to even wanna know something in the
dirt everywhere else no in the dirt Nick
would probably beat me too he has played
why I don't know he hopped on he hopped
on project cars right that same track
with the mini like we were doing yeah
and he was like tearing it up right now
granny he was octo water no granny he
was about two seconds behind me on that
tiny track cuz I I ended up pulling out
of 48 the next day okay at 48 second on
that little dirt fish track yeah but he
was like doing 49 s and 50s without even
like really getting a chance to really
get a feel for it and right as he
started getting good like the power trip
the power breaker on my computer tripped
yeah he turned itself off on its own
which I thought was kind of funny I was
like the universe was like nope it
cannot be faster than J is something and
what you don't realize is subliminally
you went over there and kept kicking the
fuse oh the sockets been acting really
weird lately probably get a handyman to
look at him oh look at it okay before
you play I'm gonna loosen the screw on
the back of this
I give credit where credit is due and I
do believe for a fact that Nik is better
than me in the dirt as well let me let
me ask you this though how much ebrake
did he use was it without the ebrake or
the I only really recall him using the
ebrake on a couple of turns and it was
just like grabbing it for like a split
second just to upset the car if he's if
he if he's fast without it that's that's
saying something big done he was a lot
more fluid in connecting those turns
well Toby needed to get a hydraulic II
brake on the 350 now I know right it's
not a hydraulic e brake it's it's just a
hydro brake it's not an e-brake call I
guess you can't use it as an emergency
brake anymore because it doesn't law I
did that once in our in our Durango
because I was going to get the brakes
worked on and in the front and it was
under warranty so I was like I don't
have time to do it myself then front
brakes though were so bad and the place
I had to drive it to was so was about
four miles five miles away I was worried
about damaging the rotors because we
were so metal to metal so I didn't want
to ruin him so I refused to like use the
foot brake so every time I came to a
stop sign or a stop light and I took
side roads right to stay off and you've
seen mine where I live it's not a real
yeah that's not really a way to get off
the beaten path they're all beaten paths
no I was getting to the point where I
was getting real good and it's a foot
brake not a hand brake it's a foot brake
the kind that as you push it down it's
like lick lick lick lick and it locks
and the only way to unlock it is to push
it to the bottom and let it up again you
kind of see where this is going going
yeah I was getting pretty good at timing
it so it was like one click two click
three click like I could progressively
push it to just bring the Durango to a
safe stop at a stop light or a stop sign
let's just say that I forgot when I was
pulling up to a stop sign that I was
dealing with that I was just kind of
like off in la-la land I was actually I
could see the tire shop or the brake
shop where I was gonna be coming up
pulled up to a stop sign and I just I
just push the brake all the way down the
Durango's slides for like a good hundred
feet with the back tires just locked up
through the stop sign just probably it
was the silliest looking thing ever
right the and the thing was like I was I
was sort of panicked steering at that
point I was like oh crap oh crap oh crap
and then I knew he was great but the
thing was I ended up pushing the main
break as
reaction because I was doing with my
left foot and I don't let foot brake
like when I'm driving normally right
right left foot braking a race car or
something but not and when I'm driving
and so I just ended up stomping on the
main breaks to practically smashing my
face against the steering wheel because
now I had the e brake locked and I
smashed the front brakes so I end up
stopping just past the inner just past
the intersection everyone's looking at
me like I am just the stupidest person
on the planet yeah I think I told you
about what I believe the brake master
cylinder in my Ford career right and I
had one of those ones we had to you had
to pull it through the - iracema oh yeah
I have to turn it and pull it yeah yeah
yeah you pull you pull it and it goes it
ratchets just like a pedal doesn't your
truck have one of those yeah actually no
it does you're right it's my Toyota yeah
so so yeah I'm dry I'm driving it on
this road and a deer jumps out in front
of me and I grenade the brakes and the
pedal just goes to the floor luckily I
missed the deer the deer jump another
way but then I realized I had no brakes
so I panicked then I pulled the Hebraic
and it locked it up in my truck just
goes like sideways sideways into the
other lane then back around and then
spins a 180 you know sitting in the
middle of the road luckily it was like
in the middle of the night it was really
dark so there's no other traffic around
but I was like oh then I had no
brakes so I had to get the thing home
and I was still like 30 miles on
backroads from where I lived
mm-hmm so the whole way home I'm just
literally holding the handbrake like
pulling it out just a little bit fell
it's locking on a thing to push the back
you just pretend like you driving a
Cessna yeah literally and when I got
home you could see you could smell the
brakes like the pit the pads were gone
on the back so that was Ben I sold it to
a guy for 250 bucks and he blew the
brake master cylinder after he put new
seals in it the day later bloom went
through an intersection crashed inside
of a brick building yeah so yeah he was
he was he laughed about it though which
I thought was funny I thought he's gonna
be pissed and like it's 250 bucks back
but he thought it was hilarious
fun fact though the video Nick and I
recorded today we actually boat we did a
had nothing to do with the racing sim
but let's just say we ended up having
incorporating a part in that video where
we each saw who could do the fastest
nürnberg lap okay arguably you've got a
little bit more track you've got a
little bit more practice Nick he had so
much practice not every car but we were
doing that in the rain and we did a dry
lab tell me that's which car did you use
salmon as always it was the
Cadillacs 80s VR gt3 you seem that
Cadillac seem to like you a lot
it did I still like the r8 a lot the RMS
but I see but I think the ATS BR gt3 is
my best car on the Nurburgring it's a
bit sale happy in the dryer and it's a
bit tail happy and dry so I have to do
trail brake left foot braking a lot in
the turns just to keep it settled it's
pretty crazy how stuck to the ground
that r8 is it makes me wonder if like
real is that that sticky but you saw it
was like 10 miles per hour slower in the
street because of it no no it is it is
because it was crazy downforce right I
mean cuz those those cars they put all
the crazy wings on them but I kind of
want to drive one now like that not even
like the track GT when I just want to
drive like a road-going 2017 r8 yeah
we're not we're not I'm not a big fan of
how they look though that's my only
thing we're not talking about
oh that's static here we're not talking
my racing guys will tell about project
cars to other cars they like half the
people say is hardcore so him another
half say it's like an arcade game I
don't get why there's such a divide on
that game there's some cars though the
programming on them doesn't seem to be
right but the same can be said for I
racing although I racing is admittedly
better it's way more expensive yeah the
one thing I did notice that I in have
you haven't played for 0-7 yet right No
so four is a seven they get a lot of the
car physics wrong I can tell you that
even just using the controller but the
one car I do want to drive with a wheel
on it is the gt3 RS the Porsche gt3 RS
it seems like whatever they did with the
physics and the car modeling and
everything it handles like a Porsche
should okay like when you're going
around a corner you gotta stab the gas
to get the car to straight now you touch
the brake it just spins and I was like
that's how a real Porsche doesn't I
noticed a lot of games don't seem to get
the Porsche right I know I racing
probably would I haven't done a portion
i racing but i'd imagine i racing since
they do the whole crazy physics model or
whatever would be perfect but project
cars I believe was the one I did the
portion it didn't feel like a Porsche at
all Oh on arse
yeah yeah bond but don't forget the one
that we were driving was the RS r which
is the mid-engine Porsche with rear
steering oh that's right that's right
okay so that's not that's not the true
rear okay that's mid-engine nevermind
it's in front it's on top of the rear
wheels instead of behind them and it
actually has a
an intelligent rear suspension rear
steering yeah because it seems like it
was under steering and doing stuff that
the regular Porsche doesn't so it did
feel like it was strange yeah I didn't
realize I didn't realize was made angel
she makes a lot of sense now because it
wouldn't handle like a freaking 911 then
well we've been streaming right now for
an hour and ten minutes so you know what
that means it's time for what time I
think it's time for anything goes we
kind of been doing that already but I
think anything goes well as long as we
segment and call the segment that valo
matter you have that's why it's called a
segment we have to segue what won't you
kick us off with anything goes there mr.

the tall guy you hang around with tall
people you know otherwise they just keep
asking you to grab stuff from the top
shelf and I'm a little sick of that
that's true that's true
you know usually there's a stack of
stuff on the counter that the wife needs
me to put away because it's in the upper
shelves but then it usually ends up
sitting there for like a week because I
never put it away that's that's why I
married tall girl I'm a husband I don't
I don't put things away my wife's a full
inch taller than me when you think
pretty much of you will be launched do

in another bill well I'm using it in
three builds right now oh I thought
about redoing the skunkworks green with
it but it's not a vibrant enough like it
was what sorry Jamie oats that your
height there's 200 of barn achlys Dix is
it end to end or side to side sorry I
like some self-deprecating hear that

linked ways or with ways I'm thinking
saying lengthwise because I'm like a
soup can dude I used to be they used to
call me tuna can back in the high school
showers the hockey puck hockey yeah my
name that's why they said you puck the
girls I didn't have to wear a con and I
mostly just banged around the outside of
it I'm getting lightheaded from laughing
so hard
oh somebody asked if I liked basketball
dad that is that is profiling
okay this probe is profiling and I know
social profile
I like profiling actually that's cool
that's all good I play basketball for
one season and I sucked at it it's
better than er you get it math what is
something a short person would do cuz
that that'd be funny just walk up to
tall people hey would you like to crawl
under D like to crawl under tables yeah
what do you think what do you think
about horse jockeys do you do you need a
step stool to pee dude that'd be the
funniest ever could you imagine
watching a horse race we're like a bunch
of people your size were the jockeys
it'd make all the horses look like do
you know what I look like next to a
jockey I went to the to the Sen any two
races once for work okay a work thing
and I went to the bathroom and there was
a jockey walking down the hallway I'm
kid you not it was like my it was like
my oldest daughter next to me they're
like yeah they're like little kids no no
I and the funny thing is like they're
like fortunately perfect
Ya Allah Ya Allah that's what I kind of
think of theirs it's and it's not an
easy thing it's not like dwarfism or any
of that stuff
they're like straight up just shrunken
people like it's not like they're just
short they're just they're it's like if
you're if you if you're doing Photoshop
they like ctrl T to grab the corner and
just shrunk the person down like fully
scaled
smaller it was crazy and they can't wait
they can't wait like 80 80 90 pounds
like soaking wet and boy yeah cuz you
wanted to take all the weight off the
horse alright so I wondered that's like
is that like a thing like when you're
born and you're like your stats come
back like that the doctors basically
like your horse jockey like you cou what
are you gonna do in life horse jockey
tell you right now you just you're a
horse jockey okay like what are your
other options I'm trying airline fighter
pilot or no you gotta be tall for that
no no no you there's a max height I
wanted to be a pilot when I was younger
but then I just kept getting taller and
taller and taller you did tell me that
you told me that you were actually
getting your pilot's license at one
point which I was 16 I was studying at
my ppl because I had this idea that I
was gonna be an AV I wanted to be an
f-18 pilot for the Navy and once I hit
six foot those dreams were over you know
what they told me they're like well I
assess that you have to cut cut out of
Hamill hole okay they said I could fly
helicopters wanna fly a helicopter down
were to fly every team yet not a
helicopter at fifteen Tomcat I know that
I as it was coming out I realized that I
was like please nobody catch that I
watched the top I watched that top
gunner show i watch the top gun I know
all about maverick and use the either
died and floated in the water
Iceman he thinks he's dangerous ice
man's a dick that he's gay that was gay
that was a Val Kilmer like Val Kilmer's
prime he all went downhill after that
Val Kilmer like did that and then he was
like bat he was like a bad Batman and
then he disappeared they got fast have
you seen him lately he's really he's put
on so much weight no the other person
was a MacGyver Richard Dean Anderson oh
yeah like his but he didn't get fat his
face just guy huge will he go he lost
his face didn't get big he just lost the
mullet without the mullet is Heather's
me was the proportion but I saw a
picture of him I did not I could not
tell it was him and to reread the
article I was like well body's not
figure nothing just Edgar you just
talked about goose dying in Top Gun and
Swift gaming just yelled spoilers you
haven't seen up gun by now okay when
don't have a VHS play they come on 87
they kind of ate a soul thinking I was
so young when that came out cuz I
remember like the sex scene with Kelly
McGillis
seven I have a really good ability of
naming dates of movies my wife thinks
I'm a freak because I can do that by the
way look up pictures of Kelly McGillis
it came out in 1987 damn I'm good
dude dude if yeah if you ever want to
see like a train wreck look up Kelly
McGillis and Tom Cruise now no no it
like Tom Cruise looks exactly the same
maybe like two years older and Kelly
McGillis looks like she's Mike servants
in 84 no it came out in 87 you stop it
Kent 87 87 87
okay let's see if I can do this so name
a movie like and not some crazy ass
movie like Charlie Charlie Charlie
Chaplin goes to the circus some crazy
that like a fairly newer new where she's
like in the last say 10 or 15 years okay
10 or 15 years how about Waterworld 2001
look it up okay I'm looking it up here
we go to the my mouse doesn't work all
right I'll look I see if I look it up
the nothing they accused of cheating
Waterworld came out Oh was that 95 damn
I was way off
whoa what's that all I know right damn
it doesn't seem like he came out good to
go I wasn't even in high school yet I
could swear I was in high school okay
well there goes that one yeah it's your
ball all right fail what bass ketball
bass ketball
oh that's the one with Jon Heder right
it's got a Napoleon Dynamite guy no no
not him who's gonna be no it's taste
what's the one has the South Park guys
Matt stone the tree part bass ketball 97
maybe okay well that sounds like that
could be right below all it didn't only
your bass ketball
thought okay um if it's basketball there
we go basic basic of all Wikipedia came
out in the game was invented make
humanity one less basket why does it
keep correcting me it's like when did we
type women's basketball came out phase
cat ball it keeps correcting it and
figure did you mean basketball no I
found it okay 1998 Oh would you say year
97 that's pretty good how about Orgazmo
or gastrin I think I've seen this same
guys oh if you haven't seen Orgazmo you
watch that like immediately I haven't
seen her
guys my then so good good we need the
stunt J think you've been charmers
yes I was thinking Benchwarmers cuz that
Rob Schneider and Stefan it yep orgasm
was 1997 so we should show the started
with orgasm no I wouldn't had to date
because III so I told my wife the way I
do this is I retire remember an event
that happened in correlation with women
that movie came out and I'm really good
at events so give me one more okay uh
Team America world please
oh god team America World Police so I
was the puppet movie right yes is that
the first one or the second one first
one 94 no 2004 oh hey I'm will do one
more South Park the thing is I never saw
that movie so let's play what you have
watch well I'll point one for the record
I've not been a huge South Park fan so
those like creators I don't really know
very well okay hold on fighting Napoleon
Dynamite Oh see I was 2004 yes you got
it okay we hear in the background no no
that was the year I start working for
FedEx that's how I knew that
okay how about cannibal the musical I've
never even heard of it what's called
cannibal them you that would just be a
stab in the dark you're about that there
is to Gratz
oh geez any movie kids really like it's
1992
actually this is 2005 it doesn't look
like the animated film oh oh he's about
the Aristocats like the Disney yeah
there is the cat's okay how about how
about this is this one should be easy
Suicide Squad really well so say
whenever risk of cats come out is it 92
okay let's see here hold on I should
like that movie that was a good movie uh
the original one was 1970 not only can I
don't think that's no there's got to be
a newer one since that says we know
Disney readers like all the movie anyway
no yeah it says 1970 I'll be damned did
they just remaster it or something squad
came out in 2016 right yes okay house
dear I came here if it was last year or
the year before it could have been I
still can't believe you haven't seen
orgasm oh dude you were doing
injustice sir I'm sorry if you liked
basketball you will love Orgazmo it
seriously it's it's hilarious I really
sucked at that normally I'm like spot-on
on this another freaky ability I have is
to go buy grocery shopping with the wife
and have a massive cart full of
groceries and then I can usually be
within five dollars of the price before
we check out that's pretty impressive oh
the wife is saying you need to look at
IMDB IMDB is where you find these things
yeah I'm gonna go watch Orgazmo tonight
now after the stream you just forgot it
I guess what in Orgazmo that's why do
they create something called the
rocket that's hilarious
it's literally a strap-on rocket that
they shoot the guy fights crime it's
hilarious just you gotta watch it so
great okay then it's Matt Stone and Trey
Parker like before I think it's a it was
after they did South Park but not by
long so it's still like the old-school
Matt Stone and Trey Parker probably high
on acid next to see you like in they're
the main characters in the movie oh come
on right now they're appropriate hopeful
hustle I don't think I ever saw that one
it's literally the same cast as
BASEketball though mm-hmm so if you saw
it like that yeah the guy that's amazing
appalled they called a little bitch even
has Ron Jeremy in it to you by the way
cheese so ron jeremy does a cameo it's
awesome alright then so so how long is
the future TechTalk gonna be like are we
gonna have a set time or we just gonna
go into whenever I I think it's that
time is the best thing because of family
life so I'm still cool with the
hour-and-a-half show the you know to
5:00 to 6:30 yeah no I'm actually pretty
good with that the only thing that sucks
about us launching it this week we
wanted to do it last Thursday but
literally I we I was working until Jerry
I was like let's just do it next week
it's going the simulator and play games
tonight and then we ended up staying up
till 2:00 in the morning cuz we rebuilt
we rebuilt the steering wheel mechanism
no no we stayed up till 3:00 in the
morning cuz it - you said you were going
to bed and I was going to bed and I
would watch Star Gate in my room and
then you went downstairs like a peds and
watch TV I didn't need piece of it I
watch TV
oh no we eat pizza together that's right
no Ryan but you but you did go you did
go watch TV I remember the next morning
you're like yeah I couldn't sleep so I
went downstairs watch TV I'm like gold 5
you're downstairs watching TV I wasn't
my very much in Stargate yeah
that's funny but if we had done it then
we had two weeks before this Nick
week now we're gonna be off schedule
because of pdx land but we think you
guys think we should do it at PDX
I don't want to try I don't wanna I
can't do it on Wednesday because I have
a guest coming in Wednesday and I'll be
doing some things with liquid nitrogen
on Wednesday so I cannot I can't do
Wednesday
Wednesday's out I think Friday at PDX
land would be fun okay it's gonna be
going actually fun it'll be going up
against win show but I think no it'll
probably later than one show because
what time if we're changing the day we
can change the time too I don't know
what time it does PDX actually open I
think they're like kind of late on the
first day I think but Friday they opened
really early I think it's like 9 or 10
a.m. because by the time I get the
systems in there and get them like
plugged in and and they like to do this
thing where they turn off the internet
when when they're getting ready to start
the event so we can't be streaming
during that what to find out when
they're planning on doing the cuz
because they don't want people just
playing games and not listening to the
announcement so they actually should off
the internet when they get up there with
their microphone I think it's a notice
me senpai power trip thing but whatever
I digress yeah so what to figure that
out but it'll probably in the evening
like 7:00 Pacific yeah I figure what
we'll do is we'll get there let me talk
to Matt he can tell us what so I'll just
say I need a two hour segment where we
have internet and people aren't like
throwing and shutting everything
down yellows but he may not even shut
him down at all so who knows that's true
well good special special just
compensation special compensation yeah
so all right well it's time to go
that was weird yeah it was kind of weird
this is this has been a weird it's been
a weird show but I put I put I put out a
video today we're apparently I copied a
guy I've never seen before and it's okay
I'm gonna upload another shell video of
me just copy and ship for morning
coffees everybody gets mad at and yells
me the comments tells me to stop being
fat and make real content
oh come on all the other twitch stream
gamers put their highlights up on
YouTube no I'm glad bats and I this
one's pretty funny though because I run
the IRS scam against the tech scammer
and like she goes along with it for like
ten minutes that's hilarious
oh my god so you pretended you were a
scammer yeah I call I called him up and
I use accent I'm like I'm gonna yell oh
I am from the press yuo yuo back text
she's like I don't know taxes I pay my
taxes and I just go back and forth her
sheep same send the cops to my house I
don't care it's pretty funny it's a good
one if I upload it it's a good one I the
stupid ones I don't upload ripping off
Linus
tisk yeah everybody's gonna say I was
ripping off was it Louis tech cuz Lou
it's true because Louis tech didn't
start doing the tech supports gaming
stuff which then I thought was hilarious
and I tried it I loved it so not
original idea left to be had gay all
right well I'm shutting her down guys
I'm running the inch of the outro now
and by the way we're gonna I'm gonna
come up with a new intro like graphic
new graphics new everything we're gonna
completely revamp the show but literally
it says because of all the fails today I
didn't have time to do anything so and
we're gonna update my logo notice how we
sell my old burns logo with the 3d
keyboard you have a new one oh yes right
you have the one that looks like the you
ripped off from Breaking Bad Breaking
Bad exactly yeah everything your top not
original idea but I'll leave it I'll
leave it it's finally how she was going
put put a on my head we're gonna go
back to that the old tech talks back
