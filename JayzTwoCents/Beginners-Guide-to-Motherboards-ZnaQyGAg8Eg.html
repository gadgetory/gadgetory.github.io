and I think new buyers who are looking
at building their first computer or even
building another computer but haven't
done so in a while are getting really
caught up and confused on how to choose
the right motherboard and I don't blame
you guys there's a lot of crap on
motherboards with the new silencio
performance optimized fans the cooler
master Neptune 240 M delivers the
perfect balance of noise and performance
click the link in the description to
find out more so over the past couple of
weeks I've done a few how-to by style
videos recently how to buy a power
supply and how to buy a graphics cards
you can find those videos here and here
and you guys have really liked that in
fact you've asked me to do more in fact
you've asked me to do an entire computer
on how to buy when it comes to
understanding what all the crap means
when you're reading the specs so I said
okay we'll do it and today we're gonna
go ahead and take a tour around my Asus
x99 deluxe motherboard because it's got
an awful lot of in it and if you
guys were just looking at the specs on
this you probably would feel upside down
backwards inside out and discombobulated
and have no idea what any of it means so
today hopefully we're gonna solve that
now before we dive into this and I'm
gonna try and make this as non confusing
as possible because there's a lot of
information on this and it's really
difficult to ascertain what's important
and what's not important and my job
today is to try and make you understand
the basics and some of the little more
advanced stuff you'll find on a
motherboard so you can determine whether
or not the motherboard you may be
looking at is overkill for what you need
oftentimes that's the case motherboards
tend to include a lot of candy features
on here that you don't really need which
takes up some of the money into this
when you really should be putting it
somewhere else so hopefully today we're
going to arm you with the information
you need to determine if the motherboard
you're currently considering falls in
that category now when it comes to
motherboards AMD or Intel they're gonna
you're gonna find some parts of the
motherboard that are the same regardless
of the brand now for instance there
gonna have a socket they're all gonna
have RAM slots they're all gonna have
input IO or input and output and they're
all gonna have PCI Express slots per
that's never going to change until the
entire way a computer works changes a
computer works changes that's that's
probably one of the silliest misspeaks
i've had in a while but I think you get
what I'm saying now when it comes to the
socket it means that only CPUs that
match that socket are going to fit so
the x99 here being a 2011 - 3 means only
2011 - 3 socket of CPUs will couple with
this motherboard and work z97 and z87
have 1150 a z77 has 11 56 I believe it
is so before you buy your motherboard
you need to decide what CPU you are
going to run I would not recommend
picking a motherboard first and then
putting a CPU in it that's a little
counterproductive because you need to
know what CPU you're gonna buy first
because quite often those features on
here that will be wasted if you don't
choose the right CPU for instance these
zseries
Intel motherboards like the z97 I have
here or the z97 I have here these in the
z87 I have here these are overclocking
motherboards that is basically what the
Z stands for it's going to give you a
lot of unlocked functionality when it
comes to the motherboard that is going
to be appealing for overclockers so if
you're not gonna be buying an
overclocking CPU it seep CPU that's kind
of a cool one a CPU then you're not
going to need to buy yourself a Z
branded motherboard that's one thing to
keep in mind but on the flip side if
you're gonna be buying some sort of a
Black Edition
AMD CPU or a case Q on the Intel side
which are unlocked overclockable CPUs
you don't want to limit it either by
getting a non overclocking motherboard
so keep that in mind as well now when it
comes to the RAM on modern motherboards
and current gen and even a past couple
of gen motherboards you're gonna notice
that there is only going to be either a
dual channel or a quad channel config
now the x58 platform actually had triple
channel that's an aged obsoleted
platform right now when it comes to
building new equipment you won't be able
to go out and buy an X 58 so we're not
going to talk about that but oftentimes
people get confused on how many RAM
sticks they need and how many channels
they have on their motherboy
because more often than not you're gonna
find that there are more RAM slots and
there are channels for instance this x99
motherboard has eight Ram slots but it
is not an 8 channel motherboard in fact
I'd be pretty damn awesome if it was but
it's not most of the time motherboards
will allow 2 slots per channel that's
why more often than not you're gonna
find a tram slots on x79 and x99
motherboards and you're gonna find 4 Ram
slots on z-series and AMD motherboards
typically like I said they give you 2
Ram slots per channel they do that
because they want you to have
expandability now lower end motherboards
may have only one Ram slot per channel
to try and save on costs or on a low low
end motherboard you might find that
there you might find there's only 2 Ram
slots period it doesn't mean it's a
single channel it just means there's one
Ram slot per channel so you're gonna
want to check the specs on the
motherboard that you're looking at and
see how many channels are available to
it I can pretty much guarantee you will
never find more than 2 channels on a
zseries processor like z97 or a Z series
motherboard I should say and an X series
is always going to be 4 channel maybe in
the future we'll get 6 channel or 8
channel who knows but right now at the
time of making this video that is the
case now here is the part that most
people get confused on and I don't blame
them because it is probably the most
confusing when it comes to specs and
that being the PCI Express slots now
you're gonna find that there are usually
more PCI Express slots then there are
capabilities when it comes to SLI or
crossfire in this case we've got 1 2 3 4
5 PC full-length PCI Express slots
leading most people to believe you could
more than likely put 5 graphics cards in
here but that's not the case I almost
dropped it now here's the skinny when it
comes to graphics cards neither AMD or
Intel support more than 4 Way SLI or
crossfire or quad fire or whatever you
want to call it the extra slots on here
are for peripherals things like SSD PCI
Express SSD cards raid controllers sound
cards things of that nature and what
you're going to notice it that is that
you're going to see PCI Express 16 X 8 X
4 X and
one X now the part that makes people
confuse is you're going to see PCI
Express 3.0 PCI Express 2.0 or referred
to as Gen 2 or Gen 3 and that's going to
make people very confused because
they're gonna notice on their new
graphics cards they're pretty much all
PCI Express 3.0 but if you're building
an AMD system you're gonna see PCI
Express 2.0 as being the supported
architecture here when it comes to the
PCI Express slots and that tends to
freak people out because they go oh my
god my new power my new graphics card
it's not gonna work because the PCI
Express 2.0 and I know they're now I
want to go Andy but it isn't people get
really confused by that they think that
if they go with PCI Express 2.0
motherboard that their PCI Express 3.0
graphics cards are going to be dare I
say bottlenecked no guys it doesn't work
that way PCI Express 2.0 at 16x is the
same bin with this PCI Express 3.0 at 8
X and here's the real kicker most of the
time when you run an SLI or crossfire
config the slot is going to downgrade to
an 8 X anyway skunkworks behind me has
three gtx 980 s in it but did you know
it's actually running 8 X 8 X 16 X 1
card at 16 X the other tube down scaled
to 8 X did that lower my scores and
lower my fps absolutely not so guys
don't get hung up on the PCI Express 2.0
vs. 3.0 thing we are still not maxing
out the bandwidth period even at 16 X
2.0 don't worry about it guys in the
future may become a problem right now
current gen and a few years into the
future it's still not a problem the only
thing you need to know is that there are
4x slots that like this one right here
this would be for a sound card or a
network card or something of that nature
other than that don't get caught up on
it really it's not that big of a deal
now other little things you're gonna
find on here are going to be like USB
3.0 plugs on here for front side USB 3.0
plugs on your case USB 2.0 some
motherboards have onboard reset and
power buttons on there this is useful if
you're going to be putting this in a
test bench like I am in that guy right
there that's a case labs test bench
can't wait to build that out and just
makes it so you don't actually have to
plug in front side panel connectors
which would go under these slots these
little bitty pins got a pain in the ass
to get in there you technically don't
have to plug those in you can control
the motherboard right there a lot of
newer motherboards come with trouble
code readouts right here gives you a
number on there if you have some sort of
an error it'll display a number you go
to the manual you look up the number huh
magic it tells you what's wrong that's
actually really cool some of them have
clear CMOS buttons in red right on the
motherboard makes it simple to clear
your CMOS without having to pop out of
battery because that was the old way
overclockers had to reset and clear
their CMOS was pull out the battery and
do a jumper and wait 10 seconds now you
just push this little fandangled red
button and you're up and running
new overclockers just don't know what we
used to have to deal with back in the
day all motherboards are gonna have a
plethora of SATA ports because SATA
ports are actually becoming obsolete
we have maxed out how fast you can
actually transfer data on SATA port
which is six gigabits per second you're
always gonna want to make sure you plug
in your optical drives your hard drives
anything you're plugging into SATA
always utilize the SATA 6 gigabits per
second some of the older motherboards
still have a three gigabit per second
and six gigabit per second some are
using the chipset some are using built
on controller you're gonna always want
to use the Intel if possible if it's an
Intel motherboard and six gigabit per
second otherwise you could actually be
slowing down your SSDs by half that's
not a good thing some motherboards like
newer motherboards like this or six
gigabit per second only and brand
spanking new motherboards like x99 are
starting to feature PCI Express our CD
SATA Express ports which are for a new
standard of connections for SATA you're
also going to notice something called it
MDOT - and basically that's an
itty-bitty little PCB SSD that mounts
directly to the motherboard
you don't have to run SATA power and a
SATA cable it just hooks right onto the
motherboard in this case there's a slot
right here it stands straight up kind of
like a motherboard boner if you will and
it not necessarily any faster but it is
just a lot more convenient to plug it in
and be up and running with your SSD and
you don't have to change it out or
remote mount it somewhere in your case
now when it comes to the back of the
motherboard they all are gonna have a
different array of input and output this
one happens to have 2 4 6 8 10 PCI
Express 3.0 or SuperSpeed ports has a
BIOS reset right here on the back which
is convenient once again for over
Fockers this one how also happens to
feature a wireless on there and a
built-in audio most motherboards are now
going to include built-in audio PCI
Express 2.0 excuse me you have to be up
to that in the past USB 3.0 and 2.0 for
backwards compatibility and Ethernet
cards on there what's gonna vary is the
amount of ports you have for USB 3.0 and
2.0 how many Ethernet you may or may not
have a BIOS clear button on the back but
again those things are all gonna vary
based on the level of where the
motherboard sits on the tier the higher
the tier the more stuff you're gonna
have so guys that's pretty much it my
computer went to sleep so I guess that
means it's time to start ending the
video and actually that has nothing to
do with the video I'm yeah I just kind
of toss that out there so hopefully this
has helped you guys understand
motherboards what all the stuff means
and you guys can already see if you're
not gonna be plugging in 2 4 6 8 10 SATA
ports optical drives hard drives SSDs
and you know you can save some cost by
finding a motherboard that has other
features you need but don't have as many
of those SATA ports maybe you're only
gonna be wanting one running one
graphics card so you don't need 5 PCI
Express slots with a PCI Express 4 so
giving you 6 PCI Express slots I'd be a
little overkill right so guys hope this
videos helped you in some way I hope
it's basically simplified some of the
stuff for you as always we got a pretty
decent community following this channel
and some very knowledgeable people who
are fans of this channel who are always
willing to help down in the comment
section if you're one of those people I
greatly thank you for that I'm only one
person I cannot get to even a fraction
of the comments that this channel gets
so I deeply am showing gratitude to you
guys for helping out all of the newbies
down in the comments who genuinely need
your help keep it up guys it's almost
like a really cool community that I
should almost have a forum or something
going huh sad part is I do at Jay's
$0.02 calm
been too lazy to be able to keep the
website going but it is a work in
progress guys I'm working on it once
again guys thanks for watching today's
video
follow on Twitter if you have any
questions put any topics you guys would
like me to cover down in the comments
and we're gonna keep this whole how-to
by series alive we're gonna do how to
buy a CP you already did how to buy a
graphics card how to buy a power supply
we're gonna talk about how to buy I
guess SSDs and things like that we're
gonna cover the entire computer in this
series guys so as always thank you so
much for watching you guys make this
channel pretty awesome to keep working
on I love doing videos for you guys as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
