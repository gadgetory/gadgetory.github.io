learn more what is going on everybody
Jays two cents here and it's been a
while since we've taken a look at this
guy in fact I bet some of you have no
idea what this is this is my project
parvum build
now I didn't come up with the name
parvum that's the name of the brand of
the case and this is made by a couple of
gentlemen out in England and the cool
thing about these guys is you can do
anything you want you send them a design
and they can make it and we started
putting this thing together months ago
in fact long before skunkworks 3.0 was
even in planning stages but we decided
we want to do a custom front panel on
this to kind of showcase some of their
work and unfortunately it took the
United States Post Office and the UK
Royal post or whatever it's called two
months to deliver this well now that the
panel's have come we can go ahead and
show you guys some of the custom work
now this is what comes on this
particular part of them which is the vir
2.0 and you can see it has the parvum
logo right there and I told them I said
you know the parvum logo is nice and all
but why don't we do something custom
well what we came up with is the arc
reactor especially with the Avengers to
be an out age of Ultron fairy let's go
ahead and do something kind of I don't
know maybe a little bit tribute to that
and we decided to come up with this
custom front piece here that is kind of
looks like the arc reactor now this it's
frosted acrylic with black acrylic with
Clear Creek I don't even know how they
do this my mind doesn't even comprehend
how they do this level of work now
really this is just part two of the
build log technically so we're going to
do some work on this today I've got to
sleep the pump I've got to do some I've
got to fix the front power button wire I
actually broke that oops the build is
not done hopefully by the end of the day
they'll have fluid in this and then
again in the future we'll do some
benchmarks and stuff on this thing so
let's go ahead and get to work
you
you
you
it may not seem like I've done an awful
lot today but I've spent over eight
hours on this build today I mean with
his cables leaving we've finished up all
the wiring we added some LEDs in there
we got the loop filled and all in all
the Parvin build came together as well
as I thought it possibly could now when
I initially built this the system I had
in mind this thing being my portable
land built but the more I've built in
this thing I think I've come to the
conclusion that this is a case best
suited for sitting on a desk and not
really moving the fact that it's acrylic
makes me one never confident in shipping
this thing anywhere simply because it's
just not going to be as robust and
sturdy as say something made out of
aluminum or steel to the edges on this
thing are extremely sharp in fact
everything is so sharp on the corners it
scratched all of my desks up anywhere it
touched it scratched and that's
unfortunate but that's just the way it
is in fact the instructions on the part
of K that come to the carbon case before
you build it even tell you be careful
because you can cut yourself you'll
scratch your desk etc I don't care that
it scratched these desks one because
they're kind of like work tables for me
and two when I redid the office I
changed all of my desks from black to
this beach color because scratches won't
show up but if you had a black desk or a
glass desk or something like that you
would probably be kind of pissed so
unless you're gonna take sandpaper and
like sand down all the edges or file
them down and make them smooth or do
like I did on the bottom here where I
kind of added these felt feet as you can
see uh yeah I'm not this probably will
not stay as a dedicated land rig so
that's unfortunate simply because I
don't think traveling with this case is
going to be very practical but something
like sitting on your desk or maybe a
home theater box or something like that
or just a small form-factor build this
thing is fantastic you can see we
crammed a lot of stuff in there like a
whole bunch of stuff in there the fact
that you can get this in custom ordered
with any of the
designs that you want on the front I
mean literally all I sent them was just
a flat file it was just it was just the
black part that you see the other part
that they came up with the inserting of
the frost acrylic and then the polished
acrylic around it and if I had a
perfectly you know suited backlight for
this it would glow look fantastic
but unfortunately I don't have any
lighting that I can put behind there the
wiring on this thing I have to say as
you can see the wiring in my case here
no pun intended was very specific in
fact I had all of these cables
custom-made once again through sanctum
sleeving because those guys just
continued to hook me up with awesome
sleeves and I had to do all the
measuring first and then give them
measurements and then they built them to
suit trying to fit standard length
cables in here not going to happen so
there's just a lot of things about this
case that really is suited towards the
experienced enthusiast builder I knew
going into this that standard length
case our K PSU cables would not have fit
so something else you need to keep in
mind I was concerned about the way the
hard drives dangle like this but you
know what they are really robust they're
not going anywhere because they only
attach with two screws hanging down
they're not going anywhere so I'm not
worried about that at all this is not a
quiet case this case right here only has
four fans in it it has three 120
millimeter fans one intake on the front
120 to exhaust 120 s on the top and an
80 millimeter bringing air in from the
back so this is not a quiet form factor
in fact I'll go ahead and turn it on for
you now so that you can hear it or I had
to turn on the power supply here it's
going to restart to the VGA thing Asus
does it too
yes you can hear it's not quiet I am
going to have the fans controlled
through pwm splitter from Swift Tech
that's an eighth fan header pwm splitter
it's just right now because the system
isn't fully booting since there's no
keyboard or anything installed it's not
actually making it past post and so it's
not ramping down the fan speed but it
will be a little bit quieter it's just
while gaming and stuff it will be a
noisy case there's just no way around
that simply because of the fact that
there is so much crammed into such a
small space there were a lot of
questions I got when I started posting
pictures of this early on asking how the
hell I was going to fill this thing
because of the fact that the reservoir
is at the bottom and sideways but as you
saw all you going to do is flip the case
up right and then it fills up like any
other standard reservoir but there you
go guys that's the parvum build it looks
amazing you can get the case in all
sorts of different colors there's been a
lot of very very well-documented popular
builds done by parvum they come in all
sorts of different sizes this is their
smallest one the veer 2.0 you can get
them in micro ATX size know ATX yet I
believe they're going to be doing an ATX
in the future but this is the micro I or
mini ITX and I mean when it comes to
specs it's got a GTX 970 g1 gaming by
gigabyte water cooled by ek it's got 16
gigs of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM
running at 1866 we've got on 4790k
made it up with an EVGA z97 stinger all
sorts of water cooling stuff in here and
then we've got two of the white edition
GTS nemesis radiators from hardware labs
so actually the same radiators that are
in skunkworks it's just there a 240 and
a 120 version and that's more than
enough cooling for the hardware that's
in here now so there you go tell me what
you guys think another build here you
guys are absolutely fantastic for
watching these videos because it enables
me to be able to do these amazing builds
companies send me this stuff to see hey
what can you come up with and this is
what we came up with here so thanks for
watching guys follow on Facebook or
Twitter or any of that stuff
for Instagram there was a lot of
behind-the-scenes pictures going up of
this thing as it happens on Instagram
because I tend to be a little bit of an
Instagram whore at least I'm not a
hipster so all right well once again
thank you to all the sponsors
performance pcs for supplying all of the
water-cooling stuff and like I've
already said we cannot do this without
you guys so you guys get the biggest
thank-you of all thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
