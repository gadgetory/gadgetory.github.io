insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strapped in with j's two cents as he
takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys Jace to cincy are still
hanging out at the AMD tent here at CES
2014 now we just took a look at the
kaveri apu on a desktop type situation
but maybe you're a mobile gamer maybe
you earn a situation where you have to
have a laptop but you want to get the
best gaming performance as you can as
well and you just want to go extreme
well AMD has unveiled the m2 90 x which
is a discrete graphics card for mobile
gaming or mobile laptops we're looking
at an msi unit right here it's the msi
gx7 t which features such discrete
graphics now they have a demo here with
three times 100 and 1080p monitors here
featuring battlefield 4 now it is very
very smooth in fact it's kind of hard to
talk and play at the same time but I've
been watching people play on this
watching for any stuttering or any kind
of freezing and considering the fact
that it's a single mobile GPU that is
pumping out 3 1080p monitors at a
resolution or settings let's see what
the settings are they have on this yeah
we've got this on a mixture of between
high and medium settings for 3 x 1080p
monitors now if Emma sighs not your
brand you're not looking for msi laptop
it is available on the alienware m17
which is shipping with that as well and
they did tell me that it's going to be
shipping with a few other brands coming
out here in the near future and I'm
assume that we're going to see followed
suit of maybe a mobile 280x maybe 270x
over time but if you're looking for
extreme mobile graphics the M 290x from
AMD is really going to be a game-changer
make sure you check it out and guys
follow us on Twitter for all of our
coverage you know what I'm going to say
anyways I'll see you guys next time here
at the AMD event in CES 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
