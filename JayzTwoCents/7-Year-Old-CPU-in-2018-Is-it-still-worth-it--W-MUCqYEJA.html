should you upgrade or is it the right
time to buy I'm gonna talk to you
specifically the long-term user of AMD
FX holding out for every last bit of
performance you can get out of that
system before you were forced to upgrade
your motherboard your processor and your
memory unfortunately memory and ddr4 is
gonna be the expensive part of your
upgrade so what I have right here is
actually an FX 83-70 system they have
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz I have 16
gigabytes of 1866 Corsair Vengeance Ram
I almost forgot a lesson
vengeance lines been a while since I've
used this Ram all running on an asrock a
970 chipset motherboard and a gtx 1070
yeah something that's a little bit
mismatched but considering the fact that
FX is now 7 years old POW driver itself
isn't but the whole architecture which
it's based on is 7 years old that's
ancient
in terms of PC time so we're gonna see
whether or not that can actually hold up
to today's modern titles whether or not
you have finally hit the end of the road
like a bad crash test dummy and an
Institute of Highway Safety crash test I
could say you piled drived into the end
of that wall
ms:i brings ultra-thin gaming to life at
their new GS 65 stealth the four point
nine millimeter bezel 144 Hertz 1080p
panel nvidia graphics and 8th gen intel
cpus make the new GS 65 self a true
powerhouse with a small footprint find
out more by following the link in the
description below now you know that this
is a named EF x based system because it
says so right on the desktop it's not
like I went to Google and downloaded
that or anything so you can take my word
for it no just kidding here is the
actual proof we are using as you can see
right here AMD FX 8350 8 core processor
we're not going to talk about the debate
of whether or not this is truly an 8
core processor or a 4 core processor
because there are 4 core modules in
there with 2 cores per module as shared
cache but that's besides the point we
are currently running at shows 4 point 3
5 gigahertz it is set to as you can see
4 point 4 but that's because the bus B
always fluctuates a little bit so we are
running performance mode 4 point 3 5 and
we are air-cooled on a cooler master
hyper style cooler it's not a hyper 212
I remember what it is but that's besides
the point and you can see our 10 7 in
there so we're gonna start off here with
just a CPU test let's see how things
fair on Cinebench I'm expecting it to be
below or right around the 3770 may be
slightly above because which you have to
keep in mind if you're running the 43 or
the 83 70 this is actually a slightly
improved it came out a few years after
the 8350 this is a higher core clock a
little bit better performance but it's
it's the exact same core architecture
there's nothing different about it the
same level of care the same amount of
cache it's identical to 18350 just
better clocks and a little bit better
efficiency so it is of course unlocked
which is why we're running at 4.4 but
you can see just how long this test is
taking right now that it is certainly
showing its age now look at that right
above a 37 70 kind of where I said it
might be a little below or a little bub
there it is right there 689 so you can
already see that this CPU overclocked
and yes we're doing overclocking to be
fair because it's oh it is unlocked of
course take advantage of that and - I am
an advocate for overclocking we want to
see
see if you can get more out of the CPU
based on its longevity all factors
should be considered overclocking is one
of them but this puts it right in line
with a 2012 ish Intel CPU so definitely
competes at its era which is good
now what about something like 3d mark
yeah we'll go ahead and check out 3d
mark we'll just do a regular old-time
spy now we kind of had a little bit of a
discussion here offline or off-camera
before we started this video about
whether or not I should be testing in
1080p or 1440 or 4k and what I tend to
have just kind of sampled with my own
viewers of people that are still on FX
is very few people if any are actually
running 4k panels with an FX processor
so that's why we're running fire strike
normal right here but as you can see our
GPU is sitting at 97 percent utilized
2000 megahertz so it overclocked itself
our temperatures are looking pretty good
and you can see our CPU usage at least
in 3d mark it's a couple of cores are
not really being utilized
but because we're seeing 97% usage on
the GPU and not a hundred percent used
to join any of the CPU cores that means
we are effectively at least in this
synthetic benchmark we are not CPU
limited we're not bottlenecking our GPU
with our CPU now the CPU test is
obviously we're gonna see the biggest
difference between modern CPUs at only
26 25 fps modern CPUs even like for corn
on hyper-threaded CPUs on Intel or even
Rison for corn on simultaneous
multi-threading because you know not
hyper it's simultaneous would see
probably a higher FPS than that probably
somewhere in the 30s or 40s so that's
just its age and it's terrible
instructions per clock for its era
that's making that test really kind of
suck so our final combined score was a
ten thousand nine hundred and forty six
not terrible not nothing to write home
about you can see our graphics core is
actually decent at an eighteen thousand
five sixty five that is probably ever so
slightly below where we were seeing this
when we were doing our initial 1070
testing when Pascal first launched two
years ago so I don't it obviously in
this test we weren't really seeing the
GPU be limited by the CPU but if we can
compare our results on line right there
we are
in the upper half not quite a 4k gaming
PC but we're better than a gaming laptop
hey Wow
that's depressing so Phil had a pretty
good point that he wanted to make and
we're gonna go ahead and test this now
is he thinks that with the far cry 5
being heavily multi-threaded that
actually benefits older hardware like
the FX that took place before gaming
multi-threading was really a thing so
this might actually be leveraging the
horsepower of an older GPU better than
modern games that aren't multi-threaded
and are relying heavily on core clock
and IPC's so what we were going to check
here is I went online and I found an
article by kit guru where they actually
took far cry 5 and 1080p when ultra
settings no AAA and no motion blur so if
you recall and they did that with a 7700
K by the way overclocked to 4.8 and what
we're gonna be checking here is to see
if we come anywhere near the 7700 K with
the 1070 so they have a 1070 founders
we're using the GeForce for the win for
the win - I believe is well you guys
actually as you saw goes up over 2000
megahertz when it's being fully utilized
so we're gonna see if we come anywhere
near that so our settings are matching
anti-aliasing is off motion blur is off
and we are in ultra so let's go and run
this benchmark so as you can see by
taking off some of the AAA settings and
motion blur asking the CPU to handle
higher frame rates our GPU is definitely
being bottlenecks that is a bottleneck
61 percentage 33 or 63 percent 70
percent it's not in the 90s until the
very end right here where it jumps up it
is certainly being bottleneck the
question is how far away is it kick guru
on a 10 70 founders Edition card on a 77
100 K running 4.8 gigahertz got an
average of 90 4.7 FPS so it's pretty
obvious this graphics card is being
bottlenecked by well the FX 83-70
overclocked to 4.4 we're going to test
battlefield 5 this was kind of a long
long winded roundabout way of getting to
test this and this is what actually kind
of triggered today's video about whether
or not FX is still worth it because
battlefield 5 is an open beta so we're
gonna test this in open beta it's
important to know that
this is not a finished game there could
still be some optimizations or probably
still will be game ready drivers for
NVIDIA that are coming out when the game
fully launches we obviously know in
battlefield 5 as part of our TX with
global illumination and obviously it has
HDR involved as well as rate racing and
all that stuff so that's a whole
different discussion for another day the
reason why I did this is when I looked
at battlefield 5 minimum system specs
they're saying they mirror that a
battlefield 1 because it's the same
exact engine but check this out they
recommend an AMD FX 6350 or an Intel
Core i5 6600 k if you compare the FX
6350 which is a 6 core 6 thread CPU to
the i5 6600 K which is 6 Gen Intel 4
core no hyper threading the 6600 K
decimates the 6350 in every single test
so I find it really interesting that
dice went with the 63 50 or 60 600
because I know there are other GPU or
CPUs out there that better mirror the
6600 so I feel like they're being very
laxed on FX or in our AMD and a little
bit more demanding on Intel which is
surprising so obviously we are running
this game now above the minimum
requirements which we are hoping is
going to give us a decent gaming
experience we are just pegged at a
hundred percent usage the frame rates
not bad I mean it's in the 80s but I
reason why I'm flying is because this is
kind of asking a lot of the CPU right
but there's lots of stutters you see
that in the graph at the bottom of those
dips do the FPS though like you're right
it's great but I think that a hundred
percent utilization might have been one
of his nope when I point back at the
players it goes back to 100
all right so heavy CPU utilization but
overall it doesn't really seem to be
affecting our game so let's get down on
the ground now let me bail out of this
ok lay this down the ground though 50 47
46 50 - wow this is bad
yeah we are definitely seeing a little
bottle linking here's the thing if we
turn the settings down that's only gonna
make it worse
because what happens when your CPU
limited is to lower the settings the
more you're asking of your CPU because
the GPU sends more frames per second and
if it already can't handle what the GPU
sending it something more is not gonna
be a good thing we're definitely seeing
a bit of bottleneck in here now there's
two ways you could kind of combat this
if you are not able to leave your your
FX platform let's just say money is Noah
is not an option well you can hopefully
not pair it with a TENS evety right if
you're if you've got a high end GPU like
this that you're pushing all of these
frames that is harder on your CPU now if
I was to put something in here like a
960 or 950 or even like a 1050 Ti we
would probably see less CPU utilization
right around the same FPS because it
comes to a point where your GPU is too
fast for your CPU so you get the GPU
performance down to match where your CPU
is then you're not bottleneck in so what
you have right here is essentially the
same gaming experience you could have on
a lower end GPU but with wasted money
that cost more than that G that lower
GPU would be that you're not getting any
benefit of at least in this game because
of the way that it is currently being
optimized now again this could be
because it's beta as many reasons this
could be so that was just kind of a
quick look here at how FX is performing
with some modern titles here in 2018 no
surprise there is definitely
bottlenecking involved there was a
discussion about bottlenecking being a
thing back in 2011 when these CPUs were
new so the general consensus would be if
you can upgrade now is the time to do it
but before you do that make sure you
look at my last upload where I talked
about some things to consider before you
upgrade if you're coming from the FX
platform you're pretty much going to be
looking at a complete upgrade we're
talking motherboard CPU and memory
because remember the new CPUs are all
using ddr4 so anyway yeah if you guys
are running an FX system why don't you
put your specs in the comments below and
let people know what games you play and
what kind of FPS you get with what
settings anyway guys we're gonna go
thanks for watching obviously we've got
more content coming in the near future
here and as the new platforms launch we
will be testing those as well because
the fall of q4 of 2018 are looking like
a pretty
good time for PC enthusiasts to build a
new computer with that I'm gonna go
thanks for watching as always we'll see
you in the next one and I can't wait to
get back in bed off of five and suck
some more when it's when it's fully
released though I don't really like the
beta's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
