it's time to start the official skunk
works building blog you know how you
know it's time my hair is jacked up and
I haven't shaved and I just realized
that every single vlog I've ever done
for skunk works in the history has
included messed up hair and terrible
unshaven face maybe that's just because
I get so stressed out when I'm get ready
to do this I just stopped shaving
whatevs
with its specifically tuned copper base
and maintenance-free plug-and-play
operations the EVGA 980ti hybrid offers
ultra-fast gaming performance at the
lowest temperatures possible click the
link in the description for more details
so even though gigabyte says they pre
tested this I had to pre test it myself
and this is going to freak some people
out I actually have my 5820k in here
technically I'll go into that for a
second but there's no fluid in there you
can see that tubes are open and this
freaks people out cuz look what I'm
about to do I'm about to be like BAM no
coolant and I'm turning on this thing
we're doing a we're doing a boot test
obviously to make sure things are going
to work we want to make sure we get some
sort of a video signal here x99 takes
extraordinarily long to turn on see what
happens - oh we got a blue light we got
a blue light and a little cursor thingy
should go to BIOS BAM yeah
no coolant no nothing in there and it
works just fine you can do it for a few
you could do that for like a few seconds
like I just did to make sure things work
what's funny is I did this already
before the video I touched the back of
the socket thinking maybe it was gonna
be really hot because you know if you
did this on like a 4790k or 4770k what a
thermal shutdown in the time that that
took but no it's all still cold so
amazing that that block with the epoxy
that's used on the enthusiast chipset
like the 5820k that's in there right now
actually has enough heat transfer to
there you could turn on the system but
here's the other thing that I find
amazing is I thought that chip was bad I
thought that chip was bad because it
wouldn't boot
my MSI motherboard but turned out the
MSI motherboard was bad and it wouldn't
boot with any of the other it but it
would only boot with one Ram stick in
the MSI board and I thought maybe the
memory controller inside the CPU went
bags I put two three or four in there it
wouldn't boot only if I had one but we
just booted right now with 32 gigs of
ram and all four channels occupied so
that means I have another working x99
CPU yes who knows what I'm gonna do with
that but obviously I'm not going to
leave the 5820k in there that was just
for the test boot everything is still
assembled in here so we're gonna do
today we're gonna get this guy taken
apart we're gonna drained we are gonna
take the blocks out of there I'm going
to open up one of them and inspect and
see if it was getting plugged which I
think might have been happening because
my GPU temps were getting hotter and
hotter and hotter as the fluid was
turning more into like a like a REIT a
ol color of beer but anyway that's what
were going to do so I've got to take
this thing back apart now get the block
off of here because with these rigid
tubes actually little bit of work
involved to get the block off and then
get my 59 60 X in there in any way it
works yes it's another rainy day here in
Southern California
we've already had more rain in the last
month and we've had in like the last
year that's because of that there and El
Nino
you can see news even is mo so sad and
wet in the rain hmm smear possible drive
this car in the rain maybe we'll be like
yeah it's fun to drive into me you know
sideways and stuff yeah that's true but
I also don't want to end up as one of
those idiots on YouTube who curbs their
car because I haven't necessarily become
the best drifter in the world but yeah
this is kind of neat this is called
water
you can think that they're El Nina for
the weather and I think that's why it's
also been so hot down in Australia
because as the weather heats up in the
Pacific Ocean the water heats up it gets
hotter down south so sorry to all yo
Down Under and that's what she looks
like without the lights on in there
that's just how nasty this is and you
know a lot of people sent me pictures
and links on forums showing me how so
many people have had this happen to
their pastel loops and you can see how
much of its like fallen out so you can
like see through that you're not
supposed to be able to see through that
but even the top even the main loop
change a little bit of color to it just
has to do with the reaction of some of
the metals and if you guys remember when
I did this build it was the same color
as the fan rings I just has to do with
reaction to the metals and temperatures
and stuff and I'm not sold on the pastel
anymore I won't use it I will recommend
it and I think just regular regular
water based and pre-mixed coolants or
all you need enough of this pastel
enough of this nano fluid stuff anyway
when it comes to draining the loop all I
do is take off the top well I first I
screw in this tube here into my valve
and you can see right now I've already
drained it I kind of forgot to hit
record oops
anyway look how nasty that is but then I
have this just going into a bowl there
take off one of the top ports because
member you have to let air in for the
fluid to get out you have to refill this
volume with something you can't create a
vacuum in there and then you turn the
valve this is closed this is open and
then literally everything from the loop
just runs out into here look at this
look how gross this is this is how it
more looks to my eye right there this
very shitty brown color that and this
was the loop that looked better wait
till you see what this is going to look
like when it comes out this is why I'm
done with this Nano fluid I'm done with
you so done with you I've read some
comments too about people saying wow
your systems dustier than I thought it
would be this is the exhaust fans for
the 280 that's on the back side of
skunkworks if you couldn't tell guys I
live in the desert okay there's there's
no there's no dust filters on case labs
cases I've never read
fitted any to them and this is this is
just what you deal with and I don't sit
here and clean my system constantly I
keep the front as clean as I can but
even intake fans on the front are pretty
dirty and every time I take the system
apart I take the opportunity to try and
clean up you know some of that does but
this is what you deal with the PCs and
if anyone's going to say their system
isn't dusty either then you're just a
liar there's a flat-out liar okay so
this is another reason why I'm done with
the pastels and why I think my blocks
are clogging for the CPU do you see that
that crud every time I've ever used
pastel and drain the loop and drain the
system I've seen this stuff build up on
the o-rings and inside the fittings so
if it's building up in these free flow
areas what on earth is it doing inside
the nice tight blocks in there where you
have small micro channels to go through
when the system is done and put back
together I'll I'll tear these at least
one of them apart and take a look Walter
them all apart me to clean them but yeah
that's why I got new blocks because this
is what you get so if you're using
pastel I don't want to scare you but
this is probably happening inside your
loop okay so this is where we're at some
more the fluid that was hiding me on the
radiators and stuff you never get it all
out random stuff so the system is
completely torn down got to clean the
radiators of course got to paint the fan
rings I need to flush these radiators I
don't want any of this or this Nano
stuff but clean up the pump tops because
it's got all that crud in there from the
Nano fluids which is absolutely terrible
it's just getting worse and worse and
this has only been in here since mam
when did I eight when did I drain and
fill my loop last there's just this
summer only a few months and this is
what it looks like absolutely terrible
I've also got to clean out the
reservoirs you know because they've got
a lot of this crap stuck to it down in
there you can kind of see it's just it's
just a nasty situation all around
so that's what's next that's what we do
next we clean we clean clean clean clean
so I don't want to put new fluid in
there and get it contaminated with this
crud such crap I already started
cleaning out some of that I mean you can
see just the amount of crud that is been
building up on the o-rings and stuff it
will focus
it's just not good whatever it's not
focusing I don't care I shouldn't have
to do too many more bends when we get
the motherboard in her soon transfer
over the CPU and get the block back on
and this isn't this isn't a lot of work
I guess it kind of looks like a lot of
work but it's really not it only took me
about 45 minutes to tear this down in
about another hour and a half to five
with people on Twitter but anyway I will
I keep going now so far we can get today
it is two days before Christmas so
sleeping it can get done all right so I
cleaned out the reservoir as I clean the
radiators they're actually in my dish
rack in the sink drying I stopped the
dust-up down there but you see the
system is pretty much nearly completely
gutted I just didn't take out the pumps
because they're wired in through the
back wall and I can actually get those
out yeah forethought right anyway I
might have put some sort of a junction
block or a molex or something back there
to actually be able to unplug them
hindsight anyway then I saw this powdery
substance on the table and I thought
well geez haven't done cocaine in a
while that's a joke guys it's joke and
I'm going what is this powdery stuff it
turns out that that white gunk I was
showing you that bill that was building
up on here when it dries it actually
turns very very thick and powder your
watch I show you the spike and actually
get the camera to focus here I can like
see that so these are presumably the
nanoparticles I think just yeah I mean
it looks nice but it's just not worth
the hassle as far as I'm concerned other
thing I want to keep in mind too is you
definitely are not going to want to
reuse any of the old tubing this is the
soft tubing a head down the bottom I'm
going to be putting new tygon tubing
down in there the reason why I don't do
hard tubing down here is I have a
radiator on this side and a radiator on
this side and there's no way for me to
get my hand in there and connect the two
together um not to mention have a you
know have a pipe that goes from there to
down into the radiator I mean I could
try it but it just would be a much
bigger hassle than it's worth and I've
run the soft tubing in the past with
acrylic or a ptg and not had any
problems so
I I don't know but anyway I'm also
changing out this plate on the front
here for a vented one because this gets
really really hot down here when I'm
gaming because of the three type Nexus
so I'll be putting a vent in there to
help with airflow by about putting an
intake fan on here to to get more cool
air in here so that the 280 isn't just
sucking in hot air from the 560 even
though it is hot air it's still going to
be providing a cooling benefit but when
the radiator is right here there's no
more room for a fan mount so that's kind
of sucky so this is the front vent a
special front vent here that case lab is
made for me but unfortunately it doesn't
look like I'm going to be able to use it
the reason for that is this little 5a
quarter-sized one is being blocked by
the mid plate and I'm not taking that
mid played out in order to just get this
front thing on I kind of want it on
there for that extra ventilation but at
the same time I don't want to
disassemble this whole case and try and
finagle this thing out I've done it
before it's not that hard I just don't
want to really don't want to go through
all that anyway I guess I'll go ahead
and skip that piece for now it's
unfortunate I thought I could get this
out when I'm gonna take the mid plate
out but that's not that's not possible
at all damn it well I might not look any
different but I just swapped out the 59
60 X in there to the 80 58 20 out of
there and now we're all ready to go yes
that sucks with it rainy as I painted
the fan rings but obviously it's gonna
take forever to dry so here's my three
Titan exits right there time to take
those blocks off put the nickel-plated
plexi fronts on there as well as the
nickel-plated crystal link fittings on
there so everything is nice and blingy I
went with the nickel plating like this
because I think I've always liked the
way orange and nickel plating looks I
think it's going to look real good with
the nice reflection on there it's going
to help light bounce around a bit and
since we were forced to go with the
nickel plexi blocks for the champion
board because it's the only color they
make right now I think it's a pretty
good accent some folks didn't like it I
do that's most important and I think it
looks great on there so the fan rings
like I said they're drying might
actually warm up the oven to about a
hundred and maybe a hundred fifty
degrees stick them in there
them kind of cure a little bit you can
do that actually to keep the temperature
low enough so they don't melt but yeah
what it's time to do now is get those
blocks on there and then we can get the
graphics cards mounted up here and
that's a nice thing about the case labs
case is you know with the removable tray
and you can work on it outside of the
case while the case is somewhere else in
the room taking up all the space
all right so those are three graphics
cards sitting in there get all the
blocks swapped out I still think it
would have been really neat if I went
with nickel plated back plates I don't
know I mean it would have created more
light reflection in there would have
also added to the orange you could have
probably seen the actual fluid back
reflecting off the back plate from the
block above because remember you're not
going to really see it from this angle
you're going to see it more from that
angle I don't think it looks too bad
though not a whole lot left to do really
it's time to get the fittings put in
here the bits power multi links in
between here with the chrome fittings
change out all the chrome fittings on
the radiators and stuff and start put it
all back together and put the the wiring
in don't think I'm gonna get it done
tonight we're heading to Disneyland
tomorrow with the family my sister and
her family is back in town so I'm taking
everyone to Disneyland and I don't think
this is going to get done until after
Christmas oh well I will see how much
father I get tonight but right now it's
time to take a break and get some food
so here's what the radiators look like
this was the dirty side of all the
radiators and as you can see they come
clean pretty nicely I literally just run
them under the sink with like a pressure
nozzle and I just let them dry or I'll
set them on top of a fan let air blow
through them to dry them off still a
little bit of water in them I'm not
gonna be powering up the system tonight
so I want to worried about it but yeah
radiators are all nice and clean here
are the fans over here fans are all nice
and clean same thing I just used this
spray bottle I literally will spritz the
fan and then use a microfiber to wipe
them all down so all of the dust and
stuff is gone it's like spring cleaning
at the same time alright this is where
I'm stopping I got quite a bit done
today but not as far as I wanted to I
just put the 24 pin in there
so that whoa
okay wobbly there just so that way I can
kind of see how the color looks I heard
some folks complain like oh those cones
look bad blah blah blah remember guys
combs are just about training the cables
not necessarily leaving them in place
full time eventually I'll be able to
move those comes and then the cables
won't show or the cones won't show at
all but the cable will be nice and
trained those cables were courtesy of
blue TRO customs thank you for that you
see I painted the fan rings are far from
perfect though there's some chips on
some of them I've got a touch-up that's
due to the rain really messing up my
painting schedule today got all the
chrome fittings on there as you can see
a comp chrome they're actually nickel
plated I got the nickel plated fittings
on there that tube and the GPU tubes are
unchanged but I do have to do a new tube
that goes from CPU pump output into that
guy right there
that's the inlet for the chipset block
then it goes to the CPU then it goes out
of the CPU into the vrm then out of
there into that fitting inside the
radiator so I just do those two bends
and then we'll be good some folks have
asked me about the input or the inlet
going into the chipset then the CPU and
then the BRM and why the CPU isn't first
because for the thousandth time it
doesn't matter what order you put it in
the loop is going to pretty much
stabilize the temperature all the way
across you're going to have very little
temperature difference between the inlet
of the radiator and the outlet of the
radiator the radiator is going to keep
the temperature as a whole
fairly stabilized this isn't like a car
where you have very hot temperature
going into the radiator and much much
cooler temperature coming out of it and
also being regulated by a thermostat
this is this is not a car it's not the
same physics because we're not dealing
with those extreme temperatures so
that's not going to matter it's the same
reason why I have no problems running
parallel for my three graphics card so
it's never been a problem but you can
see it's not as much orange as some
people were afraid there was going to be
you see the orange in the front right
there and then these are the radiators
or there's the 280 and the 560 I think
just enough and once I get the hue
lighting in there I'll be able to adjust
the white balance inside there if I want
to do white light but not that hyper
white like you get with the white LEDs I
can actually make it more of a warm
light and make the color much more warm
inside the case which I think will make
everything look a lot better with the
orange and then of course we're going to
have the orange fluid up in there which
is going to round it all out so I think
it's gonna look really good but I'm not
gonna get to finish it until like Friday
or Saturday probably not Friday since
it's Christmas I'm probably good to
touch it again until Saturday which kind
of stinks that's it for today I'm
exhausted I've spent about 11 and a half
hours on this today it may not look like
it but there's lots of cleaning I'm very
anal about little things you guys know
that I'm very anal with my systems but I
want everything to be right because I
don't want to keep taking this thing
apart I would rather be playing games
and let's face it making youtube videos
on it then just constantly taking it
apart and fighting the color-changing
fluids and if the check if the fluid
changes color again on me with this X X
1 or X T 1 fluid uh then I'm just I'm
just going to be it I'm just gonna be
pissed I'm probably gonna change the
whole damn thing out or take out some
graphics cards or something I don't know
anyway guys thanks for watching this
vlog it's I know there's been a lot of
these you guys seem to love these it
does make things take a lot longer we're
not to keep stopping and pausing and
doing video and talking about things but
it's fun too it gives me some easy
content to create while I'm doing other
things anyway guys thanks for watching
have a Merry Christmas you guys
celebrate Christmas and if not then have
a Merry whatever it is you celebrate and
as always I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
