getting so many messages and stuff right
now that it's kind of driving me crazy
because we are on the cusp of a lot of
new hardware coming out and I've got
people asking me what they should buy
today we said it a million times when
you guys are buying and building new
equipment you need to have your ear to
the ground so you know what's coming
because it's going to affect what's
already out so today I'm gonna give you
some buying advice that way you
hopefully haven't wasted or don't waste
any money here in the near future the
Sennheiser HD 58 x jubilee headphones
offer everything audio enthusiasts
desire continuing from a long line of
innovation weighing in at just 260 grams
gold-plated connector 1 point 8 meter
detachable cord and full rich sound make
the Sennheiser HD 58 X headphones from
drop the obvious choice for those who
are serious about sound sign up for drop
is always free so take advantage of this
deal by heading to drop using the link
in the description below so this is
another one of those patented talking
head videos so feel free to go ahead
minimize this and put on your favorite
music if you like because I just want to
give you guys some information as
quickly as possible since we are
literally on the edge of just a crazy
summer when it comes to hardware you've
seen us already talk about it some of
our other videos regarding Zen 2 and the
rise in 3000 series we've talked about
how Intel doesn't really have a
mainstream kind of a launch or match
happening right now we also talked about
some of the new stuff coming out from
AMD regarding graphics cards and there's
going to be a rumored to be some changes
here coming from Nvidia so there's a lot
to talk about so it's kind of concerning
and I feel bad if you're one of those
people that are watching this and has
sent me this message you know who you
are I've gotten tons of them
people that are currently working on
various builds and I've said it before
that it makes sense to buy parts over
time if you can't afford the best now at
least the best you can afford for your
budget now then maybe it's worth waiting
a little bit longer adding a little bit
more into your budget that way you can
get a better more future proof or future
friendly PC then by saving money today
because you didn't want to save a little
bit longer the problem with that piece
of advice that admittedly it's not all
advice is perfect is the fact that you
don't necessarily know when new hardware
is coming now we did kind of know that
Zen 2 was coming
from well Computex last year was rumors
CES this year with some official
announcements and that obviously we had
Computex and then III wear all of the
all of the cards were basically shown
and we knew that July 7th was the date
that a general availability for both
graphics from AMD Radeon as well as AMD
Xen 2 base cpus are going to be
available like I said the 7th of July
now what I'm kind of confused as I've
gotten some messages from folks that are
like hey I just went out today and
bought myself a 2600 or a 2200 G or
whatever
what motherboard should I get and I'm
thinking to myself oh man oh man
maybe utilize that return that return
policy if you've got one because even if
you're thinking I'm not planning on
going Zen - I'm not planning on going
well like I can't even give an Intel
counterpart because there's really not
one to really kind of compare with this
launch its existing skews but it still
sort of applies here because if AMD
comes out and is truly taking back
market share versus Intel - things have
to happen from Intel a an answer in
terms of products cues or a reduction in
price now we didn't necessarily see that
happen with the first generations in but
with the I pcs rumored again there's no
first-hand experience here yet rumored
to be improved over last generation and
exceeding Intel currently then it would
make sense that they would have to
potentially lower the price now Intel's
more expensive as it is so even if they
lowered the price to match as n2 and the
performance is the same well then I
guess you have choice with the AMD new
platform having newer features though
like PCIe gen 4 and eight gigabit USB
throughput rather than four gigabit and
all that sort of stuff so there's lots
of lots of things to talk about there
one of the things that tends to happens
retailers would be Newegg Micro Center
I guess memory Express in Canada and all
that sort of stuff is when older
generation stuff is being phased out I
can tell you right now AMD is not making
new CPUs for older generations and
they're not motherboard manufacturers
aren't making new motherboards for the
x4 70 and older they are all they've got
all of our manufacturing process pumping
out the newest stuff so what's gonna
happen is as older hardware's to be
phased out you're gonna start seeing
things like bundle deals you're gonna
see
Rebate unity / prices so it makes no
sense when right on the edge of a new
hardware product being launched to go
out and spend the full retail cost of
some hands available now when it's more
than likely than the drop in cost now
sometimes that cost savings enough to
even be able to bump you up one whole
processor tear or maybe even one whole
graphics tear now when it comes to the
graphic side of things we still don't
know exactly all the details and stuff
yet regarding the Nvidia stuff we don't
know how exactly 5700 XT and 5700 are
going to truly stack up but I can tell
you right now what has always tended to
happen and then it happened in Pascal
was when AMD launched a new graphics
card new SKUs or rearranging of price or
sometimes just a complete stack change
has happened from Nvidia for instance
the Vega 56 and Vega 64 launched Nvidia
then launched the 1070 TI which slid
right in between obviously a 1070 and
1880 to sort of give you more
competition or a better performance per
dollar or brand value or however you
want to look at it at that particular
price point giving you now choice
options and more than just one
competitor so the whole point of this
video right now is to kind of basically
tell you pump the brakes stop don't buy
any hardware yet right now seriously
even if you're not planning on buying
the newest stuff changes in product
stacks and prices at the retail level
happens all the time in fact oftentimes
a manufacturer will even incentivize
through manufacturer rebates bundle
deals game codes all kinds of stuff that
they want to move the old product off
the shelf because they want people
adopting the new stuff so they want the
old stuff out as quick as possible
they're gonna blow it out and the new
stuff is gonna come in now we're gonna
go all the way back to first generations
in ibly 2016 when the 1800 X and the
2700 or 1700 X and 1700 all that
launched the 1800 X cost $500 it was an
8 core 16 thread processor that was
basically double the cores that you
could get from the Intel offering
offering potentially disruption in the
product stack of the X 99 platform or
the 59 60 X which was a 16 core
processor for a much better value of 500
bucks
half the cost of a 59 60 X but with more
than half the performance it didn't
match the performance but it gave you
more than half the performance for half
the cost which is a better performance
per dollar the same thing happened with
the 2700 X member there was no 2800 X
just a 2700 X and down where we saw a
particular launch price and then it
quickly sort of came down from there so
I would also be potentially leery of
running out and buying new hardware on
day one especially for AMD because it's
likely we could see a price drop over
the next few months especially if we get
as we get closer to back to school back
to cool back to school sales are a
legitimate thing that happened in pretty
much all retailers as well as Christmas
deals and Christmas bundles and I
wouldn't be surprised if the $499 3900 X
that is a 12 core 24 thread part doesn't
drop down to the potential of $400 or
maybe even like a 379 range where the
3950 X part at $749 slides in at the
$500 we've seen it every single launch
from AMD a launch price followed by a
price slide which makes me feel bad for
the early adopters on the AMD stuff
because although it's great you
potentially then see this this while
your performance per per dollar is
terrible versus someone who bought it at
a better price with a more refined and a
more matured manufacturing process of
this of the node or the dye and they're
getting potentially better performance
for lesser money so this is why you need
to pay attention you need to have your
ear to the ground and if you just ran
out and bought a new processor or a new
motherboard because you're building
something right now I would potentially
return it get your money back and hang
on to it because at the very least
you're gonna see the same price moving
forward but more than likely a price
drop so that's that would definitely be
my suggestion there so anyway guys yeah
just a little bit PSA here I got enough
messages to warrant this video kind of
telling me or telling you guys to just
hold off just wait consumers have all
the power in this market it's your
dollars the manufacturers are spending
your money to make their parts so if
you're not spending it with them then of
course you know it drives competition in
terms of not just between brands but
wanting your money and they're saying
how do we
from you and so they give you better
incentives and stuff so hang on to it
anyway guys just a quick PSA thanks for
watching and as always we will see you
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
