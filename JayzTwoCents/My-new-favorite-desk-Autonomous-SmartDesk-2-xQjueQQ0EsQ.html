guys like my plant
I call him flan tea what's up guys J is
$0.02 here and since moving into the
studio one of the most common questions
i've been asked is about this desk or
this platform or this thing I'm doing
reviews on because you guys are very
interested in it because it goes up and
down well this guy is the autonomous sit
stand desk probably one of the more
affordable sit stands that you can get
on the market because the key they can
run into the thousands of dollars
depending on the brands that you go with
but what really got my attention with
this one here is the fact that the giant
table surface that you see here a 70
inch wide table surface is only five
hundred and forty nine dollars for the
upgraded model because I wanted a big
surface to use here for while I do my
reviews like for systems and cases and
even small product b-roll obviously I'm
standing at the desk you guys have seen
that in the past I went with the largest
one they have this is actually 70 inches
by 30 inches and it's pretty big so you
can even use a multi panel set up on
this desk and still have room for your
tower up here I do wish it was a little
bit deeper but thirty inches is decent I
think forty inches would have been
perfect but the cool thing about the
frame on this is you can actually buy
the frame independently and use your own
tabletop so you could use a counter top
cut your own piece of wood whatever you
want and actually mount that to the
frame so you don't actually have to use
the tabletops that come from autonomous
now just like other desks in this price
range mainly IKEA it does come in
different finishes I obviously chose the
white I felt it was a little bit more
neutral but you can get it in different
shapes as well so if you want a curved
desk that you can get closer to you can
do that I chose that it's obviously as I
said the 70 by 30 large tabletop here
now it has these pastors on here also
they're perfect for if you're going to
go with your monitors and your tower on
the desk
then you can just pass the cable through
which is very nice I bought the cable
that are draping back behind the desk
and if you've got it up against the wall
it means you can get it close to the
wall without having your cables start to
rub especially as the desk is going up
and down now the frame on this desk this
is the Business Edition so it can hold a
lot more weight in fact 300 pounds is
what they advertised the weight limit is
being something else really neat about
this desk though is as it's going up and
down it's got cable management in mind
which is very important because you
don't want those cables to get snagged
on anything so they do actually have
pre-drilled locations for you to mount
underneath the power supply for
obviously the the motors the Business
Edition has two motors the standard
edition has one it's also got
pre-drilled holes for the control box on
there it also includes these adhesive
reusable cable straps so you can keep
everything up there nice and tidy most
deaths you're kind of left to just
figure out what to do with the cables
autonomous is actually thought about
that which is very nice to see now not
only is this desk manually adjustable it
also has four presets in there that you
can save at different levels so if you
just want to walk up to it no I want to
stand you could save that to preset
number four it goes to the predetermined
height that you set and off you go you
don't have to manually manually adjust
it maybe you've got more than one person
using this desk you can so you can have
multiple settings on that which is
actually kind of neat this particular
one is not actually used as a workspace
but the one upstairs I've got for the
test bench which is a smaller version of
the same desk well bit shorter it's a 50
inch version it's actually pretty nice
to be able to adjust it up and down when
I'm doing a lot of my test bench stuff
I'm kind of up and moving around while
the bench makes marks are running so I
hate having to sit down do the things
band up sit down so it's actually very
convenient to have a desk that I can set
at a stand height but if Nick wants to
play games or I want to play games we've
done some co-op stuff in here since we
moved in you can just move it right back
down to a sitting height and off you go
but the most impressive part about this
desk is its price point now five hundred
and forty nine dollars for what you see
right here and this is pretty much the
most expensive outfitted Edition that
they have it's got the upgraded base
it's got a higher weight limit got the
larger platform on top
it's 549 bucks which
sounds like a lot of money but it's
actually a bit of a steal when you
compare it to some of the other brands
out there and you see just how many
zeros can be tacked on to the price of a
desk like this now in terms of stability
once we put it all the way to its max
height the higher something gets a
little bit more unstable it could be and
although it does look like it's kind of
wobbling around a little bit right now
it does have adjustable feet on the
bottom I'm actually a little bit lazy
and I haven't done that yet because I'm
on a concrete floor and it's not the
most even of floors and I'm moving this
desk around all the time so that's why I
haven't really adjusted those legs but
they do have adjustable feet to make it
as stable as possible have the utmost
space in this thing though to be able to
put systems on top of here when I'm
doing reviews and not worry about it
toppling over the tea legs on here very
heavy duty very robust the motors are
built into the legs and they actually
collapse into themselves so you have
very little moving parts for things to
get snagged on it's overall a very well
thought out design if I had any
complaints honestly because nothing is
perfect it would be that the pass
through go comm grommets even though
they're metal they all fit in there as
snug as I wish that they did so as I'm
pushing cables through and pulling
cables out it tends to pull the whole
thing out of the desk so I wish there
was a little bit better tolerance on
those but that's a very minor thing once
the cables are run you're not messing
with it usually and so you're not going
to be having those things pop out very
often the other thing I think would have
been a nice option is to get the
tabletop without those holes drilled if
you didn't want to have the cables pass
through the tabletop
I actually requested that from them they
told me that it's not available this is
the only way it ships but if that's not
your thing you can actually buy the
frame independently and put your own
tabletop on there so you could run down
to Ikea or
wood a wood shop or whatever and get
your own tabletop made and any size you
want
I might actually end up doing that so I
can get a little bit deeper surface
that's available too I mean they're just
holes on the bottom of the frame that
you could put any wood screw through it
long it's not too long and pokes through
your surface then you can change out the
top don't have to buy that at all which
makes the price even cheaper to get just
the frame so that's always an option as
well now something else I've actually
been asked about too are the chairs that
I'm using because you guys have noticed
I didn't put any dxracer chairs or any
of those racing simulator chairs in
here we went with real economic chairs
again my anonymous they are the Ergo
chair and they've got a bajillion
adjustments on there and they extremely
comfortable I felt they weren't to their
own reviews I'm going to do it separate
from this one but I'm sick of the whole
racing chair concept the whole racing
chair scene I'm I'm done with that and
I'm a car guy so what does that tell you
that tells you that it's just been
played out when a car guy is telling you
he doesn't want to sit in a racing chair
because he's just sick of it they're not
the most comfortable thing to sit in
long term or long long durations so the
Ergo chair will definitely be something
we're doing in the future so anyway if
you guys want to learn more about this
desk head to the description there is a
link down there again there's no
affiliates or kickbacks or anything I
just wanted to share it with you guys so
let's say guys tend to go let me know if
there's anything else you want me to
take a look at when it comes to like
setups and maybe I'll get it in here and
we'll take a look at it desks and chairs
man they're huge I mean we all care
about our towers and our monitors and
stuff but those all have to go on
something and if you love your tower and
you love your monitor but you hate your
desk in your chair the entire experience
is going to suck so care about your
setups care about your desk do some
legwork and technically do some legwork
you do like squats where you have this
guy so in fact I guess that's a good way
to got here thanks for watching guys and
see you in the next one
yeah make sure you hit like for plenty
there he's a star the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
