course that is Corsair in the Corsair
one high performance desktop PC the
i-140 I 160 and I 180 to be found in the
link in description below ok so we're
here at Nvidia here at CES 2019 and you
may have seen the the other day I put
out a tweet saying that Nvidia is doing
some validating on adaptive sync panels
and not just GC cuz I mean the
technology is there if it could be
leveraged and used and opening up panel
options to more gamers and buyers that's
a great thing so the kind of going
through this validation process where
they've tested blue this at over 400
panels at the moment and I think 12 was
the number that was found to be like
compatible enough to put the adaptive
sync you know compatibility nomenclature
on there they've really kind of widened
and relaxed the restrictions of what
they would consider to be inspect for
g-sync
compared to the very stringent testing
to do in their own g-sync technologies
so they've kind of relaxed the standard
if you will but what we have here are
two displays that kind of show why they
can't just slap a wide label you know
adaptive sync compatible on everything
because not everything is what we've got
right here is an ultra wide panel we've
got the brand covered for obvious
reasons I'm not gonna I'm sure you can
find somewhere out there on YouTube
someone that may have been brazen enough
to remove the adhesive on that so well
we've got right here is battlefield 5
running of course it's an HDR title and
this is not HDR panels just an ultra
wide but as you can see right now we've
got some flickering that's going on
right here so it completely black
flickering it's completely FPS dependent
as well so the Ridgway you don't see it
right now what we're looking up here at
the sky is because the framerate is so
high so it's just an example of what can
happen here if you were to turn on G
sync with a g-force product on a you
know adaptive sync panel that's not been
validated you get this sort of obviously
negative effects so that's why you can't
just randomly say all of them are are
compatible will be out over here now is
an HDR panel and what I'm showing right
here is it's gonna be very hard to pick
this up on camera but there's there's a
lot of things happening here there's
some color banding happening in the sky
which obviously shouldn't be happening
with HDR it's kind of the point of HDR
you've got a much wider you know
brightness levels you can deal with and
the high-dynamic-range that's supposed
to give you much better gradients and
stuffs Holborn and HDR the extreme
brightness you have better contrast
between the lights and the darks the
clouds right here though we are this
isn't gonna be picked up on camera you
just have to take my word for it but
when you move around the clouds actually
have this kind of a trailing shadow
behind it and again that's just because
of the fact that there is it's called
overdrive artifacting where it's just
kind of overshooting where the color
targets supposed to be and then it's
readjusting itself and it's it's out of
sync with the framerate as you're moving
around but we also found this by
accident actually so if you come over
here and we'll just get this one set up
we're gonna go to this other panel here
for a second - as we turn around if we
right-click or aim down sight on the gun
you can see nothing really happens
that's normal as you'd expect we're kind
of focusing on this corner right here
the brightness all stays the same but
check out what happens on this panel as
we aim down the site look at the
exposure there's this crazy weirdness
happening here in terms of exposure
where it's just brightening up the whole
scene as a whole you actually see like
the shadows and everything everywhere
just as a whole comes up so there's some
sort of weird formula algorithmic thing
going on which is another reason why
this is not a validated panel so we're
seeing a good attempt and a good stride
here moving forward in terms of better
compatibility between adaptive sync
panels but I thought this was an
important piece to talk about one to let
you know that you know you may or may
not have a compatible panel they are
doing testing on that but also the
importance of why this type of testing
has to take place so I think you could
expect the list of panels that are
adaptive or adaptive see panels that are
compatible with GeForce products and
gsync in the future so obviously guys
have to say you know ear to the ground
for NVIDIA to see what that is but
they've got this demo here that was
definitely worth taking a look at and
kind of letting you know we're getting
we're getting somewhere but it's a slow
painful process so but once again guys a
huge thank you to Corsair for sending us
to CES 2019 and brought to you by the
new corsair one desktop check it out in
the link in the description below and as
always we'll see you in a couple of
minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
