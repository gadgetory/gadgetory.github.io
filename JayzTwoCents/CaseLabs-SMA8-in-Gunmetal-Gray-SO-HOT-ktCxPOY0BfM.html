bringing you a video that I'm pretty
excited about and that's because we are
taking a look at case labs is very first
SMA eight in the very limited edition
gunmetal gray now we've already taken a
look at this case a little bit here on
my channel when we did project red mist
which by the way is still not done at
the time of recording this video it's
like an ongoing project that feels like
it's never going to end but this is
going to be for my personal rig and I
couldn't be more excited to show you
guys the ins and outs
what makes case labs cases just pretty
much the best on the market okay now
before I get into the review I want to
tell you guys a little bit about the
company case labs it's a family-owned
company that's right here in Southern
California and everything you see is
done in-house the machining of the parts
the powder coating the acrylic panel
cutting everything you see is done
in-house all the way down to their laser
printed man Hill with blade with
homemade staple no seriously guys case
labs is pretty much exactly what you
expect from a guy who one day said you
know the case is on the market today
suck and he came up with his own and the
company went from there and here they
are now and they have a whole line of
cases everything from small ITX all the
way up to ginormous double wide or even
the sth ten which isn't this tall if you
put the complete top and bottom
pedestals on there me it's almost as
tall as me but today we are looking at
the SMA eight now this is one of their
Magnum series cases and what I love so
much about these cases is the fact that
they are completely modular everything
about this case is upgradable you pretty
much have to configure it for your own
needs
unfortunately that type of quality does
carry a hefty price tag now I know a lot
of you may at this point already be
going wow these are probably as
expensive as complete belts but you have
to understand who
the marketed demographic is for these
cases and this is for the zero
compromise have to have the best of the
best type of PC builder and believe it
or not there are people like that out
there that's why I have one and
obviously red mist is based off one if
you go and check the overclock net forms
and look at their builds you'll find
case labs cases everywhere so the people
out there recognizing if you want the
best that's exactly what this is and I
want to point out I received absolutely
no monetary compensation of saying they
are the best this is purely my opinion I
just have to put that out there because
I know some of you guys may be wondering
now everything in this case is aluminum
there's no steel there's no plastic
completely 100% aluminum now first
things first we're gonna go ahead and
get this door out of the way simply open
it up and lift it off BAM the door is
completely out of the way now the SMA 8
here features a couple of really unique
things now they were one of the first
companies if not the first company to
actually market the removable
motherboard tray it's got 4 thumb screws
here that pop out they're spring-loaded
and they don't come out so you don't
lose them motherboard tray pops right on
out there it is you can put your
motherboard on your graphics card get
everything ready to go on here and
simply slide it back in the case when
you're done a guy really love this
gunmetal color I just have to admit now
actually I'm going to stop right here
for a second before I get too far into
the review I want to point out that my
case did come assembled because I live
local to them in Southern California we
were able to pick it up and it was
already assembled now in order to come
back shipping charges by shipping up the
hemat like this it does come flat packed
that means all of these parts are
completely flat inside of a box and you
have to assemble it and that's pretty
much what this is right here these are
all the instructions of putting the
thing together so that you know how
everything goes it's crazy to my next
point everything is screwed together
with very tight fitting screws that's
what she said which means that there's
absolutely no rickety no creaking no
movement in this case whatsoever which
we all love the fact that you can take
it apart and put it together if you've
ever had to drill up a rivet for a
custom case mod you would certainly
appreciate
now mines put together obviously so
we're going to start from there one of
the things I do like is you guys will
notice there's all these holes kind of
going all the way around the build in
the entire frame these are what they
call their accessory mounts and they
sell different pieces different bars
that you can install that can you know
be placed across here to give you some
sort of accessory support if you want to
do something custom it also gives you
the ability to mount lighting to this
without having to drill holes it's
actually come in really really handy and
it's nice and thick it's about an inch
thick in depth so that you can height
lighting behind there and it's not going
to show you know through the actual case
at all so I do really like that now if
you come in here a little closer and you
take a look at the floor on this one
you'll notice in red miss we had some
fan holes on here and this one does not
this is just another case option that I
chose with the solid floor which I
really really like because I am going to
do an acrylic panel on here more than
likely I just opted not to do the fan
holes on mine there now on the top here
you can just pop this top panel off and
you can order this top panel in
different depths you can get it this is
a I think a 20 millimeter I think some
of that I remember exactly what it is 35
millimeter all the way up to like a
super thick I think they even go up to
120 millimeters thick if you want to do
giant rads up here but this just simply
pops off and you can see you've natively
got 4 times 120 millimeter radiator
support as well as these rectangle
cutouts on both sides of the case which
is nice because this gives you a place
to put your radiator fittings on here
and have passed through if you want to
come up or if you want to go down
whatever you want to do it's supported
now the other cool thing is you have
these pre-drilled holes on the top of
the case you pop these plugs out and if
you want it you can even route tubing up
to the top here and have no problem
whatsoever you've got these four cutouts
for the fans so you just remove the ones
you need if you only need one or two you
remove those the other state blocked off
so you have air could ever pay a control
as well as dust control inside this case
now moving around to the front right
here the same thing applies to the
bottom you can just pop the side panel
off it's just a little pop rivet of them
not
Ribbit's but there's a little ball
mount's and just pop into these little
tabs and here is our lower support now
you can see I do have the five sixty
millimeter red support already in here
today I'm going to go a five sixty but
you can also get radiator support for
any size radiator do you want to put in
here all the way down to I think a 240
maybe even a 120 which would be kind of
silly but you could do that now the
front of the case here as you can see
we've got all these panels blocked off
for the front airflow and the reason for
that is you can now this is a separate
you know component but you can buy this
piece here to mount the radiator or fans
to or radiator and fans and this mounts
on the inside just like this to give you
your airflow you can also get optional
vents for the bottom if you want the
entire front to be airflow but since we
are in my bill going to be doing
complete separation of the lower
compartment from the front I have to
delete these solid for the bottom and
this one's going to basically get
installed right there now over here on
the front power switches you have high
quality LED switches in here as well as
the optional USB 3.0 floats that are
right here on the front with headphone
and microphone jack now you can see you
have some very large openings right here
which shows you just how deep the rear
panel is for cable management as well as
being able and you can see that that
fits on there really tight I'm gonna
need to loosen this up just a little bit
don't say that's what she said or I'm
going to flag this videos in a program
remove the side panel just the same as
the front and now you can see the frame
of the SMA eight and case labs cases in
general you can see just how well built
these are there's absolutely no flex in
this whatsoever in fact we'll take the
bottom panel off here for the side and
now you can see we're getting deeper and
deeper in this case and we still haven't
taken a single screw driver to this
whatsoever now some of you guys in red
Mis for asking me how are the hard
drives mounted well if you take a look
at the back here all of the hard drive
cage is right here are mounted on the
back so I think this is a great design I
don't like having my hard drive cages in
the visibility portion of the case so I
don't like my 900 II it's got the hard
drive K just sitting right there
I think it
really really ugly they hinder airflow
so I'm gonna have nice open airflow in
the front by them moving these cages to
the back now for drive support they do
have native support here for two three
and a half inch drives and for two and a
half inch drives right here so you can
fit six drives on the back here before
you even have to buy an adapter for the
front which you could also put some hard
drives in the front if you wanted you
can see you have nice black sleeved
cables here for the front input powers
led the USB 3.0 my I mean I do think
these could be a little bit longer
especially the USB the front side USB
something I encountered a red mist I do
wish these cables were a little longer
considering this case is about 25 inches
in length it's a huge case there's no
other way to put it now on the bottom
you can see just how much room we have
for power supply as you can see they do
have two power supply options right here
in the bottom this entire bottom panel
removes this is an option that I opted
for so this whole bottom panel removes
and then massive radiator support how
huge any link power supply you want and
plenty of room for your plumbing your
pumps whatever else you want to put down
there in the bottom and as I mentioned
you can get a good sense just right here
by my hand it that that's basically
can't even do this live long and prosper
I don't know how to do this okay so
three fingers keep this very clean I
promise
three finger depth is how much depth you
have right here now I could
scientifically just bust out the ruler
which would probably make a little more
sense what I'm gonna say we've got three
J finger depth for cables bottom line is
plenty of cable management room back
here and you can even run 1/2 inch
tubing all up through here and have no
problem whatsoever
so yeah plenty of room for that well
guys the case loves SMA 8 and pretty
much any line of product from case labs
whatsoever it's going to give you just a
whole new level of quality that I
guarantee you've not felt in any other
case before I mean there's some
as I do kind of come close but the
amount of craftsmanship that goes into
this case is just bar none now I'm going
to talk about some pros I'm going to
talk about some cons because there's no
such thing as a perfect product in my
mind
pros modularity the DES business modular
modular Ness whatever it's modular so
you can put stuff in here that you want
in fact if you take a look right here on
the desk you can see we've got you know
this is all stuff that came with the the
case I mean you've got all extra
brackets extra screws the front covers
you've got you know the little flex pay
device mounts that come with it you've
got a handle for the motherboard tray
you even got motherboard tray feet so
that you can turn the motherboard tray
into like a little mobile test test
bench if you want extra grommets and
plug kits extra screws and I mean it's
just endless anything that you guys
could possibly need for this it's pretty
much included but you can add on to that
power supply supports just you can
configure the back panel how you want it
to have just the hex mesh on there even
little fans I mean it's just so much you
can do with these cases now the downside
to that is the fact that it has a cost
that goes along with it I mean this is
not for the faint of heart for those
that are worried about having the best
case available and are a little bit less
concerned about how much it hits their
pocketbook now that's definitely going
to be a - for a lot of people now other
pros because it's 100% aluminum it's a
lot lighter than you would think it is
in fact this case right now I don't know
exactly what's curb boy is but it's
actually much much lighter than any
other case in its class I mean the 900
II a lot heavier because it's ass main
steel construction all aluminum I
thought you got pretty good that's a
good baseball who dumped me anyway yeah
all aluminum construction so you know
now what I do like is the motherboard is
actually ATX compatible so as you can
see I've got an e 80
EVGA z97 classified motherboard in here
it goes all the way to the edge so it
fills it out nicely if you don't have an
EI TX view it just standard eat at ATX
you have a little bit of a gap there
kind of like red mist has some other
boards you just can't help that now I do
like the fact that you can pretty much
drill in this anywhere that you want
because it's aluminum I did drill into
red mist I'll likely be drilling into
this so it makes a lot easier to mod
aluminum than it does to mod steel
especially you know steel plated or
folded steel that is some of these other
cheaper cases that are pretty much
surrounding me right now so the case
slabs SMA a I'm pretty excited I don't
know what I'm going to call the project
yet the motherboard is pretty much just
sitting in here I have not made a
definitive decision on exactly which
motherboard is going to go into this
build yet I do have some options
available to me but I'm not in any rush
for this project so I don't know exactly
what I want to do it because it does
have kind of military look to it I was
thinking about calling it actually my
camera man right now coconut monkey was
thing about call it project skunk works
kind of like the Raptor project you know
over at Lockheed Martin so it does have
a very stealth look to it it looks like
the best way to describe the gunmetal
color it's like the color of the stealth
fighter I mean it's just really
militarized shake the camera yes you
know do you think it looks like a
military build here coconut monkey yeah
thought so so I don't know when it's
time to do the build after red mist is
done in god will will do a build series
on that and I'll get some feedback from
you guys and how you want it to work but
case lapse case guys it just doesn't get
any better than this go and check them
out case labs net.com dotnet follow them
on twitter you can see some of their
stuff up there and if you see this gun
metal case up on their website this is
the exact case because as I mentioned it
is the first one they have done and
assembled in-house and the full gunmetal
color which if you guys know is a very
limited edition color so there you go
very excited to have this I can hardly
contain my excitement no guys I really
am excited about this so JC sense hope
to see you guys my next video follow me
on Twitter
about tech stuff go to the website JC
cents calm and as always I will see you
in my next video make sure you there I'm
gonna get you I'm gonna ciao
hey you want to hear a really funny
programmer joke yeah hey ready so the
wife tells her husband who happens to be
a programmer for Microsoft go to the
store and buy a loaf of bread if they
have eggs get a dozen he came home with
a dozen loaves of bread programming
humour take a literal if you had eggs
good it doesn't the last statement was
get a little for bread so a programming
statement would say if get loaf of bread
if condition exists eggs or present get
a dozen loaves of bread it's a
programming oh I gotta case the cameras
you like good all right not funny
I'll stop me yeah Hindu is a bit slit I
know clearly I'm just done playing why
are you looking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
