nerds days two cents here and I've been
asked an awful lot about why I'm not
using this beautiful build that I built
to kind of commemorate the launch of the
rise end platform this being the rise in
seven 1800 X of course with two Titan X
Maxwell cards in there on water and a
really cool setup but I'm not using it
obviously so why why is that well stay
tuned this video is brought to you by
audible and right now they're offering
my viewers a free 30-day trial
membership and with that trial
membership a free audiobook so that you
get to keep now I just got done
listening to the subtle art of not
giving it by Mark Manson I did it right
here on my phone and now it's
recommending that my next book because
I'm a huge fan of the self-help section
let's face it I can use the help is you
are a badass by Jensen cereal so I'm
gonna listen to that one obviously they
they know right now if you head on over
to audible.com slash Jays two cents
that's J a y'see TW o te NTS you can get
your free trial started and with it your
free audiobook better yet once you just
click the link down in the description
so actually a couple of reasons why I
haven't been using the 1800 X system one
of them makes a perfect amount of sense
and the other one is a little bit
embarrassing so we'll start with the one
that makes sense first first of all when
I built this it was literally prior to
launch I got this prior to launch
and I put it together and I got to play
around with it and it had a lot of
idiosyncrasies if that's the right word
key to you know secrecy compartmentalize
and a lot of weird BIOS issues that had
some memory compatibility issues that
didn't have the longest list of memory
compatibility as things were going
through validation as those things
become validated you need to have micro
code for the CPU be updated bios for the
motherboard to be updated it was a hell
of a process and the problem is when I
was you know when I moved into the
studio here and I'm making videos for
you guys I can't be down with problems
like that now obviously we're several
months into the future and it means it
makes something like this worth
considering once again especially for
content creators because of the cost of
value obviously with Rison that has not
changed in any of the videos I've talked
about that is data constant especially
with the X 299 launch which
happened there is still very very
competitive value on AMD side of things
and I want to see how much things have
truly matured when it comes to the rise
n platform there's actually some new
motherboards coming out too so what I
think I think when I make that change
and I build a full time usage 1,800 X
system in here I'm going to try out a
different motherboard to see what there
is I mean there's some new stuff coming
out from asus rog there's obviously new
stuff from Oris and Giga by msi and all
of them I might be asking yourself J if
memory compatibility has improved and
the bios have improved and the microcode
has improved and you've got this built
system already why are you talking about
building another one to do your testing
why don't you just use the one you have
right here and to that I would say that
is a very valid question into which I
would also reply that this case right
here is an accumulation of me being an
idiot and doing very poor due diligence
and research in building the system
prior to actually using it because I'm
sure you guys have already noticed by
now this case although beautiful the
fantex evolve case has terrible airflow
absolutely terrible airflow this case
was built with aesthetics in mind and
functionality second especially when it
comes to water cooling now this case
would be just fine if you were air
cooling right if you had your exhaust
fans on the top and you had your exhaust
fan in the back and intakes on the front
without all the extra resistance of
radiators this would be a fine fantastic
case for air cooling the problem is when
you add a 45 millimeter thick high fpi
240 rad in the front with fan filter on
the front with a solid Pam they come
take this front panel off okay I want
you guys to see this and on the
underside
you've got the fan filter now as you
guys can see I've already cut the fan
filter once you pull the fan filter off
- it comes up from the top and magnetic
just pull yes very good well as you guys
can see I've already cut out the hand
filters because I was trying to improve
the airflow as best I could
but that you got the fan filter here
you've got those tiny little slits for
air to try and make its way through on
the front and I've only got two intake
fans on there which meant that I was
having a horrible negative pressure
situation and terrible airflow there was
very little air actually making it
through plus I have to pump right in
front of the radiator which means that
they again just blocking the air as much
I possibly could that's why I had to
turn the exhaust man on the back around
to turn it into an intake fan so I've
got air kind of opposing each other
trying to go through the top okay that
kind of worked a little bit it brought
the temps down a couple of decrees but
let's take a look at the top panel
Xiaomi because check this out it's a
solid piece
the only vents you have are right here
on the side and these tiny little vents
on the front right there which cut the
front and the back so I have literally
built and I spent a ton of hours putting
together this loop and bending it and
making it look gorgeous and you guys saw
the build video on that hopefully if you
didn't it'll pop out here you guys can
go and check it out I made a beautiful
build that was just killing itself with
heat the CPU was actually reaching about
75 to 80 C on water and the GPUs both
the Maxwell type necks is not
overclocked we're reaching over 60 C on
water so yeah that's why I haven't been
using the system because in order to run
it if you guys remember where I did my
30 day rise in review in order to keep
it running and not melting itself I
usually had the top off the front off
and sometimes even the side panel off
because it was the only way enough air
could actually make it to the radiators
now proving my point that the case
design was the issue obviously if I took
off just the side panel even and said
screw the front rad getting air just the
side panel letting the 360 handle
everything temps came down 10 degrees on
the CPUs down to the mid to low 50s and
then once I took the top panel off and
the front cover off GPU temps dropped
down to about 43 the 45 C and then the
CPU came all the way down to the 50s so
yeah that means either I'm stuck with
what looks like a beautiful build here
that's nothing more than just an
aesthetic piece or I just assembled the
whole thing and start all over so I'm
leaning towards the whole starting all
over thing but also brings a very valid
point guys research your cases because
hardware connects also did a fantastic
review of this case they also talked
about the flaws and then watch that
video prior to getting this case and
putting it all together and I kind of
wish that I had now because
I could have saved myself a lot of hate
anyway that's it
the internet likes to come up with a
bunch of rumors as to why people say it
a certain thing and then use another
piece of hardware people we're basically
like Oh obviously Intel's in Jays pocket
because that's why you switched back to
x99 now it came down to the temperature
issues and then the stability of the
bios and memory and stuff and when I
build my entire business based off the
stability of my systems when it comes to
rendering these videos and creating them
for you
stability trumps all including X 2.99 I
won't be switching X to 99 for my main
PC anytime soon hey guys time to go X to
99 stuff is coming up on the channel
I've got a 7900 X I'll be doing a review
on as well as a 72 740 X and as always
connect to your continued support
consider subscribing maybe if you're not
already and as always I'll see you in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
