so for everyone who is all like
open-source fanatic so you get all
excited about open source and everyone
who likes to give me about using
xsplit or Tech Talk is now being brought
to you primarily on OBS OBS because
xsplit sucks but I still use it so yeah
well have you guys remember I talked
last week about the fact that xsplit
just kind of took a on me and I
said the one thing that kept me from
using OBS all this time was not because
you know I paid for a license or
anything on xsplit or because I liked
xsplit or because they even knew who I
was it was because of the fact that I
couldn't play videos well guess what
plugins now allow you to play videos so
here's what we're gonna do we're gonna
go ahead and roll that intro do it yeah
I can't even hear the music but I know
it's playing because the little sound
meters really weird having the intro
play but I'll be able to hear it but I
know they could hear it that's weird why
can't hear it is it because there's no
loop back on it or there is a loopback
option but I chose not to have it do it
because it's a third-party plugin oh and
there's an option in there where you can
have it loop back or output to stream or
output to audio source and for those you
guys watching that do not know what a BS
or xsplit is then you've been in a
closet but anyways it's basically live
streaming software that like encodes
your video and sends that live it's what
you have to use if you want a live
stream on YouTube or screen capture for
videos it works that way too
no it's great for a screen capture and
it's compatible with DirectX what
DirectX 9 through 11 said I thought nine
like nine minutes yeah you can screen
cap on it so yeah no it's it's great
like if you guys never watch any of my
old videos where I'm playing games I
know I haven't played games a long time
but when I do play games that's what I
use to do all my video captures either
xsplit or OBS yeah yeah so I already
seems that people like what the hell are
you wearing Jay I'm literally coconut
monkeys on his way over here and as soon
as the stream is over we're hopping on
our bikes I was going to periscope the
ride but the problem is do it no I was
going to be here here's the problem and
it's gonna hurt if I do this because I I
know what's gonna happen
I don't care do it I have to have an
external battery source and my phone
won't survive the ride what you can't
handle carry an extra eight ounces come
on no it's not that is I have a top bar
bag that I could use to put the battery
in ah and I already have a phone mount
for my bike that's how I monitor my
rights yeah the problem is where that
bag is with the I don't normally wear or
have a top bar bag I have a saddle bag
in the back yep and when I get down off
the seat to put my foot down or unclip
from my pedals my junk goes right where
that battery is I don't feel like
hopping down on the battery so I got to
figure it out and it's not one of those
riding jerseys with a little pouch on
the back yeah but the phone is in the
front no but I'm just saying oh I see
what you're saying you need a place to
put the phone I need a place to put the
battery we'll put the battery in your
little pouch in your back and just run a
cable around you it's not long enough to
reach from the handlebars to behind me
and still be able to pedal well if
you're heard of a site called monoprice
nobody did tell me about it it's just
slight where you buy cables that are 80
feet long and they cost 37 cents because
they were built by a four-year-old that
lost his fingers doing it I also don't
exactly want to tether myself to
anything on the bike that's probably a
good good idea not I think about like
today when I went out my phone was
almost dead I brought a battery and then
I realized the battery's dead
so it was all for naught but I was
periscoping with a cable basically
coming out of my back pocket just run it
up to the phone because periscope is a
battery whore yeah I used 69% I think it
you 65% of my battery at e3 when I did a
20 minute livestream in like a 15 minute
livestream yeah I think this morning
what the iPhone battery holds up
remarkably well or it could just be a
better programmed app yeah when I did
the walk I made it 30 about 32 minutes
that had drained the battery about 33
percent on the iPhone yeah on the LG g4
I mean it was sucking it well you've got
you've got so many battery packs on you
you just plug one in like I do I like I
did it at e3 but yeah I'm gonna I'll
look at it and I'll see if there's a way
I can attach the battery I'm not worried
about the weight of the battery I just
don't want to I even though I know it's
there I've got muscle memory of the way
I get down off the seat
and I just want you periscoping so that
I can just sit there with my with my
screen capture keystroke ready so when I
 when you're like if you eat
into a telephone pole or somebody hogs
you go into the ditch I'm just gonna be
me me me me me me me me me you know if I
eat crap you know yeah you know many
hearts will pop up if I fall
dude like that's that's just it as all
the hearts like absolutely all 500 from
every single viewer yeah no I was
surprised that uh periscoping gates so
hard like the first time I did came out
of nowhere didn't it huh
I kind of came out of nowhere didn't
yeah yeah I didn't I just went and
started walk and start up in periscope
and like 250 people are watching them
like wow this never happens on Twitch
well I mean it does when we're doing a
show together but now I was by myself
ya know I ain't be yesterday we had
several hundred viewers watching during
the e3 like walkthrough cuz I was
walking through III and I guess I was
the only person kind of really doing
that so that brought in a lot of viewers
in a livestream traffic on the way home
my my cameraman was with me and we were
doing a QA but I had never heard of
periscope until you you know did your
walks and so I was like I'll check this
out and the real test was yesterday III
that I turned off LTE because LTE was so
congested you know everyone's got 4G
phones now right so my 4G is congested
and you can't get any data I was telling
people protip turn off your LTE and go
back on 3G it's wide open nobody's on it
anymore
yeah cuz it's a completely different
band and hardware so yeah so that in
Thai all of the e3 live-streaming I did
yesterday was I'm with on 3G and was
flawless
oh wow you know what I need to figure
out with periscope though is I think
there's a way to save the video on your
phone I haven't figured it out yet but I
think there's a way to save the video on
your phone so then you can download the
computer and upload it to youtube if you
want yeah because it only stays in your
history for like a day yeah cuz what I
want to do is I didn't really want to
make it public because I know people on
YouTube will get pissed if I upload the
you know the videos with a big black
bars yeah um but but I would like to
upload it to YouTube and just send it as
unlisted and then give it to everybody
on Twitter and Facebook cuz like every
time I periscope I get bombarded with
Twitter suck oh my god I missed it and
I'm like we'll just go watch it on
periscope and it's apparently you can
only watch the replay on there oh yeah
yeah what so that sucks because watch
the live stream on the computers but you
can't watch the replay that I know of I
I watched a live stream actually at the
developer today who was putting out
release notes he was like live really
doing live release notes to everybody
and so everyone was like please for the
love of God tell us you enabled
landscape mode because I mean come on
who the moment I turned on periscope how
many people were like Jay you're holding
the film like a noob Jay you're holding
the phone like a noob it's like I can't
if I turn it sideways then it's sideways
for everybody I almost think it was a
marketing gimmick I almost think that
they did that orientation as a marketing
gimmick just so that if you saw that
video you would immediately think it was
a periscope video or that or it could be
like any you know cop abuse of power
video they're always holding the camera
that way so it's like I don't know
anyone who knows how to do videography
knows landscape landscape should at
least be an option you know at least
just make it an option if some people
want that whole nostalgia up and down
that's gonna go yeah you know as a
developer the amount of people crying
for it they they would have to do it
plus the latency between the chat and
the video is phenomenally good yeah
like the most I've ever experienced is
maybe 10 or 15 seconds of lag like when
I was on a really bad connection but no
it's like I answer questions and it's
like the chat seconds later is
responding mm-hmm unlike what we're
doing right now or I'm like hey
everybody type hashtag Weiner Baggins
and we'll see it in six minutes exactly
like it's six minutes it'll start
flowing by no you know that's a what
else I thought was really cool about
periscope was when you watch the replays
you can see the chat at the time that it
was happening yeah and the hearts too
right yeah yeah so it's like you get the
full experience and I think that's
really really cool too because a lot of
people when they watch back videos ask
the same questions over and over and if
they keep seeing them in the chat and
then they see you answer them it'll be
like rock-solid
that wasn't even a planned topic but I
just thought it was interesting to talk
about and no no I think it is because
the periscope I think is a cool idea
because one twitter found a way to link
it to their their social network which
is like that I think Twitter's like what
the third largest social network in the
world or something like that second or
third I think it's number one I think
Instagram is competing for number two at
this point or something like that but
Twitter I know but none of those can
live stream yeah so so the fact that
Twitter got to lock down on live stream
and that they focus as your hashtag
Mondragon places these a net Weiner
Baggins finally came into that Weiner
yeah that's how much delay we
experienced but it's cool that they
decided to do the whole cellphone route
because the thing is when you do
something like twitch sure there could
be a twitch streaming app for the cell
phone but the majority of the streams
are gonna be people just playing video
games and
sitting in front of their computer the
whole idea by limiting it to a mobile
device is you're doing just that it's a
you're monitoring people out doing the
things that they're doing and somebody
is holding a device for the most part
unless they set it down and just sit at
their desk and talk to it but at any
rate it's nice because you always have
that perspective that's from a phone so
it feels more personal and that's why I
think they did the whole video with the
black bars because they want to make it
look as amateur as humanly possible yeah
okay I want to do a call to action for
both of us actually
so you guys know for the last almost six
months now I've been doing hashtag go
team J and we're down like 56 pounds
with that movement fat ass but you're
Jerry started go team Barclays right
actually I should start that I've seen
I've seen hashtag go team bar mcbarnett
Cleese for our you know our dual
supporters and people have started using
it if you look it up you're gonna see
stuff I just hashtag go team bar because
I'm just gonna throw it out there just
by itself there that's my first me go
team barnacle ease right so so I know if
you guys know this or not in February I
had joined a weight loss competition at
my gym and I've worked my way up the
ladder because I started late actually I
didn't start at the beginning of the
competition so I had several weeks
behind
it's unplug my phone you guys heard that
and or we have tech-talkin talk yeah we
do have tech topics so anyway my trainer
messaged me today and showed me a
picture of the leaderboard because they
just updated the stats and I've been in
second place now for like quite a few
weeks behind this this girl that got
like a massive head start at the
beginning of the competition and I've
been like literally chasing her down
almost sounds like really really bad
doesn't it so I am only 1.3% wait law
total fat loss behind her and I've got
what is this today the 18th 12 days to
go so basically at her last like four
weigh-ins she hasn't lost any weight
so she's completely like stagnated and
I've been accelerating I've got 12 days
to lose let's say about 8 pounds to give
me a comfortable 2% lead on her and this
is also the time right now where I was
just telling Jerry before the stream
like I'm kind of bored with where things
are right now like I'm kind of bored
with the diet and I'm forcing myself to
get on the bike because I've been good
getting a little bit demotivated so the
go team J and the go team barnacle II
stuff motivates us more than you guys
know so do us a favor and like poke and
prod us on Twitter and other social
media anything positive helps now that
doesn't mean hey hey idiot stop putting
dressing on your salad hey don't eat
that you idiot that's not healthy at all
when it's like 10 times healthier than
the bag of Doritos I would have eaten
yeah
encouragement guys and you know Richmond
J should do keto nope I do healthy diets
so anyway so when when it comes to like
you right now all you all you need to
focus on is a deficit from wherever you
currently are as long as you're reducing
calorie intake without like cold turkey
over long term you'll win well I figured
I figured I sat down and figured out how
much was eating so I'm a big-time
snacker at night which is the worst time
to eat - yeah but you thought the
stacker no I was eating a little over
4,000 calories a day on average to
maintain 300 pounds mm-hmm so if I just
drop down to 2,000 pounds I'm gonna see
weight come off pretty quick and I have
I've gone from 305 down to 294 right now
so right I'm heading south but but it
always is fast in the beginning and then
it'll start to plateau and I'll have to
do more and that's why I'm introducing
walking I'm introducing exercise and all
that stuff but but yeah it's just a it's
a constant struggle like twice now I've
gone in the kitchen and literally
grabbed the bag of Cheetos on the
counter and walked out of the kitchen
with it not so cool am i doing took
a back instead of town it was just like
reflex well you know what I did once
back when I was first starting all this
weight-loss stuff when I was a vir
masturbation because that I heard that
works too well you've got to make sure
you use both arms that way they both get
equally skinny otherwise you'll get like
do you trade off because I can't use
both of them at the same time Jay not at
the same time you just alternate okay
there we go
you can either alternate during or make
sure each session is alternated but
anyway it wouldn't be tech talk unless
we just randomly went off on some
uncomfortable tangent no III gone to the
gas station I was on my way to an Nvidia
meeting and I had bought in like a king
sized baby ruth cuz that's like my that
was like my candy bar i loved I loved
the the salty you know no there's no way
I could say that and now I would be
taking with you giggling oh you like the
slurp on the
Multi barded yeah pretty much so uh
anyway I bought it I got in the car and
I was leaving the gas station and I
opened it and I looked down at it and I
was like what the hell am i doing so I
literally rolled down the window and
chucked the candy bar like out the
window into the field with the car
beautiful behind me kind of looking like
what the hell is this guy doing like I
bought the candy bar rolled down the
window and then threw it out the window
so that takes more willpower then than
not buying it honestly thrown away once
you have it oh yeah you know I wrote
away your Cheetos I well no I can't
that's the problem is there's AM there's
Anders food like actually did enough
motivation for you though not to eat
your kids food you think right Xander
needs the calories yes so a lot of
people have been asking and it's funny I
saw I saw the one person in the chat
over there like talk about theory I
don't give a about your calories I
was like well I don't really give a
about that guy JD give a about that
guy I don't shed about what he gets the
 about give a about I don't
even give a about what he gives a
 about in addition to about mmm
yeah that he makes sense but then he
mailed salty snack bars
hashtag salty nuts no but the thing the
thing with Xander is he's severely
underweight you wouldn't think that
would be a problem for a kid that came
from me but right he literally can't
gain weight he's five years old and he
weighs 37 pounds that's because of
metabolism is like 80 200 calories a day
oh it is like seriously as he just runs
around like a hummingbird so we
literally went to the doctors and we
tried everything to get them gain weight
and they finally were like just stuff
anything fat that you can't fat and
sugar down us through everyone's telling
me I littered by throwing that out but
no I fed squirrels I said later like
throwing food out the window the rapper
I'm sure they ate the rapper probably
choked to death and some baby squirrels
are now without a momma but still I fed
squirrels put the butterfly effect we're
all gonna be enslaved now by our monkey
leaders in the in the future just like
what is it that was the Apes movie and
its plan of thing how did you forget
that what that it was like a Planet of
the Apes I won't I only just watched it
like a week ago um let's see her so
anyways alright we can we can be done
with the weight loss anyways Jay and I
are both trying to lose weight now so so
everybody that pissed me off by saying
be like Jay well I'm still not being
okay other than lose
wait yeah I'm six months into it but I'm
happy you're on board and I never once
pushed you so that I eventually you'd
come around
yep so that's so well the thing is is
once I hit 300 I was like I was
literally like okay this is
that's a shitty number it's a shitty
number and I needed to face a lot of
dark things that were lurking about you
know me I was going cranky and defensive
there for a while your goal is to see
your junk again it was well let's be
honest I haven't seen my junk since I
was probably 13 years old but uh it
would it would be able to see it without
such a large mirror but you love you can
once again see your junk I'm gonna J
that's my goal without a goal I want to
see that sucker peeking out be like yeah
yeah success alright so you've got
something over about 18 T we have lots
of topics actually because I made us a
document today oh and there's a couple
things on there I'm surprised you didn't
cover like the Intel layoffs
nobody cares about Intel like who cares
about Intel but it's another opportunity
to take a dig at Microsoft max luxury
macro soft I know the truth is I just I
just forgot to put it on the list oh I
do okay well we'll talk about it briefly
and in Intel's rich and they shouldn't
be like throwing away all their
employees but ultimately it's
Microsoft's fault throwing away yeah
Amy's like come over here
AMD's like come over here and then
they're like we need six-figure salaries
go over there
I heard think is hiring him he's like
we're hiring volunteers and interns oh
my gosh
so so anyways I guess we can talk about
that just a little bit so how many
employees did did they say they're
related said Intel no it's in its
undisclosed they won't comment on it
because again it was an internal letter
that was leaked I thought that there was
an estimate on it though let me see her
I heard three hundred million dollars is
what they were trying to save but I
don't know what that equates to it
wasn't just salaries that were they were
saving it I mean they were cutting yeah
various R&amp;amp;D projects and things now I
hear now I had a conversation with
someone on Twitter them them saying that
you know this is you know if AMD had
been doing better you know then this
might not have been a PC decline but in
there because Intel's saying the PC
decline of sales is what was hurting
them yeah but I don't think that they
were looking at this from the big
picture because if AMD was doing better
than there would be even less market
share for Intel right
which we dress income for Intel so this
really boils down to if only a couple of
quarters of PC sales declines which
according to steam you know that's
that's really not the case at least if
we're talking about gamers then it
really comes down to Intel being very
financially immature and mismanaged
because you as a company like Intel
should be able to survive doldrums
without needing to cut 300 million
dollars worth of fat in R&amp;amp;D projects and
and whatnot so it doesn't come down to
the PC sales it comes down to
mismanagement management of money
no no III agree with you a hundred
percent that this boils down to
mismanagement of money because even in
declining sales if they manage the money
right they still survived after like two
and a half years right that's my point
like even even like a Microsoft it's
like you got a company like Intel it's
worth enough money it's like they could
seriously survive like years yeah of
horrible downturn boat but they're doing
one of two things either they're
mismanaging their money or they're so
afraid of the future that they're
literally just hoarding all of the
resources but that's dangerous it is
that's a really dangerous move to make
because if the PC market starts up and
starts flying AMD has a really good
opportunity to kick them in the nuts
well depending on how many people they
lay off I want to see what on we already
we looked this up last year where AMD
was only worth like 1.1 billion as a
company yeah pretty shocked the AMD was
just worth the billion but yet they
still were able to keep keep projects
alive keep HBM alive and launch it and
AMD right now the fury x card at least
according to the preliminary benchmarks
haven't got my hands on mine yet I do
have one coming shows that it is beating
the tight necks at the at the 980ti
price point which is huge because if
it's beating the tight necks it's
feeding the 980ti
at the same price and that's that's good
for competition we need this but they
still managed to produce this card in a
in a declined market yeah for a company
that hasn't been able to pull a positive
quarter and I don't know how many years
now so what's what's Intel's excuse here
they see Intel market value I'm curious
how many billions they're worth you know
what I think Intel's really scared of
though is Microsoft's go in the
direction of lean and mean like when
they went from windows 7 to Windows 8 1
billion dollar company I wasn't
expecting that
they're over 100 billion yeah market cap
150 one point five seven billion Franco
for Intel for intial corporations on the
NASDAQ and and they're laying off tons
and tons of people but they're trying to
cut 300 million a year so what does fine
oh that's like a piss in the bucket what
is going on over there they wipe their
ass with that much like the executives
like literally go wipe their butts with
that their dividends there's no positive
on everything right now this is weird
this is there's gonna be something that
pops up later on that explains us I
wonder if they're laying off massive
people because they're thinking about
acquiring another company or something
they're doing some kind of a merger
they're up 1.3 5% today after the notice
Intel acquires AMD tomorrow that would
be funny yeah current current market
current share cost is thirty two point
three eight but they're up there up
there in the green after the after that
you know yesterday's leaked letter so I
don't know so maybe if something
investors want it for some reason I mean
it's beyond my comprehension but maybe
one of you guys know feel free to weigh
in over in the chat or over on Twitter
just go ahead and tweet us both Jays two
cents and at Barclays yeah if you guys
know something we don't because this
doesn't make sense the company is in the
green and their projections are shown to
their five-year projections are stone to
be pretty level from where we are right
now and let's see here another thing is
dude their five-year growth is like it
looks like Apple so I don't know what
else you know what else kind of sucks to
in actually I shouldn't say it sucks
it's it's actually a good thing in some
ways and bad and others is the PC market
thrives selling new PCs usually because
the operating system gets too goddamn
slow ok this is this is historically
like what happens right if you're bigger
mall what I know I'm not mean to cut you
off is just know what the chats going
away and I don't want to miss it
cube Erica B Z says finance lesson and
he's very right I didn't even think
about this value market value doesn't
equal cash on hand mister but that's the
thing is for a company as valuable as
Intel though to not be cash rich yeah
makes you wonder again the financial
management what's happening over there
yeah that's the other thing is they put
themselves in a really bad
position if their market value is so
much higher than cash on hand or cash
available because then if some crash is
really really hard then they're screwed
right okay that could also mean -
they're operating in debt like remember
Apple I remember like back when like
Apple hit like some ridiculous amount of
money the market cap was so high that
they basically said if they drain the
Federal Reserve they like wouldn't be
able to pay Apple like oh yeah that's
back when Apple had them what was in
existence yeah Apple one time exceeded
$700 a share yeah it was no but it was
like ridiculous like their total company
was valued at like more like basically
the US government I was surprised that
there was any lawsuits going on because
like you guys cannot afford if these
guys have to call in their chips you
know well maybe they're just kicking
them in the balls so they didn't have to
call in their chips mmm
but uh oh saying about the hole in
selling business you usually have faster
chips coming out almost in step around
the same time as operating system
releases because the operating systems
get bigger more feature-rich and slower
right and that was true you know like
everything going up to Windows 7 Windows
7 was actually a decent improvement on
Vista but now it's going the other way
where because of mobile devices
everybody's basically programming really
tight lean and mean code it's defined or
designed to run on mobile stuff so
there's no it's taking away the need for
power force exactly so now you have an
operating system like Windows Windows
Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 word
fundamentally designed not from the
ground up realized that a lot was reused
from Windows 7 they were designed from
the ground up in addition to the Windows
7 code to basically run on arm devices
really really slow in Atom processors
and well you know because they were
doing the surface and now you have
Windows 10 coming out and again now
they're using the core system initiative
where they're basically building an
entire operating system on even smaller
more compact modules that are designed
to run on the phone and they ain't
emerged all three groups together now so
Windows Windows Phone and Xbox are all
under
hello wonder why people assume that an
internet hiccup with an isp as a ddos no
they always do they always jump to that
conclusion it's pretty funny I think
it's just cuz so many live streamers get
DDoS that that's just like the normal
conclusion to jump to now yeah well we
should be back on right now
there we go videos back hi everybody
there we go make sure that we're
actually uh up here no I haven't gotten
ddosed ever since I went over to
mushroom networks those guys are awesome
having havin 3 aggregated connections
going through like one of the third
largest data center in the world
actually is pretty sweet okay yeah you
know that's it's it's just the thing
people think that ISP hiccups Rd doses
and that's not the case always well
we're not d to us cuz we're obviously
back haha surprised somebody didn't like
claim claim it okay I'm like Twitter
that doesn't check isn't loading right
now though I'm oh it isn't oh I've got
chat over here let me refresh already
saying Intel's attacking now until in
other mad bro was slapped with a hundred
million dollar fine I'm not have CC yeah
I'm super happy I've been with AT&amp;amp;T for
years and they've been screwing me on
this and it's pissed me off so bad so
basically in a nutshell what's happening
is after you so you get an unlimited
data plan you go to AT&amp;amp;T and you pay the
money for an unlimited data plan if
basically after downloading a
predetermined amount of data which I
don't actually have listed here I think
it may vary in some cases but once you
hit that limit then they massively
throttle your speed back and it's by
like a lot it's not like they just cut
it down a little I mean they throttle
your speed down to like 3G love the
thing it's like and the reason why I'm
happy about any Wow people are really
impatient no I think it's because until
they hit refresh it doesn't count them
as a viewer again oh I see yeah
something like that I know we'll see how
this goes it goes down if it keeps going
down then I'm gonna ride my bike no
that's fine if it goes down again we'll
just you can go ride your bike and we
might have to make this a recorded
podcast their Google yeah just to avoid
just to avoid the streaming issues there
might it might end up having to go the
pka route where this there's no audience
interaction but at least we can get
through the show without having to deal
with either dos attacks or
ISP issues yeah no I think I think
that's a good idea
either that or if you want I can start
streaming the show since I have three I
basically have three connections so even
if the cable company goes down or the
company goes down I always have
something it might diminish the stream
quality a little bit if like cable goes
down because DSL isn't as fast but maybe
something we can experiment here you
just you help me after we get through
this show before next week you help me
all get set up on this side and let's
see how well it works because I knew up
a lot of bandwidth well the cool thing
is once you're set up you don't have to
reset anything up
no no that's that that'd be cool because
then if I'm if I'm streaming on this
side with mushroom networks basically
we'd be streaming right at amazon's data
center yeah and and if one connection
does or even two connections like go
down because like some somebody crashes
into a telephone pole or cuts the cable
well actually a proble them but as long
as one of them still working we're good
so you can always revert to your cell
phone Oh everybody's gonna ddos is
someone 92168 1.1 all right so yeah
anyways AT&amp;amp;T milk a hundred million
dollar fine the AT&amp;amp;T says that they're
gonna fight there they're definitely
gonna fight and I'd and I'd imagine they
would because as soon as they saw that
fine I'm sure they were like holy
this is this is setting a new president
yeah oh wow you weren't moving for a
second so I was like no I'm looking at
the Time Warner Cable outage map right
now and all of it all of Los Angeles
looks like it's on fire oh it's all red
on the map wait is it a three still
going today right yeah but that they
they brought into some other ISP for
that oh they did okay so okay Tommy just
right now let me add a
yes green cabbage well the other thing
is remember all the internet providers
usually go through the same trunk line
so if III is producing enough traffic
and they've got it that opened up I mean
they could in theory saturate the
network see that's a that's the that's
the outage map right there you'll see it
on the stream and you'll see like all of
the metropolitan area of where I am
right now for Time Warner is like so
oops that's why everyone that's like
baby don't be big us yeah I mean DDoS by
my ISP oh my god so so anyways
100 million dollar fine so when you
reach a certain data cap they throttle
you way the hell back and the FCC is
ruling that that is bad advertisement
because they are not specifically saying
you get unlimited data but we will
throttle your speed they're not they're
not openly they're saying unlimited
everything which includes speed and a
couple of people came back to me when I
say that that listening let me say and
uh yes I do
oh yeah sure that's not a real fire
better hope not water to put a surge
spraying like Cool Whip at it yeah J
doesn't take showers anymore either he
just he just right now he probably just
smells like like an elephant's face I
just take leaves and rub them under my
armpits pine needles you don't have pine
needles down there and right yeah a
cactus do you just rub cactus oh yeah I
feel great so so anyways AT&amp;amp;T is saying
unlimited data so some people tweeted me
today and they were saying well even
though they throttle your speed you're
still getting unlimited data so I don't
see the problem but that's the thing you
don't realize is that something like 10k
if they want it exactly that's the point
is like let's say you have unlimited
data and then you have another plan
that's like 10 gigabytes of data well if
they throttle you after 5 gigabytes down
to where you download 24/7 you can't
reach 10 gigabyte oh yeah
it's possible all right well let's go
ahead and just tweet out that we we had
to kill a stream I wish there's a way
that we're starting worried I'm up and
say we're gonna stop it
we're already streaming right now oh we
are yeah oh hi guys so my video going
there we go yeah that's not alright so
we're gonna wrap up the stream guys uh
LA's internet is like up and down and up
and down and up and down like a
rollercoaster so I don't think this is
gonna be a
but next week we actually topics and
stuff
oh well no dude I spent so much time on
that document we're gonna talk about the
Microsoft's Stephen Elop leaving the
company or probably fired talking about
the oculus consumer model and we're
gonna talk about the Samsung keyboard
bug that's basically letting hackers
take control of Samsung devices yeah and
I was gonna talk all about fury and 390x
so I know when I was gonna talk about
all of Microsoft secrets too this is
finally the show where I felt
comfortable telling you guys all
Microsoft secrets go to twitch the
problem is not YouTube all right well
I'm gonna I'm gonna go ride my bike yeah
JJ's gonna ride his bike and I'm gonna
create a video where I turn a cell phone
box into a desktop cradle so look
forward to that we're really sorry guys
but when the Internet's completely
unstable like this we're popping on and
popping off it's very frustrating it's
hard to stay on topic so we're gonna go
ahead and save the topics in this
document for the next show yeah and we
will get to and after 81 live streams
I'm highly considering just turning this
into a recorded podcast you will lose
the fan interaction but will also lose
all the frustrations as well so what
higher quality to Jerry and I will talk
about it and we'll uh we'll figure out
we're gonna do so we will figure
something out guys all right sorry for
the short show bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
