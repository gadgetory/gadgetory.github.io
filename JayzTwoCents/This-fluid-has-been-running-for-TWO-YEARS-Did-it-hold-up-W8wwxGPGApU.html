keep in mind with water-cooled rigs is
regular maintenance or in my case
completely neglected for two years
this coolant has been sitting in this
rigs at September of 2016 we are almost
in September which means this fluid has
definitely surpassed the typical annual
flush and fill that I'll do fill huh
fill camera guy even so the goal of
today is to completely drain this system
take a look at the block see how they
fared did it gunk it all did it did any
of that white powdery stuff buildup
because remember this is a pastel fluid
for Mayhem's which in the past had some
problems with with the yellow and the
orange but the blue and the green so far
in both systems I've had them running in
has been extremely solid so we're gonna
drain it take a look at it and kind of
prepare for an upgrade that's coming to
skunk works in the very near future but
I just wanted to kind of make a video
today to see what happens when you leave
a fluid in a system for two years now
this is gonna be pretty easy today
because when I set this up it's almost
like I knew what I was doing I've got ez
drain ports
I've got fill ports I've got to fill as
a cameraman that joke is never gonna get
old to me so the bottom is actually
prepped now for me to drain but I've got
two loops in this remember so I'm gonna
save that one for last because the GPU
loop which is the bottom one down there
it's kind of a pain to get all the fluid
out of because I have this part right
here which sort of just dangles there
but the CPU loop is you can see it's all
contained right here goes in the
reservoir out to the pump into the CPU
block through the rad back the red and
into the reservoir the drain is down
here at the lowest point so this is
extremely easy for me to get most of the
fluid out of we did have what looks like
and the camera is probably not going to
pick this up but the GPU loop which is
the hotter loop has definitely gone
about I already think Phil maybe a half
shade darker can you see that now if we
put up this side-by-side compared to the
old videos
the yellow turned straight up puke brown
or diarrhea brown and the orange turned
a disgusting nasty
color as well but the Green has not done
that but both the yellow and the orange
did it in only a few months this is turn
just such a slightly darker green in two
years so I'd say this fluid is holding
up pretty well now I've done this a
million times I've showed this in my
previous videos but inevitably I'm
always asked a bunch of times how I
drain my systems so I'm gonna go ahead
and show you right now of course I've
got this drain valve you can thread on a
barb in this case I have a alpha cool
compression fitting and you can just
push on your fitting and then stick the
other end and sort of some sort of a
catch can can or container I've had this
hose pop out and spray everywhere but
because of the diameter tube that I use
I can actually shove it right there in
the handle now if I open up this valve
or this plug on the top right here air
can get into the loop which means as
soon as I drain or turn this valve
physics takes over right now what I'm
gonna be doing is if this if the blocks
check out and there's no powdery residue
oxidation or any of the nickel being
eaten away then I'm gonna mix both of
these fluids together so that they're
the same color and then what we'll do is
we'll mix them together and put it back
in sometimes when you start dealing with
the powder build-up you'll see it
forming on the o-rings but this o-ring
is perfectly clean I've taken these
o-rings off before on the fluids that
have started to change color on me and
have them be nothing but a big powdery
mess and I showed those of some of the
previous videos so make sure you guys
check those out but what I'm about to do
right now it's kind of gross don't
recommend it
so I'm will even say you're blowing
bacteria in there but you got to kind of
blow your system to help push out some
little
now the reason why I do this and I'm not
concerned about blowing in there is
these fluids are also growth inhibitors
so that you don't get things like algae
and bacteria and other things sort of
growing in the loop I was planning on
taking the block off and looking at it
up close but fail gets in here you can
see that block is extremely clean so you
can see there's no real discoloration
there's no powder buildup it's maybe
slightly yellowed but that's normal when
nickel has fluid running over it
actually looks really really good but if
there's any sort of sediment building up
it would probably end up being on the
GPU rig because temperature can really
break down a fluid quickly and the GPU
loop gets significantly hotter than my
CPU loop so that's the one that we
definitely want to look at closely so
the same thing we're just gonna open up
one of these fittings on the top of the
reservoir air can't get in then fluid
can't get out or it just dribbles really
badly like you know like a bed.but bad
pee I don't know I don't know I was
trying to say all right so we turn this
knob here same thing I love physics it
makes my job so much easier
physics are great physics don't lie
physics or physics
to get a good look at the GPU I'm gonna
take the top one out but look at that
that is really clean
that little buildup of whatever this
gunk is right here is in both blocks in
the exact same spot and it was there
when I filled the loop so it didn't
happen with this fluid that could have
been something left over from previous
fluid what I want to reiterate is in the
flow plate right here
there's no buildup there's no powder you
can see on the nickel there's no
corrosion
there's no nickel flaking off this looks
like a new block that I just poured
fluid in important remember though
sometimes people see a little bit of
bleed in the area in the middle of the
block like where the fluid will kind of
pass over it slightly the only oring in
here is on the perimeter
there's nothing sealing off the inside
other than the pressure of the acrylic
pushing down so you're gonna see some
fluid kind of make its way on top of the
metal in between the acrylic level of
you know layer so don't freak out if you
see that what we care about obviously is
what it looks like here and if we look
at this block head-on there is
absolutely no corrosion of any kind no
discoloration I've even rinsed this this
is just the way it it poured out so this
looks damn good now let's talk about
skunk works here for a minute because a
lot of you guys were really kind of sad
that the system was missing from the
channel for the last couple almost
couple of years while I've been in the
studio now over a year and a half and so
a lot of folks were just really missing
skunk works because this was always the
centerpiece of my channel this build was
intended to be completely impractical
expensive unnecessary you know kinda
like me big I'm practical unnecessary I
want to bring this back to the channel
so I'm going to be tearing apart my
system that I have upstairs currently
because you know Phil does 99% of our
editing now and so we're gonna be doing
some more stuff for a system for him but
I want to bring this system back to the
forefront of the channel so I'm gonna
start integrating this system more in
some videos it's gonna be my desk rig
upstairs in our little editing den which
means an upgrade is necessary now let's
talk about this upgrade real quick
I think it's actually it's not necessary
that was a wrong word it's it's just
wanted which is why anyone would have
something on this nobody needs this item
I'm sure people already like freaking
out like are txj is doing r-tx it's
obvious Jays doing r-tx it's obvious I'm
gonna be doing r-tx reviews and I kind
of feel like if this system is gonna
maintain its status as being just an
over the top completely impractical
build then r-tx might make the perfect
choice for that but we haven't gotten
any finalized plans yet for any of that
so I just wanted to kind of talk about
that but I do know for a fact I'm going
to be upgrading the system and I'm kind
of thinking about doing like maybe the
16 core 79 60 X it's upstairs in here or
the motherboard update maybe changing
out the fans redoing the lighting but I
dunno I kind of want to revamp the
system in his set neglected in my home
office for a long time by neglected I
mean I played games on it periodically
at best for maybe 45 minutes at a time
but that's why I thought that this was a
very good video today to show how the
fluid has kind of held up because there
are times I walked away from the system
playing a game wife calls me you know
calls me downstairs hey dinner's ready
and then proceeded to forget about it
for a month running non-stop in a room
that's not air-conditioned because they
closed off the vent that way the rest of
the house can get AC I think this has
gone through kind of want some of the
worst scenario that you possibly could
so I just kind of want to talk about
skunk works a little mano a mano
or mono Fe mano a mano we can do that
you want to do that we can do that
all right that's back together you know
what it's time for Phil doing the
filling montage alright she's back
together cleaned up Dee dusta fied the
fluid has been inspected looks great
blocks as you guys saw absolutely
fantastic highly impressed with how the
green pastel actually held up over over
the last two years absolutely fantastic
so obviously they were with the Reds and
the oranges and the yellows and issues
that were happening in the past hour
definitely die slash color dependent so
yeah I'm happy with this now like I
started to say future upgrades gonna
probably bring this up to X 299 will
more than likely put our TX cards in
here just because this system as I said
has always been the centerpiece of the
channel and grows with the channel and
the ground that the channel has grown a
lot since this PC was worked on last two
years ago I think two years ago sitting
there like five hundred thousand subs
last time I did anything with this we've
gained over 1.1 million since then so if
you guys have any suggestions on what we
should do with this I'm kind of debating
a color change
I'm digging maybe blue I know gunmetal
and blue I also think because this case
is no longer available because since
we've last touched this system case
lapse is unfortunately closed up shop I
kind of feel like doing a case mod or
something to this as some sort of a
tribute slash homage to case labs
something that a lot of people have been
doing so I figure why the heck not so a
hell little lawnmower just drive by okay
whatever you probably came in here I
probably seem like a crazy guy that's
okay guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching this video I've never let fluid
go this long in a system since doing
YouTube anyway I did have one system
that ran for like seven years before but
that was that was back when we were
talking like early 2000s when we didn't
know what we were
doing we were just hooking up pond pumps
and Quarian stuff and calling it
water-cooled obviously things are coming
a long way since then
alright guys thanks for watching it as
always we'll see you in the next one
where my HOS there bitch
