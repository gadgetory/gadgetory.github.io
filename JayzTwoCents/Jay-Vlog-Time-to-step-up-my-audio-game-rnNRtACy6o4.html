nice thought it's time for an upgrade
that's little J's Xbox ah much better
how did you even get in here medic you
last time I was here no big deal well I
could go for a drink right about now
though I kind of feel like you've
already done this whole living room
thing before no there's different
channels these are horrible man well you
are breaking and entering no not I have
witnesses the new defined nano s from
fractal design supports full-size power
supplies full length graphics cards room
for a complete custom water loop and
heck even room for a couple of
freeloaders click the link in the
description for more details dr. Josh
not included what's up guys JC sense
here I'm gonna do something I haven't
done in a while and I'm gonna give you a
little behind-the-scenes vlog of kind of
not a whole day just I got a lot of
things they get done today and it's one
of those times where it's like you know
what how am I gonna get a video down I
got so much to do make a video about the
things I got to do there's an idea no
one's ever done before so I just got
back from vacation a couple days ago we
spent six days in Seattle and that was
actually a lot of fun no we didn't go up
there to see Jerry but yes we saw Jerry
while we were up there we did all kinds
of things went on a floatplane tour when
in the underground tour little Jay
wanted to go ghost hunting so we went on
that paranormal underground tours well
we're going to boat tour we're up on the
Space Needle Children's Center Science
Center all the city centers so we did a
lot of stuff it was actually pretty fun
you can see I haven't shaved in oil and
shade since I got back about three days
ago
it's fun I used to a goateed you guys
are in my old videos I had a very like
kind of ugly goatee that didn't grow
very evenly because for whatever reason
I'm one of those one of those guys my
dad could grow like a big ol burly like
bloomer Jack beard if you want it but I
can
I could never grow
beard never could this guy came in today
you guys are so sick of Kennedy stuff I
know this happens every single year guys
new graphics cards launch and all the
variations come out with it but yeah
this is gonna piss a lot of people off
though cuz people want to see more about
the 1070 guys there's still a lot of
custom cards for 1070 aren't available
yet EVGA will be sending me some 10 70s
to look at like for the women edition
stuff like that
gigabyte as well though Tech is hopping
on board would do some ZOTAC reviews but
I hear you guys I hear you when you're
saying J we want to know more about the
RX 480
why aren't you talking about the 480 why
are you being such a fanboy why do you
hate AMD why do you want to kill puppies
and kittens
well the card is 9 anyone's hands yet
and I don't talk about rumors and a lot
of people I saw some comments of what is
they gonna talk about rumors about the
1080 but no one will talk about rumors
with the RX 480 well I can't speak for
other people but you guys won't find a
single video on this channel or a single
topic on Tech Talk where I talked about
rumors of the 1080 I just didn't do it
the only thing I said was that it I
didn't know if it was gonna be a 1080 or
if it was going to be a Titan that was
the only thing you'll find so I don't
talk about things before they're out and
before they're available but I will say
this the our X 480 information is like
amongst reviewers like myself lioness
excluded AMD had a very exclusive launch
video that they set up with with Linus
so Linus got to sit down obviously with
Roger Roger Kotori and talk about the
AMD R X 480
I didn't so I have no information I'm
not going to talk about rumors and to
NDA until June 29th there's an NDA right
now so I couldn't even do a video if I
wanted about any of the RX 4 ID stuff
but I will say this though I have a
private meeting with AMD next week
specifically about the RX 480 and
Polaris so that I can bring you all the
Polaris coverage you guys want
after the NDA lon or lifts I should say
the NDA loading in place so it's on the
launch it's gonna lift so there will be
our X 480 stuff on this channel every
time an AMD has launched a new graphics
card series in the last three years I've
covered it so I don't know why you guys
think I wouldn't both that said that's
all I wanna say about that you guys just
have to wait till after the 29th before
you see or hear anything on this channel
rx4 any more than I just said something
else I'm doing is I want to upgrade my
equipment and you see the temperature
just changed a lot
I'm really looking at this guy right
here this Sennheiser MKE 600 shotgun
microphone because currently I use oh
yeah my morning coffee here it's not
Starbucks actually homemade I just
reused this nervous cup I currently use
the wireless lab here the Sennheiser II
W 100 g3 it's a few years old this thing
was actually like 600 bucks when it was
new this wireless lab and I've got it
the receiver up here on my Canon 70d
good camera it's not a lot of money it's
about a thousand bucks for the body I
know it sounds like a lot but in terms
of cameras it's really not this cameras
kind of will hold me back a little bit
on some things I want to do the mic is
definitely holding me back in terms of
audio quality and now I've got this zoom
recorder here that I had been using for
the two idiots build a computer we use
this to get two mics with I have two of
those with Sennheiser wireless mics and
that stuff is definitely in need of an
update so I'm not considering going with
a shotgun setup because they just sound
so much better than a wireless lab and
the lab will have its place it's just I
think it's sort of served its purpose
now I bought that thing a couple years
ago and it's time to upgrade the audio
the problem is the size rmk 600 which
sounds phenomenal is like out of stock
in most places actually amazon has it
right now if they have it for like 70
bucks more than like Samy's camera but
Samy's camera of course is backordered
because with a price like that everybody
wants one so now obviously my dilemma is
do I pay 70 bucks more to get Amazon
Prime and wait till tomorrow to get it I
know that sounds like super I guess
whiny child like I wanted no I don't
want it tomorrow I'd like to be able to
drive somewhere to pick it up because I
like to kind of touch and feel things
beauty geeky I like to touch and feel
things before I buy them so I'm not the
biggest fan of buying things on Amazon
unless I absolutely already know
everything about it before I buy it but
again it's $70 more than Sam
that's a lot doesn't you a lot of money
it's $400 for that mic so any company
that would say that YouTube is not a
good source for advertising or product
reviews or anything like that it's
completely full of and believe it
or not I've had some companies tell me
that they don't like to work with
youtubers which is kind of funny because
I am shopping for a microphone and a
camera and I've actually been spending
all morning watching reviews and looking
at different products and stuff to see
what other reviewers are having to say
about it I don't go to written articles
and I'll read Amazon reviews I'll go to
YouTube so I just thought to myself I
would point that out hmm companies I
think YouTube is not a good place to go
to for product information yeah I would
say that's a little bit of an old-school
way of thinking I am NOT a good shopper
I get very stressed out when I have to
spend money and here are the mics I'm
considering right now and by the way I'm
not by the time you guys see this I will
have already made it my decision so I
guess you guys can chime in on that but
I'm looking at the rode ntg-2 which is
kind of like that entry-level really
good microphone has some lacking
qualities apparently it's not very loud
to really bump up the noise or the input
levels or the output levels of your
recorder or whatever you're using look
at the ntg-3 which is really expensive
it's 700 bucks I'm looking at the
Sennheiser MKE 600 which again is about
400 and 400 ollars 399 ish yeah I'm also
looking at some of the audio technica
shotguns as then shotguns as then seems
to be like the lower quality of all of
them at least from what I've experienced
so far but I also want to get a new
recorder because my zoom keeps freezing
on me and causing me problems so I am
just like do it I don't know what I want
to spend on this plus I want to get new
camera stuff running a new tripod I
literally want to like overhaul all of
the equipment and I get stressed out
because I want to make the choice once I
want to deal with returns or any of that
stuff and I'm a patient cuz I want it
now and nobody likes no Stan or Guitar
Center
Sammis nobody has anything in stock
right now so I'm stuck with using Amazon
I decided to go ahead and open up the g1
gaming just to kind of take a look at it
interestingly enough I hadn't researched
this card at all it's got a C
eight pin power as you guys know the
additional power is not gonna guarantee
you any better overclocking so I'm
interested to really check this guy out
it's got a backplate yeah more tan ad
stuff yay but you guys can't wait don't
worry though like I said earlier we have
more 1070 stuff coming series we're
gonna do I'm going to grab up Little J
right now the wife is gone
with the baby to some some meeting some
mommy group she belongs to and we are
gonna head down to the mall and check
out Sam Ash and see what they got there
pretty notorious for saying they don't
have stuff online in stock when they
actually do so at least go check that
out
where's case scenario if that doesn't
work then we will just uh I guess we'll
just have to order from Amazon where is
Little J where's she right where I
expected her to be always playing around
on her computer my goodness
hey let's go to mom okay
my neighbors really don't like it when I
start my car anyway we're gonna go to
Sam Ash we'll be back okay so I just got
back from Sam Ash and I got a few items
here for haul I got a deer 40 tascam to
replace my zoom h4n which is right here
I've been having some issues with the
zoom let me show you let me see if it'll
do it here when I start it up my
battery's dead oh wait i gosh you do it
the right way I suck there we go
when it starts up let's see if it'll do
it okay yeah I know there's no card oh
it's right to take the card out to fix
it I had an issue where when I had an SD
card in here it would freeze on that
loading where you saw that loading
screen it would just freeze on that and
I tried different cards and it keeps
doing it and I don't know why but
overall it's been a pretty good device
except for the door broke you see I'd
put tape on there and other than that
not the prettiest thing to look at but I
thought I'd give this Tascam a try but
I'm actually thinking about returning it
because I found out it doesn't have a
true AC adapter plug for it it just uses
USB micro USB which you could then use
like the same charger or not charger but
power source you would use for like say
a cell phone with a cell phone brick I
don't really want to do that and I see
the page four in you know has the power
adapter I have the power adapter for the
h4n so I might just return this guy was
only a hundred eighty bucks but I might
return that and then just keep dealing
with h4n I don't know what I want to do
I know this is a DR 444 which is I could
step up from this one yeah I just
haven't decided really haven't
I'm very this was telling you guys I'm
very indecisive I also picked this guy
up here to replace this microphone if
you guys remember this microphone in
this cable we're trying to kill people's
ears whenever I was doing a Tech Talk
and would touch the cables so this is an
80/20 35 now to 2020 it's a 2035 so it's
technically one step up comes with the
shock mount and everything so I want to
mount this up in just a little in just a
few minutes here replace that cable
maybe we won't put that in the blog but
I am running out of time here cut the
gym in a few minutes to go to or a
couple hours anyway I should say a
couple hours isn't a lot of time
for me I tend to waste a lot of time but
this thing's pretty cool that was 149
bucks and then of course I've got some
new XLR cables here to replace the one
over there which is trying to kill
everyone's ears so yeah there's that and
I still have not been able to decide on
a damn microphone something else we'll
be doing too is I'm gonna be changing
out this s3 test bench here from case
labs for one they need primo chill wet
benches the steel wet bench with all the
colored inserts so we'll be switching
all that over here pretty soon this is
what the test area where the GPUs lately
kind of looks like here you can see GPUs
down there here
GPUs everywhere yeah this is the time of
year everyone really kind of gets sick
of GPUs DUI upgrading my lighting as
well I've talked about this in a
previous video this is just an
inexpensive softbox setting off Amazon I
was like 300 bucks came with a to
softboxes and a hair lights that's
technically three arms I used I don't
even use the one for the hair light
these put out a lot of light in fact
I've got one over here hooked up to
light switch as you can see that gives
me the pretty good lighting that you
guys have seen where even in daylight
like this I can get that lighting effect
you guys have seen in some of my
previous videos by just putting them
really close to the chairs I got a 45
angle and then reducing the iso and the
camera down really low because i'm blown
out obviously when i have those big
bright lights right next to me and then
it makes the background nice and dark
but you can see the lighting on the
computer and stuff and yeah it's it's
pretty yeah that's kind of basic I guess
I'd have one set up like right here I'm
gonna set up like right there than the
camera in the middle and then I would
just adjust the lighting accordingly so
that what looks like a darkroom effect
is actually in the daylight yeah kind of
cool huh but anyway guys this has just
been a little taste of behind the scenes
stuff I'm gonna get out of here oh I
can't shoot you more video because I
have been away from the internet and
email and stuff for about seven days and
it is pretty damn backed up I mean all
kind of videos you guys want to see I
got some stuff coming I got some
ten-eighty stuff coming and as I said in
the beginning this video are X 480
coming at the end of the month
there's NDA's and stuff in place so
that's why you haven't seen people doing
are X 480 videos yet alright thanks
watching guys I will see you in the next
video and as always
thank you for your continued support you
guys make this a whole lot of fun
frustrating at times but fun most of the
time alright guys it's the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
