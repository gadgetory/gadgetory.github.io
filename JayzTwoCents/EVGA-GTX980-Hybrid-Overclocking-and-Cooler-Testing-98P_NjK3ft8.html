and I like to call myself a little bit
of a GPU snob and really uh too ashamed
to admit it
after all honesty is definitely a virtue
if you guys remember in December I did a
review of the gigabyte water force which
was there three times 980 GTX
water-cooled monstrosity giant thing and
I said in that video that somebody
should come up with the GTX 980 with a
single 120 all in one water cooling unit
what they should have done was simply
offered a single 980 120 millimeter
radiator with much much shorter tubing
and let the buyer mount it in a standard
120 millimeter fan slot in their case
just like the 295x2 and look how
successful that card is but I think if
gigabyte relaunched the water force as a
single card solution the buzz about it
would have been much more positive
because I think it would be absolutely
successful your guys's comments
definitely echoed that now I'd like to
think that I had something to do with
this but something tells me this was
probably in the works before I ever
mentioned that video however what we
have right here could very well be a
community inspired products we're gonna
go with that we're gonna say that this
was a J's $0.02 community inspired
product probably not true at all but I'm
going with it
the fractal design r5 is so amazing it
fits all kinds of cool hardware in there
water cooling air cooling and on top of
that it's silent and it's awesome
like explosions or like any quiet it's
good okay Jay so what exactly is a
GeForce GTX 980 hybrid well as I said
and we saw at CES this thing is really
really suction cup look at that it won't
open
Oh Mike there we go
well it's right now it's an open box so
it's got products in there here's your
manual the usual stuff that comes with
EVGA graphics cards driver manual
stickers poster but look at that it's
got a radiator in it oh my goodness and
there's all your get ready for a wild
ride guys get all your accessories there
but here it is gtx 980 all-in-one water
cooling unit now you guys have said you
like doing the live benchmarks and the
more or less off-the-cuff really live as
it happens review so that's what we're
doing here first of all the packaging on
this is very very amazing and you know
one of the things that I had a problem
with with the water force and we're
going to talk about this as I try and
figure out how to get this thing out of
the box was the fact that the tubing
that they all right
editing J you're gonna have to cut this
one and she's free now one of the things
I said I didn't like about the water
force was the fact that it had that
terrible terribly ugly fep tubing was
that flexible tubing look at this EVGA
on this one has gone with a braided
rubber tube this is freaking beautiful
not only that it's extremely flexible
super flexible the thing with the fep
tubing is that likes to just kind of
flip flop around whichever way it wants
to go its own way and that's that now we
do have a hundred and twenty millimeter
radiator here looks like standard
thickness of about thirty millimeters
and we do have what appears to be a high
static pressure fan branded EVGA I'm not
entirely sure which fan they used for
this but or who the OEM supplier is on
this but frankly it doesn't really
matter it seems to have plenty of blade
very little gap seems like it's very
decent for static pressure now I've not
opened this thing up so we're gonna be
open see the seals are still uncut so
we're gonna open those together just the
end of the box and I can say there is
one thing on this card which was
definitely J's $0.02 community inspired
and that was this guy oh look at that it
has a back plate finally no if only all
their standard SC another 1980s had a
back plate on there look at that
sexiness right there mmm all right let's
get the rest of the plastic off of here
what I also like is you guys don't have
to figure out where to plug in the fan
cuz check it out it plugs into the GPU
itself so it's gonna be pulling power
from the PCI Express and the
supplementary supplemental power that
you plug into here which is again a two
6-pin now the PCB on this guy is the
same as their 980 SC model which is
their superclocked which is a reference
PCB so there's two things to mention
with that one if you want to get into
water-cooled GPU for better overclocking
better thermals and lower noise you
could pick up something like this and
you're up in water-cooled as long as you
have a spare 120 millimeter slot to put
the fan or the radiator somewhere second
of all second of all second lis whatever
because this is a reference PCB means
you could take this cooler off and put
on a high end water block like a UK
water block alpha cool cool an Swift
tech whatever so you could upgrade this
thing in the future which is very very
cool now one other thing that they did
tell me is that they are selling this
kit individually for 75 bucks at least
at the time of recording that price
could have changed you definitely won't
want to look that up but you could add
this to a standard air-cooled or a CX
version of the 980 and with the people a
standard PCB or the reference PCB which
this is and you can upgrade your
air-cooled card to a water-cooled card
like this now all of the clocks on this
are pretty much the same as their hydro
copper version because it is
water-cooled and so we should expect
some pretty low noise since the only
thing this reference fan or blower style
fan actually has to cool is the MOSFETs
and the chips which is not going to
require very much airflow at all
and all of the GPU cooling is being
handled here by the 120 millimeter
radiator so I guess there's only one
thing left to do let's go ahead and get
this bad boy in the test bench you know
to do that I'm gonna have to take Titan
off there which is kind of sucky because
it's been there and well at home for a
while now the other thing I'd like to
mention is that Nvidia said that the
other two Titan X's are on the way so we
get to do that build in the future and I
am so freaking excited I can hardly
stand it I might just poop myself a
little actually with excitement okay you
guys are gonna have to bear with me
going forward here I wanted to have two
camera angles one pushed in tight on the
FPS as we're doing the live benchmarking
and then one kind of over the shoulder
but unfortunately it looks like mighty -
I might have finally bought the farm I
knew this thing was dying that's one of
the reasons why I went about the 70d but
fully charged battery in fact I tried
two different batteries here nothing
literally dead so why couldn't this have
happened before I decided to go
full-time self-employed the 980 hybrid
is installed over there and it's it's no
harder than installing any other
graphics card except for you just have
to mount the radiator which is just four
screws and I love the fact that the
power cord for the fan is built into the
GPU but it has a three pin power
splitter on there so that you can unplug
it and plug it in to say a motherboard
or something if you want to use PWM
control or semi DC control so now the
PWM DC control on your motherboard or
fan controller and you can do it that
way but it moves a pretty good amount of
air in fact it's idle it's barely
turning in fact even the PCB fan on
there's barely turning when you first
plug it in and you turn it on you're
gonna hear some liquid and stuff
bubbling around in there there's some
shifting of air in there once you ship
it around and stuff but it will
stabilize so it's always gonna be a
little bit of air in the system so don't
be like oh my god it's all in one
cooling why that air in it all one
coolers have a little bit of air in
there now I am going to be doing these
tests at 1440p 1080p
you know we already know that's a little
bit this card is a lot a bit overkill
for that but we already know by looking
at other standard benchmarks and stuff
that going with why did that go for K oh
it is 1440 okay we already know that
doing other benchmarks and things with
the 980 s that it's not really 4k ready
a single 980 so we're gonna do 1440 on
this thing now the first thing we're
gonna do here is we're gonna go ahead
and get some baseline readings for
baseline temperatures
let's do Valley benchmark let's just let
that run for a while and then we will
get our our baseline figures on that
don't go away
okay so temperatures on this thing
pretty much stabilized at 46 degrees
Celsius on the core and so we started
applying an overclock here I'm actually
going for a 100 megahertz overclock it
boosted up to 14 55 all by itself so
I've added 100 to the offset and 300 to
the memory offset as well as adding plus
point 86 87 millivolts to it so pretty
standard overclock wasn't even able to
get this far but overclock on my three
nine ladies that are inside skunkworks
so we're gonna do now is just gonna let
the benchmark go we're gonna see what
the temperatures get up to we're gonna
see if it passed this test at this
frequency range and then we'll go ahead
and see exactly how we are we were doing
here I'm interested to see how well the
power target handles how the additional
power target on this seems like a good
idea considering you also have the fan
on the radiator pulling from the card as
well as the blower style fan we all know
that the fans or anything plugged into
the board lighting and all that stuff
take away from the overall power target
of the package of the card so obviously
it makes sense that they'd bump that up
to a hundred and twenty four percent to
make up for the added power draw that's
coming from the stuff plugged into the
card so we'll see how that plays into
overclocking and I'll go ahead and shut
up now and we'll just let it go alright
well it completed the test I consider
that validated we got thirty two hundred
and sixty two on the valid benchmark
score FPS of 78 minimum thirty-four max
149 so let's see if it held that
frequency all the way through and I want
to point out too I'm not hearing any
coil whine on this thing so that's a big
deal this thing set
- fifteen hundred and eighty megahertz
that's whole that that's higher than any
of the three 980 s I have at lunch were
able to uh to achieve Wow
so let's see oh man I would love it if
this thing could hit 16 hundred because
then that would put this guy up into the
980 classified range so I just bumped it
up twenty more let's see if we can hit
1600 well there wasn't an immediate
crash that's a good sign what let's see
if this one passes well much to my
dismay yes I just said dismay I it it
passed so 3275 the score didn't change
much minimum FPS actually went down a
little bit I think we were 34 before
we're at thirty two point eight now max
FPS one forty eight point two average
seventy eight point three so we gained
0.3 on which one I want to say that on
the average so let's go ahead and see if
boost held or if it started throttling
1600 megahertz max temperature is
achieved on this fifty-one degrees
Celsius so it's actually keeping the
thing damn cool the fans are not ramping
up or getting louder our actual power
percentage though on this is only
hitting a hundred and seven percent so
we have power Headroom in this thing you
know it's extremely annoying to want to
play a game like FarCry just to have it
launched steam in an update steam and
then lunch you play
thank God I actually remembered my you
play password and then you say play and
you play and then it brings back up
steam is this where we are in PC gaming
alright now I do have the FPS counter on
here in the left corner so you guys can
see and as you can see this card's just
a little overkill for the menu 2500 FPS
so as you can imagine the inductors
right now are screening over there
because you know the higher the FPS the
more inductor noise there is you know
3,000 fps
you know go go 3,000 FPS or go home
refresh rate 60 it just locks us there
vsync is off graphics quality we'll put
that on ultra alright there we go yes I
want to keep the settings so let's
resume all right so the FPS that you are
seeing right here is far cry at 1440 you
did very pretty
oh god yes I know yeah so we're sitting
in the 60s here very smooth I'm not
seeing any stuttering when I go to turn
so these guys say they're not gonna hurt
me I believe them it seems pretty legit
don't want to talk to me I get it these
guys seem very trustworthy oh it's been
a misunderstanding
let's go get this guy sorry you were in
the way of my knife sir oh yeah hello
peekaboo well your friend was trying to
kill me sir did you go no don't kill me
alright I'm dead so as you can see the
FPS was sitting there nicely locked in
the 70s so let's try something else
looking at the performance history
though we did go to 1600 megahertz and
it pretty much stuck there did throttle
down to 1575 a little bit at one point
power limit and everyone above 112
percent it's set to 124 memory clock
3801 you know times 2 but yeah it's
temperature never went above 54 it's
always a little more demanding in games
than synthetic benchmarks things are
looking really really good with this
graphics card red light metro red light
benchmark you know we're gonna go ahead
and run it at the 1440 extremely
demanding benchmark so let's go ahead
and run that and see how it does
well there we go the 1440p benchmark on
Metro last light is seventy four point
six six average that's actually really
good for 1440p but what I want to point
out too is how quickly this card cools
off we're all the way back down to 36
degrees Celsius and an idle this thing
sits in the low 30s high 20s so yeah I'd
say this card is performing exactly as I
thought it would
now I'm not entirely sure 1600 megahertz
is gonna be achievable for everybody but
this card was able to do it and kept it
at 54 degrees Celsius at the hottest now
my custom loop with the 3 980 s and a
560 rad is also capable of getting up to
50 degrees or 52 degrees Celsius so you
can see the cooling on this is not a
whole lot needed for Maxwell especially
at GM 204 they're extremely efficient I
mean this thing chews through the heat
like fat kids to through cake and I can
say that because I'm fat myself so so
there you go guys if you are looking for
a fantastic overclocker one that looks
great implements very very well
aesthetically and performance wise noise
on this thing and doctors are super
quiet on this hardly any coil whine
whatsoever under normal circumstances
yeah when the menu is at 3,000 frames
per second of course you're gonna hear
something might actually be your EP
growing just a little bit seeing that
FPS even if it was just a loading screen
or a menu but the braided the braided
tubes on this is just like the little
touches on this look fantastic one thing
I didn't test was unplugging that fan to
see if it gave us any more overclocking
ability doubt it would have mattered
since we weren't even going over a
hundred and seven percent on the power
limit so yeah I mean everything about
this card is just fantastic I knew it
was gonna be a good card when I saw at
CES and I'm really glad I got a chance
to take a look at here today
there you go tell me what you guys think
of this card I know I didn't benchmark
or do a lot of that this was more a
video about overclocking in performance
of the cooler itself and the
temperatures
what I was most interested in there's
plenty of 980 benchmarks out there you
guys can go look at I wanted to
emphasize today on the things I like
which is overclocking and temperatures
so there you go follow on social media
if you guys have any questions about
this cooler go and check it out an EVGA
website
brand-spanking-new just launched so it's
gonna be a little bit before you start
seeing more benchmarks on this thing but
I give this thing definitely a thumbs up
it performs very I'm not kidding it
performs better than the ones in
skunkworks
that's kind of a depressing thought I
wasn't going with three Titan X's I'd
probably be mad but I'm not alright guys
thanks for watch
