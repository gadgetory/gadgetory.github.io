is a package that I have been
anticipating now for months and it's
finally here what we're going to look at
right here is in my opinion probably one
of the most exciting small form-factor
cases that I have well been anticipating
and you know what I don't usually have
anything to do with Kickstarter's or
startups but when I was initially
approached about taking a look at this
one months ago and I said contact me
when we're closer to a production model
well I didn't expect to hear anything
back obviously I was wrong
JSU sense is sponsored by precision
camera and video Texas largest
photographer and video retailer located
in Austin for over 40 years
they're giant twenty thousand square
foot showroom floor local workshops and
worldwide shipping are just a few
reasons why you should head right now to
precision - camera calm I mean if I make
a mess it's okay and it has to clean it
so what we're gonna be looking at today
is the ghost s1 case from lope I think
it's how you pronounce it links in the
description below definitely worth
checking out it's a Swedish company so I
could be mutilating the name I'm sorry
if I am if you give me an idea of how
small this is this is a box in a box and
then it's inside the box so as you can
see the case just keeps getting smaller
and smaller one of the few times in life
were smaller is sometimes better ask me
how I know now I'm gonna go ahead and
just start off by saying that this case
right here on the surface to me looks an
awful lot like the n1 but don't let that
fool you because this right here is
quite a bit different
vexy make sure not missing anything if
we got some screws it's also important
to point out that this is a
pre-production model but they are really
close to doing production on this so so
if you guys want to learn more about it
though definitely go to the description
box below or you can learn more so this
is the ash gray and this to give you an
idea of its size is not even big enough
to hold
a pair of my shoes that you can like see
straight through that there is so much
ventilation on this comes in two colors
ash gray and arctic white oh man so
everything on this is milled out of a
solid block of aluminum or aluminium
1320 individually milled holes in each
side panel which is pretty amazing look
at that man we're gonna do a teardown
here we're gonna mock up a couple of
parts on there we've got some
fingerprints I was kind of hoping for
the white one because the white would
have showed a lot less fingerprints but
that's okay yeah I don't even know where
to start this is so cool so one of the
things that makes this quite different
is the fact that it is modular so I just
took the top off for here this is
referred to as a top hat I mean it comes
with three different size top has a
small medium enlarge but the base
dimensions on this are 183 millimeters
high 140 millimeters wide 320
millimeters long so that is it right
there like I said this is about the size
of one of my shoes I feel like taking my
shoe off just to compare it for size but
then you guys are see how big my feet
are and I don't want y'all to get
jealous so but that said this is the
extra large or the large top hat right
here which adds an additional 65
millimeters on here so that we can mount
things up here like radiators extra fans
they sent me the larger top hat so that
I could kind of go balls to the wall
with cooling because this is water
cooling friendly now that's what makes
this quite a bit different than other
small form-factor cases like this is the
fact that it is completely modular one
of the struggles of building and small
form factors are in this one here
significantly small form factor we'll
call it s SF F is the fact of space
constraints and what that usually have
to make quite a few trade-offs in terms
of what parts can you fit in there it's
very streamlined in that only a few
parts on the market to fit like small
form-factor graphics cards you know you
guys have all seen the short stubby
graphics cards there is of course you
know small form-factor power supplies or
sfx which is gonna be needed in this
case right here as well but building in
it has always been extremely difficult
because it's hard to get a hands on
especially if you can only build from
one side like typical small form-factor
cases are but what's cool about this guy
the ghost s1 all the sides come off you
build onto the spine which is the main
structure and then you put everything
back on around it this comes off this is
actually the bottom right here you can
tell that it's got the rubber feets but
you can see on there you've got your
mounts for your fans and radiators
because the cool part is the top hat you
just saw me take off the top you can
also put on the bottom so you can extend
the bottom of it you can extend the top
of it so you could have fans on the
bottom pushing air through all the way
up I think I'm gonna I'm gonna ask for
another another top hat so that I can do
that because I really want to sort of
experience that oh yeah so I did do it
right see this guy slides out that's one
of the side panels right there there's
that this is one of the other side
panels and now you can see we've got
what we are dubbing here our spine so we
have also got in here our front panel
connectors because it has an aluminum
button right here
let's get satisfying click sound to it
quality buttons but as you can see we
also have our PCIe 16x Gen 3 riser card
because as you can see your graphics
card mounts on you know right here on
the opposite side of where your
motherboard goes so your motherboards
gonna go here your graphics card is
gonna go on the back side over here and
I'm gonna actually kind of mock that up
right now so you can see unfortunately I
don't have an SFX power supply I could
have swore I did maybe what to check the
inventory but this is the spine this is
what you build on and then like you saw
you just put all the side panels back on
when you're done now the riser card is
also 100% shielded so that's gonna be
nice no interference there and the riser
card is also rigid mounted so yeah let's
go and see how it looks when we start
putting a few parts in there so I think
a Titan XP would look pretty damn good
in here considering the fact that it's
black and it matches the case but I want
to show you how much room you actually
have for custom graphics cards even in
this ultra small form-factor build here
so we just mount it right onto our riser
car
you would actually clamp it down with
this piece right here but look at all
the extra room you have you've got your
PCI Express power cables right here
which just line up with this knotch
plenty of room between the side panel
slide this back on just to show you BAM
and then that pulls in fresh air through
this part right here and exhausted out
the back as you can see fairly separated
from where the motherboard and cooler
are gonna go so the graphics card has
its own compartment which is very vain
nice to keep it from interfering but
what if you have a custom graphics card
so if it's greater than two slot and
longer than 305 millimeters it's not
going to fit it will fit higher cards so
let's test that let's push that to the
limit with the 1080i kingpin look at the
size of this card versus the case that
is massive okay we got this we got this
point out so close get in there go to
your home
so unfortunately with the kingpin we're
also impacting right here it's about a
quarter inch off but it impacts right
there it's this piece that we're hitting
on and even with this angle we're
talking millimeters off so here's the
thing if I were building in this today
and I really wanted this to fit I would
Dremel that a little bit not the cooler
the case because it's barely barely
barely not fitting so when we go to
building this I'm actually gonna be
doing a water-cooled version of this
this case will be water-cooled graphics
card and CPU it's definitely gonna be
worth checking out honestly though if I
was gonna be going with an air-cooled
graphics card in this I would rather
just go with a Founders Edition or a
blower style card simply because then
the case isn't responsible for taking
any of the heat out if you haven't
noticed there's no fans anywhere in this
case yet we can mount fans to this
especially if we're going with air
cooling or water cooling but you can
mount fans to the top and the bottom to
kind of force a top-to-bottom airflow
which is what I would do but ultimately
the graphics card then won't be relying
on the case to exhaust the air and
especially if you're going with like a
massive three fan cooler like
and that kingpin card then it's gonna
have well the case is gonna have its cut
work cut out for it to exhaust it so
once you have the bracket actually you
know mounted down in the back and then
with the rigid you know riser card right
there mounted to the chassis you can see
you could actually hold and move around
by the graphics card that's how sturdy
it is so that's kind of a nice thing
now I'm using a z97 board here just as
sort of a mock-up but I think I'm gonna
go with I kind of want to throw as much
power into this as I can this might be
where I actually put my either my 7700 K
or maybe even my 8700 K simply just for
the like over-the-top ridiculous factor
so the standoffs are pre-installed I'm
not gonna bother putting the i/o on
here's again this is just a mock-up but
it's that so motherboard and graphics
card are installed I love the fact that
they're separated when it comes to CPU
coolers though you've got a maximum
height of 66 millimetres clearance
before you hit the side panel right here
so small form-factor coolers are going
to be a thing that you're gonna have to
go shopping for I know quite a few
brands and make them so it would
basically have to clear this as you can
see that's the amount of height that you
have to work with but the nice thing is
that especially if it's a down fire
because most of the small form-factor
stuff that you flying is gonna be a down
fire but because you have all of this
ventilation right here it's gonna be
pulling the air directly from the cool
side blowing it down on all the
components you're VRMs your memory your
south roll your chipset once at
Southbridge going backwards there your
chipset as well as your CPU and
components so that's gonna be a nice
feature to have and I do wish that we
had a little bit longer sleet or cord
right here for our front panel simply
because I'm not convinced like if I was
running I guess it would barely fit like
I would fit underneath the power supply
right here this is where your sfx power
supply would go they recommended that we
go well they recommended the Celsius s
24 or then the NZXT mostly because of
the rigid rigidness the rigidity think
rigidity is the word I want right the
rigidity of the tubes because the
problem here is going to be if you have
really stiff tubes and
if you've got really stiff cooling pipes
then it's gonna be hard to get it in
place because once you start adding like
this is where a custom loop would
actually be kind of nice because then
you can have the length be exactly what
you need it to be so you won't have a
bunch of excess if you're dealing with a
IO then obviously you've got a length of
K of tubing here that's meant for like a
much bigger case which means you've got
way more than you actually need in fact
it looks like I might need to slide this
over slightly too because there might be
too close to the end right here I see
this though being a bit of a challenge
to build in I don't think they're
denying that this is a challenge even
though they're making it a lot more
friendly because of the fact that you
wouldn't a components today they're
designed for bigger cases you've got
longer fan cables you've got longer
cooling pipes the power supply cable
length fortunately SFX is usually very
short because they're like well this is
not going in a full tower so we don't
need all that length but you know you're
still gonna have a lot of cables to have
to deal with inside here so that's
something that you know tends to be a
little bit of a challenge when you're
building in cases this small take the
top hat and put that into place
so there you can see we have two fans
right here what's cool is the fans are
kind of split between compartments
you've got some on the radiator or the
the CPU side some on the GPU side but
you can see that this is creating
obviously a negative pressure situation
only but then I see about the top hats
is you can stack them you can add more
top hats on this so I could go with the
medium top hat which will add about
another what is the 25 or 26 millimeters
around there to be able to put two more
fans on here for push-pull if I want it
or likewise I could put it on the bottom
put two fans on the bottom pull an air
through pushing through the bottom of
the case up to the top creating a very
neutral cross flow which would be really
good for the cooling of this case but
because all of this all four sides top
bottom and sides but are fully vented
like as you can see we definitely are
not going to have a problem when it
comes to cooling now what about things
like cable management and such so cable
management on here is pretty well
thought out as well right because we've
got our tubes running
right here now they did mention that
there's some stuff that they're still
working on to make this a little bit
more friendly for water-cooling they're
gonna have points here to zip tie down
your tubing especially if you're going
with a custom water-cooled loop the
length on this appears to be perfect
though the NZXT Kraken anyway
they recommend the Kraken or I think I
already said the Esther the 24 from
fractal design because of their much
softer tubing and that allows you to
actually be able to bend this tubing as
you need it so your ram and stuff goes
right there it's going to clear this
cable as you can see routes around this
is the extension wire for the wall plug
so it routes around they're actually
upgrading this part right here to be a
screw in instead of a snap in like it is
right now so that's going to be changing
but then all of your cables will
actually come out your modular cables
hopefully they're modular will come out
this side that's why you have this big
notch right here so then you can easily
have everything wired up and that's kind
of what it would look like too if we had
the well there's feet right they go on
the bottom is feet to get it up off the
ground so it would end up looking
something you know sort of like this if
we had the top hat on the bottom I kind
of think I'm gonna do a top hat top and
bottom when I do my build that way we're
getting good airflow through the case
but you know what guys I'm gonna head
and go this has been pretty exciting I
was looking forward to this they've
contacted me months ago I very very
rarely get involved with any sort of
startup or crowd fund campaign or any of
that but this one caught my attention
fully modular small form-factor ultra
small form factor that's modular
expandable looks good and the build
quality is insane these guys are in
Sweden and they're this is a this is a
passion for them and obviously it shows
in their level of craftsmanship right
here so tell me what you guys think in
the comments below I'll put links to
where you can learn more about this and
when it's going to be fully retail
available and ready I'm glad to see that
they are still tweaking the design a
little bit to make it you know a little
more appealing but yeah I'm excited to
build in this guy I might go for a white
one though I think the white would look
really good especially when it comes to
dust and stuff but all right so what'd
you guys think thanks for watching and
I'll see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
