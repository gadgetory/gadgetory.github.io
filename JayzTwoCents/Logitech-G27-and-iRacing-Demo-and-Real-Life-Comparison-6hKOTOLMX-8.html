two cents and a while back I picked
myself up a logitech g27 racing wheel
here is a racing wheel I guess I could
just be a driving wheel if you kind of
just want to cruise around and like
grocery simulator probably wouldn't sell
too well but I did a video where I did
some assetto corsa driving set to it you
know a commentary where I talked about
some computer water cooling myths and
things you guys had some interesting
comments like wow you really suck or you
can't drive or you need to set your
wheel up and stuff and so I've gone
ahead and done that I've set the wheel
up here for some iRacing and I'm getting
a text message I've set the wheel up
here with some eye racing I'm just going
to kind of give a quick my thoughts on
the wheel I'm not going to go into how
to set it up or anything like that
but we're gonna we're going to do some
laps here with some eye racing and just
kind of give you some general feedback
on how I feel about the logitech g27 and
how it compares to the real thing now
the force feedback on this uh you know
I'm not a fan of the force feedback now
I do like that it gets nice and tight
what it is I know but I do like that it
gets tight in the turns I do like that
when you let go of it the wheel wore on
a snack that snap back to Center because
it feels like a real resistance of
turning like a real car what I don't
like is the way that the wheel will I'll
kind of try and demonstrate this right
now it's the way the wheel it's not even
really doing it right now see if I'm
good to do it there it see how it kind
of bounces like that sometimes the wheel
would just sit there and go Moin Moin
Moin Moin Moin Moin Moin Moin Moin Moin
without even touching see if I can get
it to do it no not really but anyway
sometimes it'll just sit there and
bounce around but what I really don't
like about force feedback is the fact
that the game tries to translate the
bumps in the road to the steering wheel
and if you guys know anything about cars
you know most of the bumps don't
translate into bump steer front-wheel
drive cars yeah but rear-wheel drive
cars all wheel drive cars the bumps
don't translate to the wheel doing that
they translate to your
in the feeling you know the the seat of
your pants and the way your body reacts
not the wheel so I can see why Berkeley
is on his racing sim is going with the
transducers because he's transferring
those bumps and stuff to your butt which
is where you really feel it not in the
wheel so what I've pretty much done in
almost every game is I've tuned out a
lot of the bumps to the steering wheel
and made it just so it gets tight in the
turns and it has some some feedback of
the road so I can tell when it road is
bumpy I've gone over a bump but I don't
like having all of the the road
roughness transferred into the steering
wheel I don't like that at all the
shifter paddles on here are really
really nice
you've got buttons on here that you can
program like this button here on the
technically that's the top right right
there I made it so I can look to the
right that buttons look to the left this
button down here on the bottom right is
talk you got all kinds of buttons over
here on the shifter I don't use any of
those except for reset and iRacing
paddle shifters feel really nice and the
steering wheel does not I mean it does
not come off the desk election tightened
down you can see I'm moving my whole
desk around trying to move the thing
same thing with the shifter I mean you
can yank this thing off the desk if you
wanted but chances are you're not going
to hurt it now the shifter is nice it's
got a nice leather boot here and
pleather pleather boot here it's got
some buttons you can program a d-pad the
shifters ok the thing I hate about
having it on the desk like it is is I'm
used to shifting you know I'm driving
and reaching down and shifting not going
forward like that I mean Honda's have
some shifters up on the dash but you
know this is this doesn't feel right
very realistic it's not the g20 7s fault
it's the fact that I'm sitting in a desk
chair to have it attached to my desk now
the pedals are actually kind of nice
they are and it's actually really dusty
so anyway the pedals are very nice
they're metal they have nice look I'm
going in Reverse now they have nice
feedback on them they're not you know
load cell pedals so they're not going to
you know they're not going to change
resistance as the braking resistance in
the simulator gets more difficult so I
mean that would be nice but you know
again for something that comes with a
kit they're really not so bad
you can disassemble this and attach
these to a bar or something if you
wanted to you know say hang them like
real petals will be most petals don't
protrude from your floor they come out
from the firewall like that so that
would be much much more realistic but
anyway what I do like is there are
mounted threads on the bottom of this
you could mount it to a simulator it's
also got this little piece that pops out
here where you can get some nice grip on
carpet if I can get to come back out so
anyway these are kind of nice I know
they're not the best pedals in the
market but they're not bad either
the brake pedal the clutch and the gas
pedal are really close together
but you can actually loosen up the the
clutch pedal and move it over more if
you want more distance between them
which is you know good I haven't done
that but I've gotten used to it I don't
recommend running these without socks on
your feet are going to start to feel
really raw because they are metal and it
start to get very uncomfortable actually
so anyway let's go ahead and just turn a
couple of laps here and we'll go ahead
and just get my opinion as we're kind of
driving you guys can see I'm not that
bad of a driver iRacing is the most
realistic physics wise that I've
encountered yet the graphics aren't so
bad we the wheel won't stop moving it's
clinking around over here so that's one
of the things I don't like is it's just
got this mind of its own but as you can
see the screen versus my wheel bits
pretty much dialed in you know so that
the screen wheel and my wheel are pretty
much the same so anyway let's go ahead
and let's do it let's turn a couple of
laps so you guys can see how I feel
about the wheel and you can see I'm not
the world's worst driver I gather and
turn some laps and not turn this thing
into a demolition derby the love of God
hey guys I am driving the BMW z4 gt3
here at Lime Rock this is one of the
download cars on the first lap you don't
want to get too crazy you just want to
warm up the tires and one of the things
I've noticed about the z4 is the fact
that it's a very very heavy understeer
car it grips really really well in the
rear it just doesn't I don't know a
understeer was really really badly
especially compared to the v8s
this is actually my first time driving
this car here at Lime Rock I typically
will drive either the Mazda here or the
Cadillac cts-v are get a little break
here
it's one of the things I noticed though
is that the z4 really likes to turn
under throttle as with most most cars
with the z4 more so than other cars I've
noticed we are getting sixth gear in the
front straight here as with most of
these GT cars they do not have anti-lock
brakes so you've got to be very careful
when you get on the brakes but I can
tell you that the z4 really does like
Lime Rock here we'll go and get on a
little bit more that last lap was just a
warm-up
this jump here is always kind of a fun
one
I love this track I've never driven this
track in real life but I could see it
being a whole lot of fun oh we're going
off the track hang on to it hang on to
it there we go
that's one of the things I think that
determines a good racer from a bad racer
is recovery everyone's going to have
mistakes in a race it's just how well do
you recover from that mistake
same thing in real life too I mean you
never run a perfect lap when you do you
never ever repeat it either but we all
make our mistakes and it has to do with
how you recover now if you look at the
wheel I want you to notice I'm going to
let go on this turn see how the wheel
straightens itself back out that feels
just like real life I mean if you don't
have a feedback wheel of course it's not
going to do that but whew got a little
light on that
okay this is the turn a lot of people
have trouble with there we go we got a
little bit up on the rumble strip but
it's alright
a lot of people seem to have a lot of
trouble with turn one and two right here
though it's a flat turn it's a
decreasing radius so it gets tighter as
you go through it the S turn I like to
take a little wide when I can that was
not a good example of it oh oh
oh my god
alright let's do one more left do a cold
lap here so I can do on cold slippery
tires
once you also notice I am not running a
driving line that was a bad line to that
turn I got off the turn really slow as
with most turns and any track in any car
it's not how you enter the turn it's how
you exit the turn if you've got a shitty
entrance you're gonna have a shitty exit
and it makes a difference
as you can see by my ghost model there
it was a bad entrance I was decelerating
through the entrance so got off of it
slower coming out and it really affected
it
is that understeer I can feel it
OOP
back left tires in the dirt that was
scary all right one more lap guys I
don't probably getting bored but man
it's just like being on track again
they will do the wide turn through here
so it lines me up tight as I exit the
turn so I can go nope can't go
full-throttle I actually got on the
break
Oh anyway there we go guys
Jason's here sucking nuts am i racing
and I got some good they got some good
laps in there but anyway guys as always
I hope you've enjoyed the video and if
not thumbs it down you liked it give two
thumbs up
log on your grandma's account give it a
thumbs up and as always see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
