know over the years I have talked about
some of the most expensive water cooling
parts that you can buy at even done a a
guide back in 2013 that was like the
eight hundred dollar loop which is
actually pretty cheap by today's
standards but I digress you know what
I've never actually talked about is some
of the cheapest water cooling stuff that
you can buy and that's why today we're
gonna take a little water block that I
bought off Amazon for $17.99
it's $19.99 now went up two bucks since
since I got it believe this we're gonna
talk about whether or not a super cheap
water block for 19 bucks can actually
handle something like an 80 700 k
today's video is brought to you by
precision camera and video and their new
YouTube video kids step up your online
presence with these hand-picked kits
tailored specifically for various price
points which include everything you need
to get started in video creation right
now if you use promo code J's two cents
at checkout you get an extra hood man 32
gig steel card with the purchase of any
kit for all your camera and video needs
head to precision - video calm water
blocks are one of those things where a
lot of science has gone into them lately
with things like micro channels and flow
plates and jet plates and this and that
I think what that is all about is just
trying to make sure you get an even flow
of water over the plate but there's only
one thing contacting the CPU heat
spreader and that's obviously the base
and as you can see on this one here it's
definitely made in China
no doubt about it this is just a cover
that's all right there it's not exactly
the prettiest looking copper but it's
pretty smooth let's take a look at the
inside here it's got of course it's
gonna have an o-ring has have an o-ring
but what's interesting about this block
is the fact that it has integrated Intel
and AMD bracket on it okay so here's
what it looks like right here it's
pretty basic you've got your base you
got your plate right here which
interestingly enough the the micro
channels here look like they're milled
very well but they they're milled into
the plate instead of some plates which
are raised higher and then they mill
down the outside to do the micro
channels so that the micro channels are
actually raised this has to go down
through the plate and back out so it's a
little bit different than say something
like your EK water block
we've got an o-ring right here which has
a hair in it that's weird the long
blonde hair okay
whatever so yeah but it's got a channel
that it fits in right here here's the
pot I think this is palm like a palm
material I doubt it's an acetal I guess
it could be but you can see it sort of
forces the flow there's not a labeled
Inlet and outlet because as you can see
it's just a square the flow is identical
it's symmetrical so that is the that is
the engineering behind this block now
let's talk about why I had these
motherboards laid out here and although
this looks like an a sponsored video I
swear it's not it's just the only
motherboards I have for Z 370 which is
what my 8700 K obviously needs but I
wanted to talk about compatibility with
motherboards because they have all the
prongs mounting for a m3 this is not a
m4 compatible by the way so if you guys
are running Rison sorry but am3+ and
backwards and Intel all pretty much all
the Intel LGA 775 and up sockets are
going to be supported the issue is
because it sticks out so far I was
concerned about it impacting with
various things so take a look at our
Strix z 370 right here
you can see we have no problems we don't
impact on the heatsink there or there
flip it around the other way if you want
to do a horizontal it again doesn't
impact with anything and it's sitting on
the CPU it's not touching any of the
chokes so we're good now if we move on
over here to the Maximus X apex board
you can see we've got the cover on there
but as you can see we do start to impact
right here so we technically might be
able to fit nope that doesn't fit that
way so if we turn it this way we
actually can mount it we actually will
be fine like that although once we take
the cover off right here I might as well
do that now but yeah with the CPU in
place we still cleared just fine so the
only way that the block can mount on
this guy is with the and that's really
close actually might even be slightly
crooked because it impacts right there
on that heatsink so you're gonna have to
mount this one vertical with the
fittings on top of each other you're not
going to be able to do it this way
because as you can see it impacts there
now that's not to say you can't just
take a dremel and hack it off well it
looks like we have to use a Strix borer
after all because once we get the posts
in place right they ate sinners itself
no matter what based on where it's going
to go right we can't move it along this
rail but it is impacting right there
like I mean we're talking like a half a
millimeter I could bust up my file and
file that and make it fit no problem you
want to be able to see that once its
installed and if we cared about it that
much we could flatten out all the other
four so it matches but it's a 22 all our
water block what do you expect ha ha
modified see I can't mod stuff he's a
file something else I just noticed too
and some of you might have noticed when
I was showing it earlier is if you turn
it this way these tabs over hang onto
the memory sticks so you're probably
gonna be hack sawing drilling stuff
anyway so just expects that an all the
one fit like this is going to require
some level of modification this is
supposed to be just a stupid block
review not a tool what is open
I never mounted this down because I was
like I don't want it to always be
mounted to the table so that's why I
never ended up using it I think that
this is a very accurate representation
though of what a buyer will be going
through so that's why this stuff is
always left in do as I say not as I do
I don't have any safety glasses here so
I have to do it this way
most important parts I expect nothing
more for a $20 block but all the times
you always recommend it's sharpie it was
like we should just sharpie I know
especially a proud moment for you it's
like a crab we've got the ek supremacy
block on here which is like my go-to
block and it has been for a while now
and we've been running a 264 trial
version because my ki expired apparently
but as you can see we actually haven't
been climbing at all now we've got a 360
millimetre radiator on here which is a
lot for a single CPU 8700 K runs hot and
we are overclocking it to 4.9 gigahertz
and as you can see these are the temps
and where they've equalized so this is
max right here ADC 79 81 81 77 79 now a
TC is 25 Celsius away from thermal
Junction max so what that tells us is we
have quite a bit of headroom obviously
what's interesting the how is it it
freaked out at some point because we've
been letting this run long enough
looking for temperature fluctuations or
a stabilization of temps and as you can
see we've achieved that okay at some
point decided it had been running for
one point well just just under 1.2
million hours but okay can't say I
didn't run it long enough I'm going to
go ahead and install this little guy one
of the thing worth pointing out too is
the fan profile on this is set to turbo
and PWM so we do have the 360 radiators
with three fans on they're not there
they're not set to silent by any means
so every now and then I have a video and
I'm like this will be easy piece of cake
easy video get it done actually get home
in time for dinner for once and yeah
inevitably what happens the same is
every single time so what I learned is
when I was like I'm just going to use
the same standoffs and stuff as EK block
is EK blocks hanging down below their
bracket a little bit more than these
then this guy does so once it came down
and hit that the plate didn't push down
against the CPU and as I said at the
beginning of this video
I lost the hardware that came with this
so now here I am having to fashion my
own mounting mechanism fortunately
though because it's Intel it's pretty
easy so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
taking these these are six 32nd screw
right here so what I'm doing is I'm just
threading them through the back plate
for the ek supremacy block for the intel
socket sets and this is gonna push up
through the motherboard which I can then
take the spring-loaded retentions
because the springs and the caps are
also 630 second which is extremely
common in the PC realm usually m34
metric or six thirty Seconds per
standard or what you're gonna find so
I'm now making my own back plate so it's
no doubt that this is a pretty block but
you know I actually really like the look
of this one too with the the four silver
screws on there with the hardware that
we kind of Jimmy rig together ourself so
anyway you know what we got to do now
these are our initial temps right here
looks like we're in the low 30s to mid
30s at idle which is pretty much
identical to what we were seeing with
the ek block four point nine gigahertz
still all identical settings all voltage
same thermal paste same fans they set up
same everything so you know the routine
we're gonna start the test where let it
run for a while and see what happens you
see the initial temperatures though not
bad the second it starts up what happens
when we let it take a little while
alright just like before you can see
we're not having any steady temperature
climb for the moment we started the test
moving forward now eleven minutes in
there's no client fact I started to
start to decline a low right there if we
look at our temperatures from left to
right we've got an 82 81 83 82 79 and 79
if we compare that to before it's an
average of 2 to 3 C higher per core
except for the last core it's exactly
the same 2 to 3 C difference if you look
right here look this is the distance of
t.j.maxx that's how much more we would
have to rise before we actually start to
thermal throttle now remember these are
Peaks those are max temperatures that
means for a split second it might have
hit that temp and come back depending on
the test that's being done we are
stressing CPU
pew n cash so this right here is more
demanding and more taxing on a CPU than
just about any process you could give it
doing normal workflows and day to day
work so it's going to be a lot lower
when you're doing your normal workflow
than something like this but look at the
actual real time temperatures we're
sitting in the 60s to the 70s dropping
down to the 50s on a $19 waterblock from
Amazon obviously if we were running
stock speeds it would be much lower into
the 40s and 50s I'm not gonna bother
even doing that test because this shows
you what the worst-case scenario would
be aesthetically I think it looks pretty
damn good given the price build quality
it's not leaking I mean as long as that
Oh ring doesn't disintegrate by any
means I still don't know what the red oh
ring is made out of you know put in the
comments below but guys I think there's
no doubt about it the takeaway from this
is when you're buying water blocks yeah
there's a lot of technology and stuff
that goes into them but you know I think
it really comes down to maybe just
buying the block that aesthetically
meets your build more so than thinking
one brand is superior to another because
really like I said they're chasing
they're chasing tenths of a see now
anyway links to this block are gonna be
down the description below like I said
19 bucks on Amazon you can't beat it the
reason why I have this block is I'm
putting together the cheapest possible
loop that I can using old-school methods
from like Home Depot and old radiator
cores from cars and stuff to try and do
it the old-fashioned way and the only
piece I was planning on buying is that
trying to make from scratch is a water
block so I got this one for 19 bucks but
stay tuned for that video anyway like I
said link down below thanks for watching
guys and as always I'll see you in the
next one man that was just leave it on
there
