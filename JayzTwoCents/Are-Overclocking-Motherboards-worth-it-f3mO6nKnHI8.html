trying to answer some of the most common
questions I find often in my inbox maybe
I should actually start some sort of an
inbox series I don't know you guys tend
to fuel a lot of the content that you
see on this channel so that's why it's
important that I do these topics that
might seem like common sense to a lot of
people but for people just starting out
and really getting overwhelmed with a
lot of the information that's out there
on the internet when it comes to
selecting your PC parts I'm just trying
to put it right here in more of a
layman's terms that you can understand
and get yourself up and running without
too much confusion and today we're going
to talk about overclocking motherboards
when you need them and do you even
really need them at all all using my
voice here great now before we dive into
today's topic I want to thank today's
sponsor lynda.com slash J but I'm about
to teach you some things here about
motherboards but if you like to learn
and you want to continue learning at the
end of this video look in the
description of this video and you will
find a link over to lynda.com where you
guys can learn anything you want on
thousands and thousands of tutorials and
topics you can teach yourself 3d
printing programming if you're an
aspiring content creator you can learn
video editing you can learn production
value you can learn all about
videography photography and just step
your entire game up to the next level
and you can check it all out for free
for 10 days by clicking the link down in
the description it's lynda.com slash J
that's ly NDA com /j hey why not the
letter J the whole name it's only three
letters it's not that hard to remember
now I've done videos before about
motherboards and I'm not going to get
into depth about all the different
components on the motherboard we're
going to talk today specifically about
overclocking and our overclocking
motherboards really all they're cracked
up to be
now typically you'll find that the
overclocking branded motherboards like
we're looking at right here with this
MSI X power titanium Edition which I
want to say might very well be one of
the sexiest motherboards I think I have
ever seen
I will be doing a full review of this I
will be doing a build with this
utilizing this sort of a titanium and
black theme but that's for another video
at the risk of being one of those guys
who tease videos well in advance but at
least I want you guys to know what
coming up but as with that said this is
a top tier motherboard it is designed
towards overclocking their X power and
empower brand of motherboards have
always been tailored towards
overclockers and the question is what
makes us an overclocking motherboard and
do you need it well first of all you'll
find that the overclocking motherboards
like I said tend to be the top tier
motherboards so they come with a lot
more features than just the overclocking
perimeters and specifications that
you'll find on this motherboard for
instance you'll find better audio
built-in usually you'll find better NICs
built in this one happens to have USB
3.1 gen2 on here which is not a type-c
connector which is really unfortunate
there's no type-c but you're going to
find that there is going to be
additional features like on-the-fly
overclocking button controls this thing
here can actually come off and has a
cable that you can control this outside
of your pc you've got these additional
overclocking buttons here tons and tons
of different SATA types of connections
SATA Express just lots and lots of
features but usually in order to get
something that's branded as being you
know overclocking Specht you get a lot
of that extra stuff which is what really
bumps up the price now something else
that really bumps up the price is
overclocking motherboards tend to have a
lot more design in their power delivery
system and that is what's most important
when it comes to overclocking now in the
instance here the X power gaming here
from MSI you will find that there are 16
power phases on this thing now what does
that mean what is a power phase well
first of all you've got to take the 12
volt that is being sent from the power
supply to the CPU and step that down
anywhere usually between one point one
volts and 1.5 volts depending on your
level of overclock now when you step
down voltage like that especially when
you're stepping it down that far from 12
volts down to one point whatever there
is quite a bit of heat that can build up
in there now the reason why more power
phases is important is because as you
step that voltage down from 12 volts
down to one point let's just say three
which is where I tend to keep my CPUs
that is a that's quite a bit of
difference there and that power has to
be filtered down to that lower usable
voltage for the CPU otherwise it would
just instantly explode and then what
you're going to end up with is just that
Herbal burnt smell that you get when you
fry an electronic now the more power
phases you have the more filters that
electricity is going to go through
before it steps down to that final
voltage you're really kind of spreading
out that load amongst all of those
phases so what that means is the overall
power delivery system for the CPU is
going to run much cooler and much more
efficient because as those VRMs get
really hot they started to become more
unstable which can lead to BS ODS or
blue screens of death or the smiley face
of death depending on which edition of
Windows that you're on and you're going
to get just overall system instabilities
at least when it comes to the power
delivery there's other factors involved
involved when it comes to blue screens
of death but that's just one of them the
other thing is you're going to get a
much higher quality component on here
you're going to get better ferrite
chokes on here you're going to get
better MOSFETs on here and better quite
honestly costs more when it comes to
these circuits and things so that's why
the pricing is up quite a bit on these
overclocking motherboards now what
you'll also find on overclocking
motherboards is additional places to
plug in power so you've got your 8 pin
EPS power here for your CPU it gets its
own dedicated 12 volt and ground that
goes to just it but you also get an
auxilary because as you start to really
bump up that voltage going to the CPU
bumping up that overclock there's a much
more demand on the power delivery system
so you can supplement that power in case
the 8 pin ends up not being enough
you've got additional power auxilary
power going into there to keep that load
line very very steady that's another
thing that can happen too is as you
overclock the CPU and it goes in and out
of demand different demand states you
can get what's called V Group which is
where the voltage will drop below the
user specified voltage and then you get
blue screens and crashes and stuff
because it was temporarily too low to
maintain the overclock that you set
higher end overclocking motherboards
also have better what's called V Group
specifications and parameters built in
to really limit the chance of getting V
droop in your system now something else
you'll notice with overclocking
motherboards is they tend to advertise
if they have a higher content of gold in
the socket which is what they're
actually coating the pins with to get a
better contact between the pin and
CPU now I've never heard anyone say that
that's true or not true that higher gold
content actually makes a difference when
it comes to overclocking stability
however you'll find that a lot of the
manufacturers will advertise that
they've got more gold content in the CPU
because remember there's gold in them
their sockets right there you know
there's gold go mine for gold that was
bad I know but overall you will find
that the construction of overclocking
grade motherboards are just beefed here
and these things are complete beefcake
when it comes to the way that they're
designed they're thicker PCBs there are
thicker traces better materials used all
around now most motherboards even ones
that are not you know branded as
overclocking motherboards will give you
control over parameters like B clock and
multiplier and voltage and v droop only
usually you have a much more dumbed down
version of those settings which are very
basic but it does allow you to overclock
your processors but it doesn't mean that
they're necessarily ready or the best
idea to push your CPUs as far as you can
with those because one thing that
happens as you overclock your cpu is you
start to get a very exponential curve of
heat with added voltage now MSI actually
had an issue with the 970 SLI crate
Edition motherboard which a lot of folks
bought it because it was inexpensive it
was under a hundred bucks and they
started putting in things like you know
8350 CPUs or 83 70s and overclocking
them and then started finding that they
were frying their motherboards because
they were only three phases and they
were all that heat was being drawn
through just three phases and vm's and
MOSFETs and then they were just
literally just combusting and popping
and breaking left and right but that's
something to keep in mind is that as you
overclock you draw a lot of heat through
that socket just for instance the 8350
is 125 watt CPU but when you overclock
that thing it draws over 220 watts that
is nearly double what the the actual
motherboard was designed to handle so
unless you get something designated as
overclocking mild overclocks at best
would be moderately recommended even
even some motherboards are not going to
be performing very well with mild
overclock so start to see things getting
very
very very hot on the motherboard another
thing to that mentioned before I get out
of here is that overclocking branded
motherboards also tend to have better
cooling solutions built in for the power
delivery all the heat sinks that you see
around the CPU are directly touching the
VRMs to allow as much cooling as
possible so that's why even when your
water cooling your CPUs you have to have
some sort of airflow going through your
case otherwise the motherboards going to
get quite a bit hot anyway guys thanks
for watching today's video I'm going to
be getting into some much more higher
content quality you know production
value stuff I know the talking head
videos a lot of you like I personally
want to do more than just sit here and
talk to you guys and just do data dump
of knowledge on top of you don't want to
dump my knowledge on you well I do want
to dump my knowledge on you but I want
to do it creatively and fun and we'll be
getting to that point soon like I said
the shop is just about setup I've got
some builds going like I said I might be
doing it build with this badass looking
motherboard when I when I requested this
motherboard I asked for an X power but I
forgot all about the titanium Edition
and this is the one that they sent me
normally the X power is black and yellow
but this thing yeah this is going to
lead to some options when it comes to
colors and I think it is going to look
freaking awesome anyway guys time to get
out of here thanks for watching again
let me know what topics you want me to
cover this video is directly derived
from my inbox so if you guys want to see
me do some sort of an inbox series where
I just do this type of video let me know
they're easy to make they really give
you guys a lot of knowledge and insider
information on overclocking and water
cooling things like that and I'll
continue to do it if that's what you
want to see anyway I'm rambling now it's
time to go I'll see you guys in the next
