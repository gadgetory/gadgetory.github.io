on all three of Intel's new caseview
processors the i7 7700 K the i5 7600 K
and you're hearing it right the i3 7350
K we finally have a case q i3 processor
what is it worth buying I don't know
let's find out I always have a hard time
at doing CPU benchmarks and the reason
being is everyone's use case is a bit
different and it's really hard to apply
any sort of across-the-board testing
methodology that is going to apply to
everybody so instead what I've decided
to do here is kind of utilize the common
thread through most people who watch my
channel and that being gaming and a
little bit of overclocking yeah their
case Q processors if I didn't overclock
these even a little bit it would really
did get negate the purpose of getting
case Q in the beginning so what I've
done to try and give us the best apples
to apples comparison crop across all
three of these CPUs as I'm running them
at 4.7 gigahertz
that's a 500 megahertz overclock to the
turbo clock to both the i7 and the i3
and interestingly enough a 700 megahertz
overclock to the boost clock of the i-5
for some reason the i-5 has a turbo
clock of 3.8 where the other two have a
turbo clock is a 4.2 I don't understand
that which is really interesting I don't
know I don't know why they did that but
anyway I've locked all three of them at
4.7 gigahertz to give us the best direct
comparison between these three as we
possibly can
now the rest of my testing system is a
z2 70 asrock gaming k-6 fatality
motherboard 16 gigabytes of G skills try
it at Z ddr4 at 2666 a HyperX savage 960
SSD making sure we're feeding the data
fast enough to the CPU and of course a
MSI GTX 1080 gaming X GPU the reason why
I chose that was I wanted to see how
much drop-off there is on the i-5 in the
i3 versus the i7 I mean everyone wishes
they can have an i7 and a 1080 but the
question is is there bottlenecking
happening on the lower end cpus and how
does that translate to a gaming
experience the games I chose are kind of
a mash-up of different dx12 games from
dx11 games synthetics things like
Cinebench I kind of just tried to
randomly pick things that I thought
would test these in different types of
sin
areas again this is it's not easy to do
these types of benchmarks and have it
applied to everybody so with all that
crap out of the way let's go ahead and
just dive right into it I know you guys
are dying to hear the numbers you don't
want to hear anything else I have to say
so let's do it
Cinnabon should be no surprise this is a
CPU benchmark utility too obviously
we're going to see a huge fall-off
between the three so as you can see you
are getting a little bit less than half
the performance of an i7 with the i3 if
we use benchmark as kind of a direct
comparison space line but we all know
that that's not going to account for all
of the uses out there so what about
games well let's go and start here with
dirt rally dirt rally is one of those
games that can hammer your CPU if it's
not up to the test it's kind of like
once you go over a certain threshold of
CPU performance then you you kind of get
all the FPS but if you don't have enough
that it falls on the face really hard we
learned that when I did that super
low-end 375 dollar build with the Athlon
but the i7 and dirt rally gave us 173
FPS the i-5 gave us interestingly enough
174 FPS 1 FPS more and the i3 gave us
163 FPS so although we had quite a bit
less computing power on the i3 than the
i7 we were only dropping about 10 FPS
compared to the i7 that's really not bad
considering the 10 80s throwing a lot of
frames at the CPU to have to handle I
expected a bigger drop off to be honest
now rise of the Tomb Raider a dx12 title
one that had some rocky issues when it
launched but it's been patched and has
been getting better with its dx12
optimization we got 835 FPS on the i7
134 on the i5 and 134 on the i3 so
pretty much identical performance across
the board obviously that's due to DX 12
which is huge this is why we need to see
more game developers doing good
optimization for DX 12 because it really
does make up for lower end hardware
Metro last light is a dx11 title and has
been known to bring gaming systems to
its knees it's one of the reasons why I
leave Metro in my testing lineup because
I have seen it literally bring systems
begging for mercy the i7 gave us 169
average FPS the i-5 156 in the i3 131 so
37 fps
prints between the i3 and the i7 131
it's amazing but that's quite a bit of
drop-off compared to the i7 so it means
even with hyper-threading and the system
effectively looking at it like a
quad-core processor there's even a bit
of difference compared to physical cores
versus the for logical cores found in
the i3 in the i-5 GTA 5 is another title
that is dx11
and has a huge sandbox Open roaming
world if you will that can really hammer
your CPU is it is a CPU intensive as it
is GPU intensive so building a system
for GTA 5 you have to have the best you
can get in both worlds now the i7 gave
us 155 SPF no surprise there now that is
in game by the way that is not the
little benchmarking track this is the
first mission you do with Franklin where
your repoing the cars and you're racing
through town it's fast-paced
lots of stuff happening so it's a very
good test and it's a consistent test
which is why I like doing it that way
and not using the built-in bench mark
but 155 on the i7 138 on the i5 and 116
on the the i3 at 39 FPS drop-offs across
the board that's quite a bit more target
I want to say that's about 25 percent my
math could be wrong I'll make a little
pop up if I'm way off but anyway that's
quite a bit of drop-off obviously we can
see we can see that the 1080 is being
affected by v8 v i3 quite a bit on that
one
now let's talk about time spot I put
time spy in here because it is a dx12
benchmark which is going to be able to
show us not only a cpu score a GPU score
but at a combined score so we can get a
bigger picture of what's happening
across the board with all three of these
CPUs now if you compare all of these
scores across the board something
interesting happens that I can't quite
explain the GPU score went up as the
processor went down I can't explain why
we got a faster score on the i3 than all
three of them and a faster score on the
i-5 than the i7 now the combined was
obviously higher across the board as a
CPU went up because you know he has a
CPU test in there that it does as well
which the i3 kind of falls in space all
the way down to 10 FPS like I said
they're running the exact same speed for
0.7 across the board the exact same
systems just swapped in the CPUs and did
the exact same test again with all the
same settings so really interesting on
that one now I know this video wasn't
specifically about the 73 50k but I
think
it's important to mention something here
even though it has hyper-threading and
it's unlocked and you can overclock it
on the test that takes CPU performance
into account you can see that the i3
with its four logical cores is not equal
to an i5 with 4 physical cores and no
hyper-threading so it's really difficult
for me to recommend this I 373 50 K even
though it's got all of its enthusiast
features on there when for approximately
the same price you can get an i5 7500
which is a lock CPU it's not a KC PU it
still allows some B clock overclocking
but it's approximately the same price
and you're going to get better
performance out of the 7500 than you
would a 73 50 K in fact something I need
to do in another video here is compare
the i3 73 50k to an AMD
8350 because again they're the same
price and we want to see if we get
direct comparisons now obviously you get
some of the latest features on kb lake
requires Windows 10 to actually take
advantage of most of those features but
that's a topic for another video
so although performed very very well I
still have a hard time recommending it
especially if we're talking about budget
builders because the Pentium series was
something that was amazing it was under
a hundred bucks dual cores obviously
fell on its face not long after it was
launched it just wasn't powerful enough
but the new Pentiums also have hyper
threading it included on them in this
generation with kb lake and they are
nowhere near the hundred and eighty
dollars that this I 3 is retailing at so
it's again I it's one those where I feel
like Intel's trying and I think they
might feel like AMD's on their heels so
you gotta do something but the question
is are they giving us too little too
much too little difference at too much
of a cost that's where you guys come in
sound off in the comments
watch other kb lake videos and take all
of that information you're going to
learn and then for my opinion not just
mine this is one test and just some
games and stuff here on this so there's
a lot of use case scenarios for these
CPUs so try to do the best you can to
formulate your own opinion using a lot
of different videos and sources and
website and then tell me what you think
sound off in the comments or hit me up
on Twitter guys thanks for watching also
to you if these are available on Amazon
I will link them down below save the
timing of these is still kind of hard to
your hands on it I think micro Center
might have some but I digress it's not
that important thanks for watching guys
there's always I'll see you in the next
