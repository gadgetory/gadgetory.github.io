what's up guys you're watching Jase two
cents an alpha cool has once again sent
me a pretty cool product you know I like
water cooling I like I like different
types of water cooling especially new
items because water cooling has been
around for a long time now and it's
really kind of been stale for a while
where all the companies are kind of
producing the same thing you've got your
cylindrical res and you've got your you
know your d5 pumps and you've got your
multi fitting radiators and companies
are really having a hard time figuring
out how to bring it to the next level
and really make it cool and no pun
intended
alpha cool has sent me their light tower
reservoir now why do they call it the
light tower well a couple of reasons as
you can see right here I've already
taken it out of the box and I've already
assembled it in like a little loop right
here that I've put together using the
fobia DC 12 pump now why did we do this
what makes this reservoir unique and by
the way this is what you get right here
when you buy the light tower you don't
get the pump of the fittings or the the
tube or the little plate that I've
mounted it to here this is a Jay's
creation I did this oh look at that what
you get here is a really high quality
reservoir with this palm base on here
that has lots of different mounting
options and if you look closely at this
you'll see that the pump is made it
directly to the reservoir and what that
does is it allows you to have some real
flexibility on where you can mount this
because as you can see it's small and it
also has ports on the bottom and the top
and they include this as you can see
this acrylic port right here that has a
spot in there for a high intensity LED
which means that you can shine it in the
top down or in the bottom up and you can
illuminate this reservoir hence light
tower this is a really unique design in
that not only does it made up to some of
the more common pumps on the market like
your d5 and you've got the alpha cool
and you've got a whole host of different
adapters which I'll show you in a moment
the base on this instead of being
just one port pulling water in you have
a plate with lots and lots of little
holes pulling water in which apparently
is supposed to make bleeding faster and
make pulling air bubbles into the system
no longer an issue now it's a really
interesting design in that the water
goes into the reservoir up through the
middle it is there's an acrylic tube in
there goes up through the middle and
it's sealed on the top and it has holes
all around it so the water shoots out to
the side against the side of the
reservoir so it makes it really cool in
that it it kind of churns the water
around in there and gives it a really
cool look now if you're wondering what
fluid this is by the way this is just
distilled water with some orange
Mayhem's dye in there so doesn't come
with that this is just what I put in
there but what it gives you is lots of
flexibilities you have to Co uh G
quartered threads right here of top and
bottom you've got one on the top this
could be used as a fill port the top
obviously unscrews and I've got it on
there really tight so I'm gonna actually
screw that right now and then on the
bottom you've got another quarter Ridge
thread on there and then on this side
you have a really big hole and the
reason why there's that really big hole
is that's what allows us to mount pumps
to it directly and there's a lot of
different adapters that are available
now what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to demonstrate how that works by
using the included adapters here to
demonstrate now if you weren't going to
be mounting a pump directly to it and
this is the one that actually comes with
it this plug screws directly into the
side right here where the pump is
mounted and it's got a G 1/4 thread in
there so you can put a barb or a
compression fitting or whatever and
mount the rez independently from the
pump anywhere in the loop that you want
if you want to mount the pump directly
to it like the case of the phobia here
you get there are these different
fittings available and this is all pom
material which is a very high quality
self lubricating plastic that have these
inner rings there's two o-rings inside
these holes and there's different size
holes to accommodate different pump
diameters for whichever pump it is that
you're trying to amount it to so this
one that I'm holding right here would
put would mount directly to like a d5
pump with the standard plastic housing
you know where they have the nipple that
points up and one that points out and
they're threaded on the outside this
would screw on to the top of that pump
and then this piece goes into the side
of the reservoir and you literally take
those two pieces and push them together
like that you've now made it the two
together you've got two o-rings for a
seal
and the reason why this is together
before I did the review is I wanted to
see if if a liquid form
with this thing running and I left it
running for over a day no leaks formed
it's been sitting here now for at least
a week put together like this no leaks
so I trust the o-ring fittings on this
they're really really tight so just push
this together like that so you'd have
your pump here your res there and
everything's together it's a really cool
design alpha cool is really working on
trying to make water cooling more fun
more custom you can do that with the the
lighting effects on this and as you can
see this is just what I came up with
with the foam made deep Omiya phobia DC
12 pump plug directly into the reservoir
now obviously you have to be careful on
where you mount it because you don't
want to put undue stress on these two
parts because they could just pull apart
if you don't have them mounted and
secured together tightly so you have to
keep that in mind but other than that
it's a really cool res I would like to
see a bigger reservoir because when you
have a big loop like mine it makes a lot
easier for filling and bleeding to have
a bigger reservoir they did say that
other tubes are going to be available in
different sizes for you to be able to
customize it like that but if you're
looking at putting together a water
cooling loop and you want something
custom that's high quality the machining
on this is just perfect I mean it is
perfectly square perfectly straight the
acrylic is absolutely glass like there
is no hazing on it there is no scratches
the palm and the o-rings everything fit
perfectly they've really stepped it up
it's absolutely gorgeous so if you guys
want to check out this reservoir head
down into the description and you'll see
a link to Aqua tunings website they
distribute all over the world and you
can just put in what country you're in
and they'll let you know whether or not
they ship to your area and you can check
it out right there on their website so
guys this has been James $0.02
checking out the light tower right here
high quality product I 100% recommend
this for water cooling it's very
flexible and that's what you need when
you do custom loops you need flexibility
sometimes the cases don't give you the
flexibility that you really need and
want when doing a custom build and wrap
up and have to conform to the
limitations of your case this reservoir
conforms to the limitations of your
which allows you more options and that's
what really makes water cooling fun is
when you have control of all the routing
and stuff and when you can take two
components that are usually difficult to
find the right placement for and making
sure that everything set up properly and
it does it for you
as a water cooler that's invaluable to
me so guys check it out down the
description I'll see you guys next time
on James two cents and as always if you
like this video you know what's do with
it if you're new around here hope you
stick around and check out more of my
videos and I'll see you guys next time
in my next video which feels like it's
going to be in just a couple of minutes
be next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
