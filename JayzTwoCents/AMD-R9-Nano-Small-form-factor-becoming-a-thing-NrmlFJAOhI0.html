you another graphic card review and I
would try and tease you guys like you
don't know what the card is gonna be
about that way when I show it you're
like oh my god that's all that coming um
yeah you've probably read the title of
this video at least I would assume that
you did but anyway we're gonna be
talking about what is probably gonna be
considered one of the most powerful yet
smallest graphics cards on the planet at
least until the next most powerful
smallest graphics card on the planet
launches but today we're gonna be
talking about the AMD fury nano
I'm assuming it's called nano because
it's really small in fact it's so small
it can hide out behind the size of a
regular graphics card there it is
now just be honest the 980 kingpin
that's not a very small card it's a
pretty damn thick and heavy but this guy
man that I actually fit this thing in my
pocket and then girls started flocking
to me it's really the new z170
classified motherboard from EVGA
features eight phase-- PWM 4 Way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want
badass motherboard with no compromises
click the link below to learn more we
will go ahead and mention the fact that
this nano card is exactly the same specs
as a fury X although it is much smaller
it is not shaved down it has the same
exact amount of stream processors the
exact same memory bandwidth memory speed
memory allocation the entire core
structure is identical to what is on the
fury X they just happen to make it
really freakin small so I don't want to
waste a lot of time talking about what
would be very redundant information if
you guys want to know more about the
fury X which this is based upon then go
ahead and watch this video right about
here and then you can learn about that
and then come back to this video and
pick up where you left off because let's
be honest oh my god sit here and wait
for you to watch that video doesn't make
this video way too long you'd get bored
I'd get bored you'd leave I would
probably leave before you would and then
I would unsubscribe and never come back
and that's that's probably what's gonna
happen anyway aesthetically this card
looks very similar to the fury X but
it's actually quite different in fact
where the fury X had that soft touch
very very soft almost like a rubbery
shroud on here this one it's just kind
of a plastic
I don't want to say a cheap plastic at
that but it is a check plastic
representation of what is actually on
the fury X card you do have a single fan
on here I want to say that this is gonna
be about a 92 millimeter fan but it is
fully shrouded and you do have zero
glowing lights anywhere on here unlike
on the fury X card where the Radeon
Gloup Gloup glowed it glued it this is
just a sticker it does not actually glow
this does not glow you don't have any of
the LEDs showing you the load on the
card like you had with the fury X this
is a very basic bare-bones cooler if you
will it's got a single 8 pin PCI Express
power on the back of the card which I
personally feel is very disappointing
and the reason why I say that is if
you're gonna talk about how short a card
is don't make the plug add length to the
card because then you are gonna have to
deal with an account for the plug coming
off the back and the wire Bend radius
which is gonna add at least another inch
to an inch and a half on the back of the
card put it on the top and then you can
actually say that the card being super
short is not going to be impeded by
anything else in the case you stick the
power plug on the back you just add it
link to the card but there is some
design thoughts inside the actual
heatsink in this and that is that all of
the heatsink rows actually run front to
back and the concept for that is the
fact that when the air is being blown
down instead of taking the hot air
that's being heated by the GPU and
blowing it down on your motherboard
inevitably heating up your motherboard
when it's in your case it's gonna be
exhausted out the rear inside the case
technically that's the rear zoom
exhausted out the rear out of the case
and then towards the front into the
chassis which will then be handled by
your chassis cooling and it's not going
to be heating up the components sitting
near it so that's pretty much what's
different about the Fury Nano let's go
ahead and get into the benchmarks and
talk about the numbers and then we'll
talk about this card and where it
belongs and why it exists because I
think that's the biggest question I've
seen at least going around them social
media is why
remember if you guys like these types of
benchmarks and stuff where we talk about
it you have to vote with that like
button if you hate them then you can
also vote with that like button just
feel free to hit the like button anyway
moving on here we're gonna be comparing
the card here to several cards in the
same price range as well as a couple
cards below it and a couple of cards
above it now way you can kind of get a
sampling of what's happening with the
performance of this card give or take
about 100 to 150 dollars in either
direction depending on your need for
court clocks I did overclock this thing
to 1080 megahertz
even though AMD was really kind of
dancing around the question about
whether or not this is an overclocking
card I mean they they did sort of say no
it's overclocking was absolutely not in
mind whatsoever when they built this
card over in fact they under clocked it
to a thousand megahertz as you can see
right here to kind of make up for the
power target the temperature target and
the form factor so even though they said
overclocking yeah not really supported
well that's how we do things around here
so damn it we overclocked at 80
megahertz because it kept crashing at
1100 but as you can see the speeds it is
being compared to the other cards as we
move forward the Tri X is running at
1120 and the fury X is running at 11:28
so there is a little bit of a percentage
gap here in terms of core clocks between
the fury X and the nano given the fact
that they are the exact same core
architecture that's not shaved down but
we do have a forty eight megahertz
difference here which is a few percent
so I'm interested to see how that's
gonna play out now for temperatures the
Fury nano is topping out the chart at 81
but it's important to note this was
overclocked this was not this was not
passing 75 degrees Celsius at stock
speeds now even though you have no core
voltage control I did up the power limit
which is inevitably going to add more
voltage and so that's important to note
it's 75 degrees Celsius is where it
maxed out at stock speeds 81 while
overclocked and you can see we got quite
a range of temperatures most cards are
landing somewhere in the 70s now you're
gonna see a pretty kind of now you're
gonna see quite the repeating pattern as
we move forward in these charts and
we'll talk about that
so the Fury nano which I'll just here
forth referred to as the nano
coming in at 14 three three four four
normal sixty seven oh five and thirty
three sixty one for fire strike now we
overclocked that and we go from the
lower middle range to the upper middle
range at sixteen three eighty three
seven and six eighty four and three
eight eight two four ultra now you're
gonna notice that this card this nano
tends to be following around the nine
eighty classified everywhere it goes
it's kind of kind of hanging out in the
nineteen eighty classified shadow and
you guys are gonna see that but they
overclock even though only 80 megahertz
did make quite a difference and bumped
it up quite a few places in terms of
performance they performed and it
responded really well to even just a few
megahertz of an overclock now Witcher 3
has definitely become the new crisis in
terms of its difficulty to run and
that's apparent right here where the
Nano could not achieve a 60 FPS average
frame rate with these ultra preset high
post processing settings with hair works
off an unlimited framerate so 57 is
where it came in on the average 45 for
1440p and 27 for 4k clearly at these
settings not playable at 4k overclocked
that thing then we get over that magical
60fps number for 60 for 10 80 54 1440
and 31 for 4k again 4k not playable at
these settings at that frame rate at
least in my opinion that 31 fps was not
very smooth in fact the minimums would
go down into the single digit or the
teens depending on the scene that was
happening so it was definitely not very
playable GTA 5 though then I had no
problem achieving nearly 100 FPS or 98
average at 1080p 68 for 1440 and 36 for
4k once again not a playable number at
these settings overclock the thing and
then it comes up to a very respectable
106 FPS for 1080 76 for 1440 and 40 for
4k starting to get a little better on
the 4k numbers but again you have to
really pull down those settings to play
4k at reasonable consistent frame rates
which is not bad considering its form
factor honestly but the 92 Ti is up here
in the 970 SSC sli for the same price
just I mean pulled way ahead of the nano
at the same price but then again a lot
more heat a lot more power and a lot
more real estate needed to run an SLI
config Metro last light once again
nano coming in at the middle of the pack
at 105 average 410 AD 69 average for
1440 and 34 average for 4k overclocked
it and as you can see once against right
behind a classified overclock it it
comes up to 119 1080p 77 for 1440 and 38
for 4k which is again very good these
are very good numbers it's just one of
those things where you know price to
performance ratio is a little bit skewed
given the fact that these cut the SSC
you know the 970 SLI albeit 3.5
gigabytes of vram is still beating it in
every single test by a lot so that's one
thing to keep in mind I mean I know I
know 4 gigabytes means 4 gigabytes but
you know 148 FPS is also 140 at FPS so
we'll go with that
but then again you gotta give it credit
where credit is due for being such a
tiny card to sit where it's sitting on
these charts Crysis 3 and had no
problems at stock speeds giving you more
than 60 FPS average at very high presets
very high system specs and MSAA turned
on giving you 49 FPS 1440 66 1080 in 25
4k overclocked the thing and it gets
even better at 74 FPS average 1080p 55
for 1440 and 28 for 4k not a playable
number in 4k in any of these tests so
far far cry 4 used to be a pretty
demanding game but as you can see the
cards are having no problems running
especially when you overclock the nano
at stock speeds 80 FPS 1080p 53 FPS for
1440 and 28 FPS for 4k
overclocked it goes from the middle
bottom middle to the upper middle near
the top at 89 fps 1086 D fps magical
number at 1440 and 31 FPS for 4k again
trailing the fury X which is expected
and trailing all over the 980 T is which
are bigger more power hungry cards and
then bf4 I did do as well and bf4 as I
thought it would but I guess compared to
the other cards compared to the Tri X
and the fury X and all that those guys
are all kind of sitting right here just
really setting up shop in the middle of
the charts as you guys can see so the
Nano 128 FPS at 1080p for ultra preset
91 for 1440 and 51 for
okay pretty much playable frame rates
for all of the test and then you
overclock it it gets even better 132
1080 98 for 1440 and 57 for 4k so it's
really set up shop in the middle of the
chart and if you look at all of these
charts you'll see the nano nano middle
nano and nano middle of the chart GT a
middle of the chart Metro way to love
the chart crisis middle of the chart far
cry middle of the freight gang chart and
battlefield 4 middle of the chart
so let's go ahead and talk about this
card though because the numbers are only
part of the story if this card was set
out to be you know a monster card that
was just gonna try and compete with
everything in its class well that would
be called the AMD fury X so anyway let's
go and talk about this card let's that's
let's discuss where it belongs why it
was created and whether or not this is a
card you need for your build well as you
guys saw in the benchmarks this card
pretty much took up shop in the middle
of the charts and just stayed there the
entire time and that's where I have to
wonder if the price point to the
performance based on the four factor
makes a lot of sense there's a lot of
groaning and moaning going on already on
the social sphere of people saying it's
too expensive
yeah it's 649 bucks exact same price as
the fury X but gives you a lot less
features no lights but that was my ring
I didn't break it I swear
compared to the fury X you really are
getting a lot less I mean obviously it's
smaller but the fury X is already a
really small card so bear with me here
but other than that you you aren't
getting a whole lot in terms of the same
features you get for the fury X for the
same price because we're AMD is banking
on is that you as a customer are going
to pay that premium of 650 bucks for the
same core and as much smaller form
factor albeit performing a less than the
fury X all around there on every single
test is seeing performed lesser than the
fury X which I guess does make sense now
I also noticed that this card is
supposed to start at least according to
the press kit this card is not supposed
to start doing any sort of core engine
broadening until 85 degrees Celsius that
wasn't my case whatsoever on this and I
I tried to figure this out
no idea why this was happening but at
stock speeds all stock no overclocking
or anything and at only 75 degrees
Celsius I was getting quite a bit of
core fluctuation all the way down into
the mid 800 s on the core down from a
thousand so I have no idea why it was
throttle and now remember the BIOS on
this thing is pretty locked down there's
no voltage control you do have a power
target controller power limit
controlling percent but that didn't make
any difference I continue to get a lot
of throttling from 1000 down to 864
megahertz I believe that is a huge
decrease in percentage and performance
now even though I overclocked it to 1080
and bumped up that power limit all the
way as high as it would go which is a
plus 50 it's still throttled but only
went up and down about 20 degrees versus
the hundred and thirtysomething degrees
megahertz the only weapon down about 20
megahertz versus the hundred and thirty
some-odd megahertz it was fluctuating a
stock I have no idea why that was
happening even though overclocked it was
running hotter it was not fluctuating as
much now of course I went into MSI
Afterburner logs and tried to look and
see well maybe we were hitting our power
limit and that's why it was fluctuating
power limits not actually visible on
this BIOS I guess because MSI
Afterburner was not able to tell me what
the power limit was it's not even an
option for monitoring maybe it's because
the cards too new I don't know so I
can't tell you why it was throttling but
I wanted to at least let you know it was
throttling much much sooner than it
should have and that was obviously
affecting a lot of the benchmarks at
stocks beats so that's something to keep
in mind now it was at this moment when
editing I realized I forgot to get a
video at least a high quality video of
the coil whine with this card because we
know that the coil whine with the fury
ex was a problem but I did happen to do
an Instagram video so if you follow an
Instagram you've already seen this but
otherwise go ahead and have a listen to
B coil whine that was apparently
non-existent with the fury X and listen
to it on the fury nan-oh
but like I said obviously AMD is banking
on the fact that you're willing to pay
650 dollars for a card that's this tiny
I'm not sure there's that many people
out there shopping for a card this small
I've built several
ITX systems in the last couple of years
alone and I never had a problem fitting
a fairly standard length card in there
anyway the card really does perform very
well for its form factor the question is
if does the form factor need to exist
this market is is it's not very
established there's not a lot of ITX
form factor cards and I don't know what
the sales data is to show for the 970
ITX and then super small cards that have
existed before on whether or not there
are people out there really purchasing
super tiny cards like this it seems like
a lot of manufacturers will make a PCB
that's super small like the the geforce
gtx 750 and then they make it bigger
because the customer wants to show off
their big powerful card right big
powerful card but i don't know you guys
tell me i build big giant systems that i
like to look at but maybe you don't
so i'm really curious as to what the
general consensus is are you willing to
go with a super tiny card in a super
small case or as gamers do you want to
show off with lots of lights and lots of
bling in water cooling tubes and stuff
and say I am a gamer I am proud and I'm
loud to have a big giant computer or is
this what you're after
AMD's banking that enough people want
this to make it exist I guess time will
tell and you guys can sound off in the
comments and let me and AMD know if an
ITX form factor form factor graphics
card is really something that you're
after because if you are well that's the
most powerful one that you can get but
at the same token it's not a lot of
options maybe in the next year or two
especially as HBM Gen 2 comes out maybe
small form-factor is the future anyway
time to get out of here guys thanks for
watching this video a little longer than
normal as always grab this card videos I
like to get in-depth but you guys can
head on over to social media or you can
go to my blog channel which I'm reviving
and you can get at me that way tell me
how you guys feel about this card I
prefer that you do it on social media or
Twitter or something like that but put
it down in the comments as well we'll
see you in the next one guys and as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
