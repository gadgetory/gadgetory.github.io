cents here and doing the second tech
talk in one week's time I know for on
some sort of a marathon or something but
I've been slacking on the videos but
I've really been picking it up on the
live streams and as I mentioned on
tuesday i think it was i have got a
special guest here with me I've got boo
boo the tech guru AKA ubuntu addicted
and he was one of my early followers and
subscribers how did you find my channel
um man it was it was a well what's up
guys how's it go on oovoo the tech guru
here coming straight at you glad to have
be on the show I really appreciate that
Jay but I think the way I found you was
through somebody that I followed on
Twitter had retweeted one of your tech
addiction episodes I don't know if it
was holiday doc or probably don't really
I think that's who it was and then from
there I just man I love that tech
addiction show and you know from there
I'm I'm a big techie at heart so I just
basically from there I followed on and
you don't it's been a blast so far yeah
it's funny you mentioned tech addiction
it's one of those things that I think
was a little bit ahead of its time but I
think it's time to start bringing it
back I heard you talking about that on
Tuesday yeah yeah I miss doing it it's
just it took so much time hey right it
was so time intensive to do that every
sort of attock you put a lot of effort
into it I mean that's I don't know if
I'll do it weekly may-maybe bi-weekly I
don't know or bimonthly whatever
whatever twice a month is but it's a lot
of work but I think now that I have an
audience base big enough to make it
worth it I'll probably start doing it
again and especially because this time
of the year is when a lot of things
technology wise really start to ramp up
because everyone wants to get their new
tech out before the holidays and I you
know so there's a couple of things I
want to talk about today one I thought
you were a really good fit for today's
show because of well granted your name
you're in ubuntu fan I had a co-worker
programmer and he was messing i would
have been to a bit and he had a dual
boot system and he really liked it and i
get a lot of messages from people asking
about alternatives to windows and
whether or not i think that they should
dual boot mac OS or ubuntu and I know
all about Mac OS but I don't know
anything about Ubuntu so I thought that
maybe we talk a little bit about that
today I want to talk about sista and it
looks like breaking news like we were
talking about just went live here looks
like they might have caught the second
suspect out in Boston which is makes me
happy because when i was born in boston
too i have an office in Boston and
granted I don't live in Boston anymore
it's still kind of you know my roots so
let me go ahead and right off the bat
program compatibility on Ubuntu is it
growing program compatibility yeah as
far as like the the number of like
software and programs right poor for the
OS right um you know everything I I run
ubuntu strictly I don't even have a dual
boot system I have a windows computer
over to my left because my girlfriend
uses it but other than that and
everything that I need to do for you
know everything that I do there's free
software free open-source software for
every single thing you know if it's
video capture video editing um you know
you name it I can do it I mean sure they
might not be as as well develop the only
thing I will say that's not up to snuff
in Linux so far is gaming which you know
they actually are starting to ramp that
up because there's a steam client now
for linux and more and more developers
indie game developers are coming out
with you know they're porting their
games over to linux now there's still no
waitlist titles up there and bunt to
steam right um i don't believe so no I'm
trying to think the what were the games
that I just picked up at in a recent
humble bundle I don't I like the fact
that they're picking up indie games at
least because I'm so fed up but a lot of
the mainstream games and you know EA and
origin and what all that you know what
they're doing in the gaming industry
I've really added kind of supporting the
indie games lately
yeah I don't know his team fortress
would you consider that in a game I
don't know I I would only because of the
fact that its valve and it's been around
for a decade greatest yeah hey guys why
it yeah I have team fortress 2 on my
ubuntu machine I tried playing it my
computer's not quite up to snuff on its
insight I'm not really a computer gamer
but I've been trying to get into it and
I realized since that that I really need
to I'm running an old penny um I mean
Cort you do all with only two gigs of
ram so it's like an 8400 GS and vidya so
that's like barely enough to run it on
medium settings team fortress 2 so I got
upgrade my hardware if I want to get
into gaming but yeah I don't think
there's really any a list a list games
um you know on the Linux side yet but
you know I'm impressed though that how
well does ubuntu run on that system
because in today's operating system
world it's your system is rather
obsolete you couldn't run a westerner
could one yeah it's definitely obsolete
and I mean dude if my computer is just
snappy it's it's the only thing like i
said is lacking with the hardware would
probably be my video you know working on
videos in rendering you know it takes me
like a normal say eight minute or ten
minute gameplay of crysis 3 or blur
black ops 2 to render out that with the
commentary overlaid and you know any
kind of graphics overlay i do and stuff
like that transitions maybe it takes a
couple hours and then you know and
that's that that's the one downside to
the to the hardware i'm still on well
what I made that what otherwise i mean
when i made a new video with my daughter
over the weekend the blog i did that on
my wife's core2duo Mac system and that
render took 25 minutes and I found that
to be painful so I kind of its
dedication if it takes you multiple
hours to render out a video and at the
rate you were putting up crysis 3 videos
that machine must have been a hundred
percent for like months straight yeah if
i could if i could look at the uptime or
stats on this machine I tell you it's
the load on it is mode average is
probably pretty high basically i render
I do my do all my video editing at night
and then I'll just click render and go
to bed and then come home and I wake up
in the morning and hit upload and then I
got to wait another two hours for the
upload oh wow what's your connection
speed um I have 20 down from
time warner cable and only half a
megaupload oh yeah i use i had that boat
sucks I had that package except for it
was 20 down one up and I I'm so not
happy with time warner they're so behind
the times when it comes to their upload
speeds because even a wide band I get 50
down but only five up and granted i say
only five it it still takes me you know
sometimes 45 minutes to upload a
15-minute video because of YouTube
server lag where you know they're not
accepting the file as fast as I can
present it but I'm definitely a hardware
snob and I try not to be but geez I've I
complain when it when i look at the
rendering time on some of these videos
and it says 15 minutes no my god really
15 minutes what am I gonna do for 15
minutes but I know I submission render
out video in 15 minutes you know really
you really consider AMD when you do your
update our you're up all night i no see
I've been talking about an upgrade for a
while you know I back in january i was
talking with you about getting a one of
the FX for a series from AMD like an
eight-core or something I just haven't
pulled the trigger you Adam I tax money
should be coming in there so the Sheep
now yeah I know it's incredible see it
and with my operating system I don't
have to go you know like today's
processor I can go you know a couple
years old and it's still gonna be
awesome even yeah even if you were to
get say like a 965 black addiction a
black edition and overclocked a little
bit that would be just light years ahead
of what you have now you can get that
processor for like 80 bucks yeah yeah
and i overclocked mine up to 3.4 too oh
no no no 24.2 gigs every day that i had
it and gamed and rendered and everything
and then I i sold it to a guy up on hard
forms which is the computer for my go-to
and he's been using it and overclocking
it they are just like brick houses when
it comes to processors well i'll
probably have to get get back in touch
with you whatever you just said because
that's probably the way i'll go you know
you give me some good suggestions on
that yeah and one of my most me i could
probably put together a really cheap
built build for a couple hundred three
hundred bucks Oh easy yeah core what i
use i have you have live every little
parts yeah but if you if you're using
anything that still has are using saitta
to or say to three drives
ha sada no i think i have like to say
two drives i'm still on ide most of my
drives our IDE it's you're gonna have a
hard time finding a modern board that
still has an IDE well see in my
workstation I'll take that back my
workstation it does have like one sided
dry but most of my drives are shared
from my file server over NFS or over
samba got it so like I have one main
drive connected directly that I put you
know that's what I render to because I
wanted the fastest connection I can and
that's SATA so if i do upgrade or if i
do get a new drive it'll probably be you
know like a one terabyte or two terabyte
drive sata right whatever whatever's on
the motherboard you know my friend
coconut monkey gets a little laugh out
of the black edition processors just I
guess that's the friend that was on the
blog last night so he gets a little kick
out of it being a black edition I guess
all right guys um you know what the
point of the show is it's ask your tech
questions and you know one of the
reasons why I'm getting people in here
too is not only to try and help and
support some of the smaller channels
because I've been blessed to grow much
much much faster than I've expected and
you know when you when you get big
youtubers that help out the little guys
you know I've been helped up by big
youtubers you've been helped out by you
know wings and yeah you know it's
important to pay it forward so you're
back yep that's why i told i told Robbie
I said he said I'll pay you back some
ways in the future I said what you need
to do is you need to help somebody else
out that's what you need to do so you go
but the other thing too is I want to get
other tech people in here because
there's questions I'm asked every single
weekend sometimes I don't know the
answer I figure between two tech brains
maybe we can collect to light them up
with answers for these guys there you go
but we've got almost 40 people in here
right now and I'm nuts I don't know if
the if the stream is just guys if you're
typing inside the YouTube chat it goes
it lags for me I don't know if it likes
for you guys but for me sometimes I
don't see it's helped to five minutes
after when it finally refreshes whether
I do the mouse trick or not so you have
two options of waste and ask questions
here one we've got both of our Twitter's
right here up on the screen make sure
you're following us both there's also my
facebook page where you can go up to and
ask questions and you can take your
chances with the YouTube stream but I
can't guarantee that
going to see it so I want to talk to you
about the the cyber security act you
know a lot of people may not know that
the Cyber Security Act passed and what
that does is it basically gives the
government just an open back door into
anything cyber communication so you're
you're talking remember back in the 80s
and 90s it was always don't say bomb on
the phone or it'll trigger the AI
computer to start recording your call
sort of thing it's kind of like that but
when it comes to all of your digital
transmissions and that I believe it goes
into your into mobile devices as well
that use data so oh I haven't got the
bill specific in in as depth as I should
have and my fault on that but it kind of
slipped under my radar because I was
following it late last year when it was
being pushed through presented to
Congress and its past so the government
is just one step closer to you know
monitoring everything we do on the
internet which you know that brings up
such a debate and I really don't want to
get into it you know too deeply but you
know at what price does security and
freedom come right cuz i don't know i
don't think you can have either or
without the other and oh my god i just
don't like the idea of somebody spying
on me I mean I've even stopped kind of
using my kinect ever since Microsoft put
in a patent to be able to watch you
right at any time on your connect right
I mean that's genetic really too funny
tweets from I follow your anon news at
your anon news they're anonymous you
know obviously yeah and two of the
recent tweets one of it says sista
abolish a--'s warrants and any other
form of legal mandate for cyber spying
yeah its basic it's basically an
indefinite wiretap it and then their
next one their next one says if you're
okay with the government collecting
every photo you email to your wife
husband or friend don't worry about
sista yeah really so it's kind of scary
I mean it it's you know when I remember
when SOPA wasn't that SOPA that came out
and in the hole everybody just like
basically crapped on it and and was it
that was the wire it was the wiretapping
wasn't it good while I'm um I know I
recognize the acronym but i dont rember
what it stands for i stood for
stop I'm wait stop Online Privacy Act oh
yes yeah well you know it's funny the
way that this government works but you
know I so many of my followers are not
from the United States but it's we're
definitely in an odd time because you
know technology's advancing so fast and
yet they're still caught up on the guns
thing and you know it just it it just
it's so funny to me that the the
Republicans agreed to it to pass this
bill because they're really against the
whole concept of the wiretapping and
whatnot at least when it comes to the
public but they would love to wiretap on
other politicians but yeah you know I
just don't like the fact that I mean
anything you send over the airwaves you
already know anything that goes on the
internet gets saved somewhere forever
there's no such thing as deleting
anything from the internet but go into
my phone or to you know anything that if
I'm connected to the internet might they
can go into my computer you know I mean
right no matter how good your firewall
is I don't think they will find a way in
you know right I remember when so when
sopa was trying to be passed sopa and
pipa bills they were like shut down
immediately because huge companies
backed you know back them like GoDaddy
and big companies basically said you
know they they even stopped going with a
certain some companies stopped going
with certain providers or maybe that's
what it was like these websites moved
away from godaddy because godaddy
supported sopa and pipa i forget how
tall and down but there was oh here it
is your google and wikipedia posted
protests against SOPA and PIPA last year
yeah but neither company has publicly
displayed direct opposition to sis pas
like they did in you know and she's
always huge because you had all the
companies like Google and then you know
that we're protesting yep and nobody
really did that for cisco right I got a
question here from CS GW clan he says
hey Jay I did a render test on sony
vegas pro 12 he's got a FX 6300 six core
anyway he did a 720p and it took 45
minutes plus to render and it was a
modern warfare 3 11 minute gameplay why
so long it's what kind of graphics card
do you have one of the things with Sony
is it is able to use
nvidia graphics cards for coup de coeur
rendering and is the setting you go into
preferences and go into video and then
you can click check the button that says
use GPU if available and if you do that
it speeds up your rendering by about
thirty to fifty percent depending on
which graphics card you have like my 680
if I do is just a straight CPU render it
can take 25 30 minutes to render a 15
minute video with my GPU enabled it it
splits that load as if I had two
processors and it only takes you know 12
minutes or so so I i I'm pretty lucky my
systems heavily overclocked though which
makes a huge difference if I reduce my
overclocked I'd probably be you know
fairly slow as well but I'm rendering it
about 15 frames per second which i think
is pretty good especially on a 30 frames
per second video so looks like Jacobs is
putting some system specs there he wants
my opinion Jake RV core i5 2500 k 4.5
gigs obviously overclocked in a data 60
gigabyte SSD seagate 500 gig asrock z77
pro pro what 34 corsair ZX 600 w and a
Corsair Vengeance 8 gigabyte 1600 it's a
very good system the SSD for the
operating system is a little small if
it's already built you can't do anything
about it if you can bump it up to like a
120 128 you'll be happy but other than
that very solid system i still like
Sandy Bridge a lot now how come I have a
quick question about that why do you say
that the hard drive is small for the
operating system how much this window is
really require windows windows really
only requires about 15 to 20 gigs it's
just once you get once you start dealing
with SSD speed you'll start to find
yourself wanting to put more programs on
it like I Oliver I run all of my
rendering software loaded on the SSD but
I rendered to a standalone drive yeah
and I put one or two of my favorite
games on there and when when Windows
boots up and you know I think my system
takes 12 seconds when you load a game
like battlefield 3 that takes my friends
on mechanical drives two minutes to load
a map and I'm in there in 25 seconds you
really get spoiled by the SSD so with I
see what you're saying yeah you can get
120
big one now for a hundred bucks so it's
one of the things where if you can spend
the extra 40 bucks I think it will cost
just do it right and already my 128 I've
got 41 gigs left on it and I'm looking
at the 500 the 500 gig samsung 840 s
I've done two builds this one right here
to my left also has a 500 gig a 40 in it
these SSDs by Samsung or just amazing
when it comes to speed of the SSD it's
put it this way your ide drive probably
rights 20 megabytes per second yeah my
7200 rpm 64 Meg cash mechanical drive
rights 100 megabytes per second my my m4
which is an SSD rights 200 megs per
second and this 840 rights 360 megabytes
per second so when it comes to the
difference is wow it's insane but I
don't recommend SSDs though for editing
because they're their life is rated on
how many guys you rewrite up you really
right timing out granted you know when I
look at SSD life which is a tool i use
it says i'm at ninety-nine percent
health and I'm my drives not projected
to die until like 2048 so if it's
accurate than hey but right what else is
gonna break in there but before the
chips do so yeah yeah yeah I haven't
gotten an SSD you out yet and I mean my
it's funny because like I just rebuilt
or I transferred over a bunch of
hardware our hard drives to a new server
build for my file server and in my DVR
server and my realized my operating
system hard drive is an old 17 gig
western digital ID ride yeah i mean
ubuntu man it only requires probably
about max five gigabytes of storage
that's it yes I mean a minimal system
could run on on a 10 gigabit hard drive
yeah my coworker love looking at it
depends on log files to and temp flat
you know all temps and all that stuff
too though obviously yeah my coworker
loved it a lot I remember you know he he
would tell me hey look at this new
operating system and now I wasn't I'm
not like that interested I guess in
operating systems so I was just kinda
like
whatever but then it wasn't until I met
you that it reminded me oh yeah there's
this ubuntu thing and if i can get if i
get a bigger SSD i might do a dual boot
just to screw around it's not like it's
hard to partition and install right it's
not at all right and since it's free and
open source what i was gonna tell you is
the easiest thing would be is if you run
it from a USB Drive that's true yeah I
forgot you just put it on and put it on
a four gig flash drive or 16 gig flash
drive and run it from there yeah the
breezeway you see windows is the only
operating system until doesn't let you
run from a flash drive rio s you can do
it in fact what's funny is the the
operating system disk that comes from
Mac I don't have ever dealt with mac OS
10 any would if you could when you use
the boot disk it's literally a full copy
of OS 10 on a disk so when you need to
run your utilities to do disk cleanup
and stuff like that you just run it you
just want to run the operating from the
drug from the DVD it's like a lot it's
like a live studio linnaeus does the
same as the same thing up an apple
doesn't even send DVDs anymore they ship
all of their systems now with a thumb
drive with the OS oh nice I didn't even
know that well because they're not
putting um they're not putting recovery
partitions no they're not including
optical drives anymore in their
computers all right right okay unless
you go with a macbook pro or like a mac
pro those will have it but mac air the
new macbook retina they're all all about
being thin so they've taken out even the
slot drive right so yeah okay we got
some more questions here we're bumping
up to 50 people if you guys are just
joining this is booboo the tech guru AKA
to bunt too addicted here on youtube and
twitter make sure you go check out his
videos if you guys are into crysis 3 and
i don't know what it is i I've been a
huge crisis fan I still have one into
sitting right up there on my on my shelf
I just couldn't get into three I don't
know what it was i think i just i'm so
burnt out on shooters right now honestly
because i couldn't get into modern
warfare or black ops 2 either I tried
yeah just I think it's a lack of time
but ok so we've got as always I needed
to start renaming this stream to GPU
talk with J's to students cuz all anyone
ever asks me
yeah I notice that a lot on tuesday too
yeah Jack Arsenal says crucial makes a
960 gigabyte SSD yes they do and in fact
if I get a huge SSD like that I want it
to be a PCI Express drive big so that
you get full transfer our data rates and
not to mention you can get a full
gigabit of right speed did you imagine
writing a gigabyte per second yeah
that'd be crazy that's insane yeah okay
Gerard w98 says hey J opinion please I
seven 3770k 4.5 AMD radeon 9700 hurts
overclocked to 1200 crucial ballistix
sport 1600 oh he said 7870 yeah um you
know I've I noticed some people make
comments that hey dude you even put up a
video in like a week and a half what's
going on I have been recording about six
videos simultaneously so you guys are
going to see some pretty frequent
uploads over the next week or two
because I got the opportunity to do with
this build over here and I mean I'll
some of you guys have seen it maybe
heaven I'm turning the camera here so
you can see this build where is my there
we go right here it's got a lot of parts
in there that people are constantly
asking me is as good as this good so I
decided one not only did I have free
range with this customer build to pick
the parts I just had two requirements
it's it's going to be a workstation
needs to be fast needs to be quiet it
needs to be dust friendly and it needs
to be bulletproof like we can't be
dealing with system lock ups or blue
screens or any of that stuff so I took
the opportunity to buy parts that I
found people asking me about a lot that
met that criteria and the 7870 gigahertz
edition is one of them and I spent a
couple of hours yesterday testing the
overclock of the graphics card and let
me tell you right now there's a lot of
variance in graphics cards first of all
one if you're going to be overclocking
you really have to take your chances you
you may find one card will overclock
some people have hit 13 hundred and
fifty thirteen hundred and seventy
megahertz on their their graphics cards
some of them they can't get out of the
1100
it's just it depends on the bending of
the of the chip and I talked about that
last week with binning is if you don't
know bidding is go look at tuesday's
video too it is so freaking quiet I was
checking the fans constantly make sure
they were actually on I have the msi
version it's not a it's not a twin frozr
but it's the same concept it's two fans
on there with a heat pipe system
graphics cards man they're getting quiet
now and I'm impressed because I've only
ever used reference models for nvidia
which are the sound like hair dryers so
that's 7870 I think that's going to be
the first video I'm going to put up at
the Parts I review on the system because
I get asked about graphics cards every
hour and I can't just jump answering the
same questions over and over and not to
mention my graphics card comparison
video or at least my discussion on
graphics cards is a little outdated so
it's time to redo it all right um if you
don't mind I got a question from go d
Rock for 299 yes what my system specs
are I'm running an old core 2 duo 1.8
giga hertz that's the way to eat 6300 i
believe uh it's seif 4300 I believe Oh
243 okay I say I chop the 6300 was a
1.86 cuz i have one hanging on my wall
here i can check right here cat proc cpu
info it's the 4300 i don't know what the
difference between them are then I I
don't either I think it well whatever
and it's got I'm maxed out it's only two
gigs of ram and it's still only ddr2
that's its old ram i have actually the
motherboard i have was ahead of its time
where you could put in either ddr ram or
ddr2 ram or pci express or a GP it's an
asrock hey g 00 sorry yeah I murray lane
then I know right I came at it set this
hardware so old I camera cut Leah but
hey guys look how much will your money's
worth you got holy I exactly I've
been on this Hardware forever I mean
you're pushing in what six years yeah
easily yeah gosh I don't know what I i
came across a video on youtube i would
happen to look up something about you
know video cards and I was kind of
watching and then
and he was just generally talking about
parts of the graphics card and sockets
and stuff and you couldn't see what card
it was because it was kind of a grainy
video and I knew it was old but when he
talked about you know moving on to
moving off a pci and onto the new AGP
socket i was like oh god and looked at
the day of my 2005 oh wow wow yeah it's
amazing that video is still up I think I
still have one pci graphics card sitting
somewhere in my basement here yeah I was
shocked that this gigabyte motherboard
that I did the review on has two PCI
slots I hadn't seen any motherboards
coming with PCI slots anymore they've
been expressed and expressed one point 0
only yeah I mean it's good for having if
you have old pci sound card or something
no problem with that right demonic
chievous wants to know if he should
upgrade and you know that gives me an
idea i've been i've been kicking around
this idea of doing a video and maybe
i'll do that tonight I just don't know I
have I'm in that mode where I have too
much going on in my head and nothing's
coming out because I can't get all right
yeah write that stuff down and just
focus on one or two you know yeah and
it's not and it's not like I'm
forgetting it it's just I'm a dding from
one idea to the next nothing's coming
out yeah I know the feeling but I want
to do a video that's an all-inclusive
how to know when it's time to upgrade
and because I get people asking me all
the time and demonic chivas just did i'm
gonna get to his question is how is it
how do you know if it's time to upgrade
he has a half x which is a case by the
way you never need upgraded case unless
it's too small he has a radeon 6950 and
an AMD phenom 1090t all default cooling
should you upgrade look it depends on
what you do if you're just gaming that
6950 is still a great card if you're not
scared you can flash the bios on that
thing to be a 69 70 they're the same
exact hardware the 1090t and the 1100 t
or were like the best processors AMD put
out prior to the FX series that turned
out to be just a huge flop with the
bulldozer a lot of people still run
their 10 90s and 1100 TS they're the
best phenom they ever did and all
default cooling you don't need stock or
aftermarket cooling unless you
we live in a hot environment or you want
to overclock so that's what he's asking
that's what he's asking though J he said
should I upgrade my cooling before
overclocking oh there we go thanks i
missed that cuz it's chris right yeah it
scrolled down on me yes never
overclocked on stock cooling ever in
fact stock cooling on AMD side can
barely handle this the stock frequencies
it's pathetic yes overclocking you must
update upgrade your cooling if that it
means adding case fans or if your case
doesn't accept it and behalf X you got
plenty of room I believe you have to 200
millimeters up top I think you have at
least one in the front you have 120 or
140 s in the back the case is perfect
for overclocking go and get yourself a
hyper 212 from like a demonic I believe
you're in the US go to newegg if you can
get anything for 25 bucks a hyper 212 by
Cooler Master one of the most highly
recommended overclocking coolers you can
get 25 bucks and then there you go and
if you see any questions you want to
answer it would just jump right in cuz
oh alright I tend to be long winded so
that's alright yeah ok read read read
acts wins red X wins hey Jay can you be
on the next text talk you're the guy
with four hundred dollar bill video I
know send me a message we'll see um you
know one thing you guys have to realize
to about why I'm so picky oh how I bring
in here is the most coveted perk you get
on YouTube is the live events and if
that gets abused they yank it fast so
you've got I've got to be very and I
believe you have live events to on your
channel don't you yes I do yeah and you
saw it was like the very last perk you
get as a partner and yep and if you have
to apply for it and they review and it's
just it's a process so you know I've got
to be careful that's why I don't allow
people to call in or anything like that
because if they say something horribly
against community standards they'll yank
it they'll yank it before they review it
let's put it that way so yeah okay um
cute what I like here is a lot of a lot
of the guys that follow my channel or
tech guys so they all tend to help me
out with the answers and I greatly
appreciate that yeah that's a big help
maniac power wants to know hey jay is it
worth buying a 3770 over 2700 to get
Intel's q sink
because you will be rendering a lot I am
I said it earlier in the stream I'm
still a huge fan of Sandy Bridge I don't
know I don't think q sink is going to be
worth the price to upgrade to the 3770 I
think you could probably still get about
maybe one hundred and eighty dollars
used for your 2700 which means you're
going to pay about another hundred bucks
for your 3770 I Bay still use the same
socket so it's selling it to buy a new
motherboard it's up to you really
overall computing power of the 3770 is
not going to be you're not going to
really feel it too much you are going to
notice it runs hotter though because I
love me a lot of people may not realize
this they changed the way the heat
spreader works on the Intel CPUs between
sandy and Ivy Bridge whereas Sandy
Bridge actually had the heat spreader
soldered to the chip so it had a perfect
you know connection between the heat
spreader and the die we're on the Ivy
Bridge they just use thermal paste and
they did a pretty shitty job of it so a
lot of the IV bridges that are
overheating people are pulling their
heat spreader off reapplying thermal
paste and then they're getting amazing
results so and Jake RV has another
question he has another build I 320 3220
with stock cooler CPU idols around 35 to
40 on full load of those 48 255 that's
not yes if that's entirely terrible no
it's not your if you got up into the 60s
low 70s and you'd have a problem the ivy
bridge is can get all the way up to the
70s and 80s before you have to start
worrying I have an old nem for prescott
those things ran so hot remember those
Elia yeah yep I and then I went to a
pentium d after that which got really
really really hot too okay well you know
talk a little bit about your crysis 3
videos because i know that's kind of
been a flavor of what you've been doing
a lot lately and it's no lie that you're
like the only guy really doing
consistent crysis 3 coverage yes i mean
there is there's a few other guys that
are doing crysis 3 videos
um which is you know the community is
really small for the game and
unfortunately you know it's falling
again just to how crysis 2 did where the
developers aren't patching some of the
core issues so people will just like a
lot of we lost a lot of people when
gears award judgment came out they
traded in crysis 3 and went out in black
gears of war judgement because they're
there were a lot of issues now they have
released a few patches for the game and
it's getting more stable but the game I
got to be honest I mean if people are
coming from call of duty or other
first-person shooters it's totally it's
really unique I mean because you have
cloaking capabilities which makes you
almost invisible you have armor
capabilities you can activate your armor
and not unavail more um I mean there's a
lot of ins and outs to the game so it's
not noob friendly and there's a little
bit of a learning curve but I have a
great channel which is Ubuntu addicted
on YouTube and I have a lot of I have
in-depth series that I'm doing you know
there I go really in-depth into the
various aspects of whether its weapons
or maps um you know and things about
like the max Nanosuit which is a
killstreak in the game you know and I
have a lot of videos that's pretty much
all of them while I'm focusing mostly on
crysis 3 videos but i also have i do
like a tech tuesdays every once in a
while as well I also do I have a shank 2
let's play which is I'm playing on my
ubuntu machine which is a neat little
side scroller i picked up in a humble
bundle and then i also have I just
started up it was an original xbox title
called black I don't know if you
remember it no it was a fraternal
instructor original xbox title yeah it's
called black and um they actually made
it they actually made it available on
the xbox 360 for 800 microsoft points
and i picked it up just because it was a
really fun first person shooter from the
original xbox days and I just started up
that series i'm doing that every monday
i think but yeah as far as the the
crisis three and then you know if you
guys are looking for help and trying to
decide whether you should go out and buy
the game I think it's already dropped
down in price I know gamestop had a huge
discount on it was only 40 bucks for a
while I
origin had a big sale on it for pc um
unfortunately the numbers are just are
really lacking lately with players I
mean that doesn't really bode well for
me trying to tell you guys go buy it but
it you know multiplayer or the
single-player the campaign of the game
is really solid it's really really fun
it's a good campaign I know there's a
couple youtubers that you know I speak
the same thing as I like vikkstar he's a
big youtuber i'm trying to think well
he's got only stared up some comments
with black a lot of people seem to
really like black yeah black was awesome
man and I can't believe they remade it
for the xbox 360 see I was gonna believe
it or not I was going to do a series of
black on the original xbox I still have
like seven of them right six like six of
them are converted into media centers
but they only play standard definition
content so I had to get rid of them but
one of them still runs you know the
regular operating system and I have
black for it but in the Nelson I found
it was for the xbox 360 I was like well
 then I can just do it you know do
it on a 360 instead of bringing out the
old xbox yeah that was a really solid
game and for 800 microsoft points i
think it's worth it just to play through
the campaign again it was a blast they
don't have multiplayer but the campaign
is really solid i will definitely agree
with what you said though about the
learning curve I think that's what
throws off a lot of people is they're
not used to the having to be quick on
the Flies switching between cloak or
armor or speed or you know power kick
and there's a it's not your average
shooter where there's you know jump
right up camp you know it that stuff
doesn't fly in crisis right it's
definitely like a hybrid type shooter I
would say yeah I think I think part of
it too though this is the first time
crisis had an open beta and crisis was
always a PC platform game right and I
don't remember how popular crysis 2 was
on on xbox but I didn't think at crysis
3 would be as popular on xbox as it is
on pc but even on PC it's just not it's
not as popular as it was and I think
that's two reasons one crisis one and
two definitely gave a lot of gamers pc
gamers a bad taste in their mouth
especially after crisis one because
let's face it crisis one still kicks
computers asses because of the fact the
coding on the the optimization of the
graphics was so poor the graphics were
amazing the problem was even the best
computers at the time
run it because it wasn't an optimized
yeah and now Crysis 2 granted the
graphics are a little more forgiving
people still think crisis as that oh
that's you need the three thousand
dollar computer I like that game to play
it right and by the time crysis 3 rolled
around they put out the open demo and
most people including myself went this
is the same as crysis 2 but with the
hunter mode so i'm gonna pay 60 bucks
for this you know so yeah I think they
did make a bunch of changes to try to
make it more noob friendly from crisis
to crisis 3 they added in a module
called auto armor which basically you
know allows you once you start taking
damage it'll automatically activate your
armor for you if you're not used to
pushing the left bumper but and I just
actually added and then they also um
somebody in this town but i don't think
that exists on pc uh yeah some would
have to correct me in the comments i
don't play it on pc sorry but and then
also the other thing they did was they
separated you know how in crisis to you
had one meter for your cloak and your
armor right and you know if you ran with
cloak or armor on your gauge went down
you had no health and you get one
bulleted yeah well in crisis in Crysis 3
they made it so that you have to
separate gauges and you have unlimited
running capability now it's a super fast
paced game I mean I'm still loving the
crap out of it even though with the
little bit of issues yeah I mean Oh
methadone vehicles down on sale in
actually just I want to throw the stat
out there a number currently for the
crysis 3 on this this website has all
the statistics that you'd ever want to
know about the game you know if you're
playing it it's a crisis 3 s.com and
currently there's 298 players on PC
there's 798 players on ps3 and 852 on
360 so that's unbelievable that the pc
is so low and 360 s you know the highest
yeah sidering it came from pc you know
yeah but it the developers and
especially the CryEngine ruined it for
pc
yeah because it people don't even give
it a shot they're not going to take a
chance at their computer can't run it
and not to mention when they put right
on the box that if you want to run it on
high settings that it recommends a 680
with no five-hundred-dollar graphics
card people aren't gonna buy that right
right not in this and this economy shoot
um Matthew Matthews hon heart I think
hopeful saying that right he wants to
know if we've ever messed with World of
Tanks I haven't what just haven't you
which is funny cuz i have in-game cash
just sit right over there a code for
that that Hawkin and I'll planetside 2 I
would play planetside 2 but I've got
some co-workers that play it love it and
I really should check it out since it's
a free-to-play but alright skeptic ah
I'm guys I'm gonna mutilate your name's
I'm sorry it seems like the only people
who speak up or the ones that like the
hardest names to say okay skipped tick
Tom 818 says Jay question when I get a
new motherboard replace your old one do
you have to uninstall all the drivers
from your old motherboard and if so how
when you get a new motherboard you're
going to have to fresh install
everything so it's not like you have to
worry about movement any drivers because
one your new motherboard is going to
come with a driver disk for all of its
chipset drivers you're going to have to
reinstall windows in most cases and all
of the computers have ever built and all
of the computers have ever upgraded I've
only I'd say lesson five times ever had
windows boot in an existing installation
on a new motherboard because it has to
do with the the chipset drivers and if
you're going with the chipset that's in
the same generation windows will be able
to boot otherwise windows's is installed
based on the motherboard chipset and the
SATA drivers and the controller
specifically it's the controller of your
hard drive that's built into the
motherboard that matters you can
sometimes make it work with a repair
install it's it's iffy and then usually
you come up with some some finicky
problems after that and it looks like we
just had move on to drop off the call
here it's going to try to reconnect in
there hmm
let's see if we can get him back am I
still alive can you guys still hear me
hello yeah let's see if we can get him
back here yeah I think you might be
having a some sort of a problem there
I'm not dropping any frames so I know
I'm still connected interesting alright
well go ahead and get into more of your
questions here we got 15 more minutes
left pharma get out of here and get some
dinner my wife is cooking over there and
I can smell it and I'm hungry I'm like
very hungry hopefully I'm not just
sitting here talking to myself which
would be the first time I've ever done
that okay um our bros says who makes the
music for my videos I am a full screen
partner and with that I get an entire
library of music that's available to me
so all of my music is provided by a
company called audio micro com it's not
free music by the way so yeah if you
guys want to you know get the music that
I use it's not something you can just go
and download for free without especially
without being pirated and I don't really
want to do any of that stuff looks like
he's back alright are you back hey I'm
back sorry I crashed I don't know why
well you just did like a max Hagan thing
there what's up you just did like a
whole max Hedren head run thing they
remember him no from it was like a cow
is he a Pepsi or coke it was like the
floating head and the monitor thing and
he was always like like glitching
whatever all I'm an 80s child like you I
think we're close to the same age but
anyway all right um everyone's been
sitting here telling me to stop talking
to myself because that's what i was
doing for a little while sorry about
that guys I don't know why that's
probably a sign that need to upgrade my
ancient hardware my skype crashed I
don't know what's going on with that
yeah some people are still putting up
here that bomb or two is in custody that
that's awesome news I hate the fact that
it's gonna get a hot meal and a roof
over his head but yeah you know whatever
at least he gets to hits to be
somebody's girlfriend right I did not
get skype army i did not get gears award
judgment rampage if you're asking me
matthews hun heart wants to know if I
think the asrock probe what do you think
of the asrock probe for motherboard I
think asrock or asrock whatever they
call it has definitely made a name its
port self over the past I'd say five
years asrock was always known as like
the cheap motherboard the $35
motherboard you know something cheap to
make your computer run but you hoped it
would work long enough before you could
save up money and replace it but now
that pro series motherboard I really
like it in fact um asrock I believe if
i'm not mistaken makes the fatality
series motherboard which is a gaming
grade motherboard so asrock pro for for
intel highly recommended human livestock
says baseball's new anchor news anchor I
love spaceballs by the way I have that
movie memory yeah right and I swear I
wore out of DVD and now any my wife
bought it on blu ray for me alright guys
know uh 40 minutes just dream getting
your questions guys I was gonna touch
back on um you had stated how you know
window is doesn't transfer to new
hardware very well well that's one
advantage to who uh Linux an ubuntu i
can tell you guys right now i switched
out i was running my server ubuntu 12.04
point2 it's uh the the latest long-term
release version of ubuntu i was running
it on an ancient dell dimension 8200
with only 256 megabytes of ram and a p4
in it and I switched it over to a p4
celeron uh celeron d with two gigs of
ram and so and i'm the motherboard i put
in there was a foxconn something or
other and all i did was just transfer
the five hard drives from one case to a
new server case and hooked everything up
plugged it in and the computer booted
right up and everything was fine so I
mean that's just one advantage to
running Linux an ubuntu that i just
wanted to point out and it's because
everything the modules are built into
the kernel and that's why that's what
differs from you know the windows
operating system has all the different
controller drivers you know separate for
every controller whereas the most
whereas the most common modules are
built right into the kernel for linux
yeah I I look I kind of liken windows as
in to remember on the the spider-man of
the spider-man movie where they had
venom and that that black note are kind
of like makes its way into your body
that's windows and your body is the
border when you switch the motherboard
it's got a re insert itself and it's
just not Renly at switching ok so red X
wins says Bitcoin mining talk i
don't--but queen so I'm not I don't
personally I don't think point either I
don't do big I see I saw the other day a
bunch of youtubers we're talking about a
purchasing stock of you know Bitcoin and
how it was going from like to 16 to
share down 76 dollars a share and how it
was just so volatile you know oh yeah
it's quite an interesting interesting
currency system and online currency
system very strange right um let's see
here Jessica Gleason says what's my take
on the zone are fo bus sound card I was
take I was looking at it and I hear my
daughter banging on my door you guys are
probably gonna hear kids screaming soon
um I've never I looked into it I've
looked at the specs one second that's
fine yeah so um I've listened to the IRA
I've heard it before in a in a test
system microcenter had one in a in a
system that was there can you hear that
can you hear her yeah let's talk all
right my daughter wants to be on the
stream or something anyway you guys are
just gonna have to listen to that in the
background she's trying to literally
break in the office um it's it is it is
extremely expensive um but you know a
lot of the the games I play I play with
my logitech g930 headphones
here these these are a wireless USB
headphone system there are 7.1 surround
their cordless so I'm not plugging into
a sound card I prefer something like
this because it's all in one these this
is the sound card and I really do like
logitech products when it comes to the
sound quality so it's hard for me to
recommend a graph a sound card that's
you know 200 bucks 300 bucks and unless
you're building some sort of a home
theater PC like a surround system then
you want to invest in your sound card
because you're going to be putting that
into a receiver so Jessica it I don't
know it really depends on what you want
to do if that money takes away from any
other performance aspect of your
computer I never think sound cards are
worth the money my system that we hear
my system over here that people have
been drooling over as long as I've been
on YouTube I use the built-in THX sound
card on the motherboard I don't use
discrete sound billion like because like
I said most of mean my sound card right
now is my mic my Yeti is a sound card so
I have all the sounds of the system
going through the Yeti into my ear phone
so I can hear me talk I can hear you
everything through the headset and do
the mic so me personally I don't spend
the money on sound cards like that cue
evil 1015 wants to know what I plan on
doing with the 900d case when I get it I
plan on taking my water cooling to the
next level and I'm thinking about doing
straight acrylic tubing with all all
bends being done with swivel fittings
and and making it look like almost like
steampunk kind of in a way I've always
liked the steampunk look and since it's
a black case I might do chrome are not
chrome copper accents on it rather than
black or red or white or whatever's
mainstream but the amount of room that I
have in that case God what couldn't I do
I could build another computer and put
it inside there if I want right it's
huge that the 900 e is so big you could
fit my switch 810 in there and still
have room you can fit I can fit in a 50
d inside of it or any hundred d inside
of it I mean I'm like so behind on all
the the hardware and the cases and
everything like I said but I had tweeted
out that picture of this full-size case
that i thought was
humongous yeah and you just like tweeted
back and you're like oh that's tiny it's
a slight say it just baby yeah i mean
the case i have over here that's not the
mean the 800d is bigger the cosmos 2 is
bigger than 950 900 e is just there's
nothing on the planet as big as the 900
e my and my switch 810 has nine
expansion slots so and I could fit a guy
took out all the external or the
internal hard drive bays but I could
have fit you know 10 hard drives in
there if I wanted it's it's a massive
case yeah I would / doona I do it isn't
I don't understand is that that's is
that still considered a desktop case it
is it's but it's considered a super
tower oh okay all right yeah king of
honey badgers awesome name by the way
and I like his little picture don't care
it's about my film with iOS hardware so
your iphone 3gs over the period of about
three days went from eight hour battery
to 10 minute battery any idea what's
wrong yeah you probably reached your
match max from battery cigars charge
like yeah see what people a lot of you
know people who aren't familiar with
nickel metal hydride which that's not
but it's a lip lipo or lithium polymer
battery maybe its lithium-ion remember
where they put the 3gs they have a
certain amount of charge cycles that
they're rated to and just like when you
have an RC car or anything and you're
playing around with it and then it just
kind of dies on you there's no warning
laptop batteries lapsewood laptop well
you know older laptops they just don't
hold a charge anymore that's what's
happened to your phone and you gotta
look at the a of your phone yeah it's
the battery on that thing is it's done
and you can don't don't get upset if if
that sounds like it's scary to you on
most places if you go on craigslist for
your area you can find some sort of an
iphone repair guy in your area and they
can switch those batteries out usually
for like 50 bucks or something so oh
yeah look on craigslist some people like
put up craigslist things yeah Matthew
Matthews hunt heart says its lithium-ion
cuz he works for apple yeah you know
that's the thing with lithium-ion they
have great battery life but when they're
done they're done it's not like you
still
to see a gradual decay in the battery
it's just it's the battery is
microchipped controlled there's
microchips inside the battery and when
they're done that's it you know so when
people start saying they see degrading
quality life in their batteries
especially on their iPhones it's like no
you have something on your phone that's
eating your battery there's nothing
wrong with a battery of your phone okay
so Joe 34 jay says so how about that
sapphire radeon HD 7770 I don't really
have a whole lot to say about it like I
said I'm a I'm a hardware snob I'm very
used to the high-end graphics cards have
not dabbled in the hundred and fifty
dollar range you know 100 I think that
card goes for like 165 ish I don't play
around in that range too much normally
because the system's I'm building or for
people who when they say build me a
computer I want to be able to play ultra
settings you know you don't dip below
the 7870 at that point anyone know about
a good forty dollar case with a window
and led go and look at the 850 dollar pc
build i did it's titled how to build a
gaming computer that case was 35 bucks
and I don't remember passive window I
know it has a vent on the on the side
panel go and check it out that case we
were all really impressed with all the
features you get for that case for 35
bucks thank you what the the ultra case
that I then I took a picture of today
and showed you i actually bought that
edit used computers to add computer
parts store for like twenty bucks and
it's got a side window but and that
there's no LED like the guys asking
about but that's just something to check
into if you have any used computer parts
doors this case was like brand new I
mean there was just a few little nicks
on the clear case but otherwise it came
with everything for twenty bucks I mean
something to look into yeah and and
Matthew saying that logis logisys has a
lot of forty dollar cases in that case I
use for the 850 build it does come with
a blue LED fan which kind of gives you
the color or light that you're looking
for so it may work for you five minutes
left guys so this is the lightning round
getting your questions and I just want
to go ahead and say ahead of time ubu
thanks for coming onto the show it's
been fun an hour goes by so fast would
have someone
here with me it's amazing yeah and I
really appreciate you have me out I mean
it means a lot to me i'm at about 840
subs it seems like it's taking me a
while to get to that thousand mark but
once i do i'm gonna do a giveaway for
all my current subscribers and you know
you guys if you're interested in crysis
3 or you know I even have black ops 2 I
have shank 2 I have black and I do a
little tech you know so little tech
things here and there come on and check
out my channel it's a bunt to addictive
and it is Egyptian by the way you guys
can just click it and it'll take you
there so make sure you open it up a new
tab though don't leave the stream now
this guy says human livestock says what
video capture card do you recommend i
use msi afterburner and fraps to record
gameplay but I'm sick of 30 frames per
second recording cap and leg I hate
fraps because it really reduces the
audio codec to where everybody sounds
like they're talking on an AM radio
afterburners okay I just don't care much
for its capture software the software I
use is not free but then again neither
is fraps if you want longer than 30
seconds I use Dxtory and dxtory you can
capture any frame rate you set including
120 frames per second if you have 120 or
monitor now to capture at that rate you
better have you have to have a good
system but so I mean if you if you've
got a mid to low-end system don't think
that you're going to be able to capture
60 frames per second but what do you
want to do with the footage you want to
put it on YouTube YouTube's 30 frames
per second caps so you're going to
capture it 60 frames per second upload
it and then be converted back to 30
frames so and a lot of people to their
so caught up on the frame rate of when
they capture video you know when you
watch your TV you're seeing 29.97 frames
per second when you go to the movie
theater you see in 24 so that's that's
the standard you know and there's
another thing that I noticed too that I
don't know a lot of people will take
note of for those of you who do YouTube
or you know capture video go to youtube
and download like a video and just look
at the the max bitrate setting of it oh
it's no more like an HD or 720p download
when I look at it after YouTube's done
transcoding and everything it's like 15
you know megabits Mac
bitrate so I see people capturing like
30 meg bit rate and it's just waste
taking up hard drive space for no reason
when it's just going to be down
converted by YouTube again yeah and you
know at when I do my captures I capture
at 4000 okay for my for night if I do
any sort of capturing for YouTube like
right now I'm uploading to youtube at
10,000 k only because I'm trying to fix
the voice lag and by the way is the
voice leg still there and I think it
might be there a little bit I think it's
better than it was like when I was on
here with boogie it was like a half a
second delayed it was stupid Carson
Bigelow that's an awesome name to I like
the way the Carson's well what's for my
opinion on the gigabyte super OC Jacob
gtx680 should you get that or another
vendor if it's the wind force the
gigabyte windforce with the three fans
is the coolest and quietest graphics
card you can buy however I don't know
what the hell gigabyte has up its assets
so obsessed with blue PCBs and if you
have a case window like me I would never
put a blue PCB in my computer because
you can see everything on the inside and
it just looks god-awful so if you don't
want the blue PCB look at msi and their
twin frozr or look at EVGA with their
their duel fans set up it's a little bit
boxy and square but it's a lot cooler
you could also always get a reference
card and add an aftermarket you know
triple fan cooler for it if you want it
as well so looks like people are saying
there's no voice leg tonight thank God I
don't know what the hell was going on
but it was really really pissing me off
alright guys if you haven't done it yet
go over to booze channel the link is
down there in the description go and
click subscribe even if you haven't
checked out any of the videos yet give
them a chance go and watch them you know
I you've YouTube is a funny funny place
now because I think you set it in your
video and I don't want to starting the
controversy though people the big
channels are growing so incredibly fast
Smosh has 9.1 million they've gained
nearly a million in the last couple of
months it's what is just crazy it's
crazy how the bit it seems like the big
you too
brazil jump um what a white boy went
from a million to two million in like
six months or whatever they just I don't
I don't know I mean I you know what it
is I think I think there's just it has
to do with Google's algorithms of
promoting yeah I was to watch stuff
right so it just snowballs it makes I
mean it makes sense I guess yeah it is
what it is and I just got to keep doing
what I'm doing and I'm still having fun
doing it so that's why I do this stuff
you know and that's what it is so I feel
bad for chief f cheaper I sound like I
have a lisp hey chief f now he says yeah
I made it he had to work late so you
missed the stream unfortunately for you
we're getting off now i mean i'll give
it a couple more minutes but hey at
least you cut the last few minutes and
don't forget there is always the replay
button and you know it's always going to
be there like the last four uploads i
think or live streams but i am coming
out of the video i'm going to be making
it tonight we'd be releasing it tomorrow
i still am not sure exactly which one I
want to do it's maybe a toss-up between
the 7870 gigahertz review and
overclocking performance or how to know
when it's time to upgrade your pc and I
kind of feel like I could have some fun
with that when to note how to know it's
time to upgrade your pc i feel like i
could almost make that as a spoof but
still get the point across I know right
as we'll see ya Jake Harvey just made me
happy by saying Smosh is garbage so is
PewDiePie when I watch those types of
channels I feel Dumber by the end of it
but let's face it they're playing the
system because YouTube is like eighty
percent 13 to 17 year olds so if you can
go out there and you know put out that
kind of humor then you'll grow but
whatever it is it's it's working for me
and I'm glad I could get the you know
gets you guys some little bit of
exposure even you know 10,000 on YouTube
is still not a very big you know not a
very big chunk of the pie but it's
something and I'm let's it's it's
awesome to have seen you grown like i
said i think i was in may be at the
couple thousand mark on for you and I
mean it's awesome you're almost at the
ten thousand mark or what you know
wherever you're at it's just keep doing
what you're doing man i really
appreciate the videos you're putting out
you know you put in the high-quality
effort and you can you can tell in your
you know and you're in your video it's
about kill mice
sometimes because I told my wife the
other day you know examined insomniac
and if you follow me on my if anyone
follows me on my vlog channel you guys I
know I'm an insomniac I don't sleep like
last night I went to bed kind of early I
guess you could say but it was like 130
on a work night my daughter comes and
wakes me up about six in the morning and
so I've been I've been taking some sleep
aids and I told my wife that's why there
hasn't been that much videos in the last
week because my youtube career starts at
9pm when everyone else goes to bed so
that's okay I can go to work now and do
the youtube thing well I've been
sleeping so I got a little bit of energy
back so I'm gonna try and put something
out good for you guys this weekend and
you know hopefully you guys will enjoy
it and thank you guys for coming Ubu

glad to do so yeah and excellent thanks
