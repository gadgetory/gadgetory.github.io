and as you can see it is a very
furiously cold day here in Southern
California it's 85 degrees and I'm
freezing no seriously guys today we're
going to take a look because it's
holiday season of a really cool device
that I think maybe you guys should
consider putting in that stocking if
you're doing holiday shopping this year
we're going to be looking at the
ravpower luster series it's got luster
to it battery charger this is a very
cool battery charger you don't want to
miss this now grab power is a company
that I hadn't actually never heard of
until they contacted me so I did a lot
of research before I accepted this
review and I feel confident this is a
battery charger that's not going to blow
up your device because we really don't
want that right unless that's the effect
you're going for it comes in four
different colors here Pink why they call
it Lester people black gold and silver
today we're taking a look at the gold
model a little bit of specs about this
here is a three thousand million battery
as you can see it's very portable just
based on the size and box and it's
designed to go with you wherever you go
and it's going to be keeping your phone
your device nicely charged it is a
five-fold 1 amp output so it is going to
be able to charge your any cellphone or
smartphone and even some tablets out
there you know I can really be charging
an iPad off this thing I wouldn't even
try the weight is 2.9 3 ounces and have
a fly in my face okay enough about the
specs let's just go ahead and see what
is inside the box here
you have your paperwork and stuff I mean
I don't look at this stuff I'm a guy
that's just how we roll and we have the
gold one here as you can see still
wrapped in plastic but what's really
unique about this battery that I haven't
shown you yet is that it is also a
flashlight and it's a very bright
flashlight and it's got this defense
mode i call it you know stranger danger
stay away you can blind your your
opponents and your foes so it's got dual
purpose it's a eyes up here dude these
these droplets so on the back it has a
USB port output on there so you can plug
in a USB cable it does come supplied
with a standard micro-usb cord it's not
the longest cord but that's fine you're
not going to really need a long board
for this looks like it's probably going
to be right around two feet and it does
have check this out a scratch it
arrangement that it's very tight yeah
so I can be nerdy and charged no
seriously this is a nifty little thing I
know if I'd actually carry it that way
but because i have CES coming up i
definitely am interested in this battery
because it's going to 3000 milliamps
will give you more than a full charge
off of a smartphone and we'll go ahead
and demonstrate that right now i shoulda
brought my iphone out hit a time up play
this plug this thing in doing that to
push anything the moment you plug it in
it's charging and like i said i did my
research on this and i tested it out for
quite a while before filming this review
i'm confident that's not going to blow
up my phone and you know yeah flashlight
stranger danger cool it's really bright
I mean I made the mistake once of
shining this thing in my face in the
dark I was seeing a circle for about six
days so if you value your vision don't
look straight at this seriously and when
it comes to charging this thing you also
charge it off of any standard USB
charger so you can plug it in with the
USB side the full-size USB slide into
the charger and this into your device or
you can flip it around the other way put
the microUSB side in the back here and
charge this off of a laptop or any other
wall charger wall brick they may have
for other devices so you have it guys
this is the wall the wall the ravpower
luster series power bake three thousand
million charger I don't like to talk
about price on these videos because the
prices are always changing and the video
is pretty much etched in stone once i
upload it but it's very very cheap if
you wanna know how cheap go check it out
over on ravpower they didn't pay me to
say that this is just something that I
think is really cool as a tech nerd
myself I can't wait till the first guy
comes and tries to attack me so I can
blind them there you go guys if you
liked this video subscribe buy this for
a loved one or buy it for yourself full
of luster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
