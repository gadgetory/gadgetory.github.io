gonna find out to say that I have
sensitive eyes would be the
understatement of the century
I have extremely sensitive eyes when it
comes to looking at screens and things
all day after all I do work in IT and I
work in software development I look at
computers all day long so recently I
reached out to you guys on Twitter and I
said hey what can I do to help my eyes
because my eyes are freakin burning
they're so red sometimes you guys accuse
me of doing illegal activities at least
Arial illegal here and I do not do such
activities and I was quite surprised but
how many of you guys said give gunner
optics a try alright guys disclaimer I'm
going to put it out there right now I
reached out to gunner gunner did not
reach out to me in fact they didn't even
want to send me a bear until they looked
at my channel realize just how awesome I
really am so as I mentioned earlier many
of you guys said hey try gunner but a
lot of you guys also said try a program
called flex and I'm going to talk about
both of those today now first things
first what is gunner
well Gunners is a brand that makes
eyewear designed specifically for
looking at digital displays in fact I am
using the gunner Regent's here they are
right here I mean they have this kind of
an amber look and what it does is it
really warms up yeah guys I know I look
really nerdy now just live enjoy this
Jay looks like a dork I now look the
part of the PC geek talking about
computers and processors and
overclocking and water cooling and stuff
and inputs and outputs and things yeah
now I look perfect don't I just just
don't ask me about the flux capacitors
because that secret alright so before I
actually give my opinion on these I have
been using these now for about a week I
do like the regions let's talk about the
frame first of all they have lots of
different styles lots of different
frames and I mean they can pretty much
suit pretty much any style I mean the
Regents are really nice they're very
flexible as you can see they have the
spring-loaded earpieces and
I'm very unlikely to break them very
soft nose pads on they're very stylish I
really like these and I think they kind
of compliment me I think they look okay
they look kind of funny when you first
put them on people would people in my
office made fun of me until I pass them
around and we'll talk about that in a
minute now
they are sort of an amber color and
what's interesting about that when you
first put them on it's very similar to
if you took your screen and you put it
on the warm preset on your monitor and
that's the first thing I noticed is it
made everything more contrast it made
everything more clear and it made my
eyes no longer squint when I'm looking
at the screen and I already adjust my
brightness down as I mentioned I'm very
very sensitive in the eyes now I know
some of you guys are already mashing
buttons on your keyboard saying just try
flex just try flex just try sex I kind
of sounded like a bad word for a second
there I'm gonna tell you why flux
doesn't work for me now I'm not saying
these glasses are gonna work for you and
I'm not saying they're not going to work
for you guys your eyes were all unique
for instance 3d going to 3d movies IMAX
a a 3d plasma TV in my living room that
I've never engaged a 3d on because my
eyes and my brain and the the computing
power that take division in flips it 180
because as you guys know your vision is
actually upside down and your brain is
converting the image right-side up
sometimes 3d makes things very difficult
for people to brains and when your brain
is biggest mind there's not enough room
in there so you can't flip the image all
the way over and I get a migraine I'm
serious guys like I can't do 3d I get
migraines so my eyes like I said are
very very sensitive now these took all
of the strain of looking at the monitor
all day off my eyes my eyes are not
nearly as bloodshot at the end of the
day I find myself a lot less doing this
and rubbing my eyes and squinting and
all that in fact many of my co-workers
agreed when I let them try them they all
agreed that when they put him on Wow
it's easier to look at things I mean the
objects themselves are Carl Zeiss these
are carl zeiss optics if you guys know
anything about cameras Carl Zeiss is
kind of a big deal his apartment smells
of rich mahogany and he has many
leather-bound books
you just can't argue with Carl where's
coral sorry little little Walking Dead
joke there after using them for a week I
have to say
that I cannot stand looking at my
monitors without them at work at home
I'm constantly wearing them and guys I
actually forgot to bring them to work
today and I freaked out because my eye
is just I was like oh my god I'm so
accustomed to these now I love them so
much now why don't I use flex here's the
problem with flux one it makes your
screen look like poop okay I tried it
for a moment and then it dawned on me
guys
I have multi monitor setup here I have a
computer over here computer behind me I
have a computer at work I also have the
computers of all the other users who I'm
also troubleshooting their systems
looking at their monitors I'm looking at
servers I'm looking at so many different
screens my smartphone my tablets my TV
you can install flex on all that stuff
now these aren't just for PC gamers I
think many of you guys are kind of stuck
in that realm of like what spell flux
you know fixes your problem well you
would be assuming that everybody is
looking at a computer monitor and that's
not the case in fact it would be very
narrow-minded and naive to assume that
everyone is looking at a computer
monitor
I mean console gamers can wear that many
console gamer stairs or screens for
hours a day hours so you can't install
flux on your console can you many of us
are looking at tablets or smartphones
all the time and if you're bouncing
around different machines like I am in
the software an IT environment I'm not
going to install flux on every machine
in the company sorry
not going to happen so these were the
easiest way to take the eye strain off
of my eye now for me personally they
work they make my eyes feel hydrated by
the end of the day one because the fan
in my in my desk is not blowing directly
my eyes I have some eye protection on
there and two just the way that the
optics are and they're not just there's
a there's a slight prescription to them
that's the first thing I noticed when I
put them on as well is that there's a
slight prescription to where things do
move slightly when it comes to the
perspective so there is a little bit of
optic correction in there and I could
just be the curvature but there is some
slight optic correction in there as well
as the color change of the monitor
itself I personally think they work for
my eyes now they may not work for your
eyes you guys may know people who said
no they're garbage they don't work my
opinion on this is they do work now
remember I reached out to gunner they
come to me and say hey do you want to do
a review so right off the bat you guys
have to throw any bias out the window
because I'm with you in the beginning I
didn't think optics like this worked at
all and now I can't get through my day
without them so if I if I ever lose
these it's good to be a big deal we
could be very upset I'd like to kill
something I'll break something sorry
sorry
so guys gunner optics they've got so
many different types of lenses are
available in prescriptions are available
in sunglasses you'd have to go to their
website and check it out I mean I wasn't
even given a review kit with these I
even requested some information about
the optics so I knew a little more about
the science behind them so unfortunately
I didn't get it so we're just kind of
talking from my perspective here for me
personally they work so there it is guys
gunner optics go and try them out they
are I've seen them at Fry's Electronics
I've seen the Micro Center the packaging
on them is fantastic they come with this
little white carrying bag which also
doubles as a cleaning bag and the box is
nifty it's got this flap on there so you
can be like oh I'm gonna rubbed action I
work whatever alright guys time to get
the heck on out of here stay tuned I may
be doing a review of my new camera rig
also got my tea - I hooked up on a
slider so now as you guys may have
noticed in this video there's some
pretty cool b-roll stuff going on there
so hope you guys have enjoyed the video
if you have you know what to do with it
if you guys hate it you know where you
can put it and as always see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
