here and welcome to the very last 960
review you will find on this channel
today we're taking a look at the msi gtx
960 gaming 2g
coolermaster skin smart world series is
where you will find the most custom
computers on the planet and Ahmad
Coolermaster dot-com for more details
breather now if I said I wasn't a fan of
MSI for years and years then I think
that you could go ahead and call me a
flat-out liar because I love MSI
graphics cards I always have I love
their coolers I love how much effort
they put into the cooling design the
aesthetic design and when it comes to
gamers they make something that's not
overly flashy but just looks really
freaking cool and the next generation
twin froze are like we're looking at
here which they debuted obviously on the
900 series cards I love the way that
these look and I also love the fact that
they carried that lineage all the way
down to the 960 which is obviously a lot
harder to make a profit on for companies
like this when they start putting in
their top two your coolers and such even
on lesser expensive cards now I'm going
to point out because you guys know how
to fill back back plates that there is
no back plate on this card but I'm not
going to hold it against companies that
don't put back plates on cards like nine
60s and nine 50s if there was such a
thing I know 750ti is kind of like the
950 but at this price point I don't
expect to see back plates I expect to
see them on top to your cards like nine
70s and nine 80s so I'm not going to
hold it against MSI but it is worth
noting that there are brands that have
back plates on their cards like the I
believe the Strix has one as well as the
gigabyte g1 gaming has one so those are
nice little extras but it's not a huge
deal on cards like this at the entry
level definitely be nice to see but
again it's not something I'm going to
hold against them at that price point
but speaking of the Twin Frozr cooler
this one here actually touches the GPU
itself it doesn't touch any of the ran
chips it doesn't have any sort of a
plate on here like the EVGA cards have
where there's a plate that runs the
entire length of the PCB that kind of
heat spreads heat that comes off the
VRMs and the
the memory chips so there is no memory
cooling on this one whatsoever they're
exposed and then there is a small like
kind of a billet heatsink that they put
on the vrm here up on the front but then
again these cards do not get hot the
VRMs do not get too hot so it's okay
that there's a little bit less or
cooling option for the PCB and the vrm
now there are three heat pipes on here
that are keeping this thing nice and
cool along with two I believe these are
100 millimeter fans which are only going
to turn on when needed which in this
case is above 61 degrees Celsius and
then they will turn off when they get
down to a predetermined temperature just
like all the other Maxwell cards and
then you can customize that if you want
to now it's not a whole lot to talk
about here I mean it's pretty much a
standard 960 it's got your DVI dual link
it's got your hdmi 2.0 and it's got
three DisplayPort 1.2 s so I guess
really all there is to do is go ahead
and plug this thing into the system run
our gambit of benchmarks and they'll
talk about this card and where it comes
in on the price point and why I think
this is really the best of the bunch
that I've reviewed on this channel so
without further ado let's go ahead and
run that transition a lot of people a
lot of people like the little minion guy
I like him he's kind of cool
and you
now obviously the aesthetics of this
graphics card are very very pleasing if
you're into this more aggressive looking
gaming style in fact I mean obviously
it's called MSI gaming 2g for a reason
but it even has a white glowing MSI and
dragon logo on the top which faces the
right way so in your standard case with
a side window you are going to see a
nice glowing emblem in there that will
match any color bill because it's white
like the gigabyte graphics card with
blue the EVGA graphics card didn't light
up at all but this one will fit any
single build aesthetic granted I guess
if it's a red build aesthetic since it's
red and black card but the LED at least
is white which is going to be nice as
well something else that makes this card
impressive is the fact that even though
it has only that one PCI Express 8 pin
connector it still is able to deliver
just as high of an overclock of over
1500
I think 1524 megahertz is what we got
out of this plus 300 megahertz on the
memory we were able to get the same FPS
in fact a little bit higher average fps
in some titles than the other graphics
cards we looked at and have more phases
there you go guys Jason is looking at
the GTX 960 from MSI I promise this is
the last 960 we're going to look at even
if someone else offers someone else
offers one up to the channel I'm going
to turn down enough 960 coverage we know
we get it besides something new maybe
coming around the corner because NVIDIA
has sent out invites to the graphics
cards or Nvidia's GPU conference in
March that's 10 that was when the Titan
was launched two years ago so maybe
we'll be looking at something new here I
don't know I got the invite
unfortunately I can't go so I'll be
getting the information on the side if
you will we get a little real side
platter going on there alright guys
thanks for watching this I know that gtx
960 coverage has been a bit heavy this
go-around
but we'll get back to some good gaming
content some good overclocking and other
hardware stuff some more how to's and
I'm heading up to Seattle on Wednesday
the 18th of February which is only a few
days away
hanging out with Barnacle E's nerdgasm
up there we're going to go on a PDX land
if you guys are going PDX land make sure
you come and say hi to us take some
pictures we love to meet our fans
and we're gonna see what kind of
shenanigans we can get up to get into up
there in a Seattle I'm afraid is going
to be cold let me shoot it's been in the
80s here in Southern California alright
see you guys in Seattle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
