about damn time
sorry guys it's my fault no it's all
right
obviously you guys were here with post
Malone we've got to build behind us
we're gonna chat a little bit we're
gonna talk about the bill we're gonna
show it to you because this has been a
crazy year obviously for both of us but
probably more so for you so yeah let's
get right to it do you want to be cooler
do you want to be more desirable you
know what guys I got new merch it's
available now karma calm /jc sense we
got zip up hoodies we got tri-blend we
got a new logo I digress since 2012 it's
at the wrist logo you guys been asking
for that anyway well guys live it up we
hope kinds of zip up hoodies beanies
polos don't take my word for it cuz
obviously I can't do this ad so just
look in the description below and you
guys will find the link Thanks okay so
if you guys haven't seen our previous
videos please go and check those out
this has been you know it's been almost
a year it's been almost a year since you
first like DMP were like yo i fuck with
your shit and i was like somebody tell
me what that means that's why I said to
you right I was like if you think I'm
jay-z I'm not so but no he got into
computers and stuff so beer bongs and
Bentley was the album that was highly
anticipated it was delayed obviously
just like the bill so everything has to
do so since our last video the album
launched it went double platinum you did
your world tour yeah the US tour
obviously a lot of like spot events here
and there you had your postie fest so
tell me a little bit about your year
your favorite part of the year you know
we we got a lot of work done and you
know I'm proud of everything that
happened I almost died a couple times
you were supposed to be heading over to
London wasn't enough when that plane
isn't happen the landing gear wouldn't
come up or blue tyre which is scary shit
and I already hate flying so I don't
know we've had a bit of a wacky time a
bit of a zani ride what I kind of wanted
to ask you here was the songs that like
sort of or more popular that album were
they the song to expect you to be
popular or is it always just kind of
like you don't know until the public
sort of reviews the album you never
really find out until later like kind of
like even congratulations took a little
wild
blow up and pop up but you never really
know you never know until and then
you'll find out like within the first
week what people are like initially like
you know struck them you know what I
mean right
there I never really I never really
planned for anything to be like the
biggest song you know it just kind of
rise that way I think better now
resonates with a lot of people too
because obviously it's about
relationships and and you know regret
and a lot of stuff and I think a psycho
hit really hard if you release that as a
single first right I remember listening
to that and it the whole album I think
personally for me is really good today
is my favorite song because I do like
acoustic yeah and so that was that was a
song that I really liked do you have a
favorite song from an album I listened I
was like cuz I always hear like you know
psycho and better now and rock star and
shit but sometimes I think it'll come up
on my shuffle cuz I do have myself oh my
oh so it'll come up on shuffle and I'll
be like you know what this is a good
song I'm gonna listen to this and listen
to some of the ones that I might not
hear as much this was just like you have
so many different flavors and tastes of
things that you like and you said that
you're a simple guy with expensive
tastes and that was kind of like man how
do we make this work I think you're
gonna like what we came up with so
obviously this this build was very very
delayed yeah
multiple time my phone no not so our is
initially obviously because we started
with very custom Spector case which we
showed you the renders of and and it
took time for that to get designed and
they were very up front of me they're
like look we if you can give us some
time we can do some amazing stuff
unfortunately they took longer and it
put it right up to the point to when we
were finally we're starting to assemble
this thing was June and I think that you
were already taken off at that point you
were on world tour and so it became a
theme where's the post Malone build
where is the post man build well guys
it's right here so here's what we're
gonna do we are gonna go ahead and
unveil it right now we're gonna turn it
on there's a monitor hooked up that's
okay that the tower is the point of this
I'm gonna tell you right now that what
you have here is a hundred percent one
of one mmm there is a there's a lot of
off-the-shelf parts a lot of custom
parts on this and the fact that was
delayed was kind of good because we got
to sort of see the public
response to beer bongs and Bentley's the
success of it kind of makes this a
little bit more of a tribute piece to
where it's like okay you you've wrapped
up your tour you've wrapped up a crazy
2018 so this will be kind of be like the
cherry on top all right let's take a
look okay so here it is almost a year
later close your eyes close your eyes
we're gonna do this very dramatically
here all right go ahead and open them
fuck yeah boy that shit is so bitchin I
need another beer you have no idea how
much time I took making this fluid look
like beer look we've even got in the
bubbles yeah - this piece down here on
the bottom the beer bongs and Bentley
logo that was actually made by my friend
Joe he works with Sanctum so he custom
milled that that's actually inlaid
acrylic and he basically had to shave it
all out and then make it into pieces and
then playing it and polish it and all
that I had the idea of when I got the
case to actually know out the opening
behind that metal plate in backlight is
because this was intended to be not so
much a computer but an art piece that
has a computer in it unfortunately guys
I I did break a guitar string on this
shit happen yeah well you see how it
sticks out a little bit so I grabbed it
and thing but we can restring there hell
yeah
this is fucking bitchin man it's a suit
it's fucking awesome all that was
custom-made this is so sick this is
obviously the hardest partier cuz the
beer bongs and Bentley's the beer is one
thing we got the blood light you know
logo and stuff in there but the Bentley
grill see we got the barbed wire going
around here
this piece was all custom-made water
jetted all right so do you think we came
anywhere close it's fucking sick hell
yeah it's mad sick this is awesome let's
talk about the specs real quick cuz
that's something we didn't really talk
about
it's a 79 40 X oh it's a 14 core 28
thread overclocked Intel processor 2
NVIDIA Titan X peas which are water
cooled and overclocked a lot of people
were asking me if I was going to upgrade
the cards to the RT X cards which have
launched since this you know I'm kind of
glad we decided not to only because like
we talked about little bit off camera
unfortunately there seems to be some RMA
or failure issues with some of those
cards I don't want there to be even a
remote chance we have to come back out
and take this apart I want this to be
solid it's a singularity computer
Specter case which sauce you obviously
built custom one-off to match the beer
mugs and mentally I you know theme and
Rockstar this I gotta tell you as much
