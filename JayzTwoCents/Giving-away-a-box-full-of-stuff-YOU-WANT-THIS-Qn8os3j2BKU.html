doing that series about cooling down
your computers in the summer and it's
kind of funny because a lot of follow
ups people send me or about their
systems there's a lot of dated systems
out there and I feel bad and I feel sad
when I see that so that's why I am going
to do officially my first giveaway of
the summer even though we are all the
way through July because I'm giving away
the contents of this box so anyway the
link is in description below no I'm just
kidding you guys have to know what
you're gonna win obviously so let's
start this off I'm gonna be giving away
an unopened unused risin 2600 this is a
6 quart 12 thread am for 2nd gen rise in
CPU definitely a baller of a CP if you
wanna do live streaming video encoding
gaming you can do it all with that
obviously need a motherboard to put it
on so that's why I have chosen the MSI
x4 70 gaming mm7
AC this is a full RGB high-tier
motherboard and there was a CPU inside
of it it's got all of the stuff you
would expect this is a full ATX board
no-holds-barred
this board is top tier check this out
that is a sexy looking board right there
you've got your nvme SSD slots
underneath there we reinforced PCI
Express slots all that stuff so that's
what your processor is gonna go on
obviously you need some RAM and sort of
got right here is the guile Evo X this
is 16 gigabytes of ddr4 optimized for
rise in RGB memory if you can't tell a
little bit of an RGB theme here so 16
gigabytes that goes that goes here next
to the CPU like that you need something
to play games on right so what I have
right here this isn't the actual one
you're gonna win this is more of a prop
this is a GTX 1074 EVGA they are sending
me however the new for the wind - it's
not really new it's actually like a year
and a half old but so for the win - I
see X card so you can monitor things
like your memory temperatures your power
delivery temperatures of course your GPU
temperatures it's got nine
sensors on the motherboard allowing you
to keep tabs on all of your temperatures
that goes like right there and then
obviously we need to keep it cool and
I've done this whole summer serious
thing every year now for the last six
years six years I know that sounded like
I said sex ears
no one can last years but anyway I
digress we need a way to keep it cool so
that's why I have taken off-the-shelf my
personal unhu' 'zed a 240 water cooling
kit from ek this is the aluminum series
which stands for a this is a full custom
loop in a box it is the CPU cooler the
CPU block the pump the reservoir the
tubing the fittings the jumper the fans
everything you need and yes it supports
a m4 and that goes well yeah that
actually goes like this crap our memory
fella that's a good it goes like that on
your system so guys if you want to win
this system like I said this is
available worldwide I want everyone to
have a chance to win this you need to
look at the link in the description
below it has a link to gleam and I love
using glean because it throws out all of
the suspicious duplicate entries and
there are multiple ways to enter this
things like follow on Twitter I don't
know what all I'm gonna do but usually
it's just make sure you're subscribed
and follow on Twitter and then we'll
come up with maybe something interesting
to make it kind of fun but anyway guys

package is actually worth so guys thanks
