announcement actually you guys can
finally buy my shirts so look in the
description of today's video you guys
will find a link to my store and yeah
this helps me not to do things like
patreon which I don't want to do so
anyway yeah there's that the thread
Ripper build is going forward and but I
was waiting on some parts to be able to
continue that obviously some water
cooling stuff and I've been waiting for
my ek water block just like you guys and
I've got two of them here to take a look
at we're gonna show you what is up with
this right now though there's actually
three versions of this I have two here
so we have the nickel acetal so that's
where it's all black on the top we've
also got the nickel plexi which is where
you can see inside and there's also the
nickel nickel where it's like a metal
top like I used to have on the old
skunkworks
I think old skunkworks head that or the
testbench did one of them did anyway it
doesn't matter but I've gone ahead and
unbox them for a couple of reasons one I
just gonna spare you the pain of
watching me unbox something and - it's
already put together for you there's
nothing else in the box put the
exception of some thermal paste and a
little installation guide that's it
because the other supremacy blocks that
you guys are probably used to seeing
they're Universal they can work with all
the different intel sockets as well as
all the different AM sockets from AMD
with the exception of tr4 so these RTR
for only which is why they're already
assembled so you not to worry about
changing out jet plates and float plates
and all that stuff it's already put
together and optimized even with the
hardware and all the retention screws
and nuts on there so you're not gonna
lose it literally the easiest water
block to install that I have ever seen
now one of the reasons why I'm also
doing a video on this not just because
I'm gonna be using it but because I've
seen some stuff on the Internet of
people that were concerned about the way
the block looks right obviously this is
a square block and it's the exact same
size as the traditional top when it
comes to the ek supremacy but if you
look on the bottom you can actually see
it is indeed bigger they even had to put
two stickers together so that shows you
how much more surface area that it is
but it's actually bigger on the bottom
than the top now that's because we are
dealing with tr4 which is also a much
bigger socket so once you go ahead and
come over here and let me take out these
GPUs if you guys have been wondering
what GPUs I'm going with in this build
obviously we're using 210 ATT is
was waiting on water blocks for those as
well those should be here tomorrow
actually so the build can commence very
very soon but if you look at the size of
thread ripper right here it's pretty big
and you know what I'll be right back I
have a good comparison for you so this
is a perfect example of why they had to
redo the plate this right here is an i-5
7600 K it's dirty but anyway there it is
right there
so you can see the traditional size was
plenty big obviously right there is the
coverage of that but they also had to
cover the extreme lineup of CPUs from
and also to the AMD like km3 stuff was
also a lot bigger than this so there was
plenty of room but the problem is now if
you compare this to rise in you can see
that's not big enough in fact even where
the screws are you lose a little bit of
cooling transfer right there so that was
not going to cut it so this is what
they've done it's not that much bigger
but as you can see it gives you full
coverage of Rison right there you see
that right now one of the other
discussions though that has taken place
is regarding the proper thermal paste
application I'm actually not going with
nickel on my build here I'm actually
going with black and I'm not gonna
unveil the theme yet of my thread Ripper
build I think it's gonna be pretty cool
I hope anyway it does have a theme
indeed and it kind of sucks as I took
the cover off the plexi one because I'm
not using it I better put it back cuz J
is a dork now I think Steve with gamers
next instead of video showing the
different applications and what happens
with the way it spreads out but ek is
still recommending the dot method in the
middle but they're recommending that we
use about two rice grains normally I
wouldn't argue with the manufacturer but
based on what I saw in that video and
the way that that actually spreads out I
don't think I'm gonna do two rice grains
but what I will go ahead and do now is I
will do an application of the actual
block itself tighten it down and then
we'll see how well it spreads out and
we'll do a two-part in one video two
parts in one video now they've actually
changed the thermal paste they're
including what their CPUs they used to
use like the guile
I hear what it's called anyway but I use
Arctic silver
this is Arctic silver 5 so I'll be using
this plus I have a lot more of it so
we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead
and do the method that they recommend
which is the in the middle 2 rice grains
is that about 2 rice grains or is that
about
yeah it's about right yeah to
breast-cancer okay there's this rice
vary in size based on region so Honda
versus what Toyota I don't know it only
goes one way though you can see there's
actually different spacing between the
screws so it only goes one way do you
just say Nissan so we're gonna tighten
this down because these will only go so
far and once the threads stop that's
literally all the spread that you're
gonna get I don't think this is enough
thermal paste because remember there is
technically two sets of dies under there
so there's actually four spots under
there that are very particular in
cooling and because the heat spreader is
designed to spread the heat across the
actual IHS we want to get as much
coverage on there as possible now one
thing I want to note before I take this
off is there is indeed going to be more
spread over time especially as it heats
up gets thinner and moves more but I
want to see what the initial spread
looks like I'm even gonna push on this a
little bit I don't think it was enough
line method I don't do drugs
you ready say we got here yeah oh I
didn't take the paper off
hmm one thing worth pointing out that
screw is actually not all the way down
you see that that might be why didn't
get enough spread this screw right here
is not all the way down do you see that
the feeling that's why we didn't get
good spread even with the stick around
cause it still would have spread is
because actually we would probably got
better spread because that takes up some
space right so yeah check your blocks ek
what's up with that it's when you
tighten that down
it also looks slightly crooked I really
hope they didn't cross thread that in
there you can see that on camera right
yeah using my alcohol so yeah do
yourself a favor guys especially on
these like the first runs of things
check your screws make sure the recess
all the way I'm almost positive that's
why we didn't get good spread you don't
want to see anything above the height of
the actual base of the on the blocks I
think we're good now take two so we'll
do the dot method again forming a line
method for the rice method we're gonna
do the rice method we need a big spoiler
you know what's also just as important
though is also doing the alternate
corner tightening method because it
can't go any farther right it's
spring-loaded Nesi I just it might
spread out more that gets hot but that's
the problem is that's not gonna cover
all of it right even if it spreads out a
little more as it gets hot that's still
not enough I highly respect eks manual
but I'm gonna do it my way
I'm gonna do this very similar to how I
do the GPU blocks I'm gonna do an X very
thin X like this and then I'm going to
do a line like that
and I'm gonna do a dot dot I think this
is good this will work show you guys
well throwing stuff at your monitors
like Jay doing it wrong you're doing it
so wrong I could do this so much better
but honestly you know what I'm what Jays
official opinion is on thermal paste do
it the way you're comfortable with not
what I'm telling you to do I'm not
telling you to do this I'm doing it I
don't care what you do your computer
it's stuck down pretty good though yeah
see I I think I trust that because look
at how far it's spread on its own and as
it gets hot it'll move in more but the
other method to that Steve did was like
the four lines so I'm gonna go ahead and
Oh with the four lines like Stephen did
this is this is kind of like uncharted
territory almost I mean it's funny how
suddenly everyone argues about the right
way to do thermal paste and suddenly a
new block and chip comes along they're
like nobody knows also too it's like
all-in-one coolers like the the ACE of
tech stuff is gonna come close to
covering this that's what I'm gonna go
with I'm gonna leave it like that I
don't want to waste any more thermal
paste as you guys can see i with the
black block because we're trying to make
this there's a theme and I said there's
a theme with this it all makes sense
when we actually do the build but yeah
it's gonna look good I've got the blocks
coming for this these GPUs tomorrow so
this bill will be able to actually
continue and I need to get the screws to
hold these these cards in there is a
lock do you think look good I mean it's
good alright guys so there it is a
pretty simple video today just showing
you guys the water blocks for tr4 go and
check them out EK water blocks calm or
ekw be calm and you guys can also check
out again my store down the description
of today's video on where to buy these
shirts because they're awesome
this one's a little bit big on me but
whatever it was a prototype alright guys
thanks for watching and as always I'll
see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
