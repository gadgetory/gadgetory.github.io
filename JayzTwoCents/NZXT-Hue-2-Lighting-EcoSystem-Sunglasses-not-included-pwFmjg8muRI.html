triggers a lot of people and it's not
the lights themselves that people don't
like it's the marketing behind it what
we're going to do today is we're gonna
try and show you how NZXT is sort of
taking the approach to customizable
lighting in your system and this will
work in any case on the market so if you
guys want to see how to actually light
up your system and take full control
over the customized illumination then
you're definitely gonna want to watch
this you know what guys I got new merch
it's available now karma calm / tasty
scents we got zip up hoodies we got
tribe blend we got a new logo I digress
since 2012 but the rest logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys we
all kinda stuff up hoodies beanies polos
don't take my word for it cuz obviously
I can't do this edie so just look in the
description below and you guys will find
the link Thanks so full disclosure this
video is sponsored by NZXT they did send
over everything here for us to look at
also - this is not my first time taking
a look at the hue system we've used it
in previous builds in the past you guys
have seen me use it in plenty of
different builds in fact the member
version it was a skunk works but back in
the day skunk works actually had the
original hue system which I used to
light up that giant smh case so we've
got a few products here we're gonna take
a look at they've expanded upon the hue
line obviously it's called hue - now
because it's a second-generation hue but
since the first one came out we've ended
up with a few extra accessories so
obviously we have the e r AE our RGB
fans these are of course digital
addressable Rd RGB fans are lit on the
outside not the center hub letting light
spread across the blade like typical
this one actually has fully adjustable
ring around the arts outside of the fan
we have two ambient lighting kits and
this is something that I if you guys
have followed my Instagram for any
length of time you remember I showed a
picture of my green and purple setup and
then I had the lights illuminating on
the wall and around the desk those were
actually the ambient lighting kits which
is kind of nice about this is the fact
that you can have now your ambient light
which is either behind the monitor or
the desk or wherever you're going to
mount it integrate with your system
lighting so instead of having to have a
separate control and a separate remote
or whatever
you go to like Home Depot or Lowe's and
buy just a basic RGB kit this ties in to
your system so it can turn off with your
system it can turn on with your system
it can expand so you can have the
lighting kind of move from the system to
the to the ambient and dance and do all
kinds of stuff you want or just set it
as a static color or whatever we've also
got right here this is the actual hub
this is the huger hub this is where
everything connects to this is where
you're gonna connect your fans you're
gonna connect to your case lighting
you're gonna connect your anbiya kit
actually the n-b-a kit has its own we'll
talk about that separately but this is
the central location that everything
plugs into that is also going to provide
all the power and stuff you need for
your digital lighting and then that
plugs into a USB header on your
motherboard also - we have two newer
things here but I haven't personally
used yet that we're gonna kind of take a
look at today we've got an under glow
kit which I think's kind of hilarious
but not really because I've actually
taken adhesive strips of RGB and mounted
them on there under cases before but
this is designed as an undergrad we'll
take a look at that as well and then
this one you're they're gonna love it
you're gonna hate it it is an RGB cable
comb so basically you put this on your
24 pin your 8 pin and your 6 pin and you
can have these also illuminates inside
of your case so if you want to light all
the things you can do that so as we're
going to do we are gonna take this H 500
overwatch edition case which they sent
along with this I didn't know this was
coming so this is a bit of a surprise I
have not played a whole lot of games of
overwatch because I'll be honest I was
really bad at it so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna take all this we're gonna
install it in this and I'm gonna control
it through via USB from another computer
so that we can show you what it looks
like when everything is in there
so the nice thing about the fans is the
fact that they do have obviously a PWM
controlled fan hub so you can plug this
into your motherboard and control it
with your CPU load but as you can see
they also have an in and an out for the
RGB actual power and digital addressable
rgv themself so you don't have to have
if you have three fans on a radiator you
don't need three different harnesses
going to the hub you just need one going
into the lead fan and then you can daisy
chain them using these cables right here
so I just thought that was kind of neat
to show is that I can when I put the 120
on the on the back and the 140 on the
top I will just have one cable
connecting these two they'll both need
their own PWM plugged into power
obviously to spin but we can still
control the lighting with just one cable
going to the fan and another one going
to the other hand
okay so obviously everything's hooked up
as you can see we put it on everyone's
favorite mode being RGB spectrum so I'm
using my laptop to actually control this
because as you could see we didn't
actually build a computer in this case
but that just goes to show it doesn't
really matter because it connects to
your motherboard via USB plug that goes
directly onto the motherboard header or
in this case I took USB to micro USB
plug or connector plugged it into that
and so I'm connecting it to cam which is
on my razor laptop right now so we've
got everything hooked up and I've got to
tell you when I first saw the cable
combs but I was kind of like come on
guys really cable combs but Phil and I
have been looking at this and we kind of
agree that cable combs are our favorite
part they they actually do a really good
job at diffusing the light okay and let
me go ahead and change this cuz it's
starting to annoy me
boom okay you see how bright the lights
actually are anyway so the cable combs
are extremely bright but they also are
very well diffused it's a nice even
light across it you can kind of see on
the back right here they've got a PCB on
them as well
lots of wiring to have to deal with so
it's gonna add some clutter so you're
just gonna have to be really good with
your wire management but if you take the
time to took home your cables through
those particular comb grooves you can
see that you would now get some pretty
good effects on your lighting so let me
do this real quick I'm gonna go ahead
and shut off all the lights and I'm
gonna show you what just the hue combs
look like why is why are the combs
ah okay
what are GP flights back alright so I'm
gonna go ahead and turn off all the
lights right here including the under
glow the fans and all that stuff so that
we can just see what the cable comes
look like so you see how much light
that's actually being put out by just
the cable combs in this case that's
pretty it's pretty intense literally so
as you can see right here if we just
gotta go into the cam software you can
select the LEDs individually because
they are addressable same thing with the
ring light are the LED ring that's built
into the fans you can individually
select them and make them different
colors if you want to do something
custom with them or you can use the
presets what i'm doing here is i'm just
using the preset so now i've got the
cable come selected I'm gonna go
spectrum wave and apply that as you can
see we've now got spectrum wave going on
the combs you can also individually turn
off LEDs on the combs if you want but
there's a lot of different modes here
I'm not gonna go into a big tutorial
about how cam works I've done this in
the past but I just wanted to show you
how well the combs actually look because
they were initially the thing that we
were most like really really RGB cable
combs I don't know that this they're not
the only brand doing this but I've got
to say because it hooks up to cam I
think they're the one doing it the best
because of the fact that you can go in
there and individually control them
where the other ones that we've seen
from other brands are not D RGB which
means that they're just all going to be
either one color or or all the LEDs will
go through the spectrum together as a
big group whereas each individual one of
these combs are addressable as well
that's the under glow so as you can see
we've got the under glow going right
there which works pretty well as you can
see we just used adhesive to mount them
comes with the adhesive and then it's
got its own cable to connect the other
side so you get two strips with it and
then we just put it up through this
pass-through hole right there
but if your case doesn't have a
pass-through then it also comes with
this IO shield on the back which just
has a plug that then the strips will
plug into that and then this will plug
into your cue controller and then you
can control your under glow but we just
decided to run it through the bottom of
the case and as you can see the same
thing
boom so we can play with all those
different modes we've got of course the
spectrum way but your one loves cuz it
shows all the colors so you can make it
slower or you can just turn every single
thing to a different mode so I mean yeah
there's lots of LEDs that can do things
but you know what my favorite mode in
all of this is are you ready that one if
that's one of the cool things about RGB
is you can make it any color you want
sure we all get a little bit irritated
with some of the marketing behind RGB
but that's why I decided to go ahead and
do this video because I was like this is
a hard sell to talk about lighting in a
system but I've gotten a lot of messages
asking me what lights I use in my bills
people have always noticed that I have
like skunk works as well as a UV
lighting in there as well as RGB every
system I've ever built
bill pretty much has RGB lighting in it
I just usually set it to some sort of a
fixed mode and if I just want to have
fun you know we can we can do the whole
spectrum wave and stuff and that's the
point of it is taking control and the
nice about NZXT is the fact that they do
it all who have control box and a single
piece of software where if you have it
hooked up to your motherboard if you've
ever used any of the built-in
motherboard RGB software half the time
it resets on you or you get very little
control or you have to deal with
third-party support where D RGB or
digital RGB doesn't communicate the same
on this device versus this device and
you get a lot of convoluted non
communication that happens or forget
your settings entirely the nice thing is
with this ecosystem at least you can
control all of it and the nice thing
with the ambient kit is they actually
have two different sizes they're
designed for either sixteen by nine
monitors or twenty-one by nine monitors
let's see this one's 26 to 32 inches for
16 by 9 or 21 to 25 or 34 to 35 and they
come with all the adhesives all the
power plugs you need the long extension
cord so that you can plug USB into your
system to control it and like I said
it's something I've been using if you've
seen my old Instagram post I mention
this the beginning skunk works and my
desk and all that before I move my home
office was set up with the hue system
everywhere including the ambient
lighting and it was kind of neat too to
have it set up to my game because there
are some game profiles that can be
controlled by NZXT hue we're like bomb
defusing with csgo would cause all your
lights to start flashing red so you knew
that there was a bomb that was planted
pretty neat so yeah if you guys want to
learn more about this there's a link
down the description below you can go
and check out the NZXT heute - ecosystem
and the best part is that it's removable
they can go in to any of your systems so
we obviously use the H 500 I to do this
but it comes with four of these strips
for the actual light strips themselves
and you can have four controlled per
header on the hue - control box and
there's four headers so you could
technically have what sit for eight
twelve sixteen yeah math so you have
sixteen strips on a single box if you
want it and you can have more than one
box in your system as long as you have
enough USB headers or you can do like we
did one daisy chain of three strips one
underglow our lights
and then our cable combs are all hooked
up to a single box so there you go guys
lighting it's one of those things that
people get super salty about because of
the marketing behind it but there's no
better way to take control of the look
and feel of your system than by having a
custom set of lights installed so tell
me what you guys think down below and
what system do you guys like to use when
it comes to making your system and
illuminate and yeah thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
