EBG a 20 hour livestream we got to talk
quiet because our live streaming over
there right now but so Steve is over
there say I see one of the things we're
doing is the main event for this live
stream is a little competition of
overclocking kington cards we determined
that the Vaseline is for the loser and
not about insulating the board take
overclocking reliability to the next
level with the new z3 90 dark
motherboard from EVGA the z3 90 dark is
built for extreme overclocking utilizing
features such as a 10 layer PCB 17 phase
power delivery triple BIOS and 150
percent more gold content mean to get
more at what you need to build the
ultimate Intel based PC to learn more
about the z3 90 dark in its world-class
features visit EVGA calm so there's a
retro card here it's a GTX 295 back when
the AI bees were allowed to be creative
and NVIDIA didn't really lock them down
but if you look back here is it's a dual
PCB card so just a dual GPU with dual
PCBs so the fan picks up on both sides
and blows it out here and is heavy I
mean look at that he's like she was too
it's not labeled it's really got two or
three like it has to be those memory
chips though now we've got a new monitor
coming and the monitor keeps going out I
think a problem is ID ten T or pet care
I think the problem we're going to get
set up right now Kingdom or business
already set up my card here they're
pieces of those back please Peter this
helps control the conversation on the
back side of the card so that we're not
going to condensation down into the
socket the pots Rd installed is already
an amount one of the things that we've
learned we talked about this one this
was in our studio was that the last
thing you want is condensation and then
the mount the mount is key because your
you've got these kind of like both to
sort of pass through here and it's easy
to get a kind of amount of cricket and
so the fact that sometimes you may
notice you're crashing at certain
temperatures or certain frequencies
could be indicative of a bad mount well
you think so sense Vince mounted this
one it's probably gonna be pretty good
but when we mount our own well we had to
remount when he came into my studio and
it made a huge difference but as soon as
I mount mayon it's probably gonna fail
like immediately there's one that's
super good and one that's like good
maturity and the other two are kind of
the same okay so if there's a chance why
don't you guys give the really you know
the best one and one guy gets those and
we're not talking about a huge
difference if he he said to are roughly
the same ones really good it's kind of
like well then your brain goes well the
one this Merc does they're really good
because those are the same but I feel
like that's a trick it's got a bitch I
feel like I'm not overthinking this and
there's no system here at All Hazards in
snow that we would notice this and
thought that we would think it's a trick
and that the one that paste alone is the
good one right wait a minute two dots on
that there's two dimples on here yeah
you know
so there's some master key somewhere
this is a deeper dud this is really for
awesome laughs for fail I don't want
this shot gonna be what it grades so as
the poet says $14.99 mm is that a
falsely there is it wait what I think we
were thinking this I've got four big
coins right here okay
I'm gonna mark one so this is kind of
three-card Monte going on right here
no I get to pick a coin thing good point
doesn't work okay oh hey no marking okay
so that's 5050
all right you win okay so you get the
shoes or you get to choose the card okay
is this is on-the-fly decision making
right here all right good luck gentlemen
no we need to turn around and we need
someone somewhere but they're shuffling
this one that's cheating
I shall just go this guy I got the egg
the mountings a key point right so I
kind of got to let you guys do it right
you have a spreader I can use jaysus the
most intense thermal paste application
you've done like nobody's watching or
anything that's the problem
you can turn feeling into sound too like
you can turn it hear what you feel true
you're gonna get like a hair in your
mouth which is gonna be Justin that's
happened
oh snap people that hair back it got
real where does the CD Drive doh do you
feel like you're out of touch chica
yeah you're losing touch with your roots
no in a while
just to remember I'm gonna drink from
one of these on the net yeah one of my
fans isn't plugged in how much you guys
gonna sabotage I had nothing to do that
you can start I guess
oh wait the contest comes before right
there's a lot at stake so let me let me
answer some of the safety questions I
guess sir first of all you tapas well I
can't do you pretty safe like if you're
worried about blocking stuff it doesn't
hurt just don't let us know right I
thought what it's so fun it's sir I
burned myself yesterday pretty bad so
Akina yeah yeah just contacts
Leidenfrost effect look it up and don't
let it soak in like your socks or
anything like that would be bad a drop
it rolled off the table under his pant
leg my socks I kind of I kind of feel
like I completely borked my mouth I'm
out what how cold it when it ran away
and way down like - one six dose isn't
good for a little bit and then it was
like saying just the numbers were just
rolling down
hey at least you got a run that was
other competitive yeah first time and I
thought downhill from there well the
fact that I feel this taste twice now
though I feel I just feel accomplished
by doing that yeah yeah we'll have to
take the cart apart you got it run it
again because they're saving time I'm
gonna tear down no I mean it's like
number two on the list no I don't know
yeah you're number three right now it's
kind of like a physical representation
between the two of us do I'm fatter I
take longer to get moving I have a lot
of inertia but once it gets going good
luck stopping me some about eight
hundred points behind it right now
but I think I found minus 25 minus 30 is
where this part work you're running for
me but I've already broken the firmaface
three bond twice it retired him twice
while and we're still running so you
might have the record they're doing on
the core keep it together yeah no
pressure or anything no pressure or
anything
I notice that yesterday these close I
was like smells great why he's seriously
a serious about hair care gamers Nexus
conditioner women yeah yeah probably
would sell every solvent we saw the
conditioner don't
seven stop running all right 380 bored
130 I missed all right so we've been
going at now for a few hours we both
kind of got our cards dialed in not well
95% of put we could probably be in the
Venus Lux and Steve is about 50 points
ahead of me but he hit that like right
away and he's been struggling with some
artifacts and some crashes and other
stuff where I had to chicken clock my
way up to his score and now it took me
so long to get there
ice is built up on the pot to where now
we're not getting good thermal contact
between the pot and the dime my mount
was good I don't think I'm gonna reap
aced but it's a hard decision because
now that we're warming up who knows
what's gonna happen so it's like like
it's not 50/50 do I repay stored right
go with it but now we know kind of where
we can shoot for it and then spend more
time dialing in before we freeze over
the pot again at the start a little when
you're at the max max clock for the
garden you serious
and I was swinging like 15 I don't talk
as I'm sorry no because I want to eat it
on streem alright so Steve is opted to
switch cards which was always an option
but I have this theory Vince said that
two of these cards performed similarly
one's a dud and one's a winner well
Steve and I were getting very similar
scores very similar clock speeds very
similar memory speeds so throughs a
simple deduction here we have to kind of
decide if we've got the match cards
randomly and we think one's the winner
and ones it does
Steve took the gamble now grabbing a
card which could be the dud or it could
be the winner or one of us could have
the winner and we just suck it over
cocky all right so I got a little tired
of screening out this card this mount
has been heated up so many times it's my
original mount like at least ten times
and this was like yeah that mounts done
so right now he's we warmed up the card
and I have a choice Remo because it's
got to come off anyway or do I just
throw it on another card well I'm
inclined to just thrown on another card
now to make it exciting because if I go
through all this work and I'm still
can't get the the 40 points I needs and
whatever so yeah we're gonna we're gonna
change cards which means I could have
the dud
this one has an F on it and the one I
have has an A on it or that could be
fast and B paper and say Apple running
away
you guys don't forget to put Alan Julian
Oh is she gonna warm up will you know
anyway 12 to 32 yeah he got a really
good memory clocked in plus fourteen
twenty and I was like 1350 on that last
round so if I can get it seized um I
might pull the voltages down because I
might be able revolting it so I just
sort of went for the brute force method
of max voltage and let's see what
happens so they're still tuning in this
you know what you know what the game
changer is that I have to try and beat
Steve's record with only ten liters of
ln2 yeah I think that's the thing a lot
of people don't realize is that when we
were doing rip DN and all that we're
playing with Ln two and stuff I only had
ten liters which I went through in like
an hour
yeah and I think that's what's really
weird to a lot of like people that
aren't in the US it's like oh yeah we
were down the storm got Ellen to like
you can just go to the store and get led
yes
I saw a flame into it everything we're
doing is completely okay that's my bad
my bad
because I was like oh there's no flame
like I felt a little like heat on my
face like right here like I thought I
let my hair in fire nothing to see here
man stop it I'm making I'm making mental
mistakes man cuz I'm withering away to
nothing over here look at me I know I'm
skin and bones Jay I think if we keep
going though at some point I'm literally
going to die so you will you will you
could just survive longer than so long I
could start really yes dude if it comes
down to that Steve Steve density
all right sweat for nearly eight hours
of overclocking I'm calling it here I
got within like we both got really good
scores nearly you know the top well
we're both top five but Steve won by I
don't know 80 ish points or so some of
that great scores that came out of both
our cards right the last minute and then
I switched cards which worked really
well at first and I got a really good
score but if you look at this mouth
that's a terrible amount look at how
thick the build-up is that's where the
the cold plate was not making contact
with the dyes we were dealing with hot
spots on the core which means I could I
could heat it up and cool it down heat
up cool it down all I wanted this was
never gonna fix a bad mouth so anyway
what was learned here today and what's
gonna happen now is Vince just took over
my machine with Steve's card he has not
divulged which card was the better card
of the four yet so if there even was but
what he's gonna do right now he's gonna
show us probably in a matter of minutes
how quickly he could beat our scores so
we'll just let him do this thing well
show what the final score was and then
we'll get out here this was a long day
learned a lot and I can get my hands on
one of these we'll just keep it going at
home but I need a big bottle of Ellen -
hey Jacob hey you won
or the passport 255 or 1200 for three
man three for three count of nowhere all
right so the best I could do was a
twelve thousand three hundred and twelve
thousand two hundred and fifty three
Steve did a twelve thousand three
hundred forty through forty five and
then Vince came in and in the first run
two to twelve thousand 303 and then he
came in and did a twelve thousand three
hundred to five and he goes let's go
dinner so and two runs we were here
eight hours but that tells you at least
the way these cards are built and with
the with the design of the heater and
all that you can bench these cards for
hours at a time which has just not been
the case with our TX cards until the
heater designed all that now let's see
what the kingpin there's no mods these
cards whatever whatsoever what you saw
us do was out of the box plopped onto a
motherboard with the heater and a pot
attached and off we went
so anyway this was a lot of fun I hope
you guys watch the live stream if you
haven't EVT a was doing a 20 hour
livestream to celebrate their 20th
anniversary and then Steve was
live-streaming on his YouTube channel an
entire time I'm sure there'll be a pod
so and how probably do a highlight reel
as well he normally does it so you might
check all that out if you guys want
hopefully this vlog was kind of fun I
mentally just whipped right now like I
can score what well I see I forgot to
turn the heater on twice got to plug the
graphics card in the first run yeah I
bet I drenched the board in water and it
didn't die so there's that that's why
he's right twice anyway alright guys
thanks for watching we'll see you the
next one and I'm tired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
