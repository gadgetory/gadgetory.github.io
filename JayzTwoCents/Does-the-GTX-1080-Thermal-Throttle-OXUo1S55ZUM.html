with another video and today we are
going to talk specifically about the
topic of thermal throttling and the GTX
1080
now I can hear you already what do you
mean thermal throttling in video showed
a demo where it was only running 67c so
today we're going to talk about thermal
throttling and why pretty much every
single reviewer on YouTube of the 1080
was a little bit shocked about the high
temperatures that the founders edition
card was demonstrating I'm going to show
you what's happening and pretty much how
I got around it with doing my benchmarks
because a lot of people were like what
the hell J your temps are not as as high
as others were saying so what that said
let's get started the mastercase 5 and
mastercase 5 pro from Coolermaster
combines modularity with creativity
giving you the freedom to build it your
way make it yours by clicking the link
down in the description now what is
thermal throttling now if you're really
new you probably have no idea what that
is if you're an advanced user you're
like yeah I know it is just get on with
it so for that there's a little slider
bar just click forward if you're you
know advanced user now thermal
throttling exists on CPUs and GPUs
together where the software or you know
the actual controller or BIOS whatever
you want to call it will try to save
itself from dying a high temperature
death by dialing back both voltages and
frequencies to keep the temperatures
below a certain target now the GTX 1080
ships with a temperature target of 83
degrees Celsius and what that means is
go ahead and ramp up the speed
automatically to whatever you want but
as soon as it hits 83 Oh butter start
backing things off to get it in check
now when it comes to the Nvidia
demonstration obviously they weren't
doing live gaming when they hit that 67
C while overclocked and for all we know
they could have had the fans running at
100% on the card again we didn't see the
test rig we only saw the precision
overlay showing 67 C and 20 114
megahertz again we have no idea what the
load was like we couldn't see CPU load
and that was just a 3d rendering of a 3d
image it wasn't actually playing any
games so that's something to keep in
mind so that's why when myself and a lot
of other reviewers we all started kind
of talking behind the scenes with each
other as we
doing our testing like hey are you
noticing your card getting really hot
and it was like wow I thought it was
just mine and it turns out everybody was
complaining about high temperatures
because we expected it to be a lot lower
now 16 nanometer FinFET is a very very
small chip and what that means is you're
gonna have a lot of focused heat so the
idea of 67c under load was really kind
of mind-boggling because with it being
so small and focused we expected the
temperatures to actually be kind of hot
turns out they kind of are now the folks
over at gamers Nexus actually did a
Frankenstein build where they noticed
they had high heat so what they do is
they ripped a hybrid cooler off of an
EVGA card stuck it on their 1080 to see
what would happen and if that would fix
thermal throttling what I'm gonna do
today is I'm going to turn around here
I'm gonna do some live gaming with an
overlay I'm going to show you the
throttling in progress and then I'm
going to show you pretty much what's
happening as its thermal throttling how
far it's coming down and then how I got
around it without having to rip off the
cooler and do anything custom but don't
worry we already rip it off the cooler
because of course I've got my GTX 1080
full cover water block from ek first one
off the assembly line baby oh yeah
if you saw that picture that ek sent out
with the block on it with the green
fluid that was my card and that was this
block Wow
yeah mind blown right alright so we're
gonna be doing this test here with some
Crysis 3 because it's pretty demanding
and I've got the settings set up pretty
much to where I would assume people with
a 1080 would put it which is very high
preset with a 4x
msaa and I'm running at 1440p so here's
what we got we've got OSD hair up from
afterburner and we've got on the
starting from the left here that top
left is the power limit that's the
percentage of power limit what that
means is if it exceeds the number that
is preset whether it be 100 obviously a
hundred percent power envelope if it
starts to go higher than 100 percent
power draw that's set from in the BIOS
then it's going to start limiting plots
and things to try and keep it under that
hundred percent obviously this is our
GPU temperature here we're running out
forty-four see in the menu this next one
here is our GPU utilization or usage so
we're only sitting at thirty percent
utilization in the menu this is the fan
speed core clock and then at
pS so what we're going to do here is
we're going to play the game with the
GPU sitting here you know not too hot it
has a heat soaked or anything but I do
have the room the room fairly closed up
the doors closed the AC vent is off and
the window is closed so the temperature
in this room is starting to get a little
bit of under boob sweat if you know what
I'm saying but what we want to pay
attention to here is obviously the
temperature number and the core clock
number I have the other stuff up here so
you can see how it relates are we
thermal throttling due to temperature or
we thermal throttle are we throttling
due to power target also once you keep
an eye of what the fan percentage is
here and then GP utilizations pretty
much always going to be a 100% but we've
got all those numbers up there so that
you can see how they're correlating with
each other to get a big picture of
what's actually happening with the GPU
now as you can see we started off here
eighteen hundred and seventy-three
megahertz it just boosted up right away
just boom you can see our power usage
here did hit 101 for a second and as you
can see when that happens this starts to
come down our temperature is nowhere
near our target yet but our power usage
is and so that starts to come down so
you're going to notice a few things
happening here at all it's a balancing
act on the way third throttling actually
works with a graphics card it's not
always temperature related but more
often than not it could be now I have a
couple of profiles set up here to which
a hundred percent out of the box which
is what you're seeing right now and then
I have another profile set up no
overclocking or anything it's just power
target or power limit and our
temperature threshold and what that will
do is I will increase the temperature
from the factory setting of 83 which is
where it will start the thermal throttle
and then we're going to raise that up to
92 and then I have got the power limit
set to 120 percent so we can exceed the
power envelope designed by Nvidia by 20
percent before it starts to pull back
power due to power draw as you can see
while I'm just sitting here talking our
temperature has raised up to 78 C and
our core clock has dropped already from
1870 range down to 1810 but that's still
higher than the advertised
17:33 boost clock but you can see we're
now we're dipping down in the 1700s
as you can see just that little bit of a
battle we're down to 1721 our power
limit is only at 85 82 it's not even at
100 but you can see our thermals is
sitting at 82 so we are now thermal
throttling
we've come all the way down to 1645 for
a second there so we're almost down to
the base clock now
all right now you can see we're all the
way down to 16 2016 4 T 5 and 16 20 so
we've pretty much lost our boost clock
now and we're pretty soon we're going to
hit 1607 so what I'm going to do now is
I'm simply going to change my profile
here and as you can see by changing my
profile by letting the power target go
up and the temperature target go up we
immediately went all the way back to SEP
1797 and as you can see we're not even
throttling anymore
well okay well it's round a little bit
but you can see the fan speeds come up a
little bit temperatures come up to 86
we're past that and power limit has gone
above a hundred percent now but look at
what the clock is doing the clock is
staying much more stable
and I just died again but look at that
temperature still are the core clock is
still sitting at 1785 but the
temperatures have gone up obviously a
couple of degrees but you can see if you
give it just a little bit of extra
temperature Headroom it will actually go
up pretty high on the core clock say all
the way back up to 1797 again and what I
want to point out here is the GPU is
sitting at 66 percent fan speed but it's
actually really quiet it's so much
quieter than the other cards typically
are so now one other thing I want to do
real quick just to just to see obviously
here is I'm going to open up afterburner
and I'm going to put the fan manually to
what I did in my test which was 80% so
the fan speed kicked up a little bit
more the noise came up a little bit
obviously you can see the fan speeds now
80% but keep an eye on the temperatures
right there
do you see how now we're sitting
straight at 1797 and it's not even
moving
you
now if we take a look right here at our
core clock as you can see it is just
bouncing all over the place
it started off nice and high 1873 where
we started the video and then it came
all the way back down into very low 1620
which is barely above boot base clock of
1607 and then it still just bouncing all
around but the second eye increased
right here this to 120 and the
temperature limit to 92 it didn't reach
92 as you can see the highest
temperature was 87 yeah still very very
hot but I want to point out that right
here you can see that we just stuck to
1797 boom and no longer throttled
anymore so it definitely is thermal
based on the way the core clocks are
kind of bouncing all around okay so then
why is this such a big deal well quite
honestly I think Nvidia made the mistake
of showing that 3d rendering demo and
then pointing at the screen and saying
but it only runs 67c because that was
very misleading in my opinion where it's
a gamers card it's not a card that's
being boasted as being a Productivity
card it's a gaming card and you put a
gaming load on it especially what the
founders edition cooler even though it's
a vapor chamber with the fan profile
that they have set up it will thermal
throttle and it will thermal throttle
back down to practically it's base clock
but as you can see by changing the
temperature target and changing the
power limit we were able to bypass that
and then get all the way up to 1800 and
what well 1797 megahertz on my card and
it only went up to about 87 see now I
say only because I allowed it to go to
92 but it didn't get there so what that
means is the thermal throttling is
happening right at the upper echelon of
where the limits are for that cooler now
the other thing you could obviously do
which is why I showed going to 80% on
fan speed although noisy brought the
temperature back down to the 70s which
is very very manageable so if you went
in there and set up a custom fan profile
so that ramped up and slowed down you
would get the same result as long as you
increase the power target and the
temperature limit and you're not going
to allow thermal throttling to have any
sort of real
factor in the way the card is performing
unless something's wrong with the cooler
then it's going to try and keep itself
from dying now I think that the people
are making a big deal of this again
because of that demo because the reality
here is all of the reference cards in
the history of the reference cards have
done this this is nothing new in fact
people wouldn't even be making a point
that it's thermal throttling if in-video
didn't make the point that it's only 67
C so I do think there was a mistake made
on that that stage where there was a bit
of an expectation planted in all of our
minds followed by a big disappointment
when it came to the reality of it's
still a reference cooler that cannot
keep these temperatures in check with
the way they're shipped out of the box
you've got to go in there and tweak some
settings now the good news is the
partner cards are launching literally in
a couple of days and you're going to
start seeing custom designs like
obviously from EVGA and gigabyte and msi
and ZOTAC they've all got their multi
fan heat pipe behemoth coolers that are
going to keep things in check and be a
hell of a lot quieter now remember this
was an open air test bench which means
the only cooling factor on the card is
the card itself case flow wasn't a
factor so if you have a small
form-factor case or even a regular
enclosure of some sort you might even
see thermal throttling happening sooner
and you might see it come down even
farther depending on what your case flow
is like so I actually showed you
best-case scenario here huh no pun
intended as you showed you best case
scenario so your results might actually
be worse than mine anyway guys hope this
videos helped shed some light on the
thermal throttling that's happening here
from Nvidia I'm not by any means saying
it's not a big deal because it's
happened on the older cards I'm saying I
think I think it's a big deal because
the temperatures were boasted as being
very low and unfortunately that was not
the real-world scenario but you could
play around the fan profiles at the sake
of or the sacrifice of noise or just
skip the founders edition all together
and go with a custom card cooler from
the likes of you know all of the board
partners out there with multiple fans or
water cool it like I'm gonna do and then
just go balls to the wall on the clock
anyway guys see you in the next video I
hope this video has helped anyway time
to get out of here bunch of people can't
be saying
talk about the thermal throttling I've
done that I hope you're happy now so you
can just zip it shoot it cuz I'm gonna
go now
holiday weekend coming up I'm gonna grab
some fun see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
