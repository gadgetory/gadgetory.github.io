insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and why
Sennheiser the pursuit of perfect sound
and of course by generous viewers like
you so strapped in with J's two cents as
he takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys Jays two cents here
hanging out at the AMD suite or AMD tent
here at CES 2014 you guys have been
asking me a lot about khavari and what
it's all about well I am sitting here
right in front of the AMD a10 7850 k
which is an r 7 GPU or APU based kaveri
apu now they're running civilization 5
right here on this system and I made
sure that there are no shenanigans
pulled there is no graphics card in this
system it's running one hundred percent
off of an APU but at a 3600 x 1920
resolution now you guys know
civilization 5 can be a little bit
intensive on the graphics but when
moving around here is zooming in zooming
out moving through the different worlds
and stuff this is extremely smooth and
this is pretty much an extreme situation
I mean a lot of people would never dare
put three monitors on an APU but that's
exactly what you have right here and
it's very very smooth kavari guys you
guys also asked me about AMD and PCI
three-point oh and you guys want to know
when is AMD going to support pci pci a
three point oh well kavari does it's a
fm2 socket which is the newer of the FM
sockets and it does support pci express
3.0 it's going to happen with am3+
socket or whether or not it's going to
be phased out or evolved upon so you
guys could just have to wait for future
announcement from andy and what they
plan on doing with that but definitely
consider khavari for your future builds
the APU is plenty strong the CPU is
plenty strong and if you guys just are
interested in building a low profile or
maybe a steam box or or whatnot you can
see here it is very it is very very
smooth in fact i'm lost now i don't even
know where the world went so but anyway
guys make sure you check out the khavari
if you're looking at building an AMD
system as always make sure you're
following on twitter so you don't miss
any of our
CES 2014 coverage and as always I will
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
