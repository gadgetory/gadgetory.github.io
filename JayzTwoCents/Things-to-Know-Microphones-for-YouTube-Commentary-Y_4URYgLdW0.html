we're going to go ahead and talk about
different types of microphones several
people have been asking me about my mic
setup that you see behind me here but I
want to talk to you about the
differences in microphones and what it
is you need to know especially if you're
going to be a commentator but wanting to
get the most out of your setup
right now I'm just simply using the
onboard camera microphone and obviously
sounds very very horrible so let's go
ahead and turn around let's get into the
webcam here and let's start comparing
some different mics and see what it is
you need to know when doing audio
voiceovers if you're a YouTube
commentator or you do any sort of
recording on YouTube chances are you're
using something like this and I'm
wearing right here these are my
turtlebeach x12
they are a gaming headset that I can be
used on xbox or pc and this is what I
think the most common YouTube
commentator is using I'm gonna go ahead
and do the comparison that I talked
about right now with a couple of
different microphones and oh my god I
just hit my knee
ah-ha-ho I'm a big baby and so what I'm
doing right now is I'm going ahead and
doing a little bit of an audio test here
of these x12 they were $59 that Fry's
got a headset built-in you can hear
yourself as you talk so you find
yourself not yelling into the microphone
if you're using some sort of a noise
cancelling headphone like this right
here which are my logitech g930 s I
think they're a great bargain if you're
doing YouTube commentaries you don't
need a giant setup like I've got going
over here with my you know a studio
quality mic I can't get these damn
lights off my face they're shining in
like right through my blinds right there
holy crap they're really missing yeah
I'll move over here so what I want to do
now with a couple of different mics is I
want to go ahead and just give a brief
description of what they are and
obviously these are my turtlebeach x12
so I'm gonna say the same sentence and
sing a little bit of a song for you guys
and so that you could hear the
differences between the mics and as well
as what they cost I've got the lovely
bunch of coconuts didn't Libby there
they are standing in a row big one small
ones thumb as big as your head the quick
red fox jumped over the lazy Brown dog
but by now some of you must be saying
but Jay I don't have a gaming headset or
I'm on an extremely limited budget I
have no money whatsoever but I really
want to make youtube videos and I want
to do commentary so what do I do get
yourself one of these guys right here
believe it or not this thing is hat is
less than $10 and sometimes you can find
it online for less than five and this is
nothing more than just a simple desktop
microphone and try to be choosy there it
the pickup on and the sound on is actual
really not that bad the only thing you
have to be careful of and the things you
have to think about are the fact that
one there's no screen on this right here
do you get too close and you start
talking into it as you can see this is
not very pleasant to listen to it's very
noisy the PISA bees and MMS no not
really but anything that is out air it's
gonna sound like crap so you're gonna
want to make sure you're talking over it
because if you talk directly into it
then it's not gonna be very well but
what you can do is you can't get
yourself some sort of a foam windscreen
to put over it or you can make yourself
just like a little blow you're a little
pop filter to put right over the top of
it similar to this right here but just
goes right over the tip of this and it
would stop all of those popping sound
the first couple of videos I made on
YouTube this is the mic that I use and I
hooked it directly to you know that
camera right there because the
microphone on that camera sucks as you
could tell by the intro to the video
built-in microphone cameras are just
there they're as like a bonus they're
not really meant to be used for
recording audio might be I've got a
lovely bunch of coconuts and dignity
there they are standing in the row big
one small one some as big as your head
to be quick red fox jumped over the lazy
brown dog now one thing I'd like to just
go ahead and point out is that these are
a hundred and fifty dollar headset you
might be able to get monsell for a
little bit less now but this is the
logitech g930 wireless gaming headphones
7.1 surround sound
they've got controls and buttons on the
side I can control Skype I can control
windows I can make programs pop up all
of these buttons are completely
adjustable
it's got noise cancelling like if
somebody walked in I wouldn't be able to
hear him what I want to go ahead and
point out is just because this is an
expensive headset do your research
because as you can tell by the sound of
this microphone it sounds horrible but
Logitech's explanation of why they sound
so bad is because they're wireless they
have limited bandwidth because of the
surround sound so they went ahead and
cut back the bandwidth on the microphone
all the way down to 16 K and 16 K is
actually considered like a tape player
quality I don't recommend using to his
these headphones whatsoever for
commentary so do yourself a favor if
you're researching head from headsets
make
you do research on the quality of the
microphone built-in as well or you could
get stuck with something like this and
having spent a whole lot of money for it
I've got the lovely bunch of coconuts
identity and there they are a standing
in a row big one small one some as big
as your head the quick red fox jumped
over the lazy Brown dog but you can have
some fun with the modulation sounder
this microphone like for instance Lois
Lois you Richard viola vivillon you I
think that you should probably not
consider using this headphone unless you
want to sound like a horror movie from
1942 oh and speaking of horrible my
qualities the built-in webcam microphone
obviously should just be ignored and not
even considered to be there it is
complete garbage and last but not least
we have my studio quality blue Yeti
right here hooked up to a pile PL 2 T
microphone boom but what you have to
realize is that this microphone setup is
not cheap the microphones 150 dollars if
you buy at full retail the pop filters
20 and the mic room was 120 so you're
talking right now with tax and stuff
over three hundred dollars simply for a
microphone but this isn't necessary I
mean I think honestly the thing that
sounds next to best to this was this
this cheap cheap microphone isn't it
amazing what this sounded like compared
to this and the fact that you can get
amazing sound out of something so cheap
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts
added Liddy there they are a standing in
a row big ones small ones some as big as
your head the quick red fox jumped over
the lazy brown dog I have a lot of fun
with this microphone though I really
like to get into it and I do an awful
lot of silly voices I haven't really put
them out on YouTube because I'm still a
little bit shy I don't really want to
you know I don't want to get the flames
coming in more than I can handle any one
time but maybe mmm maybe my Yoda voice I
show you whether the phone is a
chuckling door with a microphone like
this is it to play Laurel and do some
crazy modulation braces severe you just
realize it you know
you're actually doing that and it's not
the microphone haha seriously folks I
have an awful lot of fun with this
microphone right here and I do a lot
more with it than just getting on here
and doing voiceovers for YouTube
seriously guys in all honesty I hope you
guys have found this video very helpful
you i've been asked so many times in
almost every single review i've done
i've been told do microphones do
microphones do microphones well here you
go here's your microphone review i hope
you liked it now stop bugging me to do
microphone reviews I've already done it
now I'm not gonna do it again unless I
get another microphone then maybe I'll
do it again but seriously bro stop
bugging me to do the microphone again
