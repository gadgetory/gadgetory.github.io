welcome to my ask J series which I do
once like every six months it's kind of
fun kind of gives me an idea of the
things that you're interested in and it
kind of gives me a chance to break away
from the norm PC videos where I can talk
about anything that you guys are asking
about these questions that you're seeing
today are directly from Twitter so make
sure you guys are following over there
if you guys want to kind of get in on
the next one anyway moving on now we've
got a question here from methyl methanol
man what I'm gonna probably mutilate
your guy's screen names I'm really bad
at names I don't know why forget my own
sometimes he said did you ever use pay
to promote your videos
that's something I'm actually very proud
of everything you see on this channel
I've built
I didn't pay to promote I didn't pay for
followers and in pay for views or even
use Google's built-in pay to promote
feature I've never done that I never
felt like it was a smart move to dump
money into either botted or just
non-organic views I want the people who
see my stuff to have kind of stumbled
their way here on their own and if they
liked it stick around that's just the
way I operate this is a good one here
considering the size of the channel now
Tim on Twitter asks do you ever have any
viewers come up to you or your family
when you're out and about if so does it
ever become an annoyance to be honest
I'm recognized all the time now in the
beginning never obviously when the
channel is small then when the channel
started to reach a few hundred thousand
subs every now and then maybe once every
couple of months I may might get
recognized
now I'm recognized almost every time I
go out somewhere especially if I go
anywhere near where there's tech or PC
stuff even out of the track this last
Sunday I was at a chuckwalla Valley
Raceway and I was recognized twice while
I was there which was pretty interesting
especially since I got to run in the
same run group as some of those guys and
not only were they like wow Stacy says
wow it's busy wow I get to race nizzy it
was a really fun experience Garrett got
asked how scary was it to quit your
full-time job and become reliant on
YouTube for majority of income it's been
almost a year since I did my it's been a
year since I quit my job things were
almost two years into full-time
self-employment and I have to say that I
wouldn't change anything it was a risk
it's absolutely a risk to put all of my
eggs into a platform that's not mine
since YouTube is not mine YouTube can
change anything Google could change
anything
anything can happen any controversy any
crazy change in dynamic could affect all
of this but you know what I wouldn't
change it it's scary obviously to be
your own boss because any decision you
make could affect your future but I'm
still of the mindset that working for
someone else doesn't equal security and
it doesn't make you that much safer
because you're still at the mercy of
that business so why not at least try it
for myself it's working out pretty well
so far I've got no complaints but who
knows what the future holds at least I
feel like I'm somewhat in control of it
now this question from Cory Williams
kind of ties in to the last ones I think
it's a good segue he says is it hard to
balance the demand of the channel with
family life how do you unwind after it's
after a stressful project yes it is
absolutely difficult to balance my
professional and family time there's
that saying out there that
entrepreneurship is the job you spend 80
hours a week so that you avoid working
40 hours a week for somebody else I'm
just putting in all the time today
hoping that I can maybe have an early
retirement and have a comfortable life
later on but I do the best I can to make
sure our family are that balanced family
time I take my daughter to her diet
Taekwondo classes multiple times per
week I do everything I can to try to be
a good family man and ice and I fail and
I up a lot like I just messed up
right now if you're a family man
watching this with your kids I apologize
for that f-bomb the FCC doesn't really
regulate this yet and like I said
that'll blunt and forward things anyway
I digress I mess up all the time
and trust me where my family lets me
know that I mess up but I'm doing the
best I can which is why the hiring of
Nick was a huge thing because it's
allowing me to start the process of
delegating and that will free up some
time at least my naive mind thinks that
it will free up time but I'm working on
it
hi
mirco blitz asks as a us a foreigner I'd
like to know what is your opinion on
Trump and does his politics scare you oh
boy I don't have any tinfoil in here
because I feel like I should make a
tinfoil hat real quick I do the best I
can to separate politics from my channel
is the jays two cents is about all of my
opinions but there's no winning when it
comes to talking about politics there's
no right answer and unfortunately that
might sound like a politically correct
type of answer it's really not I just
don't feel like I just don't feel like
talking about it on my channel because I
find politics stressful now what scares
me most about Trump and his cabinet is
not his grandiose ideas or the way he
presents himself people would probably
say I'm very Trump like when it comes to
being a tech youtuber because I'm very
direct I'm very like if you don't like
me tough get the out there's a desk
Tom again I am and I'm kind of okay with
that I feel like shake ups are good but
problem I have with this cabinet as
we're moving forward is it's obvious
lack of experience and the fact that
it's trying to now run the White House
like a business and I don't think that's
going to work very well so we're just
going to have to wait and see anyway
that's my official stance on that like I
am definitely bipartisan and what sucks
about that it's either side of that
partisan fence hates you when you're
bipartisan because you're not all in I'm
never going to be all in so deal with it
Maroons fear asks I recognize that name
I think you've been following for a
while
I do remember calling that out Tech Talk
a few times and I remember mutilating
your name and apologizing apologizing
again he says how do you become immune
to negative comments on YouTube and real
life love you Jay the reality is there
is no youtuber who's famous on YouTube
who doesn't get affected by negative
comments even pudy pie gets affected by
negative comments and look at him is the
most popular person on YouTube with 53
million or maybe 54 million 55 million
50 so you see how fast he's growing so
it affects you what was difficult is
balancing how much you let it affect you
and your mood on your day obviously
affects how much you let that get to you
that particular day there's folks that
would tell me Jay just ignore it jaysus
ignore
I would say anyone who says to just
ignore it has come is completely
ignorant to what we go through and not
ignorant in the bad sense is ignorant
that you have nothing to compare what we
experienced to you've never experienced
it so it's easy for you to say just
ignore it but the problem is you try and
interact with people and if you're going
to read comments you're going to see it
and it's going to affect you in some way
there's folks that would probably say
you J you get a little too caught up in
the hate I find a little bit therapeutic
sometimes too if someone's going to give
me some sort of backhand to get it back
at them it's the way I've always been it
the way I'm always going to be and those
those people that say J you're losing
subscribers because of that I would say
I'm gaining subscriber to agree with my
way of dealing with that so there's
always going to be two sides to it
we need more direct people in this world
and I appreciate it when someone's
direct with me when they're like J
you're an asshole just shut up every now
and then I'm like you know I am kind of
an asshole but I'm an asshole that cares
I'm like a bleached asshole
uber on Twitter accent and not the you
know the driving service uber just
someone their name is uber what's your
least favorite part about your job
honestly I think it's the fact that a
huge passion of mine like computer
building and hardware and stuff has
become a job so I don't get as excited
about new hardware as I used to I still
get excited about like new launches and
things like that but the excitement of
going and and saving money and buying
that graphics card you've been drooling
over and watching videos on for six
months or a year or two years and you
finally have your hands on it and you're
just like well dick will use the Titan
here use very Titan we're just like yes
this is mine oh this is mine yes thank
you I don't feel that as much anymore
because it's my job and there are times
where I feel that way just as much as it
used to because when you're surrounded
by it you get a little jaded that's
that's the harsh truth in Holland
integer asked when's a studio tour
coming when I move I I don't get to move
till March there's a tenant in the
studio now he moves out on the 23rd of
February and I'll be moving in and then
I'm not going to be moving much from
here to there I'll be completely
furnishing it from scratch so it'd be
more of like a
kind of a set up vlog I guess if you
will there probably a series happening
there's no way I'm be able to turn all
the work I have to do there and still
get work done is literally make that my
job and make videos about that and you
guys seem to like moving vlogs anyway so
that's what we're going to do
Quinn Rudolph asks do you have any more
plans for nizzy upgrade wise Mannis
I'm torn I'm so torn on what I want to
do I want to turn it into a pure Z spec
race car I do I want to gut it I want to
cage it I want to do you know racing
seat range racing harness full arrow I
want to do all of that but I don't want
to do it to this car because this was my
dream car and I don't want to pack it up
into a race car that I can no longer
drive on the street or right now I'm not
in position where I can buy another car
so I'm really torn on that I've taken it
about as far as I can take it now for a
street car with the exception of like
specific race compound tires but yeah
that project is all on hold I'm just
driving the car now and having fun with
it and not putting any more real work or
time into it which is kind of sad
because that's my relief from all of the
stress but hey I'm working my ass off
now so that I can play a little more
later hopefully so this is a good one
Conrad GM says what are the things you
miss from time before becoming YouTube
famous I miss being able to come home
from a nine-to-five kick off my shoes
and go the rest of the day is mine
whatever I want to do with it
but this is a full-time sunup to sundown
gig but I think people highly
underestimate heard some folks say
what's so hard about your job is turn on
a computer or you turn on a camera and
you talk about it that's ignorant
you just don't understand what goes on
behind the scenes you understand the
running of the business now having
employees having taxes to deal with
having the legality of running a
business and compliance to deal with and
workers comp and and just all of that
you can't just turn on the video and
talk about a product of all the time you
take to research the product and
experiment but the products and build
the computers and tear it all down and
deal with inventory just making videos
is literally the least amount of what I
do when it comes to running the business
it's the smallest portion of it the
shack I think fish I could say you say
your name he says any special moment
that you will never forget in your
entire life it says sorry about the
grammar your grandmother she's pretty
good oh yeah there's that there's a few
of them actually the day I got married
there are there's the birth of both of
my daughters and then I have to assume
there's going to be more favorite
moments in my life I hope I create some
more but right now those are obviously
the three that stand out most for me I
don't I don't measure like special
moments in my life so far with the
business I mean where did that sound the
special moments in my life are always a
family-oriented and not hobby or
business oriented know what Mac says
this is a simple one do you feel
successful yes and no because I remember
thinking to myself if I could only hit a
hundred thousand if I hit a hundred
thousand I'll feel successful when I hit
a hundred thousand they know what
balloons didn't fall from the sky
confetti didn't shoot out of cannons I
woke up and it was like wow there's a
hundred thousand people here and then
guess what life kept going and I used to
think well half million that would be
the number at a half million I'll feel
super successful the half million came
and went and nothing changed with the
way I felt and then part of me is like
wow I want to hit that million when I
hit that million things are going to
happen and I know for a fact nothing's
going to happen it's just going to be a
million subs and I'm going to keep going
on about my life it's really hard to
gauge success because everyone gauge is
a different some people want to gauge
success on why you have a million subs
or Wow you're getting you know six
million views a month or or whatever why
you can work for yourself well you have
a nice house
everyone gauges success in a different
way to me I feel like success comes when
I die if that makes any sense
if when I leave this planet if the
impact I left people remember that
that's what I will gauge my success on
not anything I've achieved yet I don't
feel like I've ever been to my told
potential now don't think I will ever be
to my full potential which is what keeps
me going
so I don't want to ever get to the point
to where I feel like I've made it I'm
successful because success also dictates
the completion of something and I don't
think I've ever done anyway that's all
for today guys there were hundreds of
questions and lots of good ones and I'll
continue to answer some of them on
Twitter and respond to the tweets if
they didn't make it into video don't
feel bad if you want a chance of making
it into the next ask J who knows when
maybe this summer sometime I don't do it
very often make sure you guys follow on
Twitter it's at ght says and then use
the hashtag ask J's two cents and we'll
go ahead and call that a day a day
we're going to call it a day I swear a
little on my words I'm not drunk I swear
all right guys time to go thanks for
watching as always I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
