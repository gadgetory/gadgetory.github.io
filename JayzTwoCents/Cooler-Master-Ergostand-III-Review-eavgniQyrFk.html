congestion and well 50% I'm just whining
but anyway today we're gonna talk about
cooler masters new air ghosts and three
today's shout out is brought to you by

software and tools to learn more about
full sales degrees and programs make
sure to click the link down in the
description and find out how you can
start your tech career today another
reason why I was interested in doing
this review and I requested this review
is the fact that I spent nearly 10 years
working in IT working strictly from a
laptop I had to be mobile and move
around and I didn't always get to keep
the same desk in fact I rarely had a
desk to call my own so I spent a lot of
years getting used to the fact that
sometimes I had to prop up things on a
phone books or books or manuals to get
the monitor up high where I wanted it or
to get the laptop up high so the monitor
was at the right level and then at the
plugin you know my mouse and my keyboard
and my external drive or whatever card
reader whatever it may be and it just
got super freakin annoying
so when coolermaster said hey we saw
that you got a new laptop and just had
to take a look at one of our stands i
was kind of like you know what
abso-freaking-lutely cuz i want to see
what it would have been like if i had
one of these when I was working as a
mobile tech so anyway this is the ergo
stand 3 now the construction of this
thing is plastic with a metal bar now
it's a plastic shroud plastic fan in
there
plastic bass but of course to support
bar itself which is adjustable different
levels is metal now the cool thing about
this is the fact that they have
considered the fact that you're probably
going to leave this in a stationary spot
and be moving and coming to and from
this thing here so they've incorporated
cable management in this thing and it
really does make a lot of sense we'll
talk about that in a second here it also
features the fact that it's got a 200
millimeter fan on the bottom here that
is going to be giving you active cooling
to the bottom of your laptop
not to mention regardless of the setting
that this thing is whether the highest
setting or the lowest setting you are
getting the laptop up off the ground so
that you can have airflow most laptops
have airflow that come from the bottom
of the laptop and get exhausted out the
rear so that is going to be a feature
worth noting and you also have right
here as you can see a powered USB hub
now it's got four USB 2.0 right here on
the back it's got a mini USB which you
use to connect to your computer but it
also has a five volt charging device now
this is cool because you could use this
to charge your smart device or something
so you have multiple things going on
here you're kind of turning this into a
base station for your laptop now on the
front here huge mesh grille so all that
air that's getting pulled from the
bottom is getting pushed towards the
bottom of the laptop if you have tabs
that pop out here to keep you know your
computer from sliding off because that
would be sort of counterproductive if it
slid right off the damn thing and then
on the side here you do have rubber
grommets that you can pass cables
through from the side of your computer
to keep things from moving around last
but not least before we actually show
the functionality of it on the top left
here you have a power switch it's a on
and off and then a voltage adjustable
for the fan so you can click it on and
then you can control the speed of this
fan which is which is kind of funny I
thought initially why would anyone want
to control the speed of this fan just
let it blow I mean more airflow is
better but I found that as I was sitting
there using this be preparing for this
review and getting used to it that while
I had my hands on the laptop my hands
start to get kind of cold believe it or
not the amount of airflow this thing
pushes through made my hands feel a
little bit chilly so I found myself
turning it down all right so let's go
ahead and put my laptop on this thing
and let's kind of show some practical
uses for it now my laptop tends to be a
bit rear heavy the reason for that is as
you can see it's fatter at the back it's
got this massive 17.3 inch screen and
then it's got these rear exhaust here
that hang off so I was kind of curious
well obviously this laptop stand is
meant more for like a 15-inch monitor or
a 15-inch laptop so how is it going to
handle this 8.4 pound monster the laptop
I figured if there was any way to really
test this it would be by putting
something on there that might be a
little bit too big for it so let's see
how it goes we got a little bit of
flexing of the plastic down at the
bottom here where it holds the laptop
but it doesn't feel like it's going to
break off or anything open up that bad
boy and cool thing is as you can see the
monitor is now like head height on there
don't look at my password so as you can
see the monitor is head height but of
course the typing is kind of weird you
know this wouldn't exactly be the most
ergonomic typing angle but this
definitely gets your monitor up and in
your face now this laptop has USB on
both sides so because we've got a pretty
long cable here looks like we've got
about an 18 inch cable or so I'm going
to go from the right side to the rear
that way I don't have a big excess
bundle of cables coming off the side all
right and then the second you plug it in
it's recognized as a USB hub the light
turns on here as you can see and then
you can start controlling the amount of
airflow that comes through the fan on
the bottom there you go there's that if
we put this down to the lower angle
would probably make a little more sense
you know to try and type on this thing
but I want to point out that it did you
know hold the weight of this laptop
obviously but you can see if we go to
the lowest setting and we make it flat
it's a little bit too much rear weight
for this bad boy so I mean we could do
something like that that would be good
for just keeping it cool but then it's
not exactly using the ergo stand as a
stand at that point now if we're going
to be using this as like a desk or like
a base station or something like that
find the right angle so that your
monitor is you know eye level and then
which you can simply do
is in fact what's going to take the
computer off here for a moment you can
then plug in your favorite Mouse and you
can see the you see the fan turn in
there you think spins for a long time
once it loses power so that means those
bearings are extremely smooth okay so
we've got a little makeshift base
station put together here so let's go
ahead and just say you get to work or
you get home and maybe this is a dorm
room or something you can just take your
laptop set it down
open up the lid plug in the one cable
the USB cable if I actually plugged in
the USB I'll try to stick it in HDMI
right now there you go everything just
turned on no now we've got charging and
syncing of our smart device we've got
our mouse hugged up here and we have got
our keyboard and everything so now
you've got your laptop sitting here it's
being nice and cooled by the fan on the
bottom and as you can see we've got full
control over everything here so there we
go everything is working so I think
that's a pretty neat little base station
there it's not expensive it's rugged
it's holding a laptop that's technically
too big for it so if you're using
anything smaller than this laptop you
know it's not going to fall over it's
it's pretty freakin sturdy as you can
see it's not wanting to tip backwards
you can see if I tip it backwards it
comes back forward so that's a big deal
it's going to keep your laptops life
longer because you're keeping it cool
you all know laptops the number one
killer of laptops is clearly Heat so if
you keep the heat down for that big Oh
big ass two hundred millimeter fan on
the bottom doesn't make any noise at all
the thing is 100% silent and obviously I
don't see anything wrong with this so
it's a pretty simple product that does
what it's designed to do it doesn't it's
advertised to do and if you are anyone
who uses a laptop for day-to-day use it
would be worth getting one of these or a
couple of these depending on where you
may travel between and get your eye
level where it belongs because you know
one of the things I hated most about
working with a laptop was I was always
kind of looking down my neck would start
to hurt I hated looking down but now you
can see I'm more eye level head straight
Necas
straight and I guess that I guess it
actually is why it's called the ergo
stand there you go guys the air goes
stand three from Coolermaster thanks for
sending that over for review it's going
to get some use problems in fact it's
already been getting use I've been using
it been laying down on my couch being
lazy and using like a TV tray and then
sitting this on it and then the laptop
on yeah it's like the ultimate and
laziness for me
alright I might get out of here and go
jam some more medicine up my nose
alright guys thanks for watching we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
