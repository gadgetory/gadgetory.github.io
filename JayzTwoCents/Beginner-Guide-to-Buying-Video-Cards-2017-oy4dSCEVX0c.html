recent launch of the AMD rx 500 series
of graphics cards and the launch of the
1080 Ti the anticipated launch for Vega
my inbox is exploding with people asking
me about graphics cards and they just
are confused but all the different
things happening here and I just don't
know what to buy so the goal of today's
video is to arm my new and inexperienced
viewers with information they need to
make an informed purchase bring out the
bling in your PC with Corsairs new
Vengeance RGB series ddr4 memory with
its hassle free lighting controls in
superior overclocking performance put
the link in the description to learn
more so if you're an experienced builder
or a veteran of this channel this is all
going to seem very basic to you so I'm
actually talking to the beginner here
because trust me I'm sure you remember
what it was like trying to sift through
all this to try and figure out what was
the best now we're going to talk about a
few different things here and I'm going
to start off with reference versus AIC
you'll hear referred to as AIC aib or
add-in card add-in board those are the
partners the brands that remanufacture
the the manufacturers brands that make
sense so we've got two manufacturers
here and we'll start we'll start by
getting some of these out of the way
here we have got an Nvidia card right
here this is the founders GTX 1080 I'm
going to say reference for the sake of
simplicity they do call it founders just
know that founders means it's a
reference design okay
AMD has the same thing this is actually
an AMD card imma set that down now what
that means is there are only two
manufacturers of the GPU cores that go
into all of the graphics cards that you
guys are using there's Nvidia which
makes their cores which are based on the
cuda architecture known as AMD which
manufactures their core using something
called a stream processor so there are
two different types of approaches to the
same the same end goal so essentially
what happens here is the manufacturer in
this case Nvidia took this 1080 and said
here is the blueprint or the reference
and they provide these to their partners
now the partners can either choose to
remanufacture that we manufacture this
exactly as you see it throw their
coolers on there and then call it a day
or they can take the design for the core
architecture with the way the memory
interfaces with the core and then they
can take that and improve upon it which
gets you something like this this is the
asus strix 10
ETI this is based on the same reference
for the 1080 TI but it has there does
their flavor their touches added to it
so what they've done is they've taken
the core architecture and then they
built around it their engineers have
built around it to try and take this and
make it even better okay J so the
manufacturers are the ones that are
making the reference cards why do they
get such a bad rep well typically the
reason why people will say the reference
cards are something you should skip and
not purchase is because typically they
run louder they run hotter and they
don't have as much overclocking Headroom
or at least that was the case until
about the last year and a half as the
core architecture has gotten smaller and
overclocking Headroom has gotten more
consistent across the board that doesn't
hold as true anymore but what typically
people will complain about is the cooler
on a reference card now you'll hear a
lot of people that will say oh and under
no circumstances should you ever buy a
reference cooler they're terrible
they're hot they're noisy but they
actually have their place reference
coolers are typically they work like a
turbo they suck our in magic happens and
performance comes out the same happens
in the graphics card air goes in grabs
heat and exhaust it all out of the back
of the case well about 95 percent of it
some of it escapes through the cracks
and then some heat is radiated off the
back of the card now the reason why
Nvidia and AMD still use and yes by the
way I want to pause there for a second I
did indeed see that the rx 580
literature from AMD is showing a dual
card design sort of sort of like this
not exactly the same but sort of like
this and I saw a lot of folks saying
look AMD is ditching the blower style
guys I asked him about that that's a
render that's not a real cooler it was
just a computer rendered image that
doesn't really exist at least that's
what they told me when I asked them
about it the reason why they do this is
because the card is less reliant on the
cooling capabilities of the chassis the
manufacturer cannot build a card that
has a multi fan setup like this guy
right here and apply for a habit of work
in every single chassis exist on the
market so at least doing it this way
gives them the best consistent
performance variable that they possibly
could so I hope that makes sense now
with that I'm going to say that this
graphics card with this blower style
cooler they do have you know plastic
shrouds and some of the manufacturers
will take
a reference PCB and put a cheaper cooler
on there has its purpose they belong in
small form-factor cases home dear PCs
things where there's not a lot of volume
of air that the crap the graphics card
can use to keep itself cool now another
argument people will use to kind of
poopoo on the reference cards and this
is a valid argument by the way it's not
only a hot and noisy they also are sort
of bare-bones they have less power
phases they have less power plugs a lot
of times in our back plates Nvidia
actually does but which means that it
could equate to lesser Headroom when it
comes to overclocking so not everyone is
an overclock of tho but there are
benefits to go in with a custom card so
I'm going to set this one aside and
we're going to take these Strix for
instance here this is a triple fan
design which means that you have a lot
more airflow blowing down in the card
you've got this giant heatsink array on
here with a bajillion fins that's the
official number a bajillion and the more
surface area you have the more
dissipation of heat you have which means
cooler temperatures cooler temperatures
mean better performance for GPU boost
where it's going to ramp itself up
automatically overclocking as far as and
temperatures one of those things that
keep it from going as high as it can so
the lower the temp it'll go higher these
cards are also not nearly as loud as the
reference counterparts even when they're
overclocked so there's an acoustic
benefit and there's a cooling benefit
but there's also a size requirement as
well so if you kind of hold these up
against each other you can see just how
much bigger the Strix is versus the
custom card put on top of each other so
you can kind of get an idea there it's
longer it's taller it's definitely going
to have some additional chassis
requirements now speaking of chassis we
have all of this air being pulled in
from the environment or the envelope of
the chassis pushing down this graphics
card it's coming out the back besides
the bottom it's coming out of all four
sides of this card which means your
chassis has to be able to do something
with that hot air so that's where the
blower Styles come in the chassis isn't
exhausting the hot air the card is but
if you're going to be having a cooler
like this that all that hot air is just
kind of being pushed into the case the
case has to have adequate cooling
ventilation so if you try and run a card
like this in a case that doesn't have
adequate cooling the card will continue
to get hotter
hotter and hotter as that hot air is
recirculated back through the card
instead of out of the case and it's not
getting a fresh air supply which means
it will eventually slow down as the
thermal limits of the card are reached
and yes that can happen put this card
inside of a case put no case fans on the
case and close it up and watch how fast
a thing thermal throttle is it what
happened pretty damn quickly now another
benefit to the custom cards or we're
going to call them a ICS stands for
add-in card is they had multiple power
connectors now I want to dispel a myth
here real quick a myth is if it has more
power connectors it's a better
overclocking card which I've heard a lot
of people say well the GTX ten-eighty
only has a single power pin so clearly
it can't be a very good overclocker so
when you take the custom card and it has
additional power pins clearly it's going
to be a better overclocker that's not
true I can tell you right now that my GT
X 1080 founders edition card is one of
the fastest 10 eighties that I have now
not only is that because you know Nvidia
bend the GPUs but it also is because of
the fact that we are getting better
performance in the core architecture
where things like power delivery and
temperatures are not as important as
they were even two or three years ago
but that doesn't mean that they're not
necessary to run additional power plugs
what the manufacturers are doing is they
are allowing the card to draw as much
power as it needs without over
saturating in a single power pin now
although the reference cards are getting
more efficient they're not needing
additional power pins these cards are
designed to go balls to the wall as fast
as they possibly can they're going to
self overclock farther they're going to
stay there longer because of the
additional cooling but not only that
most of the custom cards have additional
power phases on them you can kind of see
the back of the power phases right here
but they're taller PCBs as well because
they're fitting more power phases on
there so the reason why you have the
extra plugs is because you're getting a
clean constant power delivery if you're
running a GPU at its limit and there's
any sudden dip of power then you're
going to have instability issues so just
because it has to eight pin power plugs
doesn't mean it draws twice the power
we're just making sure that there's
enough power making to this card without
one eight pin PCI Express cable being
over saturated something else to keep in
mind too is the custom cards are usually
taller and longer than the reference
cards so you want to make sure that you
look at the specs of the card you're
shopping for and make sure it's going to
fit in your case they're longer to
account for much longer coolers and
they're taller as I said to account for
the extra power delivery or the power
phases which usually stacked up and down
you put more of them in there you need a
taller card a taller card also means you
can space them out a little bit more and
have a little bit less crosstalk
crosstalk is where the components are so
close together they give up a little RF
interference and then they start to kind
of interact with each other in a
negative way and so having a bigger PCB
reduces that now each brand has their
own flavor of custom cards right this is
the Strix it's available in both AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs because Asus is agnostic
same thing with MSI this is the gaming X
this is the 390 so you've got the same
cooler style though on the GTX 1080p I
think I have one right here yeah so
here's a 1080i version of it they look
the same but they're not always built
identical there's some variance between
them depending on the power requirements
and the cooling requirements of the GPUs
now something else I want to keep in
mind it's a little bit less important
today as it used to be since motherboard
manufacturers are now spacing out the
cards as far as possible they're not
sandwiching them together anymore so you
can have more flexibility in which PCI
slots you use a lot of cards now to
account for the giant coolers are going
to what's known as a slot and a half so
not only is the card taller and longer
it's also fatter so as you can see right
here this is a dual slot when it comes
to mounting but it's actually a two and
a half slot because the cooler is
actually taller you know
wider than just these two slots so if
you had an old-school motherboard and
you had to squish these up against each
other you actually wouldn't be able to
because the cooler as you can see is
just so much thicker and if you can
actually see that that's going to close
that with overclocking guys overclocking
is not guaranteed silicon Lotteria what
that means is the quality of the silicon
inside of the GPU that you know the
chips the dye it's going to have a ton
of variance across the board they
manufacture these things from giant
wafers and then they're cut down and put
into the additionally all of the GPUs so
the quality of that wafer and
imperfections that exist on that wafer
mean that you're going to have a ton
of variants in terms of overclocking
ability now most of the time these
manufacturers are really good at bending
these GPUs binning means by basically
putting them in bins theoretically where
the best overclockers or the best
performers go over here the ones that
are not is good to go here a little bit
lesser ones go here and so you end up
with ten eighty ten seventy you know etc
so ten seventy GPU is actually the same
as a ten eighty GPU it just has CUDA
cores that are locked because it didn't
perform and meet the standard that's
what bidding is now the manufacturers
kind of do the same thing they kind of
will test the GPUs themselves as well
and the better Clockers or the better
overclockers will get put in the more
beefy cards and then as the card series
goes down to a little bit less of a
price premium they will typically have
GPUs that are not as good but that
doesn't necessarily mean they're not
going to be good overclockers again it
just literally is a lottery that's why
it's referred to as a silicon lottery
you win and you lose and trust me I've
been on both sides of that I feel bad
when someone tells me they bought a
custom card and they can over only
overclock it like 20 megahertz before it
starts crashing it's unfortunate but
that's just the way it is anyway guys I
hope this videos helped again this is
just a talking head video with some
visual references here but I wanted to
at least put some information out there
as there's a lot of people shopping for
graphics cards right now and I wanted to
at least kind of give you some things to
think about as you're looking for your
graphics cards so if you know someone
shopping and they're just confused and
pulling their hair out trying to decide
which card is for them show them this
video maybe it'll help them if you have
something you want to add to this video
put it down in the comments there's a
lot of information into that there's
over a million people following this
channel and that's a lot of collective
brains and knowledge so if you think
there's something important that I
missed put it down in the comments of
this video and maybe I'll make it in the
next one I haven't done one of the
videos for a couple of years so I hope
this was kind of a fun little refresher
and it gave me an opportunity to just
kind of play around with graphics cards
on the table here because I don't have
enough computers to use them all all
right time to go guys thanks for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the next also to down the description of
this video there is amazon links to
graphics cards so take you to the
graphics card section of amazon it helps
the channel if you want to help out that
way you buy something a little portion
of that goes back to the channel where I
can keep making content for you guys
alright time to go
thanks for watching see the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
