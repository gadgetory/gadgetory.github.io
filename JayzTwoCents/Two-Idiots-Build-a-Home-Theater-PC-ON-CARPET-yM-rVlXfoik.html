carpet why are you doing that because
the internet says I can't oh okay
so actually been at this for a little
while now you just decided to make a
video um I got a little sick and tired
of how big the computer that I was using
for the simulator rig was and as you can
see I took the monitor off the rig over
there and now I'm making a home theater
PC out of the same components and
putting in a note six of light so yeah
the issue here is the 605 does not
support water cooling at all in fact it
also only supports coolers up to about
130 ish millimeters and this cooler is
actually hundred and forty-one
millimeters but it does plenty of room
on top before it hits the top of the
case so we have enough downdraft here
but I'm using the Gemini when is this
the s5 24 downdraft which is kind of
neat because as you can see it overhangs
on top of the vrm or you can flip it
around the other way and have it
overhang on the RAM but it's on top of
the vrm and it will help cool the vrm in
fact I had it going in the other way and
I was like oh I need low profile ram so
I went down to the shop and grabbed my
low profile Ram but since I flipped it
around the other way now I can actually
go back to my my other Vengeance and
I've used my low profile and now we can
go back to 16 gigs of 1866 because no
home theater PC is complete without 16
gigabytes of 1866
cheers a tickle you'll never know when
you need a Photoshop on the home theater
ring the power supply here is gonna be
so overkill 2v 1200 1200 watt power
supply and altimeter PC but I gotta get
these two fans on right here it comes
with two of these this isn't a review
guys I've actually had this case for a
year Fraggle centum you over a year ago
and I'm just now getting around to doing
home theater build that comes with two
of the silent series are two fans one of
them is pre-installed with this that way
your power supply fan or power supply
cables don't get jammed up in the fan so
that's kind of neat it's so powerful and
then I had two more of these from
another fractal case that I reviewed and
I'm going to fill in the other slot so
we have two 120 millimeter intakes
actually I guess I can't do that now
that I think about it because I'm an
idiot the power supply it's gonna pull
air from right here so I can only do one
intake and two exhaust will be that bad
it means I'm gonna have negative
pressure which is going to cause a dust
issue maybe I'll have this one down here
being exhaust I'll have the two on the
top being intake so I've got positive
pressure right here on top of the cooler
and then I don't have eighty millimeter
fans but there are two eighty millimeter
fans that can go right there and then
I'll probably have my power supply pull
air from inside here instead of outside
that way it can kind of help balance out
that that pressure I don't know sounds
like a bold move people - let's see how
it plays out No how does that mic sound
though right now where you're listening
to it while recording yes that's pretty
good
I can hear me jeez suddenly you start
screaming see I was up a headphone but
when I'm just talking normal you can
hear me doesn't sound all crazy ugly
yeah yeah I sound far away and so I'm
like right here no just talk to the side
of it like 20 that you and talk pointing
it Oh
oh wow I'm loud oh good
if you guys can't tell we're playing
around the new Sennheiser MKE 440 which
is a stereo shotgun mic it's got two
shotgun mics on top of it like this
stop throwing gang signs well I think it
it works pretty awesome maybe see I had
I had a rode videomic in my shopping
cart on Amazon Prime day I think
Sennheiser might have hacked my Amazon
and saw that that I got
send him one sent in one I think that
might even what happened I I didn't find
anything I really wanted to splurge on I
did it's right there
Internet's gonna oh yeah it's an Xbox
guys watch out it's a the division
version oh you're not fun with that not
getting a visa Canada coop no I bought
that on Amazon Prime day because I feel
bad that we're always downstairs
watching TV or something and Little J
wants to play on her like Lego games and
stuff so instead of bringing the Xbox
downstairs up here because every now and
then I want to play downstairs on the on
the nice TV I was like well I get
another Xbox for cheap and we'll put it
up here in that way I could bring my
account over here and when he comes over
and we played fours or whatever we can
play up here if the wife's down there
watching TV or vice versa it solve
problems or when no one else is here we
use both of them I didn't even think
about that
if one of the truth we had to do a split
screen yeah we could just do live I kind
of really want to fart but I'm like
holding in I'm waiting for you to part
first
I've been farting oh so someone's
probably already noticed too that I said
I was using a Coolermaster s 5:24
cruller but this is clearly not a cooler
master fan that is on there and you're
right I took off the Silencio fan that
comes with it and I put on a fractal
venturi for 140 millimeter fan this is a
120 and doesn't cover the full surface
area of the cooler which i think is
weird
I don't know why they didn't just ship
it with the 140 version on their own
cooler that support to 140 so yeah I put
that on there
just to kind of give it a little bit
more cooling capacity if you will
weeding capacity II that sounded so is
suddenly Jamaican I don't know
guy doesn't Jamaican say pokeyman a
Pokemon you should use like a carbon
filter every time on your but always
immune to it we just look at the breathe
filter you know after breathe filter
didn't work he'd be like Sarah to my
fart it's like Burt a sec for breeze
yeah so every time you go it smells so
fresh in here you realize wait you
farted yeah poof
that's kind of neat so we got two fans
blowing in right here directly on the
cooler so that's going to help in
cooling and I think the open vents right
here too with an 80 millimeter fan slots
right here are going to help with some
of that heat can be able to make it
weights way there so it's not going to
swirl around in there oh well have the
graphics card right here so it's gonna
be semi compartmentalize this guy
actually goes like that so it's a cross
member support and this is also where
the weather for the hard drive cage is
attached to you look lost no I'll try to
see if I thought there would be enough
room right here for me to drop this like
behind the power supply to come up Oh
guys back there I don't know why I'm so
worried about the cable management in
this thing because it's not going to
show that I care I mean look look at the
cable management I'm doing in this thing
and something you can't even see like
I've got things wired under the
motherboard got fan wires here routed in
a way that you can't see them care about
these things this sounds like an episode
of Monster Garage hmm don't you dare you
son of a bitch Oh
so happens you try to fit in 1200 inside
the HTPC I'll just see myself out then
see it
it looks like it fits yeah but this is
just a test fit I need to see I put this
on here we're having sort of
interference with these guys I don't
think I will though nope does it hang
out we're back here oh you're fine but
some power connector Oh
so I'm going to get right here like that
barely fits right there but yeah you
can't even use that one the power
connector is not gonna that kinda sucks
yeah well see the PSC is nice and short
oh god that looks like a minefield over
there serious yeah
I feel sad that you can't run SLI I mean
I could a 750 watt would actually power
210 eighties yeah I do I did want to run
SLI ten eighties in here because for VR
does matter
you can run graphics cards per eye and
you can hit that 90 Hertz which is got
magic sweet spot for VR can you give me
a favor yeah
can you go to the shop enough shop the
officing at the other wireless that's
sitting on the desk thank you
oh right here just in case once though
whoa Danya almost just when you do what
it tastes like this is just an order to
things if they have to go together like
a puzzle pretty much I hate puzzles oh
yeah
I'm on one that was so good
she that's tight you want to say it so
badly
hey why you making this uneasy though
most home theater pcs don't have like
full-length multi fan graphics cards
going in them so if I had a short
graphics card then I could use the
hangar damn I could get this to tape
start the negatives the hangars not
having any sort of interference with a
graphics card mm-hmm now what I'm gonna
do here is I'm quite literally just
going to and I really should be putting
in a better harddrive right now for this
but wait we went to Micro Center yeah I
got that three terabyte one there go
ahead and get it where is that it's in
the closet because I can I can copy the
steam library off of this on my 512 gig
pocket SSD from visiontek and then I can
transfer it back over to the new drive
that's so much easier
I've seen some people cringe at the
thought of using double-sided tape to
mount this stuff damn it if this stuff
is good enough to hold panels on cars
that are driving down the freeway it can
hold a frickin hard drive to the side of
a metal case palms and especially when
it's not moving but the hard drives
moving platter is spinning the harder
itself is technically not moving
technically air quotes
I built plenty of computers with
double-sided tape okay I never had an
issue oh I trust you mister I'm gonna
sound like a youtube comment right now
oh god don't stop just put it down it's
not going anywhere
I my concern about getting that off now
number two you should use a spatula geez
oh there okay so that proved my point
I finished this avoid the hard drive
breaks into no I shouldn't got the one
on sale you know make the case look good
and if the cover was on it what it's
like 12:01 12 for whatever I'll have to
be this tight moment of truth
something's working
get me a wind up the Gigabyte lit up
yellow like automatically by itself all
right that's one green I think it's
doing color shifts oh it's going to your
voice look at a box
oh my gosh Congrats and we got windows
booting up where's the QC stickers
alright so everything's done a couple
days later actually here's the
entertainment center right there yep
that's an Xbox one deal with it I've got
my Sennheiser RS 175 Wireless I guess
they'd be they classify them as
audiophile but they're home theater
headphones so hooked up to the TV and
then I've got the case right there all
in its glory now one of the reasons why
I did this was if you look at the play
area here I have for the HTC vive it's a
pretty big wide-open space and I want to
take advantage of that the problem was
when I had the computer over here next
to the racing simulator the court had to
come diagonal so as it came that way you
would hit the end of it over here and it
would pull on your headset or you trip
on it but what I also did as you can see
as I moved it to right there the the
actual hookups there's a blurry finger
the actual hookups for the vibe
right there so now as the cord comes out
into the middle of the room you've got
easy access to all of the giant area
here that you can use for the HTC vive
but it's kind of neat because I've got
this hooked up right here to the TV
obviously but because I have the optical
for this coming from the TV whatever is
playing from the TV whether be PC or
Xbox or TV you know like satellite will
play through the headphones so little
Jay could be up here watching TV and not
disrupting anybody same thing with a
when playing on the PC or playing on the
Xbox
the other cool thing is once the PC is
on and you're in VR you can control all
of the Steam menus from inside VR so you
don't need the monitor or in this case
the TV to control it so someone can be
playing VR and someone else can be
playing the Xbox one you know sitting
over here to the side and can see the TV
just fine while someone else is playing
VR and they can be using the headset and
hear what the Xbox is doing so you could
actually have someone playing on the PC
in VR and playing on the console at the
same time oh and something else I got
was a Logitech g600 Wireless Gaming
Mouse pretty much live free heard a lot
of great things about that Mouse so I
bought that and then I also bought this
logitech wireless keyboard nothing
flashy nothing fancy just so that you
can control it while you're sitting on
the couch and be lazy and don't have to
get up the other thing you can see is I
took the monitor off of here there's no
point having the monitor anymore
everything's wired down here to a USB
extension and a power cord so that when
I do want to use the racing sim in VR
like project cars then I can pull it out
here more into the middle of the room
plug it into the front of the computer
because the node 605 has this little
fold out they'll flip down right here
it's got a card reader and USB then I
can do that and then when I want I can
push it out of the way part of the
problem was when this thing was sitting
diagonal like it was it also protruded
up into the play area which I didn't
like but I just received word from
fnatic that they will send me their
racing setup with the wheel and pedals
and shifter and ebrake and and all that
stuff so this is going to be getting
reworked again and I'm probably going to
get a different racing simulator frame
low higher-quality one to go with the
higher quality
components anyway that's that guy is
just a quick easy vlog I figured since I
was doing the build and the changes
anyway I might as well at least take you
guys along for the ride so anyway thanks
for watching hope you guys like the
gaming setup it's kind of nice to have
friends come over now family they can
come up here and play we actually
dedicated playroom like an adult
playroom which is kind of nice
not that kind of playroom you know what
I'm trying to say I'm gonna get out of
here before I say anything else that's
stupid all right guys talk to you the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
