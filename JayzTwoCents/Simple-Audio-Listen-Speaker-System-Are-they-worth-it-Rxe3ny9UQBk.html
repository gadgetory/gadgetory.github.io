here and we just finished up Tech Talk
and now we are gonna take a look at a
product here that technically it's not
PC hardware but that's not all I do
around here anyway
you couldn't flow use it on your PC if
you wanted but today we are looking at
these simple audio listen stereo
speakers and these they've got a heck of
a price tag that goes along with them so
there's something you would definitely
want a price drop or a little bit of a
wherever my words todays video is
sponsored by master op the largest
community commerce platform in the world
had to master up today and suggest
something to be dropped and I'd like
literally drop it you know where they
bring the price down and stuff if you
guys aren't a member of mass drop it's
absolutely free it's definitely worth
taking a look at in fact you'd be
surprised how many people were actually
signed up on mass drop because basically
what it is it is like bulk discounts
where mass drop will go and negotiate
group rates for cheaper pricing on
products that users like you vote on
that they want to go and get a cheaper
price so if enough people said hey we
want this motherboard and we want it
cheaper they'll go and negotiate it and
then they'll come up with a group rate
so it's really like a win-win now we'll
go ahead and of take a two around the
box there it is we have gone around the
box you guys know me I don't care a
whole lot for the unboxing so yeah
whatever
packages kind of need on this though
it's got a sleeve with Nvidia green and
there they are
alright so first thing I've noticed is
they're actually pretty heavy and
there's a cord that just fell out on me
there and accessories and a remote
control that's pretty cool okay so
before we talk about the accessories
that come with it I just want to point
out that these are very very sturdy made
you've got a nice fabric grill on here
kind of a mesh grill but it is fabric
not metal but you do have what appears
to be aluminum or aluminium depending on
the part of the country that you are in
and the top is a very polished plastic
and that's because all of the controls
on this thing are handled through
capacitive touch so we'll talk about
that a little bit in the future
you have a headphone port as well as an
three to 1/2 millimeter input jack so
you could hook this up to
an iPod or an mp3 player something that
maybe didn't have Bluetooth so you could
input sound into this thing and then you
have a subwoofer preamp on here which is
important to you because to get a nice
full sound you would want a subwoofer so
it does have expendability for that and
then you have your speaker out port on
there which wow I almost whacked myself
somewhere I didn't want to so you can
plug in the left speaker right there but
let's say you're in a situation kind of
like I am with the computer behind me
here where you want to separate the
speakers out a bit more you can take
this extension cable plug it into the
speaker cable and you get a really wide
capability of separating these speakers
out for wider soundstage if that's what
you want now you also have a USB a micro
USB port on here so that you hook this
up to a computer it becomes its own
sound device and then you have on here
your power port our power plug other
than that that's pretty much all the
buttons that are on there when it comes
to physical buttons in the package here
I'm assuming this is pretty much just
gonna be our USB cable and probably the
power brick because this thing does
require power and I was right what do
you know oh and it comes to the
three-and-a-half millimeter male to male
plug so that you could use it plug it
into your phone or whatever it does have
your Quick Start Guide so you would want
to consult that for doing things like
bluetooth pairing and here is your mode
control you pull that out now the
battery is active so this thing will
work so what I'm gonna do right now and
by the way this is a three meter
extension cable so you can see you've
got an extra what nine feet of length on
there which is good so we got the
speaker grille off right here and you
can see it is just a nice fabric and you
can see that it is basically a two-way
speaker system where you've got your
main woosh or driver there and a silk
dome tweeter now if you remove the back
there's something else built into these
speakers and that's what makes these
start to get a little bit into the
audiophile range it's one of those terms
I really hate to use but for the price
of this you know the technology should
be in there you have here basically it's
like a dampening cone but it is going to
help the sound a little bit especially
when it comes to the base by having this
cone on the back
okay so I went ahead and plug this thing
into power and you can see on the top
here it is capacitive touch you got your
power button one of the things I hate
hate hate about polish finishes at chat
attracts dust and fingerprints so I do
really hate that this is a Polish finish
on top but the lion input button did
illuminate on here since it can tell
that we have something plugged into it
so I went ahead and turned on the
computer while using this PC sound but
first I want to go ahead and do
something here on the the old iPhone and
we'll see how it sounds so I can't
really play much on here because I don't
have any music that I'm actually allowed
to play but that's not gonna stop us
okay so I didn't actually play it so
that you guys could hear it for very
long because I don't have a royalties to
listen to this music but I do want to
say that it's a bit louder than I
thought would be there's a bit more bass
and I thought it would be but it's not
incredibly loud that could be because
I'm just using on a device like this but
although it does have its own ant
built-in it shouldn't matter what the
input volume is so not quite as loud as
I thought that they would be but of
course just plugging it in was extremely
simple bluetooth would be just as easy
where you're gonna pair it like you
would any other Bluetooth device but
what I think I'm a little bit more
interested in with these is how well
these work as PC speakers now I find
myself in the position where I have my
my Logitech z-series speakers on there
but I don't like having to constantly
reach for it to turn it up and down I am
lazy and do like the idea of a remote
control but also a speaker system that I
can switch inputs and do more than just
PC sound on which is fortunate
unfortunately what you get with PC
speakers so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
just gonna go ahead and plug in the USB
cable and then we're gonna see how well
this these actually work as as some PC
speakers so I guess it's time to roll
that a transition there so actually
since I can't get those stupid twist-tie
off I can build a hell of a computer but
I can't operate it twist tie
now the first thing I want to point out
is the second I plugged in the USB cable
it automatically detected it installed
well didn't even install it doesn't even
require a driver it's a plug-and-play
and it did go immediately to that as the
sound source so let's go ahead and see
probably turn them on
all right turned it off am i doing wrong
here
unplug the three and a half cable let's
see what's happening
that was weird it like clicked off and
didn't come back but I think I was doing
something wrong ooh that computer
speakers all right so let's put these
theoretically in the position they would
be for computer speakers sort of kind of
and I don't know let's see how well this
this works out here if these actually
work out well then I'm gonna use them as
computer speakers
I'm really starting to hate this be as
good as advertised so if anything we'll
just go ahead and use the test bench
here and we'll do some light
benchmarking we'll just show you guys
how it's really a bunch of crappy now
let the buyer mount it in a standard 120
millimeter fan slot in their case
just like the 295 days alright so I said
the last couple of minutes listening to
these and like my videos and as well as
some other music and such and I have to
say they don't have very crisp highs
considering they have a silk dome
tweeter but they do sound a bit more
like monitors to me they were they have
more would be kind of like IPS panels
for 4 monitors they sound more like IPS
speakers to put that into a term you
would understand I guess if you weren't
into audio they do some more like
monitors where they would be more
accurate to real-life but there's not a
lot there's no EQ option I can't even
control bass or treble built into them
they have their own setting and that's
it and I think that's that takes a
little bit of getting used to in terms
of sound I think on top of that is
silence it's awesome like explosions no
fractal add gtx 980 hybrid well as I
said and we I'm just noticing that I
have to turn it up way high to get
volume out of it so I'm not entirely
sure how well these were cast as
standalone PC speakers I'll probably
leave them hooked up on this machine for
a while and just kind of try them out
and see really all you're gaining with
these is the Bluetooth capability and
capacitive touch and a remote control
that I personally don't know how much I
would use so in terms of these being PC
speakers I think the the jury's still
out
they don't sound terrible at all it's
just they don't they don't sound full
because these little 3-inch drivers are
not able to get very much bass I do have
a 10 inch subwoofer that I could hook up
to these I'm not doing that for this
video but I do think with a subwoofer
then it might sound more full I wish the
highs were a little more crisp and clear
but they're not it has a much more flat
sound signature or soundstage to these
so
I don't know the jury's still out on
these but tell me what you guys think
have you guys looked into this brand
before do you know anything about simple
audio they come off to me as a little
bit like a brand that's trying to be a
bit more of a boutique brand audiophile
grade but compared to other speakers in
the same range like the bose companion
fives i've heard those those are on my
father's computer actually and those
were 299 bucks and they sound phenomenal
they sound a lot better than these but
again they don't have a remote control
they don't have the bluetooth capability
where you can hook up you know a phone
or something to it and have a do dual
purpose so I'm not I'm not sure exactly
where these fit in you guys tell me of
course mass drop doesn't really care a
whole lot about whether or not you guys
like the product cuz mass drop is
independent from the product themselves
so obviously be brutally honest but I'm
gonna leave these hooked up as a PCS
speakers here for a little bit and we'll
see how it goes but other than that guys
tell me what you think follow on social
media if you guys have any questions and
of course thank you guys for using the
Amazon affiliate link down the
description zee I can't believe we have
sold eight hundred items in a month
that's crazy you guys absolutely blow my
mind with that so anyway keep being
awesome guys and as always thanks for
watching it cool gaming headset so today
we're gonna take a look at what is
probably regarded as one of the most
favorited headsets on the market the
HyperX cloud but what's cool about this
is this is the cloud - it's the
predecessor to the famous HyperX cloud
and they have put some pretty cool
features into this thing and I'm pretty
excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
