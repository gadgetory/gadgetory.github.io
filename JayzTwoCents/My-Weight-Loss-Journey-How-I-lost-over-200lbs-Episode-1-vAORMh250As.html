Jays two cents coming at you on my
second channel here Jay says I'm gonna
bring you my very first video of what I
really hope turns into a series here
where I talk about my weight loss and
what the last three years have been like
I get so many messages from people
asking me how I've lost over 200 pounds
and I'm just gonna kind of bring it to
you in increments I don't want to throw
too much information at you at one time
but what I did today when I went to the
gym and this is my first workout ever
since having Christmas and junk food and
pie and cookies and fudge and chocolate
and the whole sorts of stuff I should
not have eaten but I want I'm going to
go ahead I'm gonna throw you guys out
there some footage from the gym today
and my personal trainer did this for me
so I'm gonna apologize some of it
sideways some of it straight up and down
you know he was a little inconsistent
with which way he was holding the camera
but you'll get the general idea and I
just want to throw this out there so
that way there's a little bit of
motivation to some of you who I know are
trying to lose weight you guys have
reached out to me and said how did you
do it give me some advice please tell me
what your secret is and I'm just going
to go ahead and start by showing you
what my workout routine is and you know
right now I'm doing a lot of strength
training but I do a lot of cardio do
CrossFit training we really try and mix
it up to keep it fun and exciting but
check out this video and do me a favor
subscribe to this channel subscribe to
my main channel I'm going to pop up a
little button right about now right
there right yeah right there
and I want you guys to check out my main
channel as well but subscribe to both
I'm going to bring you guys some cool
content and try to keep it as fun and
exciting as I possibly can if you're
just checking out my channel for the
very first time this is what I look like
back in 2009 I know a lot of you have
already seen this picture you're
probably tired of seeing this picture
but I'm going to show you some pictures
that you may not have seen yet these are
some pictures that only family has seen
because I did everything I could be a
hermit I stayed inside I didn't go
outside I was constantly ridiculed made
fun of called fat called you know fat
bastard and you know probably was pretty
close to eating that baby right there
who happens to be my newborn daughter at
the time I weighed just under 500 pounds
when these pictures were taken and I
finally said enough is enough and I made
those life changes and I'm very proud of
the results that I have
pants and I'm holding up in this picture
right here are a size 62 waist and as
you can see I am easily half that today
this is a picture of me wearing these
pants that I was holding up in the
previous picture one of the things my
trainers and I really focus on now is
strength training when you lose a lot of
fat you lose a lot of muscle as well
you're not moving around much weight so
your muscle shrink and I've been working
out with my trainer now for 13 months
and we put back on a lot of lean muscle
in my workout what you're going to see
in these videos now is the very first
set of my workouts or warm-up sets only
lighter weight than musical I think on
these pull downs right here I was only
doing about a hundred pounds nothing too
major and every single set what we do is
we bump up the weight and we bring down
the rep so we do fifteen twelve ten or
we do three times fifteen depending on
the amount of weight that we do so don't
judge me on the amount of weight that
you see on some of these you may only
see 40 pounds you may only see 50 pounds
you may see I think I do a 120 on my lap
my low rows or my lat rows don't judge
me I'm at the gym are you at the gym and
if you're not at the gym get up off your
ass and watch my video at the gym get
