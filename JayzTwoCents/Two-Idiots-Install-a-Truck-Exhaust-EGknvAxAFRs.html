guys Jays two cents here and we're gonna
do something we haven't done in a while
we're gonna bring back the two idiots
series you know what guys I got new
merch it's available now crowd me calm
/jc sense we got zip up hoodies we got
tri-blend we got a new logo I digress
since 2012 it's like the rest logo you
guys been asking for that anyway well
guys we all kinda stuff zip up hoodies
have beanies polos don't take my word
for it cuz obviously I can't do this
Edie so just look in the description
below and you guys will find the link
Thanks so I have got if you guys are
aware if you've been following on social
media then you would know that I got a
new 2019 RAM rebel that I already done
loved a few things to you at 35 inch
nano rich grapplers leveled all that
sort of stuff cane and intake but what
we're missing most of all besides this
guy in the channel you guys have
constantly been like what happened to
him what are you doing down there
and then my knucklehead dog is acting
like a knucklehead dog he works for car
stuff now he likes doing car stuff more
so and we're also filming this with cell
phones so I apologize for the quality
because we moved into this new house and
I cannot find my my camcorder my small
camcorder so we are gonna be doing an
exhaust system on the truck today and
here's the thing Borla was awesome
enough to sponsor this video by sending
me two exhausts because I couldn't make
up my mind between the s-type or the
attack the attack is significantly
louder than the s-type at least that's
what they say
so we're gonna do today is I'm going to
install the attack first because I
wasn't sure if the attack would be to
attack II of your ears
well let's say NICUs ears and my fist is
the truck we didn't want it to be too
we're gonna kind of take you along for
the ride of taking the stock exhaust out
of the truck which fortunately does not
require any sort of cutting because Ram
unlike other every every other domestic
brand and yes I'm going to call it Ram
because it is its own separate brand
it's no longer actually technically a
dodge they bolted in the exhaust like
the awesome way you should do it rather
than welding everything in so we're
gonna take the stock one out we're gonna
put the attack in first and if that's
too loud after break-in then we'll put
in the s-type which is basically the
exact same procedure so in fact I think
it's only in the muffler section that's
different it's what you say that's
caller into the truck see if the dogs
tether trips us and huh yeah we'll go
from there also - I'll put links in the
description below to the actual exhaust
we're putting in but if you are kind of
just following along its part number one
four zero seven five three BC from Borla
so alright let's open it up
now those are the five inch chips for
her pleasure mm-hmm sup girl
you want help are you gonna help stay
there stay there
no sit down yes no it says Jack does
this one protec as you can see it's two
and a half inch coming out of the
exhaust or out of the muffler and three
inch going in sounds like Chewbacca or
mr. broom makes this down so this is the
stock muffler right here will be
unbolting that flange the two bolt
flange and then it will come out all the
way to the rear we're not gonna get much
spend today with with our helper re so I
could fit under the car tube dude we
could get under the car out lifting it's
the best part I know so obviously the
first thing we have to do is get
ourselves a sound comparison so here is
your stock start up this is not a cold
start by the way
pretty mild
will do
the other thing too though is this
exhaust is supposed to be pretty
anti-drone like drone free which is what
I'm kind of excited to see cuz I want
the noise but not the intrusion you fart
oh man Oh what did you eat this morning
alright so there's a bolt up here in
flange we have to undo because these are
slip at least this one's a slip the
passenger side the driver's side is not
that is a solid piece all the way to the
tip so that's gonna be a bit of a pain
to get out I'm almost feeling like I
wanted to just hacksaw that it's big get
it out
I know I saw we did have to cut but even
the manual said this could make it
easier I like easy
you know this was by way easier than the
first time because we weren't doing it
at 2:00 in the morning as we got the
driver's-side off we cut it we got the
hanger off with a little bit of a PB
Blaster kind of a deal a little spray
lubricant now we were taking off this
tip which gives us just little bit more
room when we're dealing with things it's
just like a it's almost like a V band
here more like a ball-joint ball band
the directions also recommend taking
down the spare and unhooking the end
links we're gonna see if we can do it
without doing that because you know
manuals right around the fact that the
spread this had to spread the lips open
there we go up here on top so a weird
position because instead of the bolt
facing down it's facing up I feel like
they could have flipped this one 180 and
put the bolts on the bottom so it's hard
to get leverage up there but it's a 15
mil take this clamp off then you'll be
able to slide out that pipe and then
because where we cut it there once we
take the muffler hangers down there's
two right here there's also a there's
also a ground strap all right there yeah
make sure we take off the ground strap
too there's also I hang around the front
as you can see there we'll be able to
drop the muffler section down and then
we just follow the instructions for the
Borla
to put the new one back in the biggest
the biggest pain in the ass obviously
are the the factory clamps and that one
being upside down alright so we got the
stock exhaust out and it's just an open
pipe sitting there now we have to do the
obligatory start it without an exhaust
system on there you ready
absolutely that
I like it the question now is what's the
attack gonna do it's gonna bring it down
some right and so maybe I will just
leave the attacking that did yesterday
you got it I did part of what made
getting the stock exhaust off you see
that part right there where it's just
all corroded that's where it's a slip
fitting so that has a bracket just like
this on there with the problem as they
made it so that the bolt was facing up
right against the bottom side of the bed
so we put these back on make sure
they're facing down that way you can
more easily get to them because that's
just it's just a slip joint and that's a
saw one's like a stud and as you can see
it's sort of wedged in there so that
doesn't turn and that's gonna clamp down
but there's no reason to have the nut
facing up just leave it like that
it's like those on otherwise if you go
to put everything in he really clamps
aren't on yeah you're gonna have bad day
that's my junk all right so the muffler
section is in I went ahead bolted it
there put in the ground strap you can
see the muffler section is in the pipes
go over the backs turn it take them
okay the audience don't drop them so you
can see now how that has the pipe set
direct over the axle off to the driver
side and passenger side so that's why
you want to make sure your joints are on
or your your brackets like we have them
so that usually prefers pipes on you can
clamp them down so we're go ahead and go
to the back of the truck now and we'll
show you how the rear section looks
alright so pretty lean back on is really
easy like I said we left everything
lined up in a position we can easily get
to it so you see Nick's finger on that
flange right there we've gotten to it
over the axle with a long extension on
my impact we just snug everything
slightly so it doesn't move cuz you want
to reline the tips yeah this also has
the piece that goes over the actual you
can see it's a two piece two right here
where it bolts on to the exhaust pipe to
the to the end pipes so you can see
we've clamped it there and then it
clamps up there about on the other side
of the differential what you gonna do is
gonna make sure everything's aligned how
you want it you see how we have a lot of
movement in here still
I'll tell Nick that's good and then he
will just tighten everything down so I'm
go ahead and hold this while he tightens
it so it doesn't move and then go ahead
and snug everything down tight so with
the help of a friend we got that snug
down exactly where you want it's got
plenty of room exactly one finger width
all the way around we do the other side
but you can see it's centered it looks
good I have a fairly flush with the
bumper just like that and it's not gonna
when I'm on an off road or in dirt
because I do have taken this trip to the
mountain quite a few times now we're not
gonna bang on the bumper some people
like to tuck it up real tight but then
it starts bouncing around it's gonna hit
things so you want to make sure you have
clearance
now the passenger side is even easier
because it's a single pipe going to that
one clamp that I can't really get a good
angle on there it is right there I can
see it above the so that is where we're
clamping this down I've got this one
sort of adjusted the same as the other
one I'm gonna hold it down nice and
tight it's a little bit left of where I
want it so what I'm gonna do right now
apply some side pressure on the hanger
hold it up where I want it and then
we'll have Nick go ahead and tighten it
down look at my face it's a little dirty
dude I I need a bath all right so the
exhaust is in now I gotta do the same
thing as before we have to do a I look
ridiculous I guess we have to do a start
remote start and then we're gonna do a
rev and see yeah
initial dance it's good
it's like I like the straight and I
like the can back
just leave me open but this is a good
substitute all right I'll go there and
give us an arrest
what okay see you guys go kill it it's
it's loud
alright I look ridiculous I'm filthy we
installed it we didn't use the heat wrap
that comes with it there's they they
basically say he crapped the part where
goes over the axle I didn't do that I
forgot about it to be honest because we
just installed it and played yeah I'll
hang on to the s-type for a little while
just just in case this is the loudest
exhaust they make and as you can see
three idiots installed this one alright
let's take it for a test drive and test
that no drone but if you like pops in
your exhaust you get it with the attack
this truck has the mild hybrid system so
it's gonna turn off right now so the
truck just turned itself off and so
obviously it's zero dB when you get a
red light this is what it sounds like
when it turns back on just a little too
far so far in the cab it's not that
intrusive I just have no idea what it
sounds like out there for everyone else
but we're in here and we're not out
there assess our problem exactly alright
so here is accelerating
I've gotta say the five-seven Hemi has
always sounded good to me it's a good
exhaust note so far though it's not joni
like there's no bass note coming through
here which is kind of nice considering
its a pretty throaty exhaust this is
also it needs to be transmission so it
should be able to keep us well under
resonating yeah it's pretty non
intrusive when you're cruising and
passing
definitely tells people you mean
business tells them you're ready to I
still have a dirty face so anyway yeah
two idiots and a dog were able to
install the Borla attack exhaust system
like I said I'm not behind recep
positive but I'm gonna keep it yet we'll
see depends on how it sounds how it
breaks in it's the loudest one they make
so it only gets less from there the
question is how much quieter is the
s-type I mean Borla has a website that
will show you the kind of like each
sound comparison between the three the
s-type is definitely a good middle
ground of course they have touring which
is the quietest but even touring is
better than stock I just
I've never gotten a complaint about my
Camaro which is way louder than the
truck so I don't think I'd have an issue
with the truck necessarily and I think
you find the tone is amazing the
five-seven Hemi sounds great it always
has and now it sounds like a man's truck
has been a man's truck he just made it
many manlier like he gave it the extra
inch of beard that it needed and the IPA
alright guys like I said link down the
description below to learn more about it
and I guess follow on instagram at JS
two cents so at there huh oh there's an
Hat that's where they copy Twitter yeah
so JC's two cents on Twitter and
Instagram I'll talk more about it there
and whether or not I go to the s-type or
not alright guys thanks for watching and
as always we'll see you in the next one
