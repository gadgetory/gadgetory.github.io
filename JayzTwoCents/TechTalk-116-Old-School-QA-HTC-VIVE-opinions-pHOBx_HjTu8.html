sense how does things sound I I didn't I
didn't even do like a an audio test or
any of that any of that crap I was just
like you know what this is how so he
used to do it back in the day when it
was just me um yeah barnacles out again
not a sick something and I'll be yeah
he's out so it's just me and for that I
kind of apologize it's just me cuz yeah
Mike quality is even shit or not Mike
but camera quality is even crap right
now so anyway I got a few things I want
to talk about some graphics cards stuff
again and I kind of like it when I do it
this way because I want to wear
headphones that's I don't like wearing
headphones my head get sweaty it makes
my hair all flat I need a haircut by the
way but whatever so as we're going to do
wanna talk about a few things as you
guys if you guys follow on the social
medias which you should be in everyone's
always like I don't want to follow on
Twitter but then those are the people
that are always like junior you're gonna
do a video about this but you would know
if you're on twitter because i am a
twitter slut it's the only way to its
that's the reality at all anyway so
weird a few things to Alex I want talk
about the vibe because I've seen plenty
of vibe demos but the thing about the
vibe in my in my opinion is it's more
than just putting on a headset and then
trying it out all right the the total
user experience is going to be what's it
like to set it up how much horsepower
does it really take to run and all that
that's kind of the whole user experience
it's one thing to walk in someplace
where they've already calibrated it and
set up the room and you just put it on
in there perfect you know scenario and
then it's another thing to set this up
yourself like it in a home you got
things you got to worry about like and
yes guys I know I haven't shaven you're
done anything literally all day been
playing with the vibe so um yeah i mean
i can in in my upstairs family room i
have here there's a there's an overhead
fan that obviously I've constantly got
to be concerned about feel like sticking
my hands up and
at sea I want to talk about that kind of
stuff and then I want to talk about
graphics cards again we always talk
about graphics cards people asking about
the 480 yeah it's right here I can show
you that tea there it is but i gotta i
gotta go ahead and roll that intro so
here it goes I don't have anyone to sing
the intro song and I don't want to sing
I can but I don't wanna tell me if this
mike is peeking or anything like that I
think I've got a pretty well tuned my
little meter over there it's just under
the yellow and stuff I know the pop
filter yet so hopefully it's not all
popping oh look I put the wrong thing
you up there yeah there we go single
camera that's what we want so Hobbs will
top is my moderator in here he got
pissed him off you deal with him got it
he deal with him not me I'm not gonna
ban people I'm gonna let I'm gonna let
the people I've set to ban people banned
people right now everyone's job is to go
into the Twitter's and tell everyone on
your social media tell your mom your
grandma your girlfriend your boyfriend
your girlfriend and your boyfriend tell
your wife and your wife's boyfriend
whoever that we're streaming let's get
in here because I don't do that I always
forget to do that I start these streams
up I've been doing this for four years
now and you would think that you would
think that it would be easier to get
this going and have like a routine but
no I don't um all right let's see here
we are live yeah we're live and
unfortunately leaking my friend skype my
bad sorry guy rip okay we are live right
now oh okay talk and we're going to talk
about tech because I don't got Barney
please here making me go off track all
the time and make me late and stuff
that's okay we weren't late last week
though because remember i started it
without him and then he came in cuz he
it of course it's like 49 seconds to
live stream and he's like I gotta go pee
Brubeck oh my god anyway here is the RX
480 already talked about that it's you
know what's really sad is I showed this
and I went hey guys look it's my rx for
ED and you know how many people were
like oh my god are you gonna make a
video it's like smash my face with the
thing hey anyway yes obviously I'm
making a video about it um this guy came
in today I've already showed this a
bunch this thing right here it's almost
as big as my junk just say but anyway
this is the 1080 amp extreme edition and
if you want to see size-wise compared to
this this this right here I'm trying to
hit the mic but check this out guys I
can touch the mic and it doesn't kill
your ears right that's cool huh because
the cable doesn't make that noise
anymore so this right here is the EVGA
1080s see this is a founders board right
it's so the dimensions of this guy is
the same as a founders card so to give
you a perspective of how big that is
yeah that's just like hey you know what
I got I got a small pecker back our big
GPU no no it's not that bad but it's
it's a triple slot card it takes up
three slots in your graphics card in
your motherboard so if you have a
motherboard that require a slot spacing
be single slot so they have to be
sandwiched then you could not actually
put two of these in there anyway yeah
this thing is huge it also takes to ten
or two to ten pin plug that's it no it
takes to UM 8 pin power on there I have
no idea what to expect to this the
amount of the amount of heat pipes in
there oh my god I don't know it's like 1
2 3 4 5 6 like 60 pipes or something
like that so I'm really interested to
see how far this goes of course you see
rumors all the time it was like oh my
god the amp extreme guaranteed to hit
two point two gigs or 2.3 gigs or 6.2
gigawatts I don't even know um to be
honest I haven't even looked at that but
i'm pretty sure that it's got lights
everywhere i'm pretty sure that these
all light up on there on the top right
here lights up yeah
so anyway give you a little size
comparison yeah they're very hits right
there there's there's no making that up
that's just so big in terms of PCB the
PCB is let's see it's nearly as long as
the entire length of that cooler it goes
to right there like right there my
fingernail is is the PCB so it's not one
of those things where we're like on the
RX 480 here you can see how you know an
extra third of the card right there
third of the link or quarter the link is
the extended cooler so it could pull an
error from both sides as you can see but
this PCB is actually really small let's
just compare the PCB size of this guy to
the 480 then let's let's take the cooler
out of it and look at the PCD difference
there yeah that's pretty crazy so when I
open this up I knew it was big huh
ladies I knew it was big was that the
third dick joke already were only seven
minutes in this is just like classic
tech talk right here um I had seen
paul's coverage on this at computex I
saw Kyle's everyone went to zou tax
booth this was like one of the this is
kind of one of the cards that people
have been waiting on cuzzo tag has a
pretty good history with the epic stream
line of graphics cards so everyone's
been waiting on that fun fact this was
actually the first review I had lined up
I had already had communication with
zotac and set this review in motion back
at the nvidia event in austin texas back
in May but it took them longer to get
this card released as you guys probably
know everybody is taking forever to get
their cards out so it's unfortunately
not first in my lineup but I'm excited
to see how far it can go and the reason
why I'm looking forward to this card is
because I put two gtx ten 70s in the the
simulator / VR rig I kind of repurposed
the the computer that I had built just
for the racing simulator to be now my VR
simulator because that's in the same
family / game room that I have up there
for you know doing gaming and VR and I
did two 7210 70s in that and
unfortunately project cars is not
working properly with VR
in sli cool yeah big surprise that right
sli issues so I'm just like you know
what screw it i'm just going to go with
1 1080 and if that one's like super
powerful then that's fine with me but we
will be moving into QA here pretty soon
i'm only gonna be streaming for an hour
because i've got to clean up the living
room up there actually did cable
channeling our channel cable cable
channeling whatever wire channeling so
that i could hide the wires on the wall
to make it look nice because married and
if it looks like an eyesore then the
wife isn't happy and you don't have a
happy wife you don't have a heavy life
and if you're married you know that but
anyway if you guys want to start getting
your questions in you can do things like
at hashtag ask tech talk on twitter that
you can also use a comment section here
which is not going to be easy because of
how much it flies by and then even
though jerry is not here the exact same
policy regarding donations is in place
look in the description if you guys are
interested on how to how that actually
works I see a lot of people every week
going I don't see the donate button it
is controlled by region so if you live
in like Germany and other places where
for whatever reason like the laws there
are you can't donate money to people
then you can't the buttons not there so
unless you're on a VPN or something like
that you can't really circumvent that so
anyway what that said have ice Tony
James says have you seen the dream
screen yet I have no idea what that is
so I'm gonna say no no um the vibe I
want to move into that setting it up is
actually pretty easy I'm dealing with
where when I did the room setup it
warned me that that my sensors might be
a little too far apart because the room
is kind of big and I even sort of
partitioned off the room so that only
part of it is used for VR so I might
have to move one of the sensors closer
so far hasn't seemed to have any
tracking issues but it just it warned me
but I've been playing project cars on it
most because it's it's the one game in
my library that's kind of like already
set up where literally I could just open
up steam VR launch project cars and it
was ready what was happening with SLI
was it was flickering holy cow
when my daughter cries she sounds like a
banshee um you guys can't hear that
anyway what happened to Jerry he died
anyway um so yeah that what was
happening is if you guys have seen vibe
you can actually virtual desktop not
like virtual desktop like you know today
where you just log in from another
computer or Nexus another desktop it's
literally virtual desktops you look
around a floating room and it's it it's
your desktop and it's floating it's
really cool so you can look at what you
want and it has a crosshair and then you
can use the controller's to activate
things or you can use the mouse if you
want whenever I would launch project
cars the project cars screen inside of
the VR would start flickering like
really bad like strobe strobe effect
kind of thing and I was going what the
heck is going on all of my VR experience
has been fine if I took off the headset
and looked on the monitor it was smooth
as could be no flickering but in the
head said it was flickering so I just
did a quick search on reddit yeah
believe it i did a surgeon it brought me
to read it and i'm seeing a lot of
people complaining about that and
apparently right now project cars in VR
with sli is is buggy which kind of sucks
so that's why I'm going back to one GPU
but what I love about when I built this
simulator rig last year and then took it
apart and then put it back again
together again when I move this year the
concept of it was I had done I did the
surround screens to get me by but what
what I really wanted was an oculus or
some sort of VR because i had seen
Jerry's video two years ago of the
oculus SDK with I racing and it looked
amazing from his experience but the
problem was it was a 1080p you know lens
and it or screen you know but with
blends and the screen door effect was
really really bad even though the vibe
is 1440 there's still screen door but
it's not that it's not that bad it's
really not it's just you take 1440 and
you stick it against your face you're
going to get some some screen door
effect but it's so much better than
surround panels because even though
you've got multiple panels set up on a
racing simulator it's still flat there's
no depth perspective so when you drive
if you want to know what it's kind of
like driving on a racing simulator with
flat what you know with screens if
you've never been on a racing simulator
try going outside and driving with an
eye patch and one eye covered and
everything's flat perspective there's no
depth yeah I should don't recommend that
you do that to be honest let me take
that back I didn't say do that put on an
eye patch or Tippett close one I put
tape on it something I just go walk
around your house try playing catch with
someone I guarantee it's going to like
the balls going to smack you in the face
you're the balls are going to be against
your face just like that you know take
it how you will because with two eyes
you have a depth per set up perspective
depth perception yes and that's why you
have two eyes so that you can see how
far away something as I can see this
mike is about one-third the distance
between me and the monitor but if I
cover one eye it's like I can't tell how
far away it is because no matter what
perspective I look at it it's
one-dimensional racing simulators are
the same way and so once you put on the
vibe or any sort of VR headset you look
at it and it's like there's depth you
can see how far away the turn is coming
up you can look around you know you
could change your whole perspective in
the car if you take your head and you
lean it out the window in the game you
are leaning your head out the window and
you're looking at your car it's really
really really weird if you stop your car
or even if you don't stop it you just
stand up in your seat your head goes
through the roof and you're looking down
like an out like a outside perspective
it's really it's really realistic and so
I I had a lot of issues with was
surrounds via our surround gaming with
the racing sim where it was fun but it
was still sim Katie no matter what its
realism was just negated by the fact
that you're looking at flat screens so
once you put on the headset it's a whole
new perspective and that one game alone
is one of the things that made me really
want a vibe because like i said i built
the simmering for that purpose it just
vr wasn't it wasn't retail ready last
year when it built it so it's pretty
neat at e3 even the thrustmaster booth
did had they had VR setup but i think
that PlayStation VR
set up and they were doing yeah pretty
sure it was PlayStation that they were
doing gran turismo but whatever they had
a set of course a setup for PC but it
wasn't a br so yeah that was fun the
wife who's never experienced VR ever I
didn't know if she was going to be
sensitive or sick vr in the beginning
made me feel like like crap quite
honestly and so because of that the I
didn't know if she was gonna be
sensitive or feel nauseous or whatever
but it's really good she went through
the whole VR set up demo thing and she
didn't have any issues whatsoever she
was having fun in fact she was like wow
this is cool she was making balloons pop
and all that stuff so I'm looking
forward to I'm looking forward to
invidious funhouse being launched
because I think Little J will have fun
with that that's just a bunch of
carnival games but it's not out yet and
that's what kind of sucks about having
the vibe right now is it's still
bleeding edge and what that means is
there's not a lot available for it yet
so it's an eight-hundred-dollar headset
and so you spend 800 bucks on that and
hopefully of a system it's all ready for
you already and then it's like okay what
am I going to play there's demos and a
couple of games that's it so it's going
to take some time see what happens
fortunately though at e3 just about
everyone that was demoing or displaying
some sort of VR was saying that's gonna
be available on both oculus and vive and
Playstations VR come as a PlayStation 3
or Samsung Sony something I don't know
there's another VR headset out there
that's coming up and I forget what it is
I think it's placed playstation sony hvr
but they're gonna be available on both
which is a big deal because the i think
it would be just so bad to have an
eight-hundred-dollar headset that is
dealing with exclusivity like consoles I
mean that would really suck right it's
like you buy a vibe or let's say you buy
an oculus an oculus but vive is just
dominating the market because they're
actually shipping units and suddenly you
have an oculus and it's always like
exclusively provide it
exclusively for vive and exclusives
don't do anybody any good console or not
it's always going to be the way it is
but anyway so with that said let's go
ahead and move into QA if you guys any
donation questions that get sent using
the link in the description will
guaranteed to get answered but moving
forward here I'm going to go ahead and
move over to Twitter so let me get that
up over here see we got onion you can
use hashtag ask tech talk all one word
ask tech top I see people like ask tech
talk and then the number I've seen a
bunch of hashtags use that are just not
correct so anyway Tanner Locklear says
do you think an r 9 380 run VR smoothly
with Triple A games in lowest settings
at all I don't know I don't know some
very powerful GPU and it takes quite a
bit of GPU power to maintain that
magical 90 hurts I don't know the
science behind it I can I can just tell
you that whoever the mad scientists are
behind generating VR and and developing
for it and creating VR have said that 90
hurts is that that magic number where
where nausea nausea or whatever vertigo
and all that stuff tends to kind of go
away so 90 90 hurts is were or 90 FPS
technically is what many Hertz is going
to be refresh as long as those frames
are consistently timed and not
stuttering that's the number you want
and I the question have to ask yourself
is can and r9 380 generate that image
twice at 1440p one for each eye at that
frame rate and not stutter I don't think
so so I doubt it Damon breck heimer are
you planning to go to way or through way
sli would GTA GT x 1080 and skunk works
so i have three cards but i think i'm
only going to install two of them
because nvidia is has still not
finalized plans on how they're going to
deal with sli they came up with the
enthusiast key and then they dropped it
and now they're like well we'll do three
way but it's only going to work in
benchmarking sweet apps and it's up to
the developers to code for three way if
they want to do it in dx12 dx12 right
now and SLI is already like
some stuff is not working very good like
Tomb Raider in sli and dx12 is fubar'd
I've thrown tomb raider I've been doing
SLI 1070 and 1080 testing and I through
tomb raider out I'm like you know what
rise of the Tomb Raider I'm not using it
because dx12 doesn't work I say it
doesn't work it's buggy and when I go to
dx11 and enable SLI SLI doesn't work in
dx12 on the rise of the Tomb Raider The
Mummy goat dx12 are dx11 great results
for both 4k and 1440 but once i go to
1080i get i was getting 30 FPS less with
210 80s and I was with one so SLI
scaling for 24 for Kennedy isn't working
and I don't think it has anything to do
with a bottleneck because I would have
at least expected to see the same FPS it
was getting with a single card if it
were truly a cpu bottleneck so I don't
know I threw it out um young gun says
how well does he HB SLI bridge work wait
for my video and let's just put it this
way my findings were what was the word I
used because I've reached out to both or
I reached out to Nvidia and then I
reached out to Nvidia through EVGA
because I wasn't getting any answers and
my findings were inconclusive on whether
or not there's a tangible noticeable
improvement and my video I use a single
flex bridge and then I test all the all
my amusing synthetics right now like
built-in benchmarks rather than free
gaming and moving my mouse around and
stuff because we're dealing with such a
small percentage of difference here that
if the test isn't on a track where it's
exactly the same every time I can't get
consistent results on the experience so
I'm not I'm not like using free roam
gaming to to measure the FPS i'm using
things that are on a track like i'm
gonna be using the divisions built-in
bench mark obviously things like fire
strike heaven and all that stuff to see
if there's truly any sort of difference
and what we're going to be doing here is
using a single flex bridge to see if you
know our baseline readings and then
using a
hard bridge like the EVGA LED bridge I
got have here in skunk works and then
using mean excuse me and then using the
nvidia HB bridge and i have any EVGA 12
to see if there's a tangible difference
i'm going to add one more test in there
and i'm going to use to flex bridges to
see because you know if you use a flex
bridge and you stick it in you stick it
in you stick it in the graphics cards
then the nvidia control panel warns you
like hey you're not using the right kind
of bridge but when you use a standard
hard bridge not an HP bridge that
warning goes away by the way so i want
to test that up Tim AAA says thoroughly
impressed with EVGA customer service
takes two weeks to send stuff to
California but they're accommodating as
hell two weeks wow where you were you at
um and see here am i planning to upgrade
my camera to 4k or 60 FPS etc why why do
we need why do i why do I need to make
talking 4k talking head videos I'm not
planning on spending money to give 60
FPS blah blah blah videos because that's
just I mean it's not high action or
motion or whatever and 4k my internet
sucks where I'm at I know and I know 60
x 42 some people are like that doesn't
suck it sucks when I had 30 by what I
had 300 x 25 so I'm not going to render
4k videos and make it take four hours to
upload I'm not it's not that important
to me um do you think Pascal prices will
go down soon for manufacturers versions
not founders no i don't i don't think
price is gonna change until a new card
is out pricing is fucked up with nvidia
this time around and it's just the way
it is it sucks has your client for red
miss gotten 1080s yet yes he has he
already has them in hand um please talk
about how is it i already did that hey
Jay do you think that the 10 ATT i will
have h BM to or even exist I don't know
we just got the 10 80s it's not like 10
a TTI is really a subject right now of
course people like like
WTF check her like the TMZ of tech are
are always going to report on that sort
of stuff because they want the clicks
but I don't know what the actual I don't
know that I don't know if the leaks are
true or not and I don't talk about leaks
I never have in the three and a half
years I've almost four years I've had
this channel not going to start now
Kenny Clem's Clem's says too much tech I
know right now how about cars talk about
cars I just got my CSF a triple row race
radiator installed on my car so summer
heat here where I'm at no longer going
to be any sort of a concern Michael wha
Jia Jia wajdi liya aur jo Delia what is
the history of your cars guys why do you
love them so much how did you decide to
get them well actually goes back to june
sixteenth okay I'll answer that you know
that was two weeks ago right is that
knows week ago a math is hard I just
always liked cars I don't know it's just
something that it's like the same reason
why you're into tech is because it just
speaks to you and cars are the same
thing for me how do you choose cars well
that's a hard as a hard one this is when
i got my 350 last year with my first
time owning a Z and I took a chance to
see if I would like it and I did that's
why I got the 370 now because I wanted
the better one could I go back to a
single screen 1080p 60 if I had to
that's what's on the rig right the
simulator rig right now because when I
hooked up the vibe I had to use HDMI one
of my panels over there was using HDMI
so I unhooked the two on the side so I
just have the one 24 inch 60 1080 in the
in the middle yeah I couldn't go back to
that day to day I couldn't I'm just too
used to big high-density real estate
like lots of screen space because of all
the editing and stuff that I do so it's
one of those things where it's kind of
like you get so used to something it's
not easy to just go back it's really not
um let's see here okay evan watson says
for a pc where I won't have to upgrade
the cpu for about five years do you
think it's worth it to get a 6850 k over
the 6800 k um five years kind of a long
time
but if you wanna if you want to if you
want the computer to last five years
without feeling like it's dated then you
need to get the best that you can afford
so whatever that is and if you could
afford even higher than a 6850 k do it
maybe like 6930 said the new ones called
whatever our canim luminaria meeeeee
says considering a black magic deck
links to do 4k and an elgato HD 60 pro
card for live stream with two cameras
your opinion I've been thinking about
doing the capture card for camera on
livestream like this because then I
could use like my FDR ax 33 which is a
technically I work a camera but I could
get a better camera for the live stream
but the problem is because I'd have to
use an interface like the elgato even a
little bit of lag is going to be
noticeable you guys can see right now
even though I'm rendering from a webcam
on the same machine there's still like a
weird audio sync and I've had to delay
the image about a hundred milliseconds
to try and seek it up with audio but the
problem is it's not consistent it
flutters around a little bit I once you
add an elgato like that then you're
adding even more tuning that has to take
place between the audio and the video if
you're willing to do all that for the
sake of better video on a live screen
lifes remember any livestream you stream
to twitch you stream or I guess
technically streaming is as you see you
stream still around that we became
twitch hitbox whatever they're all going
to super compress they're going to
compress uh the the video signal and
stuff to quality that's probably not
going to be indicative of what you're
capturing so that's going to be up to
you let's see here
um Tanner luckily I already answered
that didn't I I found grilled so hard
thanks for answering oh you're welcome
no fangirl fanboys find um fangirl i'm
planning to goods Sassa societies i'm
planning to go for a g1 gtx 960 for
gigabyte for a new build for gaming
engineering and around 1100 any better
recommendations well if you if you want
to do engineering on it like we're gonna
be using cad you're going to want to go
with something better than 960 i mean
even if you got something like an old
780ti that would do better than 960
especially if your CAD programs are
going to be able to tap in any of that
CUDA power moose 78 says I have one 980
TI classy at the moment single 1080 for
the win or a 92 ti classified in sli
which would be better upgrade opinion
right now or option I know you have a
single 980 TI classy at the moment
singleton Amy for the win well a single
1080 is much faster than 980 ti ti
classified in sli is going to be much
faster than a 1080 and you could get
another 984 cheaper than a 1080 will
cost you may be about the same you'd
have to add to get a second one as you'd
have to add after selling a 980 to get a
TI attending so unless you need pascal's
improvements in VR capability vr
surround things like simultaneous multi
projection which is supposed to be the
fix for the flatness of three panels if
you don't need any additional tech then
I stick with your older card the
advancements of Pascal with the
exception of just being like really fast
FPS usually much higher than refresh
rates is going to be pretty much negated
by the fact that if unless you're using
those additional text for VR which is in
there then you're really you're really
just for the sake of having bragging
rights to be like I've got the latest
and greatest are not going to see much
of a return on your investment i don't
think it's but that's kind of the way I
look at it every time a new graphics
card comes out flying now flying j 99
and says can you remind us what utility
you are using for overlay temp and
p.s display its afterburner its built-in
it's called on-screen display OSD you
got to turn it on in the monitoring tab
and then you check which ones you want
to monitor how does the RX for you stack
up to everyone else you just gotta wait
for the reviews no one's going to tell
you that right now it's under NDA 3
1080p monitors or to 1444 gaming why
would you you wouldn't use to because if
you tell nvidia to span the display with
two panels it's going to make the middle
where the bezels are so it would
literally be like the middle where the
bezels meet is the middle of the screens
that's where your crosshairs is going to
be is where your guns are going to be
whatever your whatever you do that's a
terrible idea so how about one 1440p and
get an ultra-wide like a 34 40 x 1440
like i'm using here amazing it's the
it's the it's such a better experience
than dealing with surround in my opinion
because the problem was surround is your
counting on software to like stitch the
panels together and then to do it
seamlessly so it fools the operating
system into thinking it's one panel but
it's not and it I've done it in the past
I've had it on the same rig too it's
it's finicky it's switching to and from
games where you have a stretch desktop
and then going into a game where it's
got to kind of load the game and launch
directx right hook the API and then it's
got to render the image sometimes you
have one screen that will turn off and
doesn't want to come back on you have to
power it off powered on and then it will
show up same thing when you leave the
game sometimes you go into a game and
come back out and it rearranged all your
icons no matter how you set them up and
rearrange it it's just enough problems
with surround which is why although
multi projection of simultaneous multi
projection is kind of neat that they've
started to really kind of play around
with the multi-panel issues I've had
such a difficult time with it that I
don't want to go back to it regardless
of the updates
Warren Hyman says Jay if I upgrade my
mobo will it see my hard drive depends
so the operating system is a lot better
now at detecting hardware changes for
instance I took the hard drives out of
the simulator rig put them into a
different computer and the motherboard
initially set up set up all the devices
reboots and then everything worked took
took it out put it back in the other
machine same thing it just worked but
that depends and I can't even tell you
what it depends on sometimes it doesn't
work and it just doesn't want to
sometimes you get a UEFI boot failure
where it can't load into the windows
UEFI and the up met and the bios just
can't make heads or tails of booting the
hard drive so good luck that's all I can
say jason says hey cool name he says do
you think two three sixty millimeter
radiators will be enough for a 58 20 k
and two gtx 1080s absolutely gtx 1080 is
extremely efficient when it comes to
heat and I know a lot of people right
now we're going to are like what the f
are you talking about man the 1080 it's
all over the news that an ad has heating
problems you know last night when I was
building the computer for the simulator
I put 29 ATT is in there reference cards
and I forgot just how hot and how loud
the Maxwell cards are the big the big
GPUs are compared to what the TVs are
now and I immediately realized you know
what the 10 80s although yeah they still
will get up to 83 see obviously where
the reference cooler is a heck of a lot
more efficient and when it comes to heat
and temperature than the 980 TI is were
so that's why I took them out and put
the 10 70s in because yeah I forgot just
how loud they were coconut monkey was in
the room watching Game of Thrones and it
was like every time I turn on a
benchmark to get the cards dial dings I
was overclocking them it's just they
were so freaking loud that I was like
yeah I'm not going to use these so you
play radiator space there
rah Ryan hey heiser ryan hauser says
heard anything about the msi gtx 1080
Seahawk nope haven't Tom Don need onion
says what was your first car or your
most memorable favorite car you've ever
owned my favorite car is nizzy my first
car was a 1985 ford ranger 5-speed with
fuel injection which is actually kind of
a big big deal because that was like the
first year that Ford had introduced the
fuel injection into the four cylinders
so it was kind of neat anyway it's kind
of it's kind of nice actually that
there's no donation comments coming in
because now I don't have to worry about
like dividing my attention my attention
feels equally divided let's will let
Twitter rest here for a minute and we'll
just check out some of the comments here
in in the chat rest in peace Jerry you
will not be missed well that's rude
that's not a reference cooler it's a
founder cooler oh excuse me you are
absolutely right you're absolutely right
once a semi 980 TI for by a 1080 for
1080p is it worth it play please answer
me I need answer tonight that's a
terrible idea it's a terrible idea to
get a 1080 for 1080p if you're not
running a super-high refresh like 144
hurts or more it's not a good idea and
especially if you're trying to replace a
980 would say was 980 TI yeah that's a
terrible idea 4k ultra wide will be
awesome you know what so when 4k started
like two years ago everyone's like 4k 4k
4k and it was one of those things where
uh so Hobbs will toss says I think your
donation buttons gone no it's not I
clicked it I should donate to myself huh
yeah anyway um the problem with 4k was
even 4k 60 Hertz didn't feel like 60
Hertz on 1440 or 1080p
it was hard to explain it just felt and
I was even having this conversation with
AMD the other day for k60 feels heavy I
don't how to explain it it feels like
there's a slight amount of input lag and
it just it didn't feel fluid even though
it was 60 FPS which is that magic number
so now that 4k is going to be capable
with 120 Hertz if that input lag is gone
and if we can get 4k ultra wide would be
perfect for a like you know even movies
and stuff I might be sold on that as
long as I can experience it okay let's
see here at Logan Jay don't like rumors
I don't want to report on rumors I
there's enough people out there doing
rumors tonight I'm just I don't know I I
don't like to fuel rumor mills if that
makes sense call me weird i don't know
1074 1080p to monitor 60 Hertz maybe
1440p in the near future or should just
get a 9 80 or 90 TI that's a lot of
questions like should i get a ten
seventy or check out a 1080i so you got
to 42 1440p or show you to 1080 or show
get a 980 oh she's got an idea you got
to ask like one question dude 1080 sli
versus it went away my bed okay um sir
poll what damn I you know YouTube does
this thing where the comments will
freeze for a second and I'll start to
read something and then it Scrolls away
really fast and I can't find where it
was so whatever sorry guys
a moderators telling me that the
donation system seems to be down I don't
know I've never actually followed I've
never actually like followed the links
to see where they go to be honest with
you okay aztec talk what do you think
about razors VR solution Oh SVR okay so
i tried o sv r when it was like brand
new it's CES 2015 and I didn't like it I
did not like it at all it didn't track
very well see you had to do this with
your hands like all the time because it
was supposed to be hand tracking and it
was like not tracking my hands and it
was laggy and I didn't like it but that
was two years ago so I don't know
whether or not uh it's gotten better but
based on the like very early models I
didn't like it that was one of the
reasons why I just wasn't even happy
about oculus revivals like whatever vr
is so terrible then not anymore it's
changed yeah if you guys if you guys did
donate we apologize right now because my
moderator and Jerry is saying that they
tried it right now to see what was
happening and it's not coming through so
if it took your money and it didn't come
through I highly apologize for that
that's the problem with YouTube YouTube
a Mountie YouTube's I feel weird I don't
claim him VR all day so my my is this
real life this is really happening right
now coming on Zen nearing um so okay
when I had my my my meeting with AMD the
other day I asked that question I said
are we still on track to see maybe some
q4 q1's end stuff and all I did was
smile and then say they couldn't answer
so I don't know you know well time
stamps come on tech talk I don't have
anybody to go through a time stamp it
for me and I'm I don't timestamp as I'm
going
probably not hiboo says hey Jay what
case would be good for full custom water
cooling loop I have coolermaster stacker
but I'm looking for an update I'm
running 12 40 rat and a 360 most cases
today would would accommodate that
fantex has a very good line of cases
built specifically towards water cooling
fractal design / like the last year and
a half or so has really started
accommodating larger radiators more
options for mounting radiators and even
reservoirs so like the define s is
actually a really good case for water
cooling in fact I might be moot I might
move all my stuff into the define desk
because I still have that i'm using the
fractal arc XL right now is the gaming /
VR rig but it's too big I need something
smaller and easier to move around
something about moving it into that case
and I'm think about also doing a full
custom water loop on it once i get the
hardware i want like completely ironed
out if you will any info the mayhem
problems they're waiting on me they're
waiting on me right now and i want i
just want to get this fluid plenty of
time to change this is where it is right
now yeah it looks red it's actually
orange it's just the camera you can see
how different the color of the tops are
versus the fluid but yeah it looks red
but it's not trust me it's just the way
the camera picks it up also to the white
leds tend to bring out a lot of the red
dye that makes up orange they look like
they're the same color right and yeah I
know that both my reservoirs are not
topped off I just never bothered took my
tie fighter again if i do that i get the
condensation out there yeah i just never
bother filling it up because this was
temporary they look like they haven't
changed color right but they have
actually I i took the the mix that I
made because I still have like that much
of a gallon like in the bottom of a
gallon container of the mix that was not
in here and I compared it and yeah these
are both much much darker than the color
was originally so here i was looking at
this going dim these are not changing
color what the frig is happening then I
compared them like
okay well i just both change color like
at the same rate so that's where we are
on that so i need to well try not to get
sick sorry having to get the cable out
of the way so i'm going to be sending
that off too mayhems in England to
inspect i'll also be giving some of the
fluid to hardware labs to inspect i'm
also going to be giving the radiators
back i'm going to give one of the
radiators to Mayhem's so that they can
do a metallurgy test and then i'm going
to be giving one to hardware lab so all
the players involved are getting pieces
of the pie or the puzzle and then we're
just going to see what happens I really
really hope we don't end up with one
company just pointing their fingers at
the other because that won't get us
anywhere but I do know that even though
that even though Mayhem's hasn't gotten
the fluid yet that they had been working
on improvements in their own lab testing
with high heat because one of the things
that we think is contributed to this but
it's not the leading cause but just the
contribution to the issue is the heat
with three Titan X's and then having the
V RMS and overclocked and all that stuff
in the loop so they've been testing it
with their own like super high heat test
rigs with no fans on the radiators
intentionally making it super hot and
they're trying to come up with a better
product which is a very good thing um
coconut monkey just texted me and said
he's gonna come over tonight and play
with VR yay coconut monkeys actually
been here like all week I like when it's
summer because then he doesn't have
school monday through friday and then
work saturday sunday 370z pros and cons
i'd really love to know that okay hey
we'll do we'll talk about cars for a
minute here for the next couple minutes
and remember i'm getting out of here
about six o'clock so i apologize again
if your donations have if they took your
money and they didn't display the
donations to me I highly apology in fact
um Hobbs when you tried to donate did it
take your money or did it fail because I
want to know if people are donating here
and I'm not seeing it because that's
fucked up YouTube seriously
audio-technica sounds good so I pulled a
lot of bass I'll get back to the 350z
comment I pulled a lot of bass out of it
because when I first had it subwoofer
users yeah
rest in peace I had the base cranked I
was like I wanted to get that that FM
radio sound boom ba-ba-boom ba-ba but
then you know that's way too much bass
so I dialed it back to like that right
there that's one of the reasons why i
don't use USB mics and i like to use a
ups like that because al funny bone
because i can um i can actually tune it
so alright 350z pros and cons one it's
old but the con it's an old car the
newest one you can get would be a 2008
which is already going to be eight years
old at this point um I don't I don't
know what's happened here okay so Hobbs
is saying it wouldn't take his money but
some people are saying that it did I
sorry guys youtube has has not notified
us of a single donation so if you have I
apologize for that on behalf of Google I
on behalf of Google we're a sack of shit
there I said it I'm a sack of shit to
what you guys are another okay 350z it's
at least eight years old for 2008 2007
and eight are the HR model which is the
two best years of 350z so if we can get
an HR are no 702 I know a you're golden
the transmissions from 2003-2005 had
synchro problems lots of synchros going
bad 2006 they fixed it 2006 stay away
from that year all together at had
what's known as the rev up motor and
that was where they made an intake
plenum change to get the engine revving
a little bit higher to about 7,000 rpm
up from 6500 those were the worst it was
only available for one year and there's
a reason for that that one year they
warrantied more motors than they ever
had in the history of the 350z of the
z33 because of oil consumption all v qs
burn oil but the rev up motor the rev up
the 2006 rev up which was only available
on the manual transmissions by the way
the that the automatics did not get the
rev up so a little fun fact when when i
went with TJ to buy his 350 and it was
an 06 everything checks out it's a good
car but i jokingly said i think he made
a huge mistake to his camera that's what
i was referring to y'all's like
revit motor but as long as he keeps his
eye on the oil he'll be fine but yeah so
oil consumption was a problem with those
um they take a lot of I know they're
kind of slow by today's standards 350z s
are not fast at all I mean you've got
you've got some four-door sedans that
are going to be faster than you but they
handle really well so if you want a car
that handles good that's a pro
aftermarket parts for them depending on
what you go with can be either cheap and
like showcar ready or expensive and
track ready and you'll find a lot of
knockoff part so you got to spend your
time doing your research on the parts
and whether or not they are knock off or
not like control arms you'll see a lot
of people's breaking lower like rear
camber arms I'm sorry you don't want a
camber aren't busting on you on the
freeway that's going to be a terrible
day so yeah insurance on them is pretty
low because most insurance companies
look at them as just a standard v6 and
not a performance car which is kind of
funny because it is a sports car safely
with the 370z because it's not my daily
driver I don't get a pail Ike
ninety-eight dollars a year for full
coverage on that car but it's not my
daily driver it's a third vehicle so
that's another reason why but they're
fun cars they really aren't you can get
them for less than ten thousand dollars
if you shop around if you want to spend
that much on a eight plus year old cars
if you got a two thousand three guys 13
years old so that's that's a lot of
money anyway um why i no see skyline
popping up why I know since I skyline
poppy-up wait time out wait time out
skyline r32 is are available here in the
united states now that's fun hey Jay do
you think it's good to buy a gaming
laptop or should I wait for the 10 ATM
and you have any idea when that will
come out have no idea probably in the
next two or three months of the most
gaming laptops I'm going to be doing a
review of the EVGA SC 17 I have it I've
had it for about a month now but that
but laptops is something I want to
spend time with before doing a review on
it I want to use it in real-world
scenario I traveled with the Seattle um
I want to use it in all the real words
now it's not be like here's a laptop I
don't put it on my desk play some games
and talk about it no what's it really
like is it heavy what's the recharge
time like what's the heat like what's
the battery life like you know did it
leave me stranded in a meeting because i
forgot to bring my plug in that kind of
thing so i want to talk about all that
but gaming laptops for the most part
tend to kind of be seen i think amongst
most people as being gimmicky only
because the m series of GPUs i'm not
very powerful and so a lot of people
tend to look at gaming laptops as being
like we slap some LEDs on their we put
an M series 960 in there which is not a
very powerful GPU at all and we're going
to charge two thousand dollars for it
because it's gaming and it has discrete
graphics I think that's how a lot of
people tend to look at them so it's
going to be a difficult review because I
think a lot of people hate the concept
of gaming laptops no oh let's see I like
cars me too Ram Jacinto jacinta ram yes
until one hurts monitor for the win okay
um we dropped fifty-seven frames those
weird sorry bout that guys hey Jay are
you so i left the sim rig on it bet you
it's trying to download something right
now i can update dammit thoughts on the
razor court never touched it 29 70s
versus one 1070 so tired of us a lot
issues then get one 1070 you already
hansard your own question Jay please
answer alex is asking we'll see out
we'll see what I answer this I have an
i5 4670k and 1080 should I upgrade my
cpu or add another 1080i just game at
1440 I don't think you should add
another ten eighty to a 4670k depending
on the games did you play the problem
with this is you didn't tell me what
panel you use and that's is that that if
you're going to take all this graphical
graphical describe this graph Oh matical
horsepower and you're going to send it
down in a displayport cable to a shitty
there's no point whatsoever if that
monitors a 1080p TN panel 60 Hertz 5
millisecond or even say 10 millisecond
response time it doesn't matter how much
information you're shoving at it because
your graphics cards are like freaking uh
you know dragsters then your your panel
is just gonna be like I don't know what
to do here that here's some here's some
images look at all look there guitaring
everywhere now because I don't know what
to do with it because you turned off
vsync because you want to see all that
horsepower and when you turn on vsync
your graphics cards are going to go down
to like ten percent usage when you game
because the graphics cards are like
doing this waiting for your panel to get
on board yeah if you don't have a high
end panel don't do it hope that made
sense what webcam do you using um this
is a Logitech c920 about it almost four
years ago the Logitech c920 has kind of
been like the staple web cam for the
longest time like the c920 so good one
everyone has this just in found an
actual topic J would like this is
probably being this is from an anonymous
coyote yep this is Jerry he's typing in
the document right now I've been
ignoring him this whole time cuz it's
driving him insane that I said he died
on livestream and then you guys have all
been tweeting him and he's like stop
telling people I died so I've been
ignoring him literally he even tried to
call and I click the disconnect on the
call because I didn't want to get let
him come in here and prove that he was
still alive but he's typing in the
document so he's a life it says future
mark is teasing a new benchmark today
for DirectX 12 wow he made the text huge
suddenly I think he really wants me to
see it I was reading it it was a little
text and then suddenly he highlights all
and then makes it huge like to get my
attention I was reading it and then it
just suddenly went like big letters um
futuremark is teasing a new benchmark
today for DirectX 12 that will be out
soon called time spy will work on all
windows versions but dx12 only on
Windows 10 obviously literally just got
the email press release zero day whoo we
just got a zero-day memo
um that's cool that's cool I guess um I
don't know dx12 was just one of those
things right now and hold on wife is
texting me I ate the cookie that's all
I'm saying yeah she text me going I
think Little J has been hiding food I
think she ate the cookie that was on the
counter there I the cookie okay speaking
of that whatever happened to one
millisecond monitors well what your app
what your what's happening now is a lot
of panels are moving towards IPS and
high refresh rate IPS but the IPS
technology itself can't go down to one
one millisecond but a lot of people are
realizing that anything like five or
under is is perfect in fact you would
probably be hard-pressed to even notice
a difference between I'm gonna go out
there and I'm gonna say it as someone
who's even like sensitive to high FPS I
notice the differences between refresh
rate the hands down but i don't think i
could pick out the difference between
say a 15 millisecond panel and a 1
millisecond panel like if you put them
side by side and then switch them all
around and they looked identical and
said which one of these is one
millisecond i don't think i could
accurately tell you based on what I see
I think it would be a 50-50 guess hey
Jay can you please please please say
potatoes no even though I already did
screw you does a 4460 bottleneck a gtx
1070 make some benchmarks please i'm not
going to go out and buy a 4644 60 just
to benchmark it for you um depending on
the games you play a 4460 might show you
reduced performance into 1070 using a
single 1080 for the oh my god this is
GPU talk can you guys ask me something
other than GPUs only got five more
minutes anyway 4k gaming monitor or TV
um okay so
the biggest monitor you're really going
to find for 4k I think you can find some
32 inches 32 inch monitors I think you
can find like actual monitors maybe you
can find like more of those Korean like
weird brands that are out there but
those are hit and miss or whether or not
you actually get a good one 27 inch
panels 27 or 28 inch panels at 4k they
are they are too small for native 4k
that's a that's a 28 inch 4k panel right
there the monoprice and that's only on
my test rig because I need to be able to
test for K when I do my benchmarks but
that has no g sync technology and no
free sync technology in it because they
don't play nice with some GPUs like a
G's the acer g-sync panel would I have
the 4k g-sync panel does not allow me to
hook up an AMD graphics card and not
have problems like I hooked up a
sapphire 290x to it and it like black
screened as soon as I went into games
hook up the mana price and it's fine so
that I had the desktop set to 1080 on
that so the desktop set to 1080 but the
games can go up to 4k you deal with the
same issue very similar to like I said
with with envy surround where when you
switch back and forth between different
resolutions in games and in desktop you
get weird things like sometimes you go
into the game and it's just like boom
it's four times bigger and you're only
seeing a quarter of it on the panel
because it's scaled but didn't shrink it
down to the screen size when it came out
of a 1080p desktop and vice versa too
sometimes you come out of the game and
you go in and your icons that we didn't
opt and you're starting to go awww man
your eclectic and when trying to scale
it and also in the computers like oh
yeah I'm supposed to scale the desktop
and then boom it goes really big because
you scaled it and then it forgot it
needed the scale and it scaled on top of
your scaling and then just wait like
ginormous so yeah it so well that's that
that's the problem when you deal with
resolutions that are switching and and
that's why I like to just stick with
native res on everything I do on my
computer that I play on not that so
what's a good ultra wide screen a GTX
1080 an msi guard like carbon the
motherboard you have makes no difference
to the panel by the way
the x 34 is an amazing panel I've had no
problems with it but then again this was
sent to me by Nvidia so I'm fairly
certain these were all vetted long
before and video got them from Acer and
then once you know so ASA found the best
ones because right let's say your acer
and you're working with nvidia and
you're like okay we'll put all your
g-sync modules in here and then nvidia
goes okay well we need we need inventory
of these because they've got our module
and we need them for demos and tech and
reviews and stuff like that so then you
send a bunch of them to Nvidia and let's
say you send a bunch of the ones with
the problems people were complaining
about stuck pixels or blight bleed or
whatever are you going to be happy as in
video going what the fuck is this these
panels suck no you're going to pick the
best ones you're going to send them well
that's what I got unfortunately the x 34
had a lot of terrible reviews on the
first go around of the panel because
they had a lot of problems so if you
could if they fix those problems than I
highly recommend it so unfortunately my
panel and that's why I never did an
official review of this panel one I
didn't get it from Acer I knew it was
handpicked so it didn't think it was
very indicative of a true user
experience from retail I think Joker got
one and it was terrible I think letting
a joker hates like every panel he gets
um let's see here Jay when are we
getting a 1070 1080 stocks i don't know
i'm not i do why do people think I know
when they're gonna go on like when
they're gonna be available at newegg or
fries or Riker cider or whatever how am
I supposed to know I mean you guys think
they're consulting me on their shipments
aren't acer and asus panels pretty much
the same no where'd you hear that
they're clearly two different companies
just because they sound the same doesn't
mean though the same all right it's time
to get out of here guys thanks for
hanging out sorry the donation thing was
broken I had no idea so with that said
I'm gonna go ahead and hop on out of
here hopefully Jerry's here back online
next week he is going to be here two
weeks from yesterday so he gonna be here
in just under two weeks
here in California melting to death I'm
sure because it's hot even for me and I
live here so we're gonna probably be
staying inside most of the time that
he's here but he's going to be here will
be a live tech talk inside the nerd cave
here not not as nice as his nerd cave
but the new nerd cave he's never seen
the new as he calls it the drug lord
mansion so that'll be fun and we got to
find some shenanigans in trouble to get
into anyway time to get going guys
thanks for watching I enjoy hanging out
with all of you got to answer a lot of
questions that was fun I would stream
longer but I've have chores and chores
