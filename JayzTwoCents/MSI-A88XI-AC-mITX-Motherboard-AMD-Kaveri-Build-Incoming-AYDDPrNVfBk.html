the big powerful PC behind me is just
overkill and why would anyone need such
a powerful PC why does anyone need two
gtx 780 s that are hacked bios hacked
over voltage and overclocked and three
monitors I mean that's just for poor
people right barn achlys don't sue me I
decided that you know I'm going to ditch
all that crap but I'm going to go ahead
and build myself a AMD APU based system
because we all know Andy APU sits where
it's at right I mean it's that's what
I've been told anyway now my Mini ITX
system that I currently have doesn't get
a whole lot of use but I want to change
that I currently have it powered by the
MSI z87 I gaming motherboard this is a
mini ITX intel board obviously but
they've gone ahead and supplied for
review the a 88x IAC motherboard so
basically this is like the APU version
of that board for the most part it does
have any in the gaming design or nominal
Eicher or scheme on there but you know
AMD says hey why don't you check out
Kaveri and I figured well the only way
to really do that and have a true
opinion of Kaveri is to use it in a
real-world situation and give you guys
some performance reviews of that so
today we're going to be taking a look at
this MSI military class Mini ITX
motherboard from MSI and then we in a
later video we're going to do the build
and then I'll probably do something
custom with it you guys know me and then
we will go ahead and formulate you know
in a little series how I feel about AMD
Kaveri you guys have been asking for
this for a long time ever since CES and
we're finally going to do that so inside
the box yeah you've got all your normal
stuff you've got your software
you've got your antenna because it is
does have a built-in Wireless your back
plate all that stuff but we don't care
about really that this is obviously what
we care about so here it is right here
looks an awful lot like the one for
Intel only it's an FM 2 Plus socket now
it is I love mini ITX builds I mean
obviously I've built a pretty big
computer and I'm building a bigger
computer now with
project red mist and I'm going to be
building an even bigger computer for
myself after project red mist so it's
kind of fun every now and then take a
step back and do these tiny little I
mean these these little like nuggets of
PC components and there's there's just
so much fun so what I like about this
motherboard immediately upon looking at
it is the fact that even though this is
a not really an enthusiast level board
it's pretty much just you know it's got
all the functions you need but that
doesn't have any of the glamour that
goes along with it is the fact that it
has that nice matte black PCB so it
doesn't have that kind of a brown
looking PCB that we've seen from MSI it
is a nice matte black okay now because
this is the a 88x now I've actually had
a hard time saying that I already had to
cut out like six different takes of
saying that now because it's an 888 now
because this is the a 88 kind of hard
one now because this is the 88 x i
motherboard or a ATX a 88 X this means
this is base for Kaveri it's got all the
functions that needs for the Kaveri
which is am these most recent generation
APU system now for the RAM right here we
do have dual channel dims and a and B on
there so Ord M 1 and M 2 is they call it
so you do have dual channel Ram I
remember with ap use if you're going to
be using the APU built into the
processor or the graphics built in the
processor you're going to want the
fastest Ram you that you can because it
will affect your overall gaming
performance it's got the standard
retention bracket on there for AMD it's
got some vrm cooling going on right here
with some nice matte black PCB I kind of
like the way that those look and then
we've got a tiny tiny little chip set
cooler right there it's so adorable I do
think the blue vga is a little bit out
of place in fact I'm not even I might
even take that off there and wrap some
electrical tape or something around it
because believe it or not that bothers
me so I don't really like that for SATA
ports we do have 4 SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports right there USB 3.0 2 fan
extension r2 fan pwm headers on there
can control three or four pin fans we've
got a four pin CPU APU auxiliary power
right there 24-pin power over here and
pretty much one PCI Express 16x slot on
the back now when it comes to i/o of
course we have got our optical right
there SP di
if optical we've got our ps2 port VGA
port which is again kind of interesting
I think we do have HDMI DVI our wireless
antenna ports right there and we have
got four USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 Gigabit
LAN and then built-in audio right there
so it's pretty basic but it's got all
the functions that you pretty much need
for a nice compatible portable take the
back nice portable gaming system so this
is going to be pretty much entry-level
mid-range gaming we're going to go ahead
and put Kaveri APU in there as I
mentioned and we're going to do a couple
of different tests I'm going to be doing
it with just APU performance where me
doing it with APU and dual graphics with
the r7 250 and then we're going to be
putting my MSI gaming 270 on here we'll
kind of compare performance in those
three configurations and then we'll go
ahead and stick it in my note 304 maybe
we'll do some water cooling or something
with it I don't know but we're going to
go ahead and we'll make good use of this
I think this is going to be a fun build
and I think it's going to help me be a
little bit less of a PC snob or a
high-end hardware snob because you know
let's face it not everyone can afford
you know this level of motherboard right
here so guys this has been the MSI a ATX
i AC mini ITX FM 2 FM 2 + md APU Kaveri
motherboard holy crap that's a long way
of putting it all out there anyway guys
there's your overview of this
motherboard here from MSI tell me what
you think when I put this picture out on
Instagram you guys seem pretty excited
because you've been asking me for about
the last 4 months now to do something
with Kaveri and I think it's going to be
very fun to do yeah yeah I'm recycling
that joke go ahead and sue me and by
that I mean don't sue me because I don't
make very much money
on YouTube at all so now that now I'm
depressed
