school is killing it didn't say exactly
that's the Russia of the availability to
do
what about MSRP price point so it didn't
save any price basically this is the
project shield so to announce the
product itself just the project so
basically announced more details
what type of operating system is the
device running on actually is running
Android Android okay what about the
gaming platform is it all cloud-based or
is a running our cartridges the other no
they are basically two so you can play
the android games so I'm doing it to be
easily install all of the play
or you can stream the gates from your PC
is a creative pc games and you can play
them on
device itself different controller so
it's slightly plank you can see just the
stream directly to advise you can buy
any pc game so give or receive on a
press conference or video game player
games like a family crisis any hiatus
again cookies to indirectly to the
device so i will just convert it to a
compatible format with the device it's a
stream so basically it's the compressed
in the stream as a stream to the device
so any game you play on the pc could be
played on this device because it's just
the street and now i guess last question
since it's streaming is there any sort
of lag or latency well actually a
there is a latency of course but it's
the absolutely reasonable and I don't
think the game of scoot to realize that
you delay when you fight against
actually the dealers are 100 menacing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
