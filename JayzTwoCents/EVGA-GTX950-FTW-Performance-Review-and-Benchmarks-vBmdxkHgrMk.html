another graphics card video seems to be
an awful lot of these lately but that's
okay because you guys like graphics card
videos I like graphics card videos and I
get a lot of complaints of people saying
I do too much high-end hardware reviews
I have no idea where they get that
impression unless you've been living
under a rock and maybe even if you
haven't been you may or may not have
heard about the GTX 950 which is Nvidia
's new graphics card to replace the GTX
750 and 750 Ti so today we're going to
go ahead and talk about that because I
get a lot of complaints from people
saying I do too much high-end hardware
do stuff that we can afford and I'm
going to do the best I can to keep this
from being a 30 minute video because we
all know I tend to talk a lot especially
when I do stuff like Tech Talk with
Jerry we get really long-winded we tend
to get off subject and we don't talk
about things are actually relevant and
then people are telling us that we
should probably go ahead and like there
was this one time actually when I was in
high school of I was in class and I was
giving a presentation the teacher told
me to kind of keep it short because
she's like I know J that you tend to
talk a lot and I did whether you're
looking for a pump reservoir custom GPU
block or a complete loop in a box alpha
cools wide range of products can make
your next water cooling adventure and
easy one click the link in the
description for more details and so
anyway to keep a long story short we'll
go ahead and talk about this guy right
here the GTX 950 now we're looking at
the EVGA 950 for the win so it's a
little bit customized it's even got a
backplate on there you know I know the
980 was boxed long before I started
giving them a hard time about there not
being back plates on their top to your
cards long before the 980ti launched or
the Titan X launched it's kind of funny
that you know we've we've got EVGA to
start including back plates on their on
their graphics cards but it's just
what's really funny about that is the
fact that the 980 still doesn't have a
backplate with it because those were
like produced and boxed and warehouse
long before the J's backplate movement
really started to gain momentum but
anyway before the win Edition and higher
on the 950 has a backplate I do not
believe the SC does so same exact
backplate you'd pretty much find on a
960 the cooler itself is pretty much
identical to a gtx 960 it's just been
adapted
to the 950 because that's really what
the 950 is is a cut-down GTX 960 that
was one of the things that the 750
lacked was SLI support so there were
some folks out there who unfortunately
bought a 750 and said well if I need
more power later I'll just get another
one in SLI and they didn't realize it
doesn't support SLI so that's a nice
change to see so the cooler just like
the GTX 960 features three copper heat
pipes which are long ways they're not
curving or going up and down aluminum
fins and quite a few of them in terms of
power delivery it only requires a single
8 pin PCI Express power and it does have
at least the for the win Edition does
have two BIOS on here a master and a
slave now I'm not sure I understand why
they're going with dual BIOS in case you
want to kind of tinker with it and hack
it or I guess you know you go have to
worry about breaking the card like I've
done in the past on single BIOS cards
but I'm not too sure there's that many
people out there who are going to go and
try and do custom hacks or voltage mods
to a 950 so to me that just it's like
hey cool it's got it but I don't know
why it has it to be honest I mean I'm
not going to hack a gtx 950 there's just
no point in that now the benchmarks are
going to be an only 1080p and the reason
for that is that is all this card is
meant for 1080p and lower it does not
have a ton of CUDA cores it's a 768 CUDA
cores
it's got 6.6 Gbps gddr5 memory it has
got the base clock on this thing as 1044
megahertz right or 1024 megahertz with a
boost clock of 1188 from the factory
this one boosts much higher out of the
box from EBG a because of the custom
design on this in fact this one in my
environment went to fourteen hundred and
fifty-five megahertz and of course we
did overclock that as well but other
than that this is not a powerhouse
graphics card it's only got 2 gigabytes
of vram so keep this thing where it
belongs 1080p or under anyway let's go
ahead and talk about those benchmarks
alright guys let's go ahead and get
right down to it so as you can see the
pricing of this guy is one hundred and
seventy nine dollars for the for the win
Edition you can find nine fifty s as low
as 159 bucks so compared to everything
I've currently put through my test bench
suite that I put together it is the
cheapest card of the bunch
therefore you should expect it to have
the least performance of the bunch so
don't think that this card is going to
go toe-to-toe with like say the 380 or
the 970 I mean it's not going to happen
alright so for the core clocks I got an
extra 100 megahertz above the boost
clock of 1455 it boosted the 1455 all on
its own and that without touching
anything so that's Factory and it stayed
there - it didn't throttle up and down
as the test went on so I got an extra
100 megahertz - 1555 I also got a plus
200 on the memory and that does actually
make a difference in these benchmarks so
I want to put that up there as well the
other thing to put out there is
overclocking on this was done on
precision x16 five point three point
seven on Nvidia drivers 350 5.82 so
those are brand new drivers and I didn't
notice anything weird except for one
test we'll talk about that now as you
can see it is the coolest air cooled
card of the bunch
62 Celsius while overclocked under load
did a great job as coolers doing very
good but the I mean the GPU is extremely
efficient it doesn't get hot so as you
can see here 28 idle in a 62 max load
now as we go forward here with the tests
I did run fire strike at normal extreme
and ultra I just want to see how it's
scaled and as you can see here we had a
little bit of a jump from a 69 42 273 49
in normal 34 or 32 69 versus 34:54 in
extreme and 1137 to a 12 62 in 4k so you
can see the overclock did yield us
obviously some results in all of the
tests now moving forward these tests are
only be done in 1080p because that's
where this card belongs 1080p and that's
it so don't think that this card is
going to go toe-to-toe with anything
else on this chart simply because it's
it's just not placed to do that the only
card it's really intended to go
head-to-head with in my opinion is the
r9 370 which I'm still waiting on from
AMD they said they would send it to me a
month ago I haven't gotten it yet once
it gets here we will go back and redo
these tests and we will do a video
directly comparing the 950 to the r9 370
now because I'm only doing one
resolution I went ahead and made this
standard clock versus overclocked
average fps and minimum fps that was a
highly requested thing that I do is
include minimum fps so that's what we
are doing here now you can see without
overclocking about 29 fps in Witcher 3
and 25 FPS minimum that's actually a big
deal considering it shows that there's
not much swing between minimum and
average which gives you smoother
perceived gameplay even at a lower fps
so that is important
32 versus 26 when overclocked GTA v when
overclocked you can see we got pretty
damn close to that magic 60 FPS number
with 49 FPS minimum healthy boost over
the you know stock clock of 1455 453
versus 44 so we got a pretty decent jump
across the board Metro last light which
is a static test here you can see again
when overclocked for 51 to 54 now the
minimums on on Metro you can kind of
ignore that these minimums happen in
between some of the scenes where there's
a where the where the benchmark actually
loads it goes to a black screen and dips
for a second so that's why these
minimums are so damn low I've even seen
these minimums go down into the single
digits with high end cards so ignore the
minimums here on Metro just like Witcher
3 Crysis 3 kind of gives this card a
kick in the butt when at very high
settings I did not change the settings
because in order for me to keep this
card relevant compared to all of the
other cards that I benchmark the testing
suite must remain the same so I would
rather take a high I would rather take a
low-end card like this and keep it on
high settings to see what the worst case
scenario is then to take a high-end card
and put it at medium settings and have
the numbers be inflated through the roof
so this is why I left the settings very
high to show you worst case scenario so
if you bump this down to say medium
settings in Crysis 3 you'd get much
closer to the 6
the FPS you might not hit it but you'd
get much much closer minimum FPS when
overclocked 26 FPS versus thirty eight
average mmm not a very good number for
you no the master race where we were
like we love 60fps or higher but it does
get the job done at very high settings
drop those settings and enjoy much
better frame rates far cry 4 look at
that I experienced something weird with
Far Cry and this is probably new driver
related but every time I loaded the game
whether it be overclocked or not the
game crashed so that's why we have no
Far Cry benchmarks and battlefield 4 as
you can see as a game gets older the
lower end graphics cards have no problem
running it above 60fps when at factory
clocks and 51 minimum very good number
50 minimum this is all margin of error
right here obviously when is one FPS
difference but 70 FPS average when
overclocked so you can get into some fun
gaming like Battlefield 4 on ultra
preset with 2x msaa on a 950 graphics
card and have no problems playing that
whatsoever alright so let's go ahead and
talk about some final thoughts I will
revisit these test case scenario to say
at the price point it should you go with
a 950 or should you go with a 370 from
AMD I'm curious the base price of a 950
is about 159 bucks
this one comes in at $20 more at 179
which puts it only $39 less than say in
r9 380 so as you saw from the benchmarks
you you can get more performance out of
a 380 than a 950 obviously but at a
higher price point and we could say that
all day long right well you know a 380
only costing 219 if you only spent $40
more than you could get you know like a
3 million be and we can do that all the
way up to the tight neck so it's up to
you to decide what's your max dollar
you're willing to spend is I can't do
that for you you guys have to do that
now I achieved fifteen hundred and
fifty-five megahertz which is one
hundred megahertz higher than the boost
clock went automatically without me
touching anything and there was an
increase in performance with that
hundred megahertz that's a decent
percentage especially when you look at
where the base clock is on this at a
thousand and 24 megahertz so you're
getting over 500 megahertz
booster over 50% improvement over where
the base clock was in fact if you know
if we ran this thing only at 10:24
without a boost clock that would be a
gutless Pig it's still at high settings
was not doing the massive FPS but again
that's high settings I wanted to keep it
static with the same suite the way I run
all my tests the same so if you bump
down the settings on this card you'd get
even higher FPS this card is not
intended for even high settings at 1080p
are all very high or Ultra settings but
at least I showed you guys what the
worst case scenario would possibly be
now we're going to just kind of slide
right into the subjective part of this
review where I say I don't really know
why this card exists I mean they're
marketing this card towards MOBA gamers
games like League of Legends and dota 2
and games like that where you don't need
a lot of horsepower to run those games
you really done there Naughton
graphically intensive and the 960
already does that that's what they've
said the 960 was designed for and I'm
not sure that this card offers enough
performance increase at its current
price point to say that it makes sense
to jump from something like say a 750 Ti
into a 950 when nine games like League
of Legends are already running fine on
cards like the 750ti or even like the
270 or 270x on AMD I'm not sure a lot of
people are going to really jump out and
buy a 950 to get marginal increases I
thought honestly when we got the notice
that we're going to be seeing a new
graphics card that we were going to be
seeing the 960 Ti or something like that
because they've done this in the past
with the 660ti that was stronger more
CUDA cores more aggressive overclocking
and did fantastic in RPGs and fps and
simulators and just really kind of slid
right in between some of the mainstream
and enthusiast type of graphics cards so
you guys tell me does the 950 make sense
to you now I'm going to go back and
review this card comparing it directly
to the r9 370 I think the bets I mean
when it comes to the entry-level market
in graphics cards those two are going to
be probably duking it out like you know
phrase
in Muhammad Ali I mean it's going to be
a hell of a battle especially since
that's the more reasonable price point
that a lot of people are looking at with
graphics cards which is $200 or less so
anyway guys thanks for watching this
video tell me how you think about this
card do you think it really fits in with
this space that it's currently at you
guys tell me that's it for today guys
thanks for watching this review of the
gtx 950 for the win from EVGA as always
hit me up on the social media it's right
over here if you guys don't want to do
any of that well then we'll just go and
talk to you at the next video so anyway
thanks for watching and I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
