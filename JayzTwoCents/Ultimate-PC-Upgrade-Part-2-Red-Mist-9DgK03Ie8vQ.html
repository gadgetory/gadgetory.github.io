actually begin today's video is brought
to you by mass drop the largest
community commerce platform in the world
and right now they have an awesome drop
going on the dxracer tank series TV 29
chair that supports gamers up to 6 foot
7 inches and 450 pounds and the great
news is mass drop and dxracer always
have drops going so be sure to click the
link below to learn more about the
dxracer chairs currently available at
mass drop
welcome here guys to part 2 of project
red mist and if you guys have not seen
part one check it out you can watch it
right here and if you have not it's
gonna be a little card that pops out you
guys can click it if you're on desktop
otherwise I'll try to remember to put
the links in the description if you're
watching it on mobile but anyway there
is a playlist as well for the original
build I did on this system nearly two
years ago showing the z87 build we did
and so you guys can get an idea of the
parts as they were versus what is new
and what's going into this update or
upgrade or whatever you will notice as a
client build guys it's not a giveaway is
anything like that this is not my
computer getting a lot of questions
people ask me if I'm giving this away I
mean that's really no I don't know how
far I'm gonna get today and I'll talk
about why at the end of this video
because there's a little bit of a snag
not like a parts compatibility or
anything like that well I'm gonna talk
about this a little bit more in the end
of the video but all I have planned
today is to get the GPU blocks installed
on the three 980ti is that can take a
little while you know when you have to
do back plates and all of the heat pads
and make sure everything is installed
properly all the 980 eyes have already
been tested we did that in part one so
we made sure they all worked remember
guys test your hardware before you start
water cooling anything that way you know
there's Pro there's a problem before you
get it all built because trust me it's a
pain in the ass taking it all apart but
I wanted to get started on some of the
wiring and stuff but unfortunately I'm
still waiting on what the custom sleeve
cables can't go anywhere do anything
without that and I wanted to get started
on the tubing but I can't and I'll talk
about why again at the end of this video
so with that said I'm gonna go ahead and
do some fancy-schmancy camerawork here
hope
or semi schmancy I mean let's be honest
it's just me filming it I'm not I'm not
like Demetri or anything let's go get
the water blocks on the EVGA 980 TI z'
and let's let's talk about why we can't
go any farther yet on this bill
now that all the blocks are installed I
always make sure to test the cards again
that way I can make sure there was
nothing wrong with the installation of
the block and I know that this is
freaking some people out right now like
wait a minute you have the system on and
there's no water in the block Jerry what
the hell's wrong with you oh my god well
I showed this once in the skunkworks
build and I want to go ahead and show it
again that Maxwell is so efficient you
can run the system as you can see right
now the graphics cards at 39c with no
water no heatsink just the block
touching it so there's no fins or
anything and no air flow like I mean
there's some air touching the back of
the of the heats or the back plate on
the back jeez I couldn't think we're
sitting there the back plate on the back
is there but there's no water in there
there's no air no nothing and as you can
see we are chilling at at 39c oh we just
hit 40 as you can see here even with a
browser going in the background which
you guys know you really don't know
Google Chrome uses GPU acceleration so
it actually puts a little bit of the GPU
under load even though it says zero it
is using the GPU to render all of the
videos and stuff like on YouTube and all
these tabs I've got going here and even
then you can see we don't have any sort
of cooling issue so yes if you're
putting water blocks on your Maxwell
based cards I wouldn't necessarily try
this with AMD I guess it could work but
with Maxwell based cards you can see you
can do a test to make sure everything's
working and you can get to your desktop
with there being absolutely no fluid
whatsoever in your block
I mentioned in the beginning in this
video that there's gonna be some changes
here that have kind of made it so that I
can't really move too far forward and
that being the fact that my fluid in
skunk works is turning brown again and
I'm not using pastel and I'm not even
using Mayhem's fluid I'm using Mayhem's
dye but the fluid that I'm using is
actually the Primo chill clear you know
I don't believe it's the fault of the
clear and I don't believe it's the fault
of the Mayhem's at this point the only
common denominator in all of this when
the color change issue started was when
I switched to my nemesis radiators now I
don't know if it's necessarily the fault
of the Nemesis they've been cleaned and
cleaned and cleaned and I can tell you
that when I had the yellow in the
previous built I wasn't getting color
shift because I don't know I mean the
the coolant was really hot so the GPU
kept turning brown and now that I added
the VRMs and the chipset and the CPU in
the CPU LuPone skunkworks
now lo and behold that GP or that CPU
loop is getting hotter and it's now
starting to turn brown and all of the
years that I've been doing water cooling
now 13 years I have never dealt with
temp with fluids changing color like
that and I've always water cooled my
graphics cards and I've always water
cooled them together with the CPU loop
and the temps can get really hot
especially in the AMD system I had temps
got really hot with my 580 with only
having a single 360 radiator again never
had color shift issues whatsoever I'm
the same fluid in my test bench in here
and even had the night the 290
water-cooled cryo venom card from vision
tech hooked up in there that fluid has
not changed a single shade and not a bit
of brown so I'm just going to go ahead
and change the radiators in both systems
and see what happens so that's why we're
kind of stuck because I don't I'm not
gonna do any of the bends and stuff
because the radiator ports are slightly
different on the location of the EK than
they are with the the hardware labs
radiators not to mention to the
thicknesses of the EK radiators are a
little bit different
instead of being thirty like one is
thirty eight and the other one it's like
forty five so we are going to be going
with you know look thicker radiator as
well so until I get those radiators in I
can't really move too far forward I'm
gonna paint be SLI bridge white and
remove the SLI sticker and then put it
in the red the red J's to sense gel
we're gonna call it and we're gonna see
you know it's gonna look pretty good but
the nice thing about this being anodized
aluminum is if we don't like the white
we can just use air craft remover and
strip it and it won't affect the
anodizing we can start all over I also
need to do the glass tubing in between
the cards right here and then I could
also get these tubes between the
reservoirs and the GPU kind of ready to
go because we already know how far those
have to go they're just right there
anyway guys I hope this videos
entertained you in some way I don't know
I'm just kind of logging what we do with
the system here and I will be fully
documenting what is happening again with
the fluid inside skunkworks
anyway guys thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
