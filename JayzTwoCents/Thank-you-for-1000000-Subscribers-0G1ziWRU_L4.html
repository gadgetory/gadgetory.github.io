number that I said at the beginning of
this journey wasn't possible the reason
why it wasn't possible because I didn't
think a thousand was possible wasn't
thinking a million I was like if I got a
hundred subscribers that would be insane
not a thousand then 10,000 100,000 I was
never going to happen dammit I keep
proving myself wrong or better yet you
guys keep proving myself wrong or
proving me wrong whatever the correct
Lingle is because I can't really talk
right now a little bit like upside down
in all of this seeing 1 million
subscribers is it's just a number but
it's a number that represents you guys
don't you guys don't know what has like
gone in to all of this the behind the
scenes the amount of sacrifice both for
myself and my family to make all of this
possible if it wasn't for the amount of
support that you guys give I never would
have been here if it wasn't for you guys
sharing the videos liking the videos
being there every single time I upload a
video regardless of what the content is
good or bad I mean I put up some pretty
bad videos but you guys consistently
come back and are supportive and that's
why we're here and that's why I use the
word we when I say we hit a million
subscribers sure you guys are subscribed
to other tech channels too and we're all
one big family but but Jays fam right am
i using that term right Nick tells me
all the time I don't use the latest
lingo correctly but I've got kind of
that old guy thing going on where I
think I'm being young and hips but I'm
not a kid I don't even know if it's the
right word anymore whatever I digress
doesn't matter this has this is this
whole journey has been one big group
effort and you guys consistently teach
me how wrong I am about myself and what
I'm able to achieve welcome ladies and
gentlemen to Jays $0.02 YouTube channel
come out to semi live on the Internet
here
or to welcome you to my new channel
okay so right this very minute hit
10,000 and I think already before I can
even get the camera going I was already
at like ten thousand and one so what am
I feeling right now each and every one
of you are crazy and insane including my
wife and my daughter sitting over there
I resigned from my full-time job
that probably surprises a few of you
were housed Tibet because so many of you
already figured that out was nothing
more than a full-time youtuber the
channel has reached 500,000 subscribers
for the first time ever I think that the
concept of this channel being able to
reach a million subscribers might be
possible I'm gonna get real with you
guys for a second here and if you don't
like the real I apologize but this is
important this is a milestone
I swore was impossible because I'm going
to tell you why I felt it was impossible
I have consistently been a quitter in my
life there's many things I tried in my
life that I quit at many ventures that I
failed at many things that I set out to
do and would just fail over and over and
over again yes I know that failure is
the formula for success but I never
none of that stuff I really felt like
led up to here maybe it did maybe those
failures made me go you know what enough
is enough I'm sick of failing at things
so I'm just going to give this all I've
got and I did and it's been four and a
half years of every single day all day
every day working towards this and I
don't know what's next I know a million
is very very significant but I try not
to get caught up on those numbers I very
rarely ever throw my numbers out there
but a million manages has a good ring to
it also to my wife I've got to give
credit where credit is due
there is a huge support system that
takes place at home the amount of time
and effort she spends taking care of the
family to allow me to do this I'm not
proud of how much family time I've
sacrificed to get to where I am but I am
proud to say that since moving into the
studio I've actually been home more and
spent more evenings on the couch and
watching TV and visiting with my girls
and going out then I ever did leading up
to this point so the studio is working
out exactly as I wanted again
this this is all a huge symbolic
representation of the success we've
achieved as a community here love me or
hate me it doesn't really matter because
this train is moving and there's no
stopping it and the reason why this is
so significant to me if I said it before
I said it in my I quit my job video I
said it in the video where I said I'm
going to quit my job where I don't have
a lot of friends I have a select few
people that I keep close to me and
that's it my circle is very small
obviously in real life it's very small
this circle is a million people big but
you guys you guys make me feel a little
bit more normal if that makes sense
anyway I digress I'm rambling now
because I'm excited I am so excited
about this because I've if there's one
thing I like it's being proven wrong
about something good and here we are so
I said I don't know exactly what's next
the studio is obviously a huge move I'm
still setting it up and I should working
on the vlog today I'm getting a lot of
things set up in here now regarding to
giveaway here here's what I'm going to
do I grossly underestimated how fast we
were going to hit a million I expected
about another month to hit a million
even with the giveaway so the date on
that I believe was like I want to say
it's like April 21st or 22nd something
like that where I have it scheduled to
end I want I'm going to end it early but
how early is the part I'm a little bit
conflicted on I'm going to probably let
it run until the end of this week like
Friday and then I'm going to draw the
winner they're going to be notified and
as soon as the winner confirms or if
they don't confirm a new winner is drawn
and once they confirm once we have a
confirmed winner that's what I'm trying
to say I will announce the winner both
on Twitter and in a winner a winner
announcement video so yeah and you guys
whoever wins is going to be getting a
serious upgrade package you guys should
have already seen that video if you're
here hopefully you've seen it if you
have no idea what I'm talking about
go into the video list and look at the
ultimate upgrade package I'm giving away
so I just want to sit down from the
camera here in front of the green screen
I mean windows break set this one
million subscriber Oscar on behalf of
all of you guys because again it's not
possible without this group
collaborative effort that's it now
enough to say guys thanks for watching
the videos here's to a million mama said
100 more here's to a million more as
always I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
