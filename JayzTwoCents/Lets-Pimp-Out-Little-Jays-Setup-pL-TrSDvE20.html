what's up J is 2 cents and Little J here
we are actually in my new office I think
pink is a lovely shade of color for J's
to sense women into 2015 what do you
think do you like pink mm-hmm mm-hmm
are you being shy all of a sudden so
we're in little J's room right now
actually it's pretty pretty nice little
setup here but she's getting older she
needs a place to do dedicated homework
and her current set-up for her nice new
computer is actually quite embarrassing
sitting on an old table that practically
wants to fall over all the time and so
we today are going to be rearranging her
room we're gonna pimp out her room set
up your mumbly you know that basically
what she's saying is we're gonna
rearrange all the room and we're gonna
put a new desk over here turn my bed
that way and we're going to put my
dresser there know what's going over
here behind us where it's gonna go here
and then we're gonna take my dollhouse
and we're gonna put it in my playroom
and we're gonna move my basket and we're
gonna put my okay let's just do it and
then they can see what we do how's that
alright so here we go we're gonna pimp
out Little J set up
you
you
you
you
alright so we just built Little J her
very first computer desk let me help
she's very mad I had to keep kicking her
out cuz she kept getting in the way
anyway not well yeah it is your fault
there's not a lot of room in here anyway
next time you're buying your own desk
then you keep this up so for those
wondering this is the this is the IKEA
um Mickey or Mickey mi cke I know it's
Scandinavian Swedish whatever I'm I
don't think it's Mickey I think it's
Mickey Mickey whatever it's about 140
bucks it's not too bad but it's got a
lot of storage space up there which she
decorated out with her little princess
figurines and things but it's a good
corner desk for a small room like this
it's perfect for her to have room to do
her homework either I really made a room
for Cinderella like like it's her castle
getting ready for someone to marry which
is the prince unit easier I knew why do
you dress well I'm not too happy with
the cable management on the bottom of
the desk but I'll work with that in the
future it doesn't matter if it's a kid's
room or not I still get very anal about
wiring flip open the thing you there
show mother's like paper storage in
there I pull good it's kind of tight
there you go so you can actually put
some paper storage in there it's a
little tight right now because it's new
but it'll get easier to work with but
it's got adjustable desks on there
plenty of room for a 24-inch monitor
even bigger if you moved it yes close it
even bigger monitor if you moved it a
little bit closer I did keep my promise
and gave her one of the 24 inch acer
monitors which she's been bugging me for
a nicer better monitor and
old one was a very old um table and I
was getting kind of tired of it because
I kept on like having accidents I yeah
well you're not gonna be eating at this
table or this desk you understand me all
right I'm also putting a password on her
computer so she cannot get up during the
night and go on her computer because I
told him and now he is very upset
because one night one night you got up
and one on your computer in the middle
the night yes I'm a preschool night why
do I have a five-year-old going on 15
okay so all in all if you guys are
looking for a nice small desk a lot of
people are asking me about my desks I've
got giant IKEA Galant desks in my office
and I don't recommend those for bedrooms
they're huge but this McCade mcgee what
is called Mickey this Mickey desk back
here perfect corner unit I'll put the
dimensions of the desk down into the
description of this video also a link to
it if you guys want to look at it is
IKEA there pretty much all over Europe
in America so a good chance you guys may
live near one and you can order this
desk or go pick it up and purse I don't
recommend shipping it cost more to ship
these desks and it does actually buy
them but yeah perfect for a small
bedroom like this in fact this room is
not big and she's got tons of room over
here so we're gonna get on out of here
and now you've got a place to do your
homework which I expect you to be doing
your homework not playing on the
computer I will help you on your
homework except for the math because
addition is hard all right all right
guys we're gonna get the heck on out of
here we'll see you next time
nerd blocks are coming soon hopefully
we've just been so busy especially with
Mini J being here
maybe's here now so alright guys see you
in the next one see you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
