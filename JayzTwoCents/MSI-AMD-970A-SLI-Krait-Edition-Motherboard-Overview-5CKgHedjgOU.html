and I've been promising you guys some
AMD material and here it is today we're
going to be taking a look at the
brand-new msi 978 sli crate edition
motherboard for AMD FX cpus and 3 plus
now what makes this motherboard so
special well it is the first AMD
motherboard with USB 3.1 the new EVGA
silent series power supplies offer
excellent silence and efficiency through
their new EVGA eco-mode technology and
also features a seven-year warranty for
worryfree gaming click the link in the
description to learn more now I don't
think many people would disagree with me
with saying that I think AMD enthusiasts
have felt very left out lately and I'm
not just talking about on my channel I'm
talking about for the most part of being
a PC enthusiast a gaming enthusiast and
an AMD fan at the same time because when
you're an enthusiast and you're a fan of
something you want to see it evolve and
grow and become better and better well
if you're a fan of AMD especially of
their gaming series are their FX line of
CPUs you've definitely felt like that's
been a bit lackluster over the last
couple of years and if you don't feel
that way then you haven't really been
following some of the progress AMD's
really put a lot of its R&amp;amp;D into its apu
technology which is doing fantastic but
true gamers like to get raw CPU and GPU
performance so that means the FX line is
kind of where your interests are now
what's happening here is the board
partners are the ones that are having to
come up with the designs of the boards
to try and implement the most custom and
current feature sets for an older
generation of CPU I mean don't get mad
at me for saying that the FX CPU is an
older generation it really is it's a
reason why you see 2011 stamped on the
top of all of the heat spreaders it
really is a four year old design and
that's pretty old in CPU architecture
let's go ahead and start with kind of a
meat-and-potatoes of the motherboard
here we're going to talk about slot
options here now you have two PCI slots
on this and now that that makes sense I
guess considering the fact that PCI is
not PCI Express by the way PCI slots are
still native to the chipset
AMD's using back from 2011 as I've
already mentioned so it makes sense that
they put them on there I don't know how
many people are still running PCI
slotted peripherals whether it be
graphics car not graphics cards but
audio cards or network cards most of the
time you're going to be running
something PCI Express nowadays you do
have two PCI Express One X on here as
well as two PCI Express 2.0 16 X slots
now some people freak out over the idea
of them being PCI Express Gen 2 but
they're still not being saturated even
with current graphics cards you're going
to have more than enough bandwidth on
PCI Express 2.0 16x for your favorite
graphics cards and not be worried about
saturating those PCIe lanes now because
there's only two PCI Express slots
you're only going to be able to run two
graphics cards it's kind of I guess it's
kind of obvious the way the math worked
out on that one but let's go and talk
about what kind of graphics cards you
could run on here you could run to Titan
X's you grow in to 290 X's you can run
to the new fury cards or whatever they
going to be called and you wouldn't
really have a problem is supported so
you can run Nvidia or AMD on here but
because it's the 970 a chipset and not
the 990 FX this graphics card will not
support quad fire or four-way SLI or
Quad SLI now the difference there is a
quad fire would be running something
like 2 to 95 X 2's which would give you
total 4 GPUs or running something like 2
Titans YZ which I don't think anyone
should do for 4 GPUs on the Nvidia side
you simply are not going to be able to
do that on here because the 978 chipset
is not going to support that now onboard
audio is a surround audio with their
isolated circuitry on there which a lot
of motherboard manufacturers are doing
now so you don't get any noise
interference from the board itself and
then you do have massive heat sinks here
on both the VRMs and the North Bridge
and the South Bridge you have a lot of
cooling on here that's me picking up air
from your case airflow cooling off the
motherboard components itself now on the
side of the motherboard here you have
high quality chokes you have high
quality capacitors they're all black
they look very very sleek 24-pin power
3.0 USB 3.0 plug on the bottom and then
all of your USB plugs front side panel
etc etc all your front up you know power
reset button
for your harddrive and peripherals you
do have four SATA three six gigabit per
second on the side here as well as two
additional here on the top of the
motherboard now this thing does also
support ram disk which is kind of neat
and MSI has their own built in Ram disk
configurator and it's all contained in
their BIOS so you could easily set up
Ram disk set up onboard raid it's not
going to be any problems whatsoever but
as we mentioned earlier in this video
this is the first
ambi motherboard to feature the new USB
3.1 standard now it is the what looks
like the standard USB 3.0 plug but it
has USB 3.1 for up to 10 gigabit per
second performance that is extremely
fast but continuing on the back here for
i/o you do have six USB 2.0 two USB 3.0
ps2 plugs on the back here for
old-school gamers who like to use their
lag-free input devices and then you do
have a Gigabit Ethernet card now the
motherboard is made with a nice matte
PCB on here which is very thick very
multi-layered
there military class 4 so it's very very
heavy-duty
it's actually a decently weighted
motherboard so it's not going to be easy
to break I don't suggest you go trying
to bend it in half or anything but it's
really going to hold up now for fan
control you do have two PWM fan headers
on here and then you have one system fan
plug so I would have liked to have seen
more built-in fan headers on this thing
but considering the price point and the
fact that it's a 970 a it does it makes
sense that there are a ton of fan
headers on this thing so you're probably
going to need to get a fan controller if
you're putting this in a system that has
a lot of fans so there you go guys
that's the msi 970 a sli crate edition
with the nice white and black theme it's
kind of nice to see an AMD motherboard
that's not read I mean it's cool that
AMD likes red that's their color and all
AMD red team and all that sort of stuff
but I like that msi kind of went against
the grain I made a black and white one
so you guys could come up with some
really nice black and white themed build
just would look really good in like an
r5 or an r4 it's good to see companies
like MSI giving upgraded features to
people who are still very enthusiast
over an older platform so it kind of
pulls you guys into a little bit more of
a modern era on a bit of an aging
platform the last thing to talk about on
this thing is overclocking because
is the FX line is pretty decent with
overclocking so how does this thing do
well it gives you the features that
you're going to need to do some basic
overclocks the 978 chipset isn't exactly
known as being you know the the toughest
overclocking motherboards that's really
set aside for the 990 FX a or 990 FX
chipsets but you do have access to all
the basic features that the average
overclocker would want you have voltage
control multiplier control frontside bus
control loan light calibration control
all the things that you would need to
get yourself a fairly decent overclock
putting something like an 80 320 or an
80 350 or even in 83 70 up into the 4.5
plus gigahertz range which is definitely
going to give you a nice boost in
performance on your AMD FX CPU so even
though this is a 970 a they still give
you a lot of the features that you would
want basic features to get some pretty
decent overclocks without really having
to get too deep and deal with some of
the really over complicated settings
like you would find on say the crosshair
5 motherboard so there you go guys the
msi 970 a sli crate Edition motherboard
it's nice to see that MSI hasn't given
up on the FX line of AMD CPUs the am3+
chip is definitely aged I mean like I
said 2011 stamped on the top of those
CPUs but they're still bringing you
current feature sets integrated into
their motherboard still coming out with
AMD FX motherboards which is great to
see so people who are building a
lower-cost budget-minded PC can still
get modern features without having to
completely break their bank by going
with an Intel build so there you go guys
tell me what you think of this
motherboard brand new on the market
first USB 3.1 motherboard for AMD really
happy to see that so I'm interested to
see how you guys feel about this how do
you feel about the black and white it's
not common we see AMD motherboards that
aren't red or black or blue I mean
really this is like nice monochrome
theme you could do like an r5 build with
this or an r4 build with this with
fractal and get a real nice kind of like
Paul's arctic panther you could get a
really nice monochrome colored build
with this thing so there you go guys
hope you've enjoyed today's video taking
a look at some AMD stuff I promised I
swear we're still doing the AMD build
that I've been tee
forever it's right there you just can't
see it the problem is I've now
encountered a problem with my test bench
that's requiring me to change out my
motherboard what just put me back more
when it comes to time with III next week
and some more 980ti stuff coming and
other projects that I have to get done
that has been set off just a little bit
but I swear we are going to do the AMD
night it we are going to do the AMD 8350
overclocked versus Intel 5820k
overclocked using the same GPUs back and
forth and comparing performance to see
whether or not you really do have to
spend a lot of money to get good gaming
computers I promise that videos coming
just bear with me I'm one person and
it's a lot to get done and it doesn't
help when we have to deal with equipment
that has to be swapped out anybody want
to work for peanuts anyway guys time to
get out of here thanks for watching
follow on social media if you have any
questions as always we will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
