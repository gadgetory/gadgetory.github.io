I'm wearing a very brightly colored
shirt which means that we're going to
bring you an affordable graphics card
review actually those two things really
have nothing in common do they either
way we're going to check out a graphics
card that gives you awesome performance
and it doesn't break the budget now it's
no secret that I really like MSI I mean
I really like MSI if that wasn't obvious
behind me
so when msi was willing to send me a
brand new r9 card that is unreleased i
had to jump at the chance to test this
card out and see whether or not this is
a card that you guys really should spend
your hard-earned money on because the
graphics card that we're going to look
at today is aimed directly at the person
who is on a budget I mean you've got the
r9 290x you got the 280x you've got the
high-end cards that are out there but a
lot of people just don't have that kind
of money to blow so we're going to take
a look at a graphics card today that is
aimed right in the middle and that is
going to be the r9 270 there it is it's
got a dragon on it and everything now a
lot of people may be looking at this
right now going what gives the 270 is
already out what's already out is the
270 X this is the 270 there's no X on it
so this is aimed right around where the
7800 series is on the 7000 series and if
you want to get really technical this
would be right around where the 7850 is
today or yesterday now let's go ahead
and talk about what it is that we're
looking at here this is the r9 270
gaming OC edition by MSI now I really
like the gaming line that they've come
out with this year 2013 was a year that
MSI launched its new gaming line of
graphics cards and motherboards and
they're aimed at just that the
enthusiast gamer now it's a mid-range
product it falls right in the middle of
their product line and it offers a lot
of really unique features that
definitely appeal to gamers one thing it
does feature that I want to go ahead and
mention first because a lot of people
have asked about shadow play and how I
feel about it but I will tell you that
this graphics card right on the back of
the box here shows that it comes with
the experience
it says predator it says experience
predator and this is a lot like Nvidia
shadowplay where it will record your
gaming as it's happening then you can
access it later and use it for playback
in videos or YouTube videos or whatever
you want to do with it
so it does feature that now when it
comes to the construction it does have
solid capacitors and it does have a 18
year gaming life on the solid caps so
the caps are rated 18 years or 150 8130
that's pretty big now the gaming edition
has a really cool design to it and their
logo in their mascot in this whole
gaming edition thing obviously is this
dragon and it looks really really cool
and this is the OSI model as I mentioned
and it does have in the gaming app easy
tune so you can set it for OSI mode
gaming mode or silent mode I don't know
anybody who's going to buy this card and
not running an OSI mode for performance
specs on the card it does have a 975
megahertz clock a 400 megahertz base
clock that's what it runs at when it's
just idling for hundreds and it has a
256 bit memory bus has 2 gigs of onboard
memory and it does have 4 DisplayPort
outputs it's got your display port HDMI
port dvi-i and DVID
it is recommending a 500 watt or greater
power supply has to have at least one 6
pin PCI Express connector and it has to
be able to supply 75 watts to that 6 pin
connector so the bottom line is any
reputable power supply company is going
to be able to power this card it's not a
very hungry card whatsoever I'm going to
go ahead and open this thing up we're
going to take a look we're going to take
a look at what comes in the box inside
the package here you have another
cardboard box and this is where you're
going to have your software your manual
and your warranty information and you
know a 4-pin molex times 2 to 6 pin and
we don't need that and you have your
user's guide in your manual and your or
your users guide in your software disk I
recommend downloading a fresh one off
the internet because things are always
changing and then you have your DVI port
to vga adapter I don't think anyone
should be using that let's go ahead and
get to what really matters here and that
is the cart we've got the card right
here in this anti-static bag and it is
definitely a liquor
you
I'm very pleased with the gaming line
for MSI from MSI a lot of gaming coolers
sometimes just look really over-the-top
they're really not very attractive but
this looks awesome especially if you're
going to the black and red build or
maybe an AMD build this is just going to
look really really hot you've got this
really awesome gaming logo right here
with the dragon on it and you've got
your dual fans on here that run at a
incredibly silent operation I mean they
move so much air and it helps that they
have this massive heatsink on there that
just runs the entire length of the card
and in fact it extends out past the back
of the card as you can see right here
you have your 6 pin PCI Express port
plug right here on the top and you do
have two aluminium heat pipes built into
this it doesn't seem like a lot that
there's only two pipes but guys remember
this is not an extremely hot chip to
begin with this is a refresh of the 7800
Series card you have your PCI Express
slot right here that's protected you
know by a little cover and then you have
a single crossfire plug right here so
you can crossfire this with another
matching card the overall design of this
looks really good it has a matte black
PCB on the back it just looks very
attractive so considering the fact that
the PCB is mostly what you get to look
at if you have a window in your system
it looks really awesome and then it has
an MSI logo right here on the top that
you get greeted with if you look into
your case with a window so aesthetics
this is a very very pleasing card I
really like the way that this looks as
we mentioned in the Box you do have your
four different ports on here your DVI
DVID full-sized HDMI and DisplayPort so
we've talked enough about the way the
card looks we talked about the specs
let's go ahead and get right in to the
benchmarks because I know that that's
what you guys would really care about
and I'm serious when I say that the
performance of this card legitimately
shocked me if you've got a budget that
you got to maintain you don't want to
miss these benchmarks ok so let's go
ahead and talk about some benchmarking
numbers here there's going to be a lot
of different stuff flashing up on the
screen so I just suggest that you pause
it to take a look at the benchmarks that
you want
for our settings here we are running
this card overclocked or running at
eleven hundred and ten megahertz I was
able to achieve more I dialed it back to
where I felt the majority of the cards
would be able to settle in on an
overclock and run incredibly cool
temperatures never exceeded 61 degrees
Celsius and the fans never exceeded 27%
fan speed that is just insane it is
super quiet couldn't even hear the thing
when I was gaming and I left the side
panel open and my headphones off if you
want a silent card definitely consider
any card in the gaming line the cooler
on this thing is just amazing that's all
I can say is amazing alright so for our
synthetic benchmark we used Unigine
Valley benchmark you know I like to use
that and we ran it here at 9 and 75 1050
and 11 hundred and 10 megahertz she can
get an idea of how its scaled when
overclocking we actually saw the biggest
improvement going from 1050 to 1110 so
you can see it really jumped up once you
opened up to 1100 megahertz and it
really liked it there and there was no
crashes whatsoever I let it run the loop
for over an hour no crashes whatsoever
now I'll put up some other games here we
got BioShock Infinite Borderlands 2 and
tomb raider just want to give you guys
an idea of what the performance looks
like just pausing on the benchmark you
want to take a look at but I know what
you guys all care about is battlefield 4
now battlefield 4 as we know as an AMD
title and AMD cards love battlefield 4
and this is no exception
so how did this mid-range AMD card
really perform now I took the lowest
averages of all the FPS benchmarks that
I did in all the different maps so what
you're seeing right here are what the
lowest averages are some maps performed
really well some maps are more stressful
than others so you're taking a look here
at what these stressful maps were and
what their averages were again as the
benchmarks pop up on the screen just
pause them at the ones you want to look
at well let's go ahead and talk about
ultra for a minute here battlefield 4 on
ultra on a card that's mid-range like
this one was absolutely enjoyable to
play on some people might look at the 50
FPS average and say well that's too low
or some people might even be saying why
is this card performing as well as it is
we know what maybe it's because it
really likes the overclock maybe
ms:i just put together a really awesome
mid-range cart and maybe AMD is just
really starting to bring it to the table
and not only going after the high-end
crown like it is with the 290x this
might be the year where mid-range AMD
cards take the crown as well because
these numbers guys they shocked me they
shocked me as much as they are shocking
you right now I'm sure and I just
couldn't believe it they the game was
butter smooth once you go through and
apply some of the fixes that I've done
other videos on to the registry and
whatnot definitely check those up the
game was butter smooth I was able to not
worry about spikes all over the place
because the average frames per second
that you're seeing here truly were
average they were very very level you'd
see some spikes and some dips but the
bottom line is it wasn't very noticeable
this screen latency or the the frame
latency was according to MSI Afterburner
was very very steady you weren't seeing
these crazy times going all over the
place the frame latency was very level
so the card is delivering you frames on
a consistent basis and we need to break
out of that concept of frames per second
and care more about the frame latency or
the time it takes to render that frame
because you could have 50 frames per
second but if the first half of that
delivered you the first half of that
second delivered you 40 of those 50
frames per second your eye is going to
perceive that as being very stuttery in
choppy gameplay so the card delivered
very smooth graphics guys if you are
looking for a mid-range graphics card
that's not going to break the bank it's
quiet its efficient and it's just giving
you an amazing bang for the buck or
price to performance ratio you've got to
consider the r9 270 it literally shocked
me and you guys know that I'm a graphic
snob I've always used the high-end cards
and I'm still shopping right now for
what high-end card I want to put in this
rig and really show off to the world
saying this is the card that J's 2 cents
is using and this just turned my world
upside down because if the 270 is
performing like this I can't wait to
experience what the higher-end cards are
really bringing to the table from AMD
I've said it before I think this might
be the year of AMD this card only proves
it guys I love MSI and it's a brand
I have spent a lot of money on out of my
own pocket and this r9 270 gaming
edition card if you're wondering if I'm
giving this away or if you're wondering
if MSI is taking it back I got news for
you it's going in my second rig that I'm
building right now and you'll have to
pry this from my cold dead hands and
even then you're not getting it
don't even try it the dragon will get
you it'll eat you I swear to God matches
you and one that feels nice Trey's got
the right way gotta write something new</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
