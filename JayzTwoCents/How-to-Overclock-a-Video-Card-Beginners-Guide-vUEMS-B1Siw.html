bringing it another one of those
tutorials where you guys like where I
show you how to do something that's kind
of fun
I guess I've not done enough of these
and I keep saying that but damn it you
guys keep telling me to do them and here
we are so today we're going to talk
about how I overclocked my graphics
cards the tools I use why you should do
it you really should be overclocking
your GPUs because there's free
performance you're just leaving on the
table and it's not right because you pay
for these amazing graphics cards and you
need to get every ounce of performance
out of them that you possibly can look
at it this way overclocking your
graphics card is like getting a free
upgrade because often the performance
jump that you can get on your graphics
card is often very similar to going up
to the next tier GPU if you had bought
it and maybe you couldn't afford it but
now you can get performance that's
similar absolutely free so don't go
anywhere
have you been putting off water cooling
your computer because you're afraid that
you're a klutz and you're just going to
screw it up well that's okay because EK
water blocks is launching its brand new
line of predator water cooling loops
that feature the exact same components
that you would find and standalone
custom built loops already put together
for you so go ahead check out the
pre-order link down in the description
and while you're there you can buy back
your man card trust me you want that man
card back do it now
okay so it's been nearly three years
since I did a GPU overclocking tutorial
and I think needless to say it is well
overdue so we're going to be using two
programs here we're going to be using
MSI Afterburner I like MSI because it
works with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs not just
Nvidia like some of the like EVGA
precision only works with NVIDIA GPUs
and we're going to be using vally
benchmark just to validate our overclock
for crashing now what we're going to do
here is we're going to install
everything and you're going to have to
do a system reboot and it's going to say
everything's been installed reboot your
system for it to take effect do that and
then when you open up MSI Afterburner
we're going to configure it and we're
going to change a couple of settings
here so click the Settings button kind
of kind of funny how that works you
click settings and you get settings oh
and also this video is version 4.1.1
if you're watching this in the future
make sure you head to msi is website to
get afterburner don't do third party
like guru 3d or anything like that get
the official from msi and you usually
will have less issues in the future so
hit settings and by the way msi is not
sanctioning this video this is just the
software that i use because i enjoy it
so if you've got an sli config I love
your GPS will show up right here
obviously I'm on skunkworks
and then if you click this button for
synchronized it will apply the settings
to all of your GPUs if you SLI or
crossfire if you only have one GPU only
one will show there and that button
won't be clickable start with Windows
and Start minimize this is to make sure
that afterburner is running so that your
profiles are always going to be in use
although there is another setting to
force it to use these profiles even when
afterburner is not running I'll mention
that in a second so we're going to
enable all the buttons here that we
possibly can except for force constant
voltage force constant voltage is very
similar to like K boost on EVGA stuff
where it'll just force a maximum voltage
no matter what we don't really want that
we want the voltage to come down we want
the temperatures to come down when we're
in between gaming or just sitting idle
at the desktop there's no reason to be
pumping all that voltage into the GPU
not doing anything all it's going to do
is wear it down over time these buttons
over here for user mode and standard MSI
and reference design whatever just leave
these at whatever they boot up
there's no reason to really change those
and then I would check for available
updates but I wouldn't use beta versions
other than that you can go ahead and hit
OK when use when you do the voltage
radio buttons there it's going to tell
you you have to reboot MSI Afterburner
for it to take effect say yes as you can
see right there
so MSI Afterburner has restarted and
there it is these are all the values
will be monitoring the only things I'm
monitoring in this tutorial are GPU
temperatures for all three GPUs in my
system GPU usage for our GPU one because
that's always going to tell me what the
max usage was and the other two GPUs
will usually follow suit if there's an
sli config and then GPU core clocks for
one two and three as you can see right
now we're all running at a thousand one
megahertz and that's because we are
encoding this video using the GPU so
they're not sitting idle like they
normally would
they are encoding this as we do this so
they are doing something and then we've
got a memory usage I only monitor memory
for GPU one because memory usage is
going to be the same for all three of
them if they're being utilized so
there's no reason to monitor them
separately as far as I'm concerned
that's that's personal though you might
want to do if you have it because I've
got three graphics cards this thing
would be like a mile long if I monitored
everything for all three now you can see
voltage is not showing in here that's
because once we enable voltage
monitoring here we can go over here to
the monitoring tab and then we can
scroll down and click voltage control or
voltage monitoring now you can monitor
anything in your system here GPU usage
CPU usage CPU temp so you could turn msi
into kind of a one-stop monitoring
system for everything in your system but
i'm only using it for the GPUs so i've
unselected the stuff that I don't want
now the other thing we want to do is
disable something called on-screen
display that's built in with rivatuner
which is the server that does all of the
overclock monitoring and overclock
application here for your graphics cards
and we are going to want to make sure
that we disable on-screen monitoring
which is what we normally have that
display that shows you temperature and
the speeds and all that stuff usually
it's a purple text we want to disable
that because that can cause some
problems and some overclocking crashing
on certain applications and
turning that off is actually the most
recommended thing to do so hit more
it'll bring up this rivatuner statistics
screen thingy and then when it says here
for global you can turn off application
a show on-screen display and then for
global makes your application detection
level is at none if you're doing your
overclocking and you've been getting a
lot or you installed msi afterburner you
start getting a lot of crashing in your
games more than likely it's on screen
display so make sure you go into more
and then turn that off last but not
least because there's a lot of settings
here and I can't cover all of it or it
would be an hour and 45 minute long
video some of you might like that most
of you wouldn't I personally wouldn't
like a video that long so we can go into
user interface make sure these two are
checked and then anything that you put
your mouse over will bring up a little
tool tip pop up that you can read and it
will tell you what those settings do so
let's go and reset our settings here so
now that we've unlocked voltage control
we can move this prior to that this was
grayed out and we couldn't touch it but
we're going to leave that at zero
because we have to know what we're
starting with
before we start changing anything so
here's what we're going to do we're
going to go ahead and run Valley
benchmark just for maybe 60 seconds here
I know it's not going to crash because
it's that stuck and we want to see what
our values are going to so we can see
what we had to play with so I'm going to
do that and then we'll be right back
okay so we had things running here and
now we can see a couple of things going
on here we can see that my graphics
cards jumped up to eleven hundred and
ninety megahertz that's about a 190
megahertz boost clock jump which is not
bad it's not great but it's not bad and
we know that we can get some more out of
that which is the whole point of this
tutorial
temperatures look good the main card
here which has the GPU hook are the
monitors four of them hooked up to it
got up to 48 degrees Celsius and then
the other to 44 and 45 so some people
might look at this for degree gap here
and be like well J obviously your
parallel conveying isn't working well
you got to keep in mind that the GPU
that has the monitors hooked up to it
are under it's under a higher load than
the other ones so it's something to keep
in mind right there that's why there's
that gap
these GPU two and three aren't doing
anything they're just assisting GPU one
nothing's hooked up into it there's no
actual pixel clock or
so engine doing anything so it's running
a little bit cooler and then there's our
GPU clock and as you can see we're back
down to 1001 because we're rendering
this video in real time so our GPU
memory our GPU voltage you can see our
voltage went to 1.17 for on GPU one and
then 1.16 two and one six eight of GPU
two again the voltage went higher in GPU
one it's under a higher load so it got
more voltage and now that we know what
our settings are doing we can go ahead
and start playing around with the core
clock now we're going to leave the core
voltage alone we don't want to touch
core voltage until we find an unstable
setting now we're going to do here is
our going to click this little arrow
next to power limit we are going to
prioritize temperature by pointing the
arrow down and we're going to drag that
all the way up now that's going to freak
some people out going why would you let
your graphics card go to 91 more than
likely it's not going to reach 91 with
the fans that are built on the graphics
cards today it would probably get up
into the 80s
it'll never hit 91 and it's better to
let the boost clock 2.0 prioritize based
on temperature than TDP or power limit
because typically there's more Headroom
and temperature than there is TDP now
we're going to start with something kind
of conservative here I I personally
already know that my Titans are capable
of 1500 megahertz and I know 1190 has a
big way to go before 11 are in 1500 but
let's just do a 100 megahertz offset now
the core clock is not the slider here
this is not the clock this is the offset
hey guys it's me editing J I'm editing
this video right now and I need to
correct something I just said what I
just said about the offset is absolutely
true for Nvidia graphics cards however
on AMD graphics cards it will be the
clock at least most of the time pretty
much all the Radeon r9 stuff is the
actual clock that you're entering in
there so if you wanted to try twelve
hundred megahertz you would type 1200 it
works a little bit differently than
Nvidia so before I get flamed and tons
of people eating confusion I thought I
would go and people potentially
underclocking the GPU I figured I would
go ahead and
chime in right now and and say that
recording Jai was stupid and editing Jai
needs to tell you that AMD cards are a
little different with the way that
slider works and it will be the actual
clock in most cases there's always
exceptions except for the times when
there's not but usually there is are you
confused yet alright go back to the show
go so if I said that two plus one
thousand then that means we're gonna try
and run 1190 megahertz and that's
obviously not going to work because that
would be a world record so what you're
going to do is you're going to start
with a number plus which is the offset
additional to what you just saw so
because I know that I was running 1190
megahertz plus 100 will get me 1290
megahertz so it's an offset or in
addition to whatever the bios boosts
clock setting is i hope that makes sense
and memory clock we're going to leave
that at zero right now so if i apply
these settings we're going to save them
to a profile now so you hit save these
are going to start flashing and then you
can save it to whatever profile you want
so we'll save it to profile one there so
now if we hit one and apply you can see
everything is where we left it if you
were to hit reset that puts it all back
to the factory BIOS settings hit number
one and apply you can see our overclock
settings just took effect now if we want
to make sure those take effect every
time we start the computer check this
box it says apply overclocking at system
startup that's going to put a profile
into the system startup so that even if
MSI Afterburner isn't running then the
overclock will still take effect another
thing you can do is you can control
which profiles take effect based on this
profile manager in the settings so for
3d profile we could say okay if it's
running a game that has a 3d profile
then run this profile if it's got a 2d
profile maybe something that's not is
I'm trying to think of a 2-d game maybe
like a side scroller or something then
you could tell it to do something else
even like watching movies and videos
would be a 2d profile so you can control
that now I like to let 2d and 3d both
run at my overclock so I applied that
profile to both hit ok startup Valley
and do it again okay so I only ran
valley for a few seconds here obviously
because I want to make sure the core
clock has taken effect so now you can
see
that +100 is getting us a twelve hundred
and seventy eight megahertz boost but
anyway we can start playing with this
now and bumping it up and up and up
until we get a crash now here's where
I'm going to explain the methodology and
the rest of the work is up to you leave
the stock voltage leave it at zero and
then increment Li increase your core
until you get an instant crash and what
I mean by that is you hit run on valley
benchmark and then it tries to load up
the scene and it just crashes it might
go to a gray screen it might go to a
lock screen the system might hang all
all together simply reboot your machine
and then bump down that overclock until
you can get the scene to load once the
scene loads then you're going to let it
run and see if it can do loops for let's
say a half-hour if it can complete a
half-hour
chances are then that you probably are
stable and you can leave it there if you
want to see if you can get more core
clock out of your graphics card then you
would go back to that value that crashed
and start bumping up voltage
incrementally and see if you get stable
it's just like CPU overclocking so if
you get if you become stable with more
voltage then you can start bumping up
the core clock some more because
sometimes bringing up the voltage will
bring where your crash was stable and
more Headroom so you you're kind of
doing this leapfrog thing once you get
your core clock stabilized then you can
start playing with memory overclock and
believe it or not memory overclocks
tend to have a pretty big impact on how
far your system can actually overclock
and have a performance actually as I
know a lot of people think that on
Maxwell you don't touch the memory
that's not true you can get a huge gain
in performance by overclocking the
memory as well as the GPU so here's what
we're going to do right now I'm going to
find the max over clocks on my Titans
I'm going to tell you about them how I
got those settings and then I'm going to
cut you guys loose and let you determine
what your settings are now remember you
can't really hurt your GPUs using MSI
Afterburner unless you have a non
factory BIOS that gives it too much
voltage control then you could damage
your GPU by doing too much voltage
control and too much heat remember your
V RMS are another factor you have to
take into account when you're doing your
overclocking because as you bump up
voltage you're putting a big stress on
that vrm as well and those can often
die before the GPU does especially if
you don't have good adequate vrm cooling
on the air coolers which a lot of
companies are not doing adequately
fortunately since I'm on water blocks
I've got much better temperature control
of the VRMs all right so I'm going to
find my max overclock on the Titans and
then I'll show you where we were okay so
here's where my overclocks on the three
Titan X is pretty much landed now the
overclocking here the stability is only
going to be as stable as the least
overclocking card at least when you have
them all linked together you could do
individual overclocking where each card
has its own overclocking profile but
that takes a lot more time it's much
more difficult because the top slotted
card typically has more typically should
be where the better overclocking card is
placed and when you're in a hard piped
water cold loop like I am it's not easy
to just swap those around like you could
if they were air cooled cards now I am
I'm running here of the plus 112 volt
because my cards loved extra voltage
power limits at 110 with the max of 91
prioritized on the temps which is
obvious how my cards did reach over 60
degrees like 65 degrees Celsius because
this room is closed it's hot I've been
benchmarking for a couple of hours in
here now and as the temperature in the
room rises so does the water cooler
parts in a water-cooled loop so it's one
of those things where it's a trade-off
yeah 65 degrees Celsius is not exactly
the coolest water-cooled setup but when
you've got three cards being
water-cooled together in the same loop
and they're tight Nexes which get really
hot it's actually not a bad temper it's
about 20 degrees Celsius cooler than one
card was in there and if I had three of
them sandwiched together with reference
coolers they would have been thermal
throttling so I'll take it trust me
but as you can see here I got what I was
like clicking away like a clicking
monster so I've got plus 250 on the core
which give me give me about fourteen
hundred and ninety eight megahertz
overclock on these cards all three of
them but a plus 400 on the memory so
nine or 800 megahertz extra on the RAM
made a big difference in the
overclocking as well so when I did my
Valley benchmarks this was my base run
right here 1440p keep in mind these
scores were at 1440 as you can see right
here because at 1080p
skunkworks does get it does get
bottlenecked actually where it doesn't
matter if it's overclocked or not the
score is the same because while
overclocking it it can't take advantage
of the extra Headroom and even stock was
creating a bit of a bottleneck on the
cards with the 5960 exits overclocked so
I'm looking forward to all this stuff
being updated with Windows or DirectX 12
and going with Windows 10 maybe in the
near future but not yet anyway so we got
a 5701 score on valley benchmark with an
average FPS of 136 point 3 minimum of 40
and a max of 223 fps so the overclocked
score here is a 60 170 with an average
FPS of 147 point 5 so our average jump
from 136 to 147 a 10 FPS jump on average
and a minimum FPS of 44 point two versus
a forty point four so a 10% improvement
once again on minimum fps and maximum
FPS actually went down ever so slightly
or no went up I'm sorry apparently
numbers are hard for me but that went up
for FPS also but the point of that is we
got that for free
that didn't cost us anything and doesn't
matter if your air cooled or water
cooled overclocking will give you gains
that are measurable for zero cost and
pretty much negligible difference in
terms of degradation or longevity
changes over the lifespan of the card
you are going to replace this card long
before overclocking with msi afterburner
whatever caused any damage and it's
unlikely that any damage you ever happen
I've never had msi afterburner damage a
card and I've been using MSI Afterburner
as long as it's been around so there you
go guys it's been a fairly in-depth how
to overclock your GPU remember baby
steps small increments at a time stock
voltage do your core clocks first then
when it starts to crash back your core
clock off slightly like maybe 10
megahertz and then bump up voltage
slightly and see if you gain stability
if you do once you're stable on the
voltage start bumping up your core
clocks again and leapfrog it till you
find that balance of where your CPU or
your GPU likes core versus voltage and
then start playing with your memory as
well alright guys time to get out of
here I hope this videos helped let
everyone know down in the comments how
you are doing on your over
clocks how much did you gain what
graphics card are you using and what
drivers you're using drivers actually
make a difference for overclocking as
well so I'm going to get the heck on out
of here I hope you guys have enjoyed
today's long tutorial and as always
don't forget to subscribe and we will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
