MSI and the new Z 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
what's up guys JC sends here and I am at
the MSI showroom here at the Venetian
and we are taking a look at a lot of new
motherboards so there's a lot that we
could possibly talk about the
motherboard we've got a new series of
motherboards here this is their M series
and we're actually taking a look on the
channel here when I get back from CVS
the new m7 motherboard here which has
some amazing features on there 3m 2's on
there there actually have a heatsink
that you can put on your m2 that's gonna
help keep it cool if you're use it as a
main drive it can keep the temperatures
down which will keep the speeds up it's
got two audio codecs on here so now for
the first time you can actually have
simultaneous control over gaming audio
and multimedia or htpc audio whatever
you want to call it so that you can have
a codec designed for whichever purpose
it's going to be and you can listen to
both of those codecs simultaneously with
multiple headphones front and rear
onboard audio is one of those things a
lot of people just kind of write off as
being useless but that's not the case
anymore
they also want with a very spaceship
design here that was the entire design
concept on this with sort of a spaceship
maybe it's you think maybe it's not but
it's actually pretty nice with the RGB
lights it's always going to match
whatever aesthetic you're going for now
moving down up down the line a little
bit here we have the gaming series as
you'd expect to designed for gamers but
it's got all the features that you need
SLI crossfire support multiple m2 s
obviously nvme support
it's got cooling in mind because long
gaming sessions put good loads and your
motherboards can get nice and hot so
they've got big heat sinks on all of
these motherboards here and of course
here we had our gaming series or Arsenal
series here where this is this that's
where I think most of you were gonna
fall right there you don't have a lot of
money to spend on the motherboard but
you don't want to sacrifice the features
and that's the game you play when you're
shopping for a motherboard but MSI's
thought ahead here that giving you again
all the features you'd expect but not
stripped down you've got multiple
chipsets here they're going to meet
whatever your price range is going to be
but also to maybe you're like
you do a lot of pro creativity you do a
lot of workstation stuff but you also
are a gamer so you get the pro series
here which gives you everything that you
could possibly need depending on what
type of system you're building that's
going to give you all the features you'd
expect that kind of meet both of those
worlds so it's kind of enough
compromises gaming and workstation
compatible motherboard multiple chipsets
once again here b250 I Pro and two
different Z 270 options there
okay graphics cards guys unfortunately
there is no 1080 T I know that's what
you guys were really hoping that Nvidia
was going to talk about at their keynote
but no so grab its cards there's not
really a whole lot new to talk about
here they do have the Silver Edition
which came out actually in October of
last year one of the issues people have
but the graphics was they're amazing
cards the coolers on them are very very
good I mean I would call them amongst
the best graphics coolers that you can
get with the twin 406 the problem is
they're a whole red and black which
unfortunately unless you're building a
red and black theme kind of clashes with
a lot of things so that's why they've
got this the Silver Edition which it
came out with last October so that kind
of fits a lot more aesthetics actually
looks really good with any of their X
power and power stuff the titanium
series stuff so unfortunately not a lot
to talk about with graphics cards so
this is going to be one that we're gonna
have to unfortunately just wait and see
things we took a look at here we will be
doing some in-depth reviews and hands-on
stuff back at the studio after the show
everything I've showed you here so far
though we're looking at a Q 1 2017
launch so as always with CES we get to
see this stuff early you got away a
little bit to see what actually comes
market maybe once again a huge thank you
to my supporters for this trip MSI's
course is my official motherboard
partner for CES 2017 and they VGA once
again for sending us here our trust and
graphics partner alright guys lots
don't go anywhere I know your your sub
boxes are exploding but trust me it's
worth it see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
