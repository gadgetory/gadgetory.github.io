the holidays which means a ton of you
are building new computers or building
your first computer building computer
for someone else or upgrading an
existing rig and instead of just buying
parts on Black Friday or Cyber Monday
and going here's what I got in the deals
that are by the time you guys see the
videos they've already passed by you
can't take advantage of them they're out
of stock I'm gonna show you guys how I
approach building a system with budgets
and I'm going to hopefully arm you guys
with information on how to spend your
money more wisely that will apply to any
time of the year the holidays have
arrived at mass drop the community
driven commerce site dedicated to
finding the best products in over 15
user driven communities mass drop is a
great place to get high quality products
at amazing prices and this year for the
holidays they're making it even easier
to find that perfect gift this year mass
drop is introducing new flash sales that
will be live on the site for a limited
time of 12 hours or until the item sells
out sign up is free and these deals
won't last get the perfect gift for your
loved one or even yourself this holiday
season by heading a mass drop by
clicking the link in the description
below so what you see right here are
just different categories represented by
parts that are required to build a
system if you're going to be upgrading
your system then obviously only the
parts that are in that category are
going to matter to you but you're going
to need a CPU right you've got to have a
processor you gotta have your memory
your storage cooling power delivery a
motherboard to plug it all into and of
course your graphics card now the
approach we're gonna take today is that
we are building a gaming system because
gaming systems also make great
workstations because typically they're a
lot more powerful than you would find
out like a typical web browsing machine
obviously now it doesn't matter if
you're talking about 500 bucks or 5,000
bucks the word budget simply means that
there is a cap that cannot be exceeded
often way too often the word budget is
confused with the word cheap now
although they are interchangeable and
the board budget typically can refer to
something as being less expensive or
lesser of the amount of money available
the word budget in my particular
vocabulary
it's a capped amount that we can't spend
so it could be $500 or $500,000 it's
still a budget so that's the way we're
approaching the word today don't confuse
it with the word cheap graphics cards
are single-handedly the most expensive
part you typically will put in your
system you could spend a hundred dollars
on a graphics card or you could spend
twelve hundred dollars on a graphics
card for just one then of course if
you're going sli it just scales up from
there although it doesn't scale great in
SLI you get the point I tend to spend
right around twenty-five percent if it's
a low-end budget like a $500 bill I'd
put about 25% of that into the graphics
card otherwise I'll go as high as 50%
because this is the single most
important part when it comes to gaming
when it comes to determining your gaming
performance now the type of graphics
card you're gonna buy has to do with a
couple of different factors one what
games are you playing do you need high
FPS like csgo players right the more FPS
the better for those guys if you are
doing role-playing games and stuff they
tend to not require as much high FPS
like 60fps will get the job done but
also what resolution are you playing at
if you're playing at 1080p you don't
need super high-end graphics cards
anymore because 1080p is getting really
easy from water and graphics cards to
push the amount of advancement we've
made with GPUs with the amount of time
1080s been the norm is very good
actually in fact if you look at the
Steam survey you can see that most
players like 9 out of 10 are still on a
1080p or lesser panel but if you want to
go with 4k or 1440p then obviously the
more graphics power you can get the
better in my opinion there's no cap I'd
go with 2 of the most powerful graphics
card you could possibly buy if you're
going for 4k or a nice mid-range to
high-end if you're going 1440 but you
know what can affect the performance of
your graphics card your CPU because if
you go with a real high-end graphics
card and you go with a real low-end CPU
you're gonna get what's called
bottlenecking a term that's thrown
around a lot and often misunderstood but
you can indeed impact the performance of
your GPU if your CPU can't handle the
task of your GPU if the GPU is sending
tons of frame rates to the to the
computer and the CPU can't actually
handle that then you get what's called
bottlenecking where the GPU will slow
down you get stutters and
in FPS which is not a good gaming
experience so if you're gonna go with a
high end GPU especially if you're going
going for high frame rate 1080p gaming
like 1440 a 14 or 144 Hertz or hire 200
Hertz even then you're gonna want to get
a nice powerful CPU now overclocking can
obviously help so if you're going with
like an i3 right this is actually a 2
core hyper-threading CPU I wouldn't
personally pair an i3 with something
like a 1070 TI I would probably pair it
with something more like a 1050 TI
because we're not going to be exceeding
the CPUs capability with the GPU and the
GPU for 1080p gaming is still more than
enough to get the job done if you're
after that mythical magical 60fps number
but if you're going for higher FPS then
you would definitely want to go with a
higher end GPU and something like maybe
horizon 7 or like a 6700 K or 7700 K
from Intel talking about CPUs now that's
the other controversy or the hard part
right Intel or AMD well the nice part of
AMD all and AMD CPUs are pretty much
unlocked all the Zen core architecture
whether it be rise in whether it be
thread Ripper
they are overclockable so overclocking
is basically like free performance if
you already have the cooling necessary
if you have to beef up your cooling to
get the overclocking then it's not
necessarily free you'd spend money on
that so that's the way I approach
budgeting as well but it's really an
interesting time because 2017 was when
AMD really made a splash in the CPU
market they actually changed the
landscape a little bit and took some
market share away from Intel which made
Intel respond by launching X 299 early
and pulling coffee lake all the way into
summer of 2017
now speaking of overclocking you
obviously are gonna have to have
motherboards that can take advantage of
that so you're not gonna take something
like an Intel 6700 K or a 7700 K or an
80 700 K and stick it on like an h2 70
or whatever the 370 version of this is
because the H basically means that it's
not overclocking it still has a lot of
features on there right still has all of
your fan headers it still has two PCI
Express slot so you can run SLI or
crossfire but it's really a stripped
down
it takes away a lot of the features you
don't care about it's just bare-bones
designed to put a CPU in there and get
up and running and for most gamers
that's gonna be good enough but if
you're an enthusiast and you want to
overclock then you definitely are going
to want to get you know like an X 370 or
even a B 350 for R for AMD which will
allow for some overclocking and stuff
and same thing on Intel right you're not
going to take that I three down there
and stick it in a Maximus motherboard
because that is just a gross negligence
an imbalance of money being spent so
you're just putting money in a
motherboard that you're getting no
performance benefit out of it so if
you're not overclocking doesn't matter
if you go with a high-end motherboard
and a low-end motherboard you're not
going to notice the difference the
difference is build quality right how
good is the vrm engineered how good's
the cooling how good is the you know the
metal used in the socket and all that
stuff so you do get what you pay for
with the motherboard it's definitely
easy to have diminishing returns
so parent overclocking CPU with an
overclocking motherboard and vice versa
I mean you just don't want to mix and
match all that right so you wouldn't put
an i3 on this Maximus with a 1050 Ti do
that put it on Reddit watch what happens
but the thing I absolutely hate shopping
for especially in 2017 with what's
happened to prices is Ram because both
of these Intel and AMD CPUs that have
come out well rise in 2017 and anything
2016 or newer with Intel pretty much
requires ddr4 it's like it's like
precious metals in the stock market it's
always fluctuating and unfortunately
we've been on an upward trend for quite
a while I like to recommend 16 gigabytes
of memory for gaming pcs in fact I even
asked that on Twitter and you guys all
agreed well most of you agreed 16
gigabytes are go home eight gigs is just
not enough anymore these days especially
with modern titles some modern titles
are even recommending 16 gigs with eight
gigs being the minimum requirement so
you don't want to create a future-proof
problem for yourself if you scrimp now
now you could get eight now and add more
later but yeah it's just unfortunate
when you can spend a hundred bucks on
eight gigs of memory back in the day you
could spend a hundred bucks and get 16
gigs or you could spend 45
50 bucks and get eight gigs no problem
whatsoever but that kind of died with
ddr3 and ddr4 is unfortunately an upward
trend we're hoping for a crash where it
comes back down but who knows now
storage this is another area where I get
a lot of questions on Twitter what kind
of storage do I need for my gaming rig
you don't technically need anything more
than spinning mechanical Drive the
problem with these is they have slow
boot times they're very slow seek times
and load times in your games and booting
for your system is going to be painfully
slow if you've ever experienced an SSD
but there's a lot of people that are ok
with that and you want to save money so
you could get a 2 terabyte hard drive
7200 rpm 64 Meg cache hard drive and you
can get that for about 50 60 bucks no
problem and that saves money for
everywhere else the problem is this
becomes in my opinion the bottleneck of
the overall experience of your PC you
could spend a lot and go with em - the
problem with em - is a lot like memory
it's very volatile it's same thing with
SATA drives we'll talk about that in a
second but MDOT - you're getting less
per dollar less gigabytes per dollar
with MDOT - that's because this direct
this goes on the motherboard directly it
can go to a PCI Express slot it's not
limited by the bandwidth of SATA it's
very very fast and because of it it's
also very sought-after
now prices have come down significantly
since it first came out but you could
still bet spend five six hundred bucks
on a say MDOT to drive no problem that's
why I recommend SATA I mean every gaming
system I build is gonna have a SATA SSD
you guys have even complained this on my
budget builds that I'm putting SSDs in
there when it's not necessary but I'm
sorry I don't want to wait two minutes
for my system to build III could see a
brand new built system fresh install of
windows take over two minutes to boot
it's just painful so I will always
recommend SATA drives even if you have
to scrimp a little bit elsewhere in your
system because they're fast they get the
job done the amount of gigabytes per
dollar that you can get with these now
is very very good in fact this 500 gig
850 Evo actually bought two of these
they're actually for the camera that
you're watching this on but technically
they I got this for a hundred and forty
nine dollars a drive the sales are
always happening on Amazon so I think
the performance per dollar of SATA is
definitely where it's at
right now now another place that's
really easy to overspend and get
diminishing return is your power supply
the only time I would recommend going
with that beefy high you know 80 plus
rating power supply is if you were
overclocking high-end hardware new like
AMD CPUs the x2 99 stuff from Intel
Nvidia graphics cards especially AMD
graphics cards that are overclocking
friendly that you can push really far
like the new Pascal stuff can
exponentially draw power so you could
take a graphics card like the 1070 TI
that's like a hundred and eighty watts
or whatever it is 190 watts and push it
to like 350 watts I mean I'm just
throwing numbers out there but like 1080
si you could push almost as high as 400
watts 1080 Ti is no problem can hit 400
watts if you're overclocking so you
definitely are gonna want to get a power
supplied that's gonna be friendly for
that so you don't want to have a power
supply that's barely on the limit of
being able to handle your hardware and
then try overclocking you'll get random
blue screens and crashes and restarts
and shutdowns which could be your power
supply now if you got a PC part picker
they actually have a really good power
meter calculator so you can put in your
parts say if you're gonna be
overclocking or not and it will give you
a very good recommendation of how much
you power is gonna be drawing and what
size power supply to go with so I think
that's a really good place to go to
figure out what size power supply but
the ratings on here the higher the metal
preciousness precious my patient
whatever that was really cringey huh the
higher the metal the more efficient it's
going to be which means it takes less
power from the wall to deliver the rated
power of the power supply I would rather
save a little money and go with like a
750 watt bronze than paying for like a
750 watt platinum because then it saves
more money elsewhere and the difference
in power being drawn from the wall is
actually not that much affected did a
video about power draw and how much it
actually cost you to run your computer
it's worth checking out
now that I said that brings us to
cooling because depending on the type of
cooling we need depends on whether or
not we're overclocking or not and what
kind of CPU we have working with like a
low wattage I three CPU you could save
some money and probably go with the Box
cooler if you're not planning on
overclocking it'll be more than enough
to get the job done but I like to err on
the side of insurance by over cooling
stuff is obviously with all the water
cleaning stuff I like to over cool my
parts but if I'm going to be
overclocking
the box cooler not going to get it done
so you need to go with some sort of an
air cooler at the very minimum now I
don't have it on display right here but
one of the most epic air coolers that
has ever lived is the cooler master
hyper 212 if you guys look at any review
of it thousands and thousands of reviews
on Newegg and amazon and all of that
probably one of the best bang for buck
coolers that you can boss possibly buy I
mean it just doesn't really get any
better than the price of performance on
that it's about 25 to 30 bucks depending
but you can scale up from there right
you can go all the way up to giant
Noctua coolers you got big push-pull air
coolers like right here you can push
pull on the evo highly recommended air
cooler if you want better than stock
cooling I recommend it
that's not sponsored or anything that's
just my opinion but you could also step
it up even farther by going with a AIO
water cooler like the Celsius right here
on the bottom because it's gonna give
you the cooling efficiency of water on a
smaller scale of than a custom loop
really probably putting water in your
system is if you've never done it before
it's probably gonna be a little bit
scary because everyone's afraid of leaks
it's a risk it could happen
personally it's only happened to me
twice in like the last 15 years of water
cooling but it's a it's just it's an
enthusiast thing I like to do it I'm
going to continue to do it if you want
to step up from an AI oh you could go
with a full custom loop in a box like we
have right here with the fluid gaming
series from ek comes with all the parts
you need all the fittings even the
jumper to jump your power supply to
believe the system so depending on how
far you want to overclock or how far how
many cores and all that is gonna depend
on the type of cooling you'll go with
but I highly recommend air if you want
maintenance-free operation just blow out
some dust every now and then I that
might surprise some people hearing me
say I recommend air but that's a
situation that makes a lot of sense and
then of course water cooling now what
you don't see on the table here
obviously is cases that's because I tend
to see what I have left over after I've
chosen the parts that actually affect
performance because cases only do two
things
they're box to put your parts in and
then they create a cooling environment
because when you have a case and you
have intake fans and exhaust fans you're
promoting directional airflow which is
going to blow air over the RAM and the
motherboard and the back plate of the
grab
card which helps take heat out of your
system now that's how you're going to
determine what kind of case you need if
your air cooling decent amount of air
flow will get the job done if your water
cooling you want to make sure that you
can fit your radiator of course if you
buy a 360 ride you get a case it only
supports 240 rads that's obviously a
problem you also want to make sure that
if you're going with a very tall air
cooler that your case is large enough to
actually fit the air cooler with and
still close the side panel something
else forgot to mention with coolers
though too is you also want to make sure
that if you go with a big cooler and you
have tall Ram this actually isn't tall
Ram right here this is tall Ram if you
go with tall Ram anyone picture it's
gonna clear underneath your air cooler
most modern air coolers now are better
about offsetting in such a way that
they'll fit definitely something worth
keeping in mind though so it really
comes down to aesthetics and personal
taste and size constraints because if
you have a limited space that can go in
you're not gonna go with like a giant
like EVGA case like what's behind me
right here and if you've got a big space
that you want to fill in with a big case
because you're like big cases mean I've
got a big gaming addiction then you're
not gonna want to put a tiny little ITX
case in there so you also have to look
at it if it's ugly and you don't like
the case sure you could switch it later
but try get something that at least
appeals to your taste the confusing part
about building a new system especially
for first-timers is which cooler do I go
with and which power supply and which
this and which that and then all the way
down to ok I picked that one at 1070 t I
do I get an EVGA doing it at Asus and
MSI do I get a girl acts what do I do
for the most part guys it's all gonna
perform pretty much the same all 1070 Ti
is performing roughly the same Alton 80s
so go with the one you think looks best
and has good reviews for cooling and
stuff like that if you think I missed
something put it down in the comments
below there's a wealth of information
behind my behind me with my followers
there's a lot of people down there that
are always willing to help and I'm proud
of my viewers for offering up the help
so keep it civil guys have some good
conversation down there let me know if
you think I missed anything
I'm gonna go thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
