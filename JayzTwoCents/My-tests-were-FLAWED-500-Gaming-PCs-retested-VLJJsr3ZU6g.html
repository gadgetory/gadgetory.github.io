might notice the set behind me we never
tore it down because when I did that
budget build video a lot of you guys
were like hey I don't agree with that
hardware you could have done it this way
he made it better and you know what you
guys were right jisu cents is sponsored
by precision camera and video Texas
largest photographer and video retailer
located in Austin for over 40 years
they're giant 20,000 square foot
showroom floor local workshops and
worldwide shipping are just a few
reasons why you should head right now to
precision - camera comm so on that video
you guys saw that I used an H 270 m for
the pentium g 45 60 F if those ever seem
to remember four or five six - the arrow
45 60 you guys were mad because that was
a on Amazon with 87 99 kind of expensive
right and you guys were mad at me you're
like you could have gotten an H 110 and
done a BIOS update because it's it will
support seventh gen CPUs with a BIOS
update and you could get that much
cheaper well that's what I got right
here the same day that video went live I
ordered an h1 10m gaming three I'm not
convinced that it has the BIOS on it
that I already need to update the Intel
you know the BIOS to recognize the Intel
seventh gen processor but yeah things
are happening over there anyway yeah so
if for some reason I put in the Pentium
and it doesn't recognize it means the
BIOS is out of date the problem is and I
didn't think about this until after I
ordered it I can't update the BIOS if it
doesn't recognize because I don't have
any 6th gen processors hanging out I
don't I don't have anything 6700 K a
6600 any of that so I may not be able to
update it and try it with this
motherboard that might have to be a
follow up video but the good news is if
I just take that processor and stick it
in this motherboard and run the test
that stock speeds like we did before
nothing's gonna change in termina
performance it's just a cheaper
motherboard with an the older chipset
but I would definitely like to test that
to keep it as apples as Apple's as
possible but you guys were also like
what the hell what what gives you why
did you get an a320 motherboard and then
put Rison in it obviously got to
overclock it to make it better well I
picked up the be 350 gaming pro from MSI
because it came in actually at the exact
if you guys could see the look nick is
kidding me right now
I guess we're gonna test your ability in
this I bought that I don't hear any
Raylan oh it's hanging over the edge I
see that now
where was I oh yeah yeah so I just
bought that motherboard and it costs by
the way you guys can find links to this
stuff down at amazon ste $9.99 so that
was the exact same price as what I paid
for the a320 motherboard huh now I see
why you guys are so mad so what we're
gonna do today no fancy editing or any
montages or that crap we're gonna just
go ahead and we're gonna stick the
Athlon in this motherboard update the
BIOS and then we are going to run our
tests again and then put the Rhys n3
back in there run our test again and
then we'll see where it stood up to the
Pentium processor he's alive you guys
were super mad about that video if you
guys are sure what your video I'm
referencing to it'll pop out here you
guys can go and check it out all right
we'll be back in a sec why am i turning
drop its products so this video has kind
of taken an interesting turn here in
that we were testing stuff obviously
once again the Intel fortunately booted
with our motherboard I did of course do
a BIOS update on the AMD board as well
to make sure that it supported Verizon
fully even though it worked there were
updated our updates with things like
memory support whatnot so always update
your BIOS guys when you're doing
motherboards with new platform trust me
it's important couple of interesting
things here though we noticed what the H
110 that we were seeing slight drops in
performance on the intel side very very
very slight drops but drops nonetheless
so worth pointing out but what we
noticed was when I started running the
Athlon against we tested the Athlon once
more I want to see if there was a boost
if there was any overclocking ability
whatsoever with B 315 Athlon there
really wasn't it wouldn't let me change
anything so the Athlon is truly locked
down and those numbers were as
consistent as could be so if you're
going with the Athlon processor and you
don't plan on upgrading or I don't know
I don't mean people really don't plan on
upgrading their PC but the a320 it
performed exactly the same as the B 350
and considering this this motherboard we
got here right the B 350 M gaming pro
versus the where is it the a 320 m HD -
from gigabyte being the same price might
as well at least get the B 350 but we
know so the performance was pretty much
identical across the board almost down
to the fraction when it comes to the FPS
but something interesting happened when
I put the Rison 1200 on the B 350 we
started seeing that all those scores
improved slightly they they were still
nowhere near the Intel scores and a
couple of things I want to talk about
with that and don't like draw the
conclusions yet there's there's some
interesting things we discovered we need
to talk about one I I've used this
processor already guys remember I did
like the seven hundred and fifty dollar
build where I used the tomahawk board
which is better suited for overclocking
than this guy is this does not have this
is not a motherboard designed for like
high-end overclocking it's just got some
unlock features on it but we noticed
that I could not get anywhere near the
processor speed or memory speed that I
could get on
tomahawk board I was able to achieve 3.9
gigahertz on the tomahawk as well as 30
200 megahertz with not the same memory
but a different memory module on the
tomahawk on here I can only get 20 667
out of the memory and we know rise in
love memory speed so that's something to
keep in mind that again that could just
also be you know the the quality of the
memory and whether or not that it wants
to overclock 2,400 is its XMP profile I
was running at 20 667 could not get
higher and then I was only able to run
the CPU at 3.6 and like I said I could
get 3.9 at the tomahawk if I went three
point seven or anything higher it just
continued to hard lock on boot couldn't
get a post power cycle stuff like that
and that was on the newest bios so I was
hoping with 200 extra megahertz 3.4
versus 3.6 that we would see an
improvement in performance and we did
not so that tells us two things one the
processor is not bottlenecking at 1050
right the Athlon was a little bit but
horizon 1200 should not be behind
electing at 1050 and it wasn't but when
we looked started looking really closely
side by side at the frequencies being
achieved between the AMD system on Rison
1200 and the Intel g40 560 we noticed
that the Intel system was running
slightly higher on frequency for the GPU
usually right around 1779 1780 on the
frequency versus around 13 or 17 36 on
the AMD system and I started wondering
if what was going on there well
obviously maybe the score differentials
we were seeing had something to do with
the processor slowing down the GPU so
what we did was we then switched the
GPUs right we got is we got two of them
right here obviously we switched the
GPUs and ran the tests again and guess
what we saw a really significant
increase on the AMD side and a decrease
on the intel side so what at the end of
this video we actually learned over to
different videos of playing around with
this hardware spending I don't know at
least ten hours or more playing with
this stuff now we learned that what was
more important than what CPU you were
using in terms of performance was the
differential in quality between the GPUs
even though these are exactly the same
GPU from the exact same manufacturer I'm
about to drop the box they're just boxes
guys chill
I'll put him down we learned that there
was a difference in variance and
performance between both those GPUs
which made a bigger difference overall
than what CPU you were using Verizon
versus Pentium so that I guess that
makes sense right you're talking about
things like ASIC quality you're talk
about GPU boost 3.0 that's gonna take
various things into factor the amount of
power being news the amount of power
available to it
remember these do not have supplemental
power so they're pulling power only
through the motherboard and that means
that we're also dealing with
temperatures and difference of quality
there we notice one of the cards gets
about 6 C hotter than the other card
which is going to affect the amount of
GPU boost performance that you can get
out of it manual overclocking brought
the two closer together but that really
shows that out of the box there is more
important there was more difference with
the GPU performance affecting our scores
than the CPUs so I guess there's a huge
moral of the story there now obviously
there's more to CPUs than just GPU
performance right you would choose a CPU
for multiple things multiple tasks tasks
and stuff so I'm gonna do right now is
I've got Cinebench up right here we're
just gonna compare the two now in
cinnamon I know that's only one
synthetic it doesn't tell the whole
story but at least it's something to
kind of go off and I'm gonna hand these
off to Nick he's gotta come get these
now props were a good idea but then they
got in the way so I'm gonna start both
of these tests on the count of three one
two three and you'll see now that when
it comes to both of these there is a
pretty significant difference on the
rise end when it comes to you know the
Cinebench workflow then there is on the
Intel and this was one of the complaints
I heard on the previous video too was
like yeah Gaming is only one thing but
you know if I'm gaming and I have a live
stream open or youtube open on another
screen listening to music listening to
videos I got multiple things going on
then what then am I going to get a
better experience on AMD or am I going
to get a better experience on Intel and
if you use Cinebench as sort of a base
marker you can see obviously rise n is
just smashing the Intel when it comes to
multi-threaded performance and it goes
without saying and people know Intel has
better instructions per clock which
games will usually leverage but when it
comes to overall compute tests and you
know if you're doing multitasking then
the Rison system you can see is
significantly ahead of the Intel so I
guess a little bit it looks like right
because there are two different sized
monitors one
one looks like it's way ahead but it is
definitely ahead that's something else I
need to mention - two different size
monitors but wrote both running 1080p
the size of the panel does not mean the
number of pixels some people were really
confused with that in the last video
it's not because it was a bigger panel
that that meant that was gonna be harder
on the GPU doesn't really work that way
but I'm just killing time now wait
please to finish you guys can see in
real time the the timing difference
between these two systems right the the
Intel still going risin has been done
for a while Rison just did a 557 score
still waiting for Intel to catch up
hyper-threading yo get in there almost
done
that was a huge difference between the
two huh in terms of time so yeah it's a
380 2 versus the 557 so that's
significant at least in that one test so
there's actually two different takeaways
here right if you were comparing the
Athlon with the a320 or the B 350 right
the same price you can put the Intel on
an h1 10 and bring the price down to
match that under $500 both both
platforms will give you a really good
experience for under 500 I'd still go
with the G 4560 obviously versus the
Athlon but if you're going to compare it
to the 500 plus price point and you're
definitely going to get more performance
out of the AMD at the 520 ish dollar
range on a be 350 platform compared to
the Intel when it comes to multitasking
and stuff like that you just have to
keep your fingers crossed when it comes
to the overclocked ability which is kind
of the last point of today's video if
you're new to building computers and
you've not spent a lot of time on this
you don't geek out over it you're just
trying to get your feet wet in this
genre and you have no very little
experience to go off of I don't know how
much time you're gonna spend trying to
overclock this because even with all my
knowledge of Rison I had to go through
quite a bit of testing and quite a bit
of failures and crashes and CMOS clears
to bring the system back after I was
trying to find my Mac stable overclock
which is another thing to consider right
if you don't want to overclock it if
you're scared to overclock it out of the
box performance at stock speeds the
Intel is still edging it out just a
little bit in games but still not in
multi-threaded tests there's a million
different ways we could have done this
test and I want to continue this series
so if you have some suggestions on what
we should do to continue this series of
budget testing then definitely guys put
your comments down below these videos
exist because of those comments
obviously this one as well something to
go now guys thanks for watching don't
forget Jays two cents merch available
link down below of this video and once
again a huge thank you to me for
sponsoring today's video I have my own
pocket so thanks for that smash the like
button again if you guys appreciate that
as always I will see you in the next
video I had to thank myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
