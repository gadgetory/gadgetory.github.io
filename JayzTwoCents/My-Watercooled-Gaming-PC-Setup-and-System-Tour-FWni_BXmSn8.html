what's up guys you're watching Jays two
cents and today I'm going to bring you
probably one of the most requested
videos of the entire year and that is to
bring you a video about that big guy
right there in the back and what I use
for a gaming setup and more about my
system so let's go ahead and turn around
and take a look at all this crap while I
look like I'm doing that little Carlton
dance it's not unusual to have fun
I don't dance like I just go ahead and
turn around get into this PC and all of
this stuff and see what Jay is using as
of August 2013
now when it comes to entertainment here
in the man cave we what on hmm I've got
myself a 32 inch insignia 1080p high def
LED TV it's not the it's definitely not
high-end but I don't watch that much TV
so I don't really need to have you know
high-end TV got the Vizio sound bar
because the Insignia TV sound sucks and
there you go
vizio sound bar and down there we got my
RC car which I've played with too much
but well maybe someday we'll bring that
back on out right here we've got my
preview monitor my monitors monitor I
use this when I'm doing my editing and
stuff I use all my previews on this this
is a Samsung 23 inch 120 hurt 3d monitor
finally is it for any gaming I could use
it for testing you know 120 hurt
capabilities on video cards but it does
not have an HDMI input which really kind
of bothers me so I pretty much just use
it as a second monitor for monitoring
streams or checking out the reviews and
whatnot this is my main monitor it is a
27-inch
it's an Acer it's not an IPS panel I'm
just too cheap to afford IPS panels but
hey you know it gets the job done it's
27 inches it's 1080p HDMI all that good
stuff and when it comes to a keyboard of
course I am using the course here k70
mechanical gaming keyboard here it looks
like it has dancing LEDs unfortunately
it doesn't that's just uh that's just
the way it gets picked up on the camera
I love this keyboard if you haven't seen
my review of this keyboard click the
video that's going to pop up right about
now boring but I did that sound effect
with my mouth yeah check it out it's an
awesome keyboard I love every feature of
this it's mechanical without being you
know too loud and I just flipped all
over my channel I probably spammed
myself oh well whatever so yeah check
out that keyboard love this keyboard
super quiet when it comes to mechanical
keys but it feels amazing I have no
complaints about this keyboard what so
and when it comes to my mouse I am using
a wireless Logitech G 700 s Gaming Mouse
awesome Mouse I have no real complaints
about it other than the battery dies on
it a little bit quickly I mean you got
to keep a cable nearby because it's a
yeah it only lasts for maybe 2 days if
you don't leave it plugged in but no
real complaints about it smooth slides
really freely here I have no complaints
about that whatsoever so yeah if you
look for guinea mouse little pricey
about a hundred bucks but you know it's
a good Wireless Gaming Mouse if that's
what you want when it comes to my webcam
I am using the Logitech c920 is an
amazing amazing webcam I'm a little
embarrassed to admit how often I tend to
use this webcam for my videos rather
than actually doing any sort of a you
know high-end camera work I mean I've
got this camera right here as you can
see but I tend to use this little guy
more because it's just so simple and so
easy and then if you're looking for a
webcam there's a Logitech c920 is
definitely the way to go I am not paid
to say that purely my opinion right
there look at that camera work look at
that camera work woah yeah oh yeah yeah
baby
so yeah I'll just taking C 928 when I'm
doing my streams with and a lot of my
youtube videos to be honest now when it
comes to microphones I get asked an
awful lot what I use in my videos when I
do commentaries or reviews and stuff I
tend to use my blue Yeti here it's just
a USB mic and it is connected to a hile
PL 2t desk boom which you can see is
just mounted right there and put a
scratch in my walls on a bitch and
anyway it is fully articulating and
adjustable as you can see I mean it goes
up down left right a B select start all
that stuff and you know I use a just a
cheapy people have asked about this pop
filter and it's just like an $18 cheap
pop filter from Guitar Center there's
nothing special about it whatsoever
people are always asking about how I
have such good audio with the Yeti
because there sucks well honestly it all
comes down to the game guys if you look
at the gain on the back here it's going
to be upside
down if you look at the game I've got it
nearly all the way down on the cardioid
pattern and then you let windows do the
adjustment for the actual volume that
way you're not getting horrible clipping
and stuff so yeah yeah blue Yeti there
it is but I know what it is you guys
have all come here to see and it's this
guy right here you guys want to see more
about this so I guess let's go ahead and
just dive right in okay guys when it
comes to the case this is the 900 D by
Corsair it's brand new this year and it
is the largest mass-produced case on the
market not including case labs or
mountain mods because you have to put
those together but this this is a
mass-produced case it's the largest you
combine it absolutely dwarfs anything
else you can see right here I don't have
any five and a quarter Bay's on the
front it has a flip-down case or cover
here that shows your USB 2.0 3.0 ports
restart switch power switch which is
right here on the front and then you've
got this this brushed aluminum panel
here that you can remove and reveal all
the dust on the back which exposes my
fan filter and showed you my 120 SP
Corsair SP 120 fans on the front and
then you can see some of my water
cooling hoses right here on the front as
well when it comes to the main side
panel here of the case you can take off
the cover really simply by pushing the
button here and pull the whole front
just pops right on off and we'll set
that aside there and as you can see the
whole side there just popped off but
once you know so yeah there you go right
off the bat you guys are probably
noticing that I'm using orange juice to
cool my system and that's because the
citrus acid inside of orange juice is
just absolutely phenomenal when it comes
to killing anti microbials and corrosion
you know anti-corrosion benefits so it's
not orange juice guys please for the
love of god don't listen to me this is
Mayhem's pastel sunset yellow nano fluid
that's what it is that's a it's a lot of
stuff to say for a cool but yeah here's
my loop if you bring down the door here
you can see we have an alpha coil xt 45
45 millimeter thick quad radiator if you
want to learn a little bit more about
that you can go ahead and click this
link that up
up right about here pointing I did that
with again with my mouth so don't you
know the don't ask me where you can
download that sound effect unless you
want to buy it for me but you can see
right here it's got you know a filter on
there it's a magnetic it just sticks
right onto the case there and you know
I've also got a triple x t 45 alpha cool
radiator in the back the loop here is
being powered by MC p9 sick or MPN CP 6
5 v variable speed pump by swift tech it
does have the threaded neck on there so
you don't have to deal with any of the
plastic stuff I've got all alpha cool
swivel Barb's here again you can check
that out by going to this link ah and
learn more about those fittings the
radiator loop here is feeding into an EK
water block for my gtx 680 and it is a
EK a nickel with a clear acrylic cover
on there so you can see what looks like
the yellow orange juice is kind of
flowing all through my system there that
feeds into the nexus water block which
is feeding my 3770k and keep it nice and
cool when it's overclocked to four point
eight gigahertz and then it goes back
into my bits power 250 millimeter res
mounted right here now the airflow comes
you've got the two fans in the front
bringing air in and then you've got the
two SP 140 s on the top and then one SP
140 on the back pulling the air across
and up and the quad radiators bring in
air in feeding into the power supply and
the triple radiator which is you'll
bring an air all the way across so
that's my water cooling setup right
there it's definitely pricey it's it's a
way overkill hoping to do something in
the future that may require all of this
cooling right here but nonetheless it's
good to have more cooling than not
enough when it comes to the fans though
these are SP 120 on the radiators as
well as on the front like I mentioned
these are all quiet addition fans it's
very very quiet PC don't even when it
comes to you know audible and how noisy
it is you can hear a pin drop I mean
it's absolutely insanely quiet because I
am cooling or controlling these fans
with the phobia touched expand
controller and
this fan controller up here is just
controlling all of these fans at the
exception of the quad radiator which is
being controlled by software on the PC
when it comes to the motherboard I am
using the as Roxy 77 OC formula amazing
motherboard have nothing but good things
to say about it amazing overclocking
very stable the debugging features on it
or her amazing if something doesn't work
it'll tell you what's not working you
don't have to think about it unless of
course it's the motherboard that's not
working and then it may not really know
what's going on but I digress for the
CPU I am using an i7 3770k I do have a
video about why I chose that right about
here right and you can go and check that
video out and it'll tell you why I chose
to 3770k over the 4770k and then I am
using a msi reference GTX 680 with the
water cooling on it that is overclocked
to 1300 and six megahertz it's just so
fast there was no reason to upgrade this
whatsoever power supply wise I'm using a
ax 750 by Corsair it is an 80 plus gold
rated power supply the fan doesn't even
run on it ninety percent of the time
because it's so efficient it doesn't
even get hot even when gaming the fan on
the power supply will turn off where
most you know PWM supplied power fans on
the power supply will turn on under load
this one's just so efficient it barely
ever turns on that it's absolutely
amazing for hard drives I have I am
using the hot swap Bay built into the
900 D you know it does come the 900 II
does come with four hard drive bays
comes with a triple here another triple
there two more triples on the bottom but
I took all of that out because I'm only
using three hard drives I had to make
room for my water cooling setup you know
I've got the the seven or the one
terabyte hard drive here 7200 rpm that's
my you tube driver all my videos get
directly recorded to I've got my
redundant backup drive here that does my
daily backups of all of my important
data and I've got my SSD up here which
is a crucial m4 it's only 128 gig I
definitely could use a bigger drive but
whatever when it comes to five and a
quarters you'll notice I don't have any
five and a quarter bay dry drives in
here no DVD drives or blu-rays or any of
that
do purely digital now and then like I
mentioned earlier have the phobia touch
six fan controller controlling all of my
fans when it comes to overall this case
it is absolutely gargantuan it's huge
the system performs more capable than I
needed to it does all my rendering
extremely fast I do all of my rendering
on Adobe Premiere Pro I use the Adobe
cloud so it's all legit in case you guys
are wondering and don't bother asking me
where you can get Adobe because I'm
going to tell you go buy it because
that's just the right thing to do so
this has been my my gaming system here
as of August of 2013
I do plan on making some changes to this
later in the year go and check out most
of these components are have a review
video for them somewhere on my channel
and at the end of the video I'm going to
link up all of those reviews please
click on those and go and support huge
thank you of course to alpha cool for
sending me a lot of the parts that you
see here the radiators the fit the
radiators the fittings the block on the
CPU this stuff is just you know I'm a
hardcore water cooler I've been doing it
for a decade and I definitely wouldn't
be running this stuff in my own personal
system whether it was provided to me or
not if it doesn't if it didn't actually
perform like I need it to what else can
you say there you go guys there's my
setup here on J's - sense this is what I
use every day to bring you guys videos
live-streaming gaming all that in crap
so if there's any questions that you
have about anything you've seen in this
video just ask down in the comments I'll
do the best I can to answer your
questions and as always if you enjoyed
this video
mash the like button share it with a
friend show you grandma and I swear to
god your grandma's gonna love this
gaming system you know should probably
get out here and start rockin some
battlefield with me here any single
moment so guys I'm gonna get out of here
hopefully I'm going to do something fun
in the future we've got one year right
around the corner and as always thanks
