cents and recently I've been doing
effect over the history of my channel
I've been reviewing portable batteries
wyd I've been reviewing portable
batteries well because i'm a very
portable person i'm always on the go and
when CES coming up I like to Kate stay
connected because last year my battery
was constantly dying in the charging
stations at CES are about 500 people
deep and you only get a few minutes to
charge your battery and well you know
that does it doesn't work so I'm going
to stay connected at CES so we already
took a look at the ravpower luster
flashlight thing that I guess apparently
I gave some of you guys an epileptic
seizure I'm sorry sincerely I'm sorry
about that I'm gonna kill you hope you
stay subscribed but anyway rat power has
now sent me this massive 14,000 milliamp
portable battery Wow 14,000 milliamps
you can charge your iPhone 5 7 times off
of this you could charge a galaxy s4
even a note like six times off of this
and if you could hook it up to your
laptop you could probably charge a whole
laptop office you can charge your iPad
more than once it's just let's just go
ahead and dive into it I was impressed
with the build quality of the last rav4
product I took a look at which was that
Lester charter if you didn't see it
click on here it's going to pop up but
this is the deluxe series power bank and
the model is the RPP be thirteen
fourteen thousand million holy crap it's
very heavy too this isn't the kind of
thing you're going to stick in your
pocket when you take it out of the
package here yeah and it does on the
back of the box show some of the other
products they carry you know you can go
to the website check that out here it is
it's in this plastic sleeve it's very
heavy it's about the size of like a
portable hard drive ish about that size
like two and a half inch hard drive with
an enclosure
you have your product manual you have
your warranty card definitely fill that
out because you want to keep it warranty
and you have this little baggie comes
with a baggie of methamphetamine no save
it in here is a couple of things that I
think is really cool that sets this
charger apart typically you have to
choose what it is you're going to be
charging that you have to buy a micro
USB charger or maybe a standard mini USB
or an iphone 5 charger or whatever and
even though this has two USB one amp
outputs you could charge multiple
devices on this at the same time and it
has the 5 volt in charger right there it
comes with this it comes with two cables
in here as well as a whole host of
different adapters like you have a
iphone 30-pin charging right there
you've got your micro USB right there
you've got a mini USB right there you've
got a holy crap that super tiny I have
no idea what that fits right there and
then you have the two cables that these
are falling on the floor these attached
to like that so you just plug in the tip
that you want to use now unfortunately
this doesn't include a lightning port
for iphone 5 but that's really not a
problem if you're an iPhone 5 user or an
iPad Mini user or whatever you can just
plug your USB cable directly into this
but the cool part is that this has you
pretty much covered you know if you're
out with someone who like hey I need to
charge my phone and you're like hey what
kind of phone you have and they have
like a really old motorola razr that
uses an old USB port really when I don't
have that well there's one right here so
it's pretty much got you covered on
really common types of batteries it
comes to us pre-charged three-quarters
of the way and you have these LED this
LED strip right here that lights up to
show you how charged it is and then you
also have this built-in little LED light
blue that it's not as bright as it's
actually still pretty bright it's not as
bright as the LED flashlight that we
checked out but you know hey
does dual purpose I mean that's cool i
like getting stuff included that's extra
so there it is 14,000 milliamps I mean
you really can't go wrong with that I
mean this will keep you charged for a
week off of the plug and it's got more
than 500 cycles capable now that's 500
cycles of this battery that's 500 times
fourteen thousand million that is really
really cool and the price on this I I'm
not going to say what the prices because
the price is always changing but at the
time of filming go down in the
description and check it out I think
you'll be shocked at how much this costs
so if your college student and or you
travel all the time fly on airplanes
your business professional you just have
to stay connected you have multiple
devices and I've had an iphone or a
kindle or galaxy nexus 7 whatever it is
adjacent galaxy nexus that was retarded
and nexus 7 or a galaxy tab whatever you
can stay nice and connected if you were
to use just a standard smartphone on
this on a full charge i calculated you
could go about seven days of average use
having never touched a wall plug just
using this so there you have it guys the
ravpower deluxe power bank 14,000
milliamp and they are available in
different sizes 14 thousand eight
thousand four thousand there's a whole
range of product and this is this is
this is pretty awesome so make sure you
go and check it out guys some j's two
cents taking a look at the deluxe power
bank here from brad power really like
their products you probably see more of
it on the channel here in the future but
as always if you liked this video you
know to do it if you don't like it then
you can punch your screen and then i'll
laugh because you broke a train but
whatever hope to see you guys I just hit
the mic hope to see you guys in the
future as always subscribe if you're new
