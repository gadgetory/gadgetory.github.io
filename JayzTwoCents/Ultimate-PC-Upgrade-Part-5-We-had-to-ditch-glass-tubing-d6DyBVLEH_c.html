to God this time around this project has
been nothing but a pain in the ass no
not honestly I don't mind they're being
conflicts with this bill because every
time I overcome a conflict it arms me
for the future to be able to overcome
these issues if they arise and be able
to handle em a little bit faster than
I'm handling them this side the asrock B
box and 3,000 B sets a new standard for
desktop miniaturization with its super
mini sleek form factor it seamlessly
fits into any tight space and powered by
the Intel n 3000 2.0 8 gigahertz
processor USB type-c wireless 801 11 AC
Wi-Fi and 4k playback mean the beatbox
from as rock may be small but packs a
serious punch click the link in the
description to find out more
so what's holding it back today and why
you guys haven't seen much of an update
is because of the fact that you guys
know we were waiting on the 1080s we got
the tan eights a couple weeks ago
actually just now getting a chance to
start working on this but now we're
seeing an incompatible compatibility
here with the tubing and I'm going to
show you guys that right now so what you
see right here is a piece of 13
millimeter glass tubing and yeah it
seems pretty an extraordinary if you
will nothing special about it this is a
piece of 13 millimeter PE TG tubing
we'll put that right next to it and what
you see right here is a 13 millimeter
rigid compression fitting from primo
chill so that's the base there's the
o-ring that goes in there and then of
course here's the compression top now
when you put your 13 millimeter PGG in
there fits fine actually go do the
o-ring but you know I mean if it's fine
like that then the compression fits
right over that you clamp it down and
all is good well when I went to do the
glass tubing I can show you here the
first thing I noticed is the tubing does
not fit in side of the compression right
there I thought okay well I guess maybe
the maybe the compression is a little
bit smaller than the 13 millimeter
advertised so it has a tight fit okay so
I took my caliper tool and I want to
measure what that opening was to make
sure that it wasn't the fittings fault
that it wasn't fitting get it the
fittings fault it wasn't fitting and
actually measured twelve point eight
seven millimeters so just slightly
smaller but that wasn't an issue because
as you can see the 13 millimeter ptg
fits through there just fine so then I
went on to measuring the glass tubing
here as you can see it is measuring in
at thirteen point one eight and it
varies a little bit throughout the the
tube where you measure what emerges is
that one right there is thirteen point
three O at the end at the very end right
there it measures thirteen point two
nine so it's not perfectly straight and
it's much larger than the 13 millimeters
as advertised so I was like well you
know that's not a big deal I'll just
stand down all the compression fitting
openings and then we'll be good
unfortunately that's not going to work
because here's the problem if you look
inside the fitting right there
it's channeled at that same measurement
as the opening of the compression so I
would have to bore out all of these the
problem is once I start boring that out
I want to make sure I don't get any
leaks or anything and the other issue
was because there's only one Oh ring on
these compressions that hold everything
together there's no inner o-ring inside
here it's just this one that squeezes
against this cambered or this chamfered
face right here then you get a lot of
flex in the lines now this is ptg so of
course is a little bit of extra flex but
there's a lot of flex so we just want to
take the chance so the owner of red
misses pretty much said fine ditch the
glass just go with PE TG and get it done
and I'm like okay fine PGG is easy I can
get it out of here quick I've only got
to do two bends the only two bends I've
actually got to do are this guy right
here so it's a 90 90 and then a 90 into
the CPU and then this Bend right here is
always the hardest every time I've ever
done this Bend this is the hardest but
anyway then he's going to use these
fittings that he's not using on his
friends build so yeah anyway we can
start to to wrap this up now but yeah
that's what's been taking so long so I'm
gonna do today is I'm just gonna try and
get these two bends taken care of get
the blocks put on the GPUs and then this
thing will be closer then once I get the
lighting installed then I just had to do
the wiring and she's done man it took
way too long one other thing I want to
mention real quick too is because I know
someone's going to ask since I have last
tubing in the build in the corner back
there that's the Nano s build J why
don't you just use 12 millimeter tubing
in the pits bits power fitting since you
know they're going to work one I
personally feel that twelve millimeter
in a case this big is going to look way
too small twelve millimeter looks small
in that Nano s so I don't want to
imagine how small it's going to look in
this case I think it'll the tubing will
look undersized to given the size of the
case too
that means buying all new fittings for
the upper end fittings that run about
ten to twelve dollars a piece
and then he's going to need the elbows
for them as they need the compressions
that adds up to a couple hundred dollars
with the fittings on top of everything
he's already purchased plus having to
buy new glass so this just really turns
into a cost savings now it's like okay
do the PT G we know it's shatter
resistant I can actually polish it up
and
been doing some polishing here with the
plastics I use it on the cars like
headlights and stuff but it works really
good on the ptg so it can get out those
micro scratches and and just kind of a
dullness that ptg has so once you polish
it it actually looks really really good
once it's done in fact I polished this
bottom tube right here as you can see
and it's pretty shiny yeah compared to
the other tubes up here like you can
kind of see just how dull I know things
have focused on but this tube right here
is kind of dull especially compared to
the bottom one which I've already
polished up so I think it's gonna look
good at the end well there's the first
tube done first try no wasted pieces I
think that turned out pretty darn good
if you ask me now we just gotta do this
bad I swear I what is about this Bend
but skunkworks had it and all of its
revisions the first red mist had
something similar and this I always like
take five tries get this one I think
it's because of how close together the
bend radius is now let's see alright so
there is the tubing right there this
took three tries and I know it looks
kind of rounded on camera right there
the problem is with how close together
those two 90s are so you can see on the
better on the bottom there when you heat
up one of these bends and then you go to
heat up the next bend the heat will make
its way to the other bend and start to
relax it so it's hard to keep it as a
nice tight 90 degree radius or a 90
degree Bend but I think it turned out
pretty good actually it could be worse
but yeah so there's those two bends
right there now I can put the blocks on
the cards and get those in there and
then this thing is a lot closer to being
done and the closer this thing gets to
being done the closer I get to start my
build one thing I want to point out too
is I get this an awful lot in my videos
where I show these bins that come from
the CPU block and go over top of the RAM
from this angle people say how you gonna
get the RAM out you can't get the RAM
out with the tubes right there it's just
a perspective thing as you can get
underneath that you can see there's lots
and lots of room to get the RAM out I
just want to point that out Magna get my
whole hand in there
there's her that's what she said anyway
yeah so I think it's looking pretty darn
good if you don't say so myself
alright this is where I'm stopping
it's late now it's like 11:00 11:00 at
night but working on this thing all day
so I changed this one up here a little
bit as you can see I've now got two 90s
right here so it comes up along the side
of the reservoir so add more room here
for the wires will talk about these
wires in a second here
so at 90s here and that 90s into the CPU
same with this guy right there how do we
do the part here with the graphics cards
a couple times because I have the
spacing wrong
I had an NPC ie one in PCIe 3 and that's
incorrect I technically would have
worked but with the 40 Lane CPU by go
PCIe one and PC for that I get X 16x +
16 X which is what we want so I had to
redo the link for that I redo this one
right here and then I put it back
because I ended up putting this back
down to where it was originally and yeah
that's so pretty much this is exactly
how it is for like 3-way only there
would be another card right here in the
middle so really I could have just left
the top in the bottom one where they
were I thought I had to change up the
layout but I didn't so anyway that's how
it looks I won't talk about these wires
here real quick believe it or not but
there being less wires here on the 1080
because it's only got a single 8 pin and
not an 8 pin and a 6 pin it's actually
harder to train these wires because
there's less bulk or cluster to keep
together if that makes sense so these
kind of want to go their own way but I'm
going to start training the cables to
get them to lay how I want I probably
will have to use some zip ties to
control that the most important part is
that the loop is done now one thing I
want to point out so many people are
always asking me like Jay how do you do
your bends and stuff I'm not perfect I'm
not I tried something different where it
came up the back and I want it to be out
of the way the RAM a little more the
owner didn't like that as much so I went
back this way and then I changed this
one here this bend right here took me
all those tries yeah so I took these
scraps because these aren't these aren't
actually throw aways because they're
still perfectly good and they're all
90-degree bends as you can see so there
might end up being a portion in the
future
with other builds where I need just a
90-degree Bend and then I could cut them
down to length and then use them
somewhere so I keep things as well as
all of these short scraps as you can see
here all of the short pieces because all
of this stuff is usable it's not
throwaway so I make sure I don't scratch
them up and mahram up and whatnot
so anyway yep there's that I'm going to
this is a standard bridge this is not
the high bandwidth bridge but I'm going
to be using the high bandwidth bridge or
the the standard bridge top instead of
the high bandwidth if that makes sense
this piece right here if you undo these
two screws it will come off and then
this one will mount directly to the EVGA
high-bandwidth bridge that we're going
to be using and I want to paint this the
problem with the high bandwidth one is
it has like oh there's a little logo
thing here like a little carbon fiber
looking thing like on the front of their
new graphics cards and I won't be able
to paint it with that on there so I'm
going to paint this white take off the
SLI stick or paint this white and then
I'm going to put this cover on his
high-bandwidth one in fact I don't think
I have it out here nope I don't this
more of his stuff right there but anyway
yeah my shop is a disaster absolutely a
disaster but that's one of the reasons
why I'm happy to have a shop like this
is because now I can just roll down the
door and go to bed so that's that this
is the second to the last video for the
red mist build because the next thing to
do now that the loop is done is get all
the wiring in and then do our leak
testing and then it will be done and off
to the owners house and then I can get
started on my builds this one took way
longer than it ever should have doesn't
help that it's summer and it's really
freaking hot out here anyway guys thanks
for watching hope you guys enjoyed these
build blogs remember red mist some
people comment like red mist and skunk
worse or too much alike remember red
mist was first skunk works was worse
second actually first was sniffs bloody
vampire build but anyway yeah so red
mist has some things taken away from
some of sniffs build skunk works has
some built some ideas taken from red
mist and red mist once again is acting
as kind of a canvas that I can use to
make sure that when I go to do skunk
works on more efficient with it so I'm
poor
generally for him takes longer to get
his bill done because I'm figuring out
all of these things like the tubing
didn't fit and all that which means that
when I go to do my build I'll be much
more prepared
thanks for the being the guinea pig dude
anyway guys thanks for watching hope
you've enjoyed the vlogs and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
