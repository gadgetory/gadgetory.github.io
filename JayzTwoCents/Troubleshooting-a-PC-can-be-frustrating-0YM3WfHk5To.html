working on a video about bottle necking
but I was getting blocked by an issue
that was causing me a bunch of problems
that I finally figured out and I figured
this would make a good opportunity to do
another one of those troubleshooting
teaching videos where actually show you
guys how to get around some problems
that might otherwise have seemed to be
pointing at one issue when it turns out
to be something entirely different the
new dg7 series case is from EVGA off a
PC enthusiast more of what they love
like tempered glass side panels vertical
GPU mount integrated RGB control board
DG tuner and an awesome three year
warranty to learn more about the DG
seven series of cases from EVGA head to
the link in the description below so my
setup here is an 8700 K in an ASUS
Maximus X apex board I've been running
this for a while with a Titan X
obviously like I said we're going for
some bottlenecking stuff and I I've been
having a very strange issue the same SSD
and the same Western Digital black hard
drive I have been using forever started
to give me some problems and I'll show
you guys what those problems are but
first I just want to explain the problem
and then I'll demonstrate it for you be
a data
i think it's an sx 900 SSD I have in
here is quite a few years old it has
been used a lot didn't get any sort of
smart errors but I started getting
complete system lock ups on responses
and then the drive would drop off from
the BIOS detection entirely leading me
to believe that it was a bad SSD but
upon switching the SSD and the problem
persisting thought that maybe it was a
bad SATA cable turns out that wasn't the
problem either because now I've got
three different static cables that I've
used two different drives and the
problem persisting now I've got
everything working fine for the moment
and just to show you here's my Samsung
Evo 850 or a 50 ebo 500 gigabyte SSD and
then my Western Digital black showing up
just fine so we're gonna go ahead and go
into the OS and I'm gonna show you in
real time what happens because it is
extremely easy to recreate so this is
one of my disc images that I use for my
testing things like blender and
Cinebench and all that as you can see
everything is working fine let's go
ahead and load up something like
Cinebench
something that is gonna start to sort of
stress our system a little bit here so
if I could just go ahead and run my CPU
test see the moment I hit run No oh
there goes see how that kind of took a
minute and then it started to go these
are the these are the telltale signs
that something wasn't right when I've
been using this system long enough now
to know when something isn't right what
if we go ahead and do something like oh
I don't know it's launched MSI
Afterburner let's place some farcry I
need to download this driver though and
the problem has now started I just tried
to install the latest driver for Far Cry
5 as you can see we've got a little
spinning wheel it's thinking I told it
agreeing continue nothing's happening
nothing's happening in control of Billy
Joel shift escape
we saw the moving cursor we have not
hard locked or anything like that but
our OS is completely unresponsive I
can't close windows nothing so now this
is the part where it gets interesting
and this is why I'm making this video
because someone might start to think at
this point especially if they're in
inexperienced with computer hardware or
troubleshoot hardware's computer
hardware's more than one of them this is
where troubleshooting and experience
really starts to come in because
somebody who's new to this world might
have started to think they have a bad
installation or even a bad disk let me
show you why because now if I just hit
reset on here because we have no choice
but to do a hard cycle of power on this
when we come back up you will see that
it will take us straight to our BIOS
because now the computer is not going to
see any sort of boot drive remember our
SSD is our boot drive so now if we go
over here to see my first thought now is
somebody who's dealt with this a million
times is ok sometimes a BIOS will change
the boot order it's rare but it does
indeed happen and because I have to but
storage drives on here I have a standard
hard drive which is used for all my game
files and mass size files so I'm not
filling up my SSD and may SSD is my OS
if you go over here to the boot tab you
can see now only the Western Digital is
showing up if I go into the boot ride
override on the left again
the Western Digital is showing up now
part of troubleshooting at this point
would be to try another cable or make
sure you're getting power to the SSD and
I've already done all of that I'm gonna
spare you guys me watching me do all
that in this video but that's what I
would do next I would make sure the
cables plugged in all the way I would
make sure that power is plugged in all
the way and because I do know power
works considering the hard drive is
using the same pigtail as the SSD I do
know that there's power in fact we were
just using it so no here's what we're
gonna do we're gonna go ahead and clear
the CMOS even though we were running all
optimized defaults no overclocks no
anything we are going to go ahead and
clear the CMOS and I'm gonna show you
that clearing the CMOS actually brings
it back but I've also repeated this test
a good 10 times today and just using the
PC normal within a few minutes it will
give you the exact same result we're
gonna talk about why and we're going to
also talk about how to fix it
so most asus boards have this green
clear CMOS button on the back I'm gonna
hold this for 10 seconds you're gonna to
check with your motherboard menu a
manual to see where your clear CMOS is
every motherboard has a clear CMOS this
is basically forcing it to revert to its
out-of-the-box settings it's gonna clear
any sort of stored memory in the BIOS
now since we cleared the CMOS it forces
us back into the BIOS to check all of
our settings make sure that they're
correct if we go to boot look what's
magically back our Samsung 850 Evo so
that tells me it's not a bad Drive it
tells me it's not a bad cable it tells
me it's something wrong with the actual
motherboard BIOS itself now here's what
we're gonna go ahead and do we are going
to go ahead and update our BIOS on the
motherboard I have a theory I have used
this set up now for months without a
problem
ever since coffee Lake has launched I
have used this CPU and this motherboard
in this configuration without any
problems what has changed is recently
there were some Windows updates that
were actually causing problems on Intel
SSDs now this is not an intel SSD but i
do believe that our problem is going to
be somewhat related the fact that I can
even get it back is actually a good
thing
unfortunately my SX 900 a data SSD which
I've been using for this test bench now
has a corrupt installation on it though
because of
the when it failed it did something
catastrophic and now windows needs to
try and restore that installation but
updating your BIOS is one of those
things that I typically tend to go with
if it ain't broke don't fix it because
there's a lot of things that could
potentially go wrong with updating your
BIOS a sudden power loss your dog trips
over the power cord your significant
other or your kid trips over the power
cord in the middle of flashing which can
brick your board again fortunately asus
has BIOS flashback features which don't
even need a CPU RAM or anything plugged
into it but that is that that is an asus
feature so if you're not using an asus
board chances are you could end up
breaking it so we're gonna do now is we
are gonna go ahead and take this flash
drive i've installed the latest rom on
here on the root of this drive and we're
gonna use easy flash to bring it back
which should fix our problems asus
updates take a little while because it
does multiple things each time it
restarts so will do multiple restarts
again every motherboard is different
check with your manufacturer because
last thing you want to do is start see
now it's doing the BIOS update it was
doing the management engine update a
second ago yeah so this is you don't
want to cut power in between this see it
just turn itself off again that would
freak you out they know what you're
doing but I'm warning you now so you
know if it starts doing all these
restarts it's normal
unless it doesn't stop doing it that's
not normal and here's our new revision
right here 1301 we were on what 0 2 1 4
or something like that before so if we
go into our BIOS we should now obviously
see our drive the question is now can we
go into Windows and although that we
have all kinds of things showing up now
and now we're going to kind of do a
little gambit of test to make sure it
works but the point of this video is
sometimes your problem could look like
it's one thing but it's something else
entirely obviously our problem was not
with the SSD
this might leave some folks to think
that the SSD not showing up and just
suddenly dropping off and locking up
it's a problem with the SSD or
potentially a cable or have you looking
at things like power supply and pretty
positive the entire issue here was a
Windows Update causing a conflict with
an old BIOS on this motherboard this was
a very old BIOS it's really this was a
launched BIOS when copy Lake first came
out so as you can see
that took us in a completely different
direction so where we failed last time
was when we tried to install our driver
so we're gonna go and try this again
and see if it actually makes it through
I don't anticipate there being a problem
I really don't if the problem persists
then I have no idea where to go next to
be honest with you but I'm pretty sure
the problem will be fixed because it was
persistent through different SSDs
different cables and different power
plug so the only thing that changed from
when the problem started until the you
know before the problem started was a
Windows Update so yeah Jack went up to
Microsoft once again all right so it's
working obviously we're doing Windows
updates now 76% left this is the major
update the 1803 I couldn't even get this
far before because the drive Kipp miss
let's just say disconnecting from the
controller in some way but it's all
working perfectly fine right now which
is a good thing the point of this like I
already said sometimes problems look
like they can be leading towards one
thing when it's something completely
else so this is one of those times when
I would definitely recommend if you're
running an old BIOS definitely update it
if you feel comfortable with it please
please check the manuals with your
motherboards to make sure you're doing
it the right way so you don't break your
devices I had no choice because
obviously the update paths and how many
updates old we were or whatever was
obviously conflicting with the age of
our BIOS with our particular hardware so
we had to do this to get it up and
running there is that guys I this this
literally was an impromptu video because
it was stopping me from making the video
I was trying to make so we're gonna go
ahead and get on with that but if you
guys enjoyed today's video won't you
give it a like and maybe share it with
some of them might be having some sort
of a similar issue
I hear people all the time tweeting me
and emailing me about their system just
stopped responding with a little
spinning wheel and that's exactly what I
was getting right here anyway guys
thanks for watching copy Tex coming up
next week you guys are not gonna want to
miss the coverage on that we're gonna
try and give a perspective of Computex
not just running around doing the
obligatory here's this here's this
here's this we want to do more of a an
experience for you guys and give you
more of a first-hand look of what it's
like to experience Computex
as a PC enthusiast not just what's at
Computex but we're gonna go thanks for
watching guys as always we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
