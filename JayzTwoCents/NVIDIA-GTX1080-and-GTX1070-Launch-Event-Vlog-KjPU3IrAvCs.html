week sort of

anyway all right guys let's go let's go
get some breakfast that is a fancy
tic-tac-toe board okay so this is this
is Logan's breakfast a dainty little
omelet
it's like
all over here is just eating a nap I
have nothing go and is constantly trying
to offload her breakfast on to these
guys
it sounds more like you're peddling see
my boy Logan and Joanne are having a
very very deep conversation about
sunscreen she knows me well I have
adapted this is Anthony guys from tweed
town if you guys have never heard of
tweak town well where the hell have you
been
three times our home aw everything that
you need we are they also from down in
de writers okay great
Luke is going to shoot shotguns what
you're gonna do some Texas we've been
doing Texas since we got here well you
know they do it big in Texas I
immediately regret not bringing my
sunglasses so this is the park right now
we are going up here to drink some wine
and play some poker well that's why I
brought out the camera
it's riveting poker footage here I've
got going looks like will tears a poker
here with the little cameras yes we do
call them all right I think this is
sandbagging just slowly reeling in more
money
all right that's right with mover three
twos let's let me just compare the chips
yeah I'll send you the link I am slowly
owning the table one dollar at a time
for some barbecue all right so we're
gonna we're gonna go shoot some shotguns
here do you keep shooting but to get
there we get to take a hayride let's
take it here right
I have never seen such a perfect dollop
of Wow
don't take yourself there's a button
behind it trigger by the way the trigger
do not put your finger on the trigger
some of them butterfly can land on
that's enough to take it off pop your
hand on the outside so we have that gun
down range and you're ready to fire
right here here's the safety you see red
you can shed blood red for dead right
baby's off make sure that Safety's on
your fingers outside the trigger first
lane go Sabo and I want y'all to shoot
an order one two three four laid one
says pulled he's gonna have a shotgun
down here he's gonna follow it up before
that bird starts to drop he's gonna
shoot about a foot in front of that bird
you shoot with your barrel right on that
bird you're gonna miss it you're gonna
shoot behind it shoot about a foot in
front of that bird once I bird starts to
drop down not only is it going twice as
fast down as it was up but it's going
away from you you got a 50/50 chance of
hitting it from there I'm shooting about
ninety to ninety four percent
all right so you have to shoot the
shotguns I didn't get any footage of
mine maybe I'll steal some of his from
the shooting with anyway that's fun
12-gauge and 20 gauge shotguns so what
you think good lot
all my shoulders yeah yeah there's a
certain like akut of your shoulder where
you should put the rifle that or the
shotgun or doesn't hurt as much but he's
Australian so these ever got to shoot a
shotgun before are they as bad as they
say they're really off that's good if
you weren't on the business end of the
show yes stay behind it I keep
forgetting to turn on this damn thing
and then I'm doing a vlog this is gonna
be the worst vlog ever
so anyway I'm about to shower right now
you guys don't get to go with me to the
shower but then I'm gonna be meeting up
with Anthony from tweak town Luke from
Linus tech tips Paul and Kyle we're
gonna go to dinner and then we're
heading to like a super-secret venue
tonight with a super-secret musical
guest and I guess the launch is
happening tonight by the time you guys
see this video this is obviously going
to be all like after the fact so NDA
Stefan won't be an issue clearly it's
obvious it's a graphics card that's
being launched tonight don't know
exactly which one yet my my personal
thought is that it's gonna be like a
1080 maybe a new Titan I doubt it's
gonna be the new Titan but I don't know
really know to expect but it's been a
lot of fun we got to go skeet shooting
today there's a lot of activities that
you could choose from I'm not falling
over I'm taking my shoes off skeet
shooting there was rafting
horseback riding ATV riding play Texas
Holdem Poker as you guys saw there was
wine tasting what else was there anyway
doesn't ring that as well it's really
fun they got to go to a Texas ranch a
real working Texas ranch and that was a
lot of fun I'm pretty good skeet shooter
though apparently I surprised him that I
was a California boy that could actually
shoot a gun but you guys already know I
have guns so what does matter I want to
buy shotgun now actually
but anyway time to clean up and we're
gonna head to dinner I'll take you guys
with me we'll talk to Luke maybe we'll
get a little chat with Luke and yeah
this is a lot of fun I should come to
more of these events yeah I think I
clean up all right
oh hello that came around my face this
Paul's aggression could you please not I
would mind please not kill me this
moment I love you are you why you still
filming me your poorly done impression
of me is upsetting you oh nice they did
it twice anyway it's awesome hard work
happening here cameras
everyone here thinks you're super famous
like wow there's three dudes people
filming girl in various media outlets
covering the show here we're now
this one last night and then one leg
this guy just obliterated his salad yeah
his salad with tomato soup on top
it appears that the main course is
speaking facial
an onion
it's a really fancy potatoes
look like a girl maybe
whatever so so it turns out we there's a
general line and there's a preferred
line and then there's a press line right
oh recording I'm sorry I'm just ignoring
you like I always do yeah so Luke what
are your predictions for our times it's
a refresh yes it'll be like the 1890 800
deal or they just pretty stick 2014 all
over again so if it's a metal sticker so
looks like a bad move they literally
just sharp eat like a 1 and they made
the 9 of 0 all right so we are waiting
to get in right now to the video no idea
what to expect I think I think we're all
expecting maybe more about the media
drive so far the hardest thing has been
getting people in a straight line
hey everybody you know I don't think
we're gonna get seating room only fellas
you know we're we are all very tightly
crammed in here hello right my shoulders
gonna be very friendly I know right
because you and I are white shoulders it
is so familiar that's history
we're overlapping at the moment yeah
they have definitely gone all out
fanfare is real hey rod Bob
I'm still pretty sure it's it's about
Nvidia Drive has nothing to do with
driving starts right I mean like once
I'm good to notice is that there's tens
everywhere yeah I think there should be
at least
gigs of RAM and at least obtaining 34
I leave ten cars
the ten gigs of RAM that's just that's
just stupid why would you think ten gigs
of RAM because I mean like they have to
go up from somewhere right there at a
certain level oh so you mean like HBM on
AMD going down to four gigs yeah
my loan
it made it possible for us to start the
PC gaming revolution in England today
but what makes the PC gaming platforms
so special is that it's also open
so I'm literally editing this video that
you guys are watching right now and I
realized that holy I forgot to like
film anything about the ending of the
video so anyway this video was about
just kind of like the behind the scenes
of what we were all doing this weekend
regarding like the whole Texas feel and
stuff and not about my feelings on 1080
I'm gonna do a separate video for that
it really deserves more than just a
mention in this ultimately I'm pretty
excited about it though I said that into
it on Twitter last night while we were
live tweeting or at least I was live
tweeting the my reaction to it that
thermals are insane over 2100 megahertz
of overclocked ability at least on a
random car that they chose that demo
that you saw last night on the live
stream was happening on a like a
standard card it was not a custom card
of any any kind 67c on the reference
color absolutely amazing anyway yes I am
doing reviews yes I do have reviews that
are gonna be coming from multiple board
partners as well as 3-way SLI confirmed
in skunk works yes it's a very first
thing I asked them about and yes I am
going to be doing that in the near
future near enough anyway got to get
water blocks and stuff like that ready
for it but anyway guys thanks for
watching my coverage here of the behind
the scenes of what we were going through
here at the Nvidia event it was a lot of
fun it wasn't just hey come listen to us
shove marketing down your throat it
was come have some fun and oh while
you're at it let's talk about this
graphics card thing anyway I'm getting
out of here right now we're about to all
