I'm at least a month ago I was like
that's it
we give up Steve wins because he used
the Dominus board and a 31 75 X or W 31
75 X which is the 28 core or the 50 to
threads no 50 56 now that's a lot of
threads in one CPU and I was like we
don't even have the hardware to compete
it's all about change bitches today's
video is brought to you by Nord VPN and
look I've said this in the past and I'm
gonna say it every time we live online
you're watching this online right now
but it's important to protect your
internet experience from prying eyes and
that includes your ISP they want to
shape your data and your traffic and not
give you everything you paid for in
terms of speed with streaming websites
like YouTube Netflix they're constantly
trying to get involved and control your
experience that's why a VPN is extremely
important and encrypts your data with
military-grade encryption and one of
their thousands of servers across the
world including regions like Africa the
Middle East Asia Australia we've got
servers across the world now right now
Nord VPN is offering my viewers 75% off
a three year membership bringing your
monthly cost down to less than that of a
single Starbucks coffee
you should start protecting your
internet experience and taking it
serious today you'll find a link in the
description below and if you use offer
code J's two cents at checkout you'll
get that deal I just mentioned seventy
five percent off a three year membership
and people can stop spying on what you
do so do it right now now a lot of you
guys are already asking and I've seen
this asked a million times in our
comments Jay why don't you just run
thread Ripper like a w29 90 X or
whatever that CPU is it's something to
do with the CCX and the way that 3dmark
times by extreme is coded it doesn't
like threader per thread Ripper just
does not perform well in that particular
test even with the massive amount of
cores it just does not do well in that
particular test so we saw this at CES in
a couple of builds it's a widest
motherboard i've personally ever had as
well this is the one that was kind of
controversial last Computex where they
were like look it's the x5 nine nine or
whatever running at five gigs
but then I was using like a water chill
my god I thought I was gonna be
presented with like I don't know some
sort of suspense nope you just open it
up and it's like there it is so this is
using what socket is this the LG ace
36:47
so three thousand six hundred and forty
seven pins in this mother this mounting
mechanism is odd right this is very
similar to like the C on mounting stuff
and so I don't have any way to mount
anything down to this so one of the
reasons I'm doing this video today is to
kind of bring you guys along for the
ride of what's included with this I
don't mess with that yet I have no idea
how much any of this is I'm sure you'd
have to take out a second on your home
to afford it the processor itself is
three thousand dollars I mean this is
like his biggest red ripper and
interestingly enough you see the way
it's split down the middle on the pins
it makes me wonder if this isn't too
Zeon's like underneath here it'd be
hilarious though if that was the case
because remember Intel did make fun of
AMD for gluing their CPUs together I
love that they give you all the Republic
of gamers like gaming stuff when this is
really not a gaming board like in the
least are these they said Jim got to
with active cooling they are well sort
of an active cooling okay so you got to
dim twos oh that's amazing so this is
also a 6 channel motherboard so it's a
six channels worth of memory I'm
planning on using our g.skill RGB on it
for now it's not the same Ram we
actually had our records and stuff with
because this is not the fastest Ram it's
funny our GB RAM because of the small
amount of power that the LEDs consume
you don't you'll very rarely find that
anyone's got any sort of world record
with RGB Ram it's always basic non you
know lighted RAM or lit Ram here this is
only 3200 dims obviously we use 3800
that we overclock when we do our
overclocking stuff so I'll be using six
of these eight modules so this is the
dim dot to something you're very similar
to seeing with asus rog boards only now
you have two of them don't tell me it
doesn't actually have RGB on this it has
RGB on this board oh my god imagine go
in the data center
holy crap there's four fans on the VRM
big-oh heatsink that runs the lung along
the whole top of the board and then
there are four fans in the top of that
okay so this video is kind of morphing
into more of like just a walk-around of
the motherboard and kind of an overview
this is my first time getting hands-on
with it we saw it at CES I don't have a
cooling solution for this
so the LGA 3647 this is a Xeon socket so
there are ek waterblock I think Alpha KU
also makes a water block that will fit
on this we don't have any of that I
wanted to do a boot test so which I
probably will with air but I'm obviously
not gonna be doing any testing on this
with air or overclocking because this is
an overclockable CPU which kind of makes
it unprecedented because Zeon's have
always been locked down and this is
basically I mean you saw gamers Nexus
hit with 5.1 on water with his chilled
water but still water nonetheless so
yeah it's also a great option for people
that need the type of workstation setup
that you can get with this with server
grade stuff without the cost that goes
associated with it this is probably the
only time you ever hear me say $3,000 is
a bargain for a CPU because this
basically slides in where the 8180 would
be in terms of core count and hyper
threading but it doesn't have a $10,000
price tag with it because for what we
can tell at least looking doing a quick
search is that this basically is an 81
80 that's overclockable but can't be
linked with multi proc prop motherboards
so you can't have multiprocessor support
which 8180 supports up to 8 CPUs and
that would be obviously for server grade
stuff so if you're looking for an
extremely high-end workstation build see
your CAD designer or you just this would
be perfect for like a home server or
even a small office server this would
definitely get the job done at $3,000
for that CPU which and last time I
checked my math is less than a third of
the cost of an 81 80 so yeah I mean
that's why I said this the only time you
ever hear me say something like this is
a bargain if you fall under that extreme
use case which is interesting though
because this is all set up for basically
gaming it falls under the Republic of
gamers naming and all that sort of stuff
so it's quite interesting
this exists in a consumer fashion but
anyway we'll continue our walk around
like I said welfare out the cooling
solution we will definitely be stepping
back into the arena with our
overclocking competition with Steve I'm
gonna get this on Ellen - just got to
figure out how power wise - 24 pin
connectors on this you need two power
supplies for this if you're running at
stock you could probably have gotten
away with one now because this is
overclockable you know what happens when
you pull more amps than your power
supply and stuff can deliver buyers
become a bit of a concern so we want to
make sure that doesn't happen in terms
of fan headers we've got six of them
right here just six of them by the CPU
and of course we've got some RGB headers
which i think is hilarious on this
motherboard because we've got an
adjustable RGB any non addressable RGB
right there USB 3.0 on the side to you
to s was this two four six eight SATA
connectors right there a 6 pin PCI
Express supplemental power to the PCI
Express Lanes because although you have
four sockets on here four PCI Express or
slots you can run for graphics cards in
this now know you can't do a four-way
SLI with r-tx cards but if you again if
you're using that extremely use case
where you have a very powerful
workstation you're leveraging these
cards for things like 3d rendering
real-time rendering for CAD drawings and
stuff then the graphics cards will be
able to be leveraged not in a gaming
situation where there s allied but each
individual card can be having a task
associated with it so have another USB
3.0 on the bottom I put the amount of
room there is on this board I'm
surprising weren't that they could have
just stacked it but that word kept it
together right there both power plugs
together there so why not do that over
here holy crap I just realized you
actually have one two three four eight
pin ups plus two 6-pin PCI Express on
either side this might be a system that
would actually legitimately impact your
monthly bill by putting it under load
the two white plugs down here at the
this is a water flow indicator and then
we have another water pump header right
there
we've got one two three four five six
six more fan headers on the bottom two
USB 2.0 s this is an auxilary plug to
one of the boards that go inside or that
comes with this motherboard because this
also has a standalone fan controller
that asus is known for that plugs in and
then it's an expandable fans slots if
you will that can be controlled
independently so you're gonna have
already a 12 fan headers plus however
many more on that board which is insane
we've got two more RGB headers at the
bottom another adjustable another
standard 12 volt and then of course your
front panel connectors and yeah so on
the back side though you've cut eight
USB 3.0 right there super speeds
actually you guys got a total of 10
because the red ones are also super
speed dual Nick yeah Ethernet we've got
two USB type C's of course our digital
spit off' and then of course we have
sound plugs BIOS flashback and clear
CMOS on there oh there's another fan
header right there holy crap okay
another one there so you've got 14 fan
headers on the motherboard itself this
is like the board that just keeps on
like surprising me so really we're gonna
do we are going to immediately start
sourcing a cooler for this so that we
can immediately still lose to Steve
because he's running those Titans but I
digress we will do what it takes
including taking those Titans out of
that system if we have to or we're right
around the corner from kinking cards so
a feeling the entire competition is
gonna equalize itself now that we have
matching Hardware for the CPU side and
have a feeling that kingpin cards are
going to make their way into this
competition in some way so I had
basically conceded and then unconsidered
officially in this video Steve even if I
don't win out okay that's my hardware to
play with you have to admit like you
wouldn't turn down an opportunity this
would yeah no I didn't think so alright
guys so anyway that was our unboxing and
look here at the Asus Dominus extreme
this is gonna be fun give me a fun one
but I have a feeling that this one is
going to also be a bit nerve-wracking
because now the stakes just continue to
get higher with more and more money on
the line with this level of hardware so
yeah
completely unnecessary for what we do
but that's what makes it even more fun
alright guys thanks for watching and as
always we'll see you the next one oh and
did I tell you guys built-in wireless
because you know why the hell not
this is like the heaviest other word box
I've ever felt like but watch that watch
the knife look at the knife no put your
hand under it you feel the weight
