storm Reaper aluminum or aluminium
gaming mouse right here and i am using
mine right here because it is awesome

mouse and you guys wanted to know more
about where you could buy it and it
became pretty obvious if you live in
north america that it is not available
here well guess what coolermaster saw
your comments and they saw just how
upset you were and decided to give me
this brand new sealed box with the mouse
in and of course to give away to you if
you live in this continent giving you a
chance to own one of the very first
Reaper mice in all of North America now
I know some of you guys right now are
already mad throwing things at the
screen and probably already hitting that
unsub button but before you do that
listen I do have something I'm gonna be
giving away to you guys anywhere in the
world no matter where you live and it
might be from the wall behind me or
might be right here in front of me which

another time so sometime between now and
