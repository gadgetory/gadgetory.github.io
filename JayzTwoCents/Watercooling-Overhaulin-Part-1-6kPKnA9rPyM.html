bringing you another bill blog type of
thing only this time it's not an entire
computer we're going to be refreshing
the water cooling in that bad boy right
there how many of you guys remember this
build I did early last year this is one
of the first client builds I did here on
the YouTube channel
and he saw some of the rigid tubing
stuff I've been doing and he said hey I
want that so that's this week's project
has no name no so we'll call it project
no name now since I know some of you
guys gonna be dying for specs this is a
PC I built early last year for a viewer
and when it comes to specs it's a 3770k
overclock to just 4.5 it's nothing major
gtx 680 s and sli let's see it's got a
met Maximus V formula from a SUSE as you
can see there courser ax 850 power
supply it's got an XS PC tripper right
up top 240 on the bottom and nothing too
spectacular I mean it's a it's a good
powerful PC it's gonna last a long time
but he's pretty much sick of the red he
doesn't want the red in there anymore
the the computer sits right next to him
at night and up on top of the desk and
he thinks the red is distracting so
we're actually going to be converting
everything over to blue now the hardest
part of this is going to be getting all
of the red out of the system because
we're reusing all the blocks and the
radiators obviously so it's going to be
a lot of bleeding involved in this and
trying to get the system clean I've got
some techniques that I use hopefully
they'll work and there won't be too much
of a pain in the ass but red is an
absolute pain in the ass when it comes
to trying to get you know out of the
system so first we got to do is going to
clean this bad boy up it's a little
dusty I mean it's not too bad but you
can see the PCBs have some dust on them
I mean the all of the tubing is kind of
dusty the radiators or dirty of fans are
dirty so we'll be clean and giving this
thing a nice detailing as well you know
while we're in here so all right let's
go ahead and get started
all right as you can see it's completely
gutted there's the six 80s over there
with the kind of an old school not
really old too old school but eek a
bridge right there you have C bridge and
pump and stuff so yeah got it completely
bled I have hooked up to the sink
running some water through there and
then went ahead and does well bled the
entire thing again through with
distilled water and so now the thing is
ready to go so I'm just going to kind of
clean it up get all the dust and dirt
out of here then we'll get all the stuff
reinstalled with the rigid tubing
fittings and all that crap okay so now
it's time to open up the box from frozen
CPU it's really long because it has the
rigid tubing in there so figure will go
and just unbox this together I guess
it's funny too because this box is going
to be mostly empty considering pretty
much the only thing in here of any size
is the tubing it's really hard with one
hand
there we go so mostly just going to be
paper and more paper and more paper
we've got our blue LEDs right here two
of those bad boys has a blue LEDs two
strips we've got our bits power
rotatable fitting for connecting the
pump and the reservoir together here is
our tubing in here this is our x1 UV
blue from Mayhem's it's not a pastel
it's a transparent fluid and of course
our ten pack of fittings okay so I'm
sitting here cleaning this thing up and
I want to point your attention to
something look right down here now this
phantom 820 is only a little over a year
old I built this PC in March of 2013 and
all the rubber is like completely dried
out
I mean leave this look see that I you
just pull the pieces right off of that
it's literally falling apart as the
cables go through it as you can see so
clearly the the rubber on this case is
not really up to standard my opinions
that's unfortunate nothing I can do
about that
Jiji NZXT
alright one thing I want to point out
that I did here is I move the fans to
the top and the radiator to the bottom
because the way the the 820 is it's got
these little cutouts here for the
fittings but because of the size and how
big these fittings are they wouldn't
they wouldn't really fit right there not
to mention I want to be able to tighten
them down very good for the sake of the
acrylic tubing so now up underneath it's
just a you know the entire radiator is
visible so I think that's going to look
alright I'm going to paint these rings
black more than likely instead of
putting the blue ones on and then I'm
going to switch the RAM from the black
channels to the red channels that way
there's less red there I might paint
that strip black I don't know yet what
to see how much it you know how much the
blue stands out versus the red but most
of the red gets covered up so anyway
it's time to get the bottom red in there
get the block mounted down I couldn't
decide how I wanted the block to be
which way I want to orient it because
the way the loop is going to be I wanted
to make the most sense with the minimal
amount of bending I don't want to spend
hours upon hours upon hours of bending
although that is what rigid tubing is
all about ok now another thing I'm often
asked about is how to take your pump and
turn it into a pump reservoir combo so
here we have our bits power 250
millimeter reservoir our alpha cooled e5
aerial pump and then we have a this is a
just a male-male revolver Bowl fitting
here from bits power and I use bits
power because they have the strongest or
ings on the inside this thing doesn't
flop around and pretty much all you do
is figure out how you're going to orient
your pump so you screw that into the
inlet and then on the bitts power
reservoirs you have multiple sides here
one has three ports with a little fill
or a little plunger pushes the return
line down into the fluid that way you
don't have you know a waterfall
otherwise I can introduce air you have
one side with a single fitting so you
basically just end up attaching it
like that and as you can see by doing
that now I have a reservoir pump combo
with just a little little fitting there
in the middle it's all it takes and you
just got to kind of think and improvise
sometimes so now we've got the pump off
of the top of the PSU which is where it
was which is now going to allow us to
have a very clean loop some people
really didn't like the way that the loop
was done in this system but now it's
gonna be much much cleaner oh the other
side it looks blue because of where
you're standing this Chrome for I was
like why is that do something
inspiration
okay all right so I've got all the
fittings on I've got the pump and red
combo put together I've got the radiator
swapped up on the top with the fans on
top now and I'm still going to paint the
fan rings black I'm not going to use
blue I'm gonna do black and then all I
really have to do is bend the tube and
fill it up so I'm not going to do that
today I'm going to actually stop here
today because this guy came over and I
think he wants to play video games
before he goes climbs the rock falls to
his death as a YouTube memorial there
won't be one for me I know that any time
while you're popular now you're seeing
you're seen by hundreds of thousands I'm
not that popular I'm just some
background guy you're popular by
relation with a popular by proxy and
proximity proximity that makes sense
