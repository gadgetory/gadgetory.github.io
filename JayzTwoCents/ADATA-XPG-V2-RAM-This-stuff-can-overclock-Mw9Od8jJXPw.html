the ADATA xpg gaming ram now some of you
may be claimed what's a data I've never
heard of a dude well a data is a company
that's been around for quite a long time
but they did a lot of business solutions
portable hard drives that sort of thing
and they're really now trying to really
expand upon their gaming line of RAM and
so that's what we're gonna be taking a
look at today the unboxing is really
easy there it is you can see it practice
I'm in a box it's a plastic sleeve which
is perfectly okay because you know it
doesn't really matter it's got this
little tab right here you just pull it
back and it's free
pull the Rams not for you have to pay
for it but here it is it's very unique
design in terms of the the heat spreader
on there and it's available in different
colors you can get it in gold and this
kind of a gunmetal grey I don't know if
there's any other colors besides that
but it is a very attractive Ram I like
the way it looks the PCB on the RAM is
black that's awesome I mean there's
nothing uglier than looking at a green
PCB underneath a really cool heatsink
just messing up your color scheme it's
pretty heavy-duty
it is a Lumina meets Inc here I'm taking
a look at the heat pads they're all
touching all of the RAM modules so it
looks like we're gonna have good cooling
on there and let's go and talk about the
speed we are looking at the eight
gigabyte kit it's two times four
gigabytes and what a lot of people get
stuck on the speed of the RAM oh it's
1600 megahertz or it's 1866 or it's 2133
it's 3000 megahertz some people might go
with 1600 a little bit slow by today's
standards well it really depends on what
you're doing we've already learned that
gaming RAM in some of my previous videos
does not benefit from superfast Ram
speeds there are some exceptions out
there before you guys start writing me
hate mail yes
are some exceptions like Minecraft and
AP use we're now talking about AP use
here guys we're talk about gaming
systems that use graphics cards there
there is I believe Skyrim with all of
the texture mods of just eats up Ram
like crazy we're talking about quantity
of RAM there but not so much the speed
of the RAM so the xpg line at least this
Ram module I'm looking at is 1600
megahertz but the timing on this the
timing is nine nine nine twenty four I'm
not gonna get into what those numbers
mean I'm just going to tell you that
with your CL latency are your timing of
99 924 for gaming it's very quick Ram
the latency on this is great and the
latency is is the very important when it
comes to communicating with your
processor especially for overclocking so
we're going to go ahead and we're going
to take this Ram we're gonna throw it in
a rig that I'm building right now and
we're gonna see just how well this Ram
performs we're gonna see how far we can
overclock it and we're gonna see what
kind of benchmarks we get using this xpg
ram from a data
okay so it's been approximately three
weeks since I've received the rim and
I've been using it now for almost that
length of time and I've put this Ram
through an awful lot of stress testing
both through gaming synthetic benchmarks
memory tests memory overclocking BIOS
all the overclocking is done in the BIOS
and if there's one word I had I have to
use when it comes to this rim that would
honestly be reliable I could not get the
RAM to fail until I reached 24 hundred
megahertz as the effective clock on the
RAM that's a lot I can't even get my
Corsair Vengeance to boot at 2200 let
alone 2400 and these past my stability
tests at 2200 now granted you have to
relax the timings quite a bit when you
overclock Ram that far but the bottom
line is it was stable and it was fast
and I may be putting some images up here
showing you the different benchmarking
scores through mem test on our maximum
on just how well these modules did and
you know I think everything about this
Ram is terrific I think this is
excellent gamer Ram they may not be the
fastest timings on the market but they
are certainly quick enough where gamers
aren't going to notice it whatsoever and
you can save some cash by going with
1600 memory modules like this or 1600
megahertz modules like this as opposed
to buying 2,000 or 2200 base clock
modules because you can get good
overclocking perform inside of these you
want to make sure you have good air air
flow over the RAM modules obviously but
which brings me to another point the
heat sinks on this are fairly low
profile I mean some heat sinks out there
even though they've got these points
right here they're fairly low profile
where some get really high and they get
a bit ridiculous on that I mean they
look really good they overclock even
better I definitely I definitely enjoy
this Ram in fact I'll be honest I had
never used a data Ram prior to this and
the xpg in line it's pretty badass I
mean I don't know what else to say
I would certainly use these and feel
comfortable using these for you know if
you're building a computer now or maybe
you're looking for new RAM I would
consider these I honestly would these
are great modules at a great price at
the time of filming these were only
sitting at about 65 bucks for an 8
gigabyte kit I mean that's not bad at
all I mean you can get 16 gigs for 120
bucks that's cheaper than I paid for my
corsair ram so there you go guys the xpg
the ADATA xpg gamer line of ram i would
like to see some more colors the
gunmetal just looks killer I love the
gunmetal look on this it matches the
Gigabyte build perfectly and it does it
is available on gold but I would like to
see maybe red maybe some blue and
definitely a black to make sure you
cover all your bases when it comes to
aesthetic builds so there it is guys
Jase 2 cents taking a look at the X PGA
data modules here go and check them out
I mean you've got nothing to lose and
only stability and speed to gain there
it is guys you know what to do if you
liked this video you know to do if you
did not like this video and it does
anything you want to see me review make
sure you put it down in the comments I
would like to review things that you
guys want to know more about making your
smart buyers here this holiday season
when it comes to buying and building
your own PC I'm gonna get out of here I
got more stuff to do as always I will
see you in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
