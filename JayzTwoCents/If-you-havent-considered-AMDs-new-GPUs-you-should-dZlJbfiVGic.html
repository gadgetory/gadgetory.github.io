am these are DNA cards have hit a single
shelf yet yet there's already a price
battle happening AMD just announced
prior to us starting this video that
they are slashing the price of the
Radeon 5700 XT and 5700 but wasn't
enough to stave off the super cards will
you hope to give you a super review in
this video with its aluminum bezel solid
construction and adjustable base the
vast 35 inch ultra wide 100 her two V a
panel from drop offers performance at an
affordable price learn more about this
drop by following the link in the
description below okay so first things
first here are the new 5700 XT and 5700
I left it in the box cuz I'm gonna be
honest here I I I feel like AMD could
have they should have gone a different
way of packaging this because this is
just two Nvidia like I mean I'm just I'm
just gonna say it I'm just gonna do it I
mean that's there this one a good
section on it apparently good tolerances
on this box I I don't know if anyone
else is gonna call that out it doesn't
matter this isn't the way you're gonna
really get it I don't think from confer
retailers and stuff it's just they want
to put a dent in the competition though
it says I don't know bend the rules
that's it bend the rules cuz you know
the fingers alright anyway besides the
point I'm excited for these cards
because one of the first AMD cards I
ever owned was like a 1300 XT so I love
to see the throwback to the original
Radeon naming convention with the XT
models but here's what we're gonna do so
we know for a fact that AMD and they
they've come out and said it there's a
Venn diagram of performance and value
and price and you know there's there is
a Venn diagram that overlaps of where
people shop and that is kind of where
they've always focused now we've seen
what the Polaris base stuff the rx you
know the Polaris 580 and the 590 and the
480 and all those cards people waited
and waited and waited and waited for
some sort of a and enthusiasts card well
what you got was Vega series and Radeon
seven but these were cards based on an
entirely
different branch of engineering the AMD
tried and I think that they're realizing
now that it was probably not the best
venture in fact the the head of of all
of that is not even with the company
anymore
Raja Kotori he's now with Intel and so
it's one of those things where like so
much money was invested in this they
didn't really recoup any of that cost
because unfortunately the performance of
it Radeon 7 in Vegas 64 just wasn't
enough to beat the top-tier offerings
from the competition so seeing AMD sort
of regroup and kind of RIA tack that
mainstream market is a good thing
because that's where most people shop
and video knows that AMD knows it so to
see a price battle and and performance
competition and just people going
head-to-head at that 350 or so dollar
price point is a really good thing to
see I feel most people spend anywhere
between two hundred and seventy nine
dollars to about three hundred and
seventy nine dollars so that is where
like that just that main focus is on
performance so what you're getting here
today is really like the three hundred
and seventy nine to four hundred dollar
battle if you will now these are the
first they are DNA architecture offers a
lot of benefits according to AMD's
keynote and you guys can go and rewatch
all of that we've got features like
anti-lag you've got features like the
was a big ras those the thing you got
features like are is which is radio and
image sharpening a pci express 4.0 ready
and all that sort of stuff it's it's
gonna be interesting to see how these
cards stack up because what happened
here was nvidia basically launched in
improved versions of existing cards no
no new architectures or anything like
that to compete with these cards that
weren't even out yet but the fact that
the super cards came out from Nvidia
prior to the launch of the Radeon cards
gave AMD time to kind of evaluate the
performance per dollar and allow them to
adjust the pricing of the 5700 XT and
5700 comparatively so respectively so we
saw the price go from 449 which is what
they mentioned at their keynote at
III down to 399 dollars for the 5700 XT
and then from 379 down to 349 for the
5700 meaning we have a lot of options
right around that price point so now you
could consider on the low end something
like a 1660 ti or a 2060 or a 2060 super
and now you have the 5,700 XT and the
5,700 that all reside right around there
yes I know the 1660 ti is below that
price point but I think for those that
maybe don't want to buy into the whole
arc TX architecture and yet they could
still get really good gaming performance
by not paying for those extra premiums
but that's gonna put it lesser than the
price of 5700 but then it's like if you
want to spend let's say an extra 50
bucks and get a 5,700 that's where it's
kind of fun where you don't have to go
up significantly in price to get that
next tier performance servers we're
gonna do we're gonna go ahead and show
you the benchmarks on the way that these
cards stacked up and we're gonna go
ahead and talk about it and which what
kind of sucks here is I now have to sort
of do a lot of this value calculation in
my head on the fly because like I said
leading into this video literally right
before we started it they sent the email
about the pricing changes and that
changes everything because it all boils
down to value and what might not have
been as valuable at 449 might be a heck
of a lot more valuable now at 399
because that's more than a 10% dropped
so yeah let's just go ahead and see how
this day
so you might have noticed there were
only four cards that we used in this
review and that's because of the pricing
change had they not done that it would
have it would have been a really
interesting again an interlacing of
pricing when it comes to product stack
in price not lining up directly but
interlacing that's because one company
wants to one-up the other but now now
that you have two cards on two different
tiers that are the exact same price
which is something that hasn't happened
a whole lot when it comes to AMD versus
Nvidia we now have a direct price
comparison and in my opinion at the
price point that they're targeting which
we already discussed is the meat of the
market the competition here is fierce
we've got the 5700 XT versus a 2060
super now at the same price running
considerably higher FPS in Raw FPS
gaming at 1080p and then doing an
extremely fabulous job at 1440 and then
4k again I don't think if you should
worry about 4k in this price point but
the fact that you can run games in 4k
remember these settings are on high you
drop those settings back you're gonna
get the 60fps or higher in 4k with the
mid-tier cart yes I'm calling a three
hundred and $99 or $349 card mid tier
but that really is what it is consume
you can spend 200 bucks four thousand so
that's definitely mid tier the fact that
you are getting more FPS out of the 5700
XT at the sacrifice of not having RT
cores or tensor cores or the advantages
of turning on some of those functions
that games that are being designed for
it or games that are now being optimized
for it or turning on those functions as
we move forward we're seeing more games
now utilizing RT X and DX r than we did
a year ago obviously we had one title
that used part of it a year ago we now
have dozens of titles that are now
starting to use it you have a decision
to make as a buyer do you want all the
bells and whistles of a card that's got
a little bit less Rauf yes and has RT
cores that you can turn on some eye
candy and game to get fabulous
screenshots and still playable
framerates but you could turn on DX r
and get the beautifully ray traced
reflections and global illumination all
that sort of stuff and make wall art if
you want but I've been to events where
Nvidia specifically took games
witcher 3 and they made huge posters and
stuff out of screenshots captured
through ansel so it's one of those
things that like these are features that
you would give up for the sake of raw
FPS and I think I think a lot of people
would if you wanna know the truth I
think a lot of people would rather go I
want all my FPS that I can get for my
dollar and I think a lot of people would
shop right there but you also have to
buy in two driver support and long-term
support from the manufacturer and I
think AMD has a long way to go to still
kind of prove itself as being you know
obviously one of the two manufacturers
making graphics cards right now anyway
of with Intel gamer they enter the arena
next year you have that choice to make
and the cool thing is you have that
choice which is something we didn't have
for about the last two or three years I
mean Vega and the whole HP m2 and HBM
back on on VG architecture in my opinion
was just a bit of a flop it was too
expensive to manufacture which meant the
prices had to be high which made a lot
of the value not there but now you've
got the fifty seven hundred and fifty
seven hundred XT beating fps wise its
counterpart from Nvidia at the same
price point so it's one of those things
where really as a buyer you're the one
that has to make the decision on whether
it's worth it to you now we're going to
be adding more titles to the mix here
and one thing we obviously didn't talk
about here is overclocking of the
graphics cards because when it comes to
overclocked testing and and all that I
want to use retail facing drivers the
public driver that you were gonna have
not the press driver that was supplied
to us and I always feel a little bit
sketched out by doing reviews using
press drivers but we don't have really
have a choice and very rarely have I
seen there be any sort of negative
effect by not getting the same
performance with the with a full
functioning driver for the public but
it's one of those things I just want to
know that what I used is the same exact
thing you are gonna have so that's why
we wait to do our overclocking and that
sort of stuff but one of the things I
asked AMD specifically was whether or
not we're gonna see this family grow I
think obviously we are I don't think
they're gonna have an entire our DNA
architecture hinged on just two skews
they're obviously going to grow
but my question to them was whether or
not we're gonna see bigger and badder
things or are you gonna try and start
more at the entry level are you gonna
try and go after like the 20 ATT eye
level market because Radeon 7 clearly is
not at that right that performance level
all they would tell me was that these
are the only two SKUs that they're gonna
talk about and basically what they kind
of said was you know Nvidia you know is
is alone up there in the top end and
they're okay with that which to me kind
of met like okay maybe they're not going
to compete on that but what they did say
was that this should be compared our
DNA's architecture should be compared to
when Rison first launched in 2016 and
the disruption it made to the market in
the cpu market is how this should be
looked at because they have the same
roadmap the same internal philosophy on
graphics now because there's been a
shake-up and the leadership downward in
the graphics division as well that they
should be looked at how Zen was and then
over the next several years you'll see
much more exciting evolution of our DNA
architecture so I mean that's one of
those things where aim D delivered on
the CPU promise but are they gonna
deliver on the GP promise
I think if these cards become adopted
and market share comes back to AMD on
Radeon side like it's been happening
with CPU if they can do the same level
of competition and potentially beat
Nvidia kind of across the board then
there's no choice but for both companies
to innovate and have a price battle
which i think is great for everyone so
guys sound off in the comments below
it's only two new excuse from AMD but
it's new nonetheless and it's worth
talking about because now like I said
direct price comparison and for once to
see AMD actually win that price
comparison in terms of just value for
FPS per dollar it's it's exciting to see
so many guys sound off in the comments
below on how you feel about this and
what titles you think we should add to
our benchmarking suite because we want
to add more that's it that's all there
is to talk about and I can't wait to see
what you guys have to say because I have
a feeling it's gonna get heated it's
gonna get almost as hot as all these
GPUs get alright guys as always what's
the internet
