r-tx performance although beautiful is a
little bit lackluster even in 1080p
today we're going to show you how far
the latest dice patches actually improve
things which could look kind of
promising for the future
all right so this is the exact same
portion of the campaign the French
portion I believe the French part of the
campaign where we showed you that even
in 1080p with DRX on in dx12 obviously
those those have to go together we
showed you that I was actually dropping
down with ultra all the way into the mid
to low 30s at 1080p so let's go ahead
and compare it's the exact same graphics
card as I mentioned this is the unicorn
20 atti Strix from Asus which apparently
is still not made it onto shelves this
is the 2080 version right there I might
have said tinny they don't recall anyway
RTX 2080 TI and so this is the same part
if you recall that I showed you that's a
friendly where you can see the
reflection of the truck how that truck
is now obscured from view and you can
still see it what sort of happens here
and I know I mentioned this in the last
video but in case you haven't watched it
I'm gonna go ahead and explain to you
again real quick what RT X is and why
this is the future now listen to me I
know a lot of you are like RT X no one
cares no one cares no one cares here's
the bottom line all the cards are
selling out RT X is it's the future it's
the same thing people said about shaders
new a new shadows no one cares about
shadows or any of that stuff well guess
what you've come to accept it and that's
now the way we game this is probably
gonna take some time to mature obviously
but what happens here is the reason why
you can still see the reflection right
there is because ray-tracing is looking
at reflections and basically rendering
anything that is out of scene what
basically could have happened right here
if we're looking at standard screen
space which basically just takes an
image flips it upside down in the
reflection to give you a bit of a
reflection once the truck blocks that
view you can no longer see it here and
in the previous video we'll show you saw
that there was kind of a blue box that
sort of appeared and which was sort of
blended into the scene things that are
not in scene don't need to be rendered
because it's useless information the
reason why RT X gives you such a
performance hit is because now it's
rendering not only everything that you
can see anything that is in line of
sight of reflections now as you can see
in 1080p right now in ultra we are
sitting at 80 fps
previously we were sitting at 60 which
was just okay I guess but for a $1200
graphics card or in this case like 1300
or whatever it is that is certainly not
something to write home about in fact
it's a little disappointing or downright
depressing to be like I've got a $1200
graphics card that in 1080p can only
give me 60 FPS or on top of this hill 30
now Phil can do a side-by-side here so
you can sort of see and compare this
particular scene sure they're not exact
and I've got to kind of take care of
these fascists real quick hold on so
yeah it's not a direct side-by-side but
you can kind of compare that you know
we're not getting 30 FPS we're now
getting 75 at 1080p with everything on
Ultra what they've also kind of done too
is they've lessened the gap between
Ultra and low because member what we
showed you in that last video is if we
went too low then we saw a significant
increase in performance but that's
actually not the case this time we just
went from 75 to 78 or 84 83 right it's
not massive I mean 10 FPS it at this
particular you know resolution is
significant but it's nothing like it was
before where we were seeing massive
improvement so I'm gonna go ahead and go
back to ultra and like I said 75 FPS
pretty damn nice now now that we're
seeing this type of performance I kind
of wanted to test what happens with
1440p or even 4k because Nvidia made the
claim that in 1440p you can get 60fps
okay so we're in 1440 60 again ultra and
as you can see we are now getting this
guy needs to just get out of there okay
yeah get him so as you can see now we're
getting 65 FPS 64 well of course we look
straight down look at that seventy five
six so we're definitely at least in this
particular scene right here I had
already given up in the last video at
this particular part of the campaign
when I was playing it for the testing of
our TX because of the fact that it was
pretty much unplayable and I'm dead we
were only seeing 30s here now you can
see we've upped the resolution an entire
level and are getting twice the FPS we
were at 1080p so there's clearly been
some maturity when it comes to RTX
Athena is still disappointing where you
go ahead and go and check multiplayer
now the thing that is extremely
disappointing is the fact that there is
still no SLI support this would be a
perfect opportunity for RTX and SLI to
get really good performance yes at the
cost of you know $2,500 I'm a well I'm
well aware of how expensive this card is
trust me but at the same time it's like
there are people out there like myself
who really get their jimmies wrestled in
a good way when it comes to this level
of detail I know how I know how this
game type works I don't need you to tell
me all right so here we are in
multiplayer 32 players seeing um deploy
90 FPS remember this is 1440 I went
straight to 1440 I don't we don't know
exactly what they changed they just said
up to 50% performance improvement with
our TX with the latest patch and Driver
which is clearly what we're seeing they
kind of copped out on the running water
though because I mean make sense it's
not smooth so of course the reflections
aren't gonna be really there I'm sorry
if you're a graphics nerd like I am this
game all battlefields have been great
but this one's specifically okay well I
mean I'm 1440p everything's maxed out
settings wise including DRX what is okay
that gun sucks all right so here's we're
gonna do right now we're gonna go ahead
and put the 2080 in because Nvidia and
dice are saying that with the latest
drivers and such you can actually get
with DXR on you can get 60fps I believe
it you can get 60fps and 1080p which
again as he saw we couldn't do with the
2082 guy before and the 2080 TI was
advertised as having enough improvement
to give you 60 FPS in 1440 with all
features enabled so that's we're gonna
do right now we're gonna throw in my
2080 and see if we're getting those
advertised claims considering what we
just saw right now with the 2080 Ti
I think it's pretty obvious that we're
gonna probably gonna get at least 60 FPS
with this okay so I know this is not the
same map that we just played but it is
Rotterdam which is a map that's pretty
hard on poor
a lot of people complain about Rotterdam
being terrible now as you can see we're
getting 60fps 6160 now they did
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
they did claim 60fps with settings on I
believe a high is what it was and Phil
can annotate if I'm wrong but I believe
it said 60fps suddenly in a big piece of
combat here so as you see we got fire
going here we got some reflections I've
got me being killed sitting in the upper
50s low 60s with a non overclocked r-tx
2080 something else I should have
probably pointed out earlier in this
video is these cards are not overclocked
these are out of the box settings and
here's a spoiler alert for you guys in
terms of performance the 60fps you're
seeing right now with the 2080 is at
1440 ultra so we are obviously going to
exceed in 1080p the 60fps promised with
DX are turned on okay so in conclusion a
2080 at 1440 is certainly playable in
battlefield 5 with RT X on or DXR on lo
obviously give us about 10 more FPS
ultra was clearly playable in a map like
Rotterdam where everyone complaints but
here's the takeaway at the end of the
day in the last video a lot of people
seem to get upset that I said I like RT
X I think it's cool I thought the same
thing when rasterization came out this
is a personal belief of mine if you
don't agree with me that's perfectly
fine this is not the card for you you
can go out and get yourself a card
that's not our TX based and have a great
gaming experience although I'd recommend
you do it soon because Pascal is not
being made anymore
and because of the price of our TX
people ran out and bought up Pascal
cards as fast as they could find them so
if you can get your hands on one great
otherwise you're gonna be stuck with you
know 20 series anyway we're not testing
2070 because I still don't think that
card has enough performance to truly
give us the figures that we want and the
performance that we want at the price
that still costs I also didn't test it
because I forgot it at home I I remember
I did my review there it's still sitting
there but that's besides the point I
digress look rasterization when it first
came out took 2 or 3 remember there was
the the 256 from Nvidia the Emidio 256
card which was the first rasterization
card and then there was the GeForce 2
which then was like an improvement on
that we saw a really good performance
and then we saw the next family of cards
where it really became playable it looks
like things are moving faster with
yes which is a good thing I don't think
anyone can truly complain about that
again I have no idea what they change to
make performance better but clearly it
is better and it you know if a $1,200
graphics card to give you you know 1440
FPS or 1440 DXR and ultra at 60fps isn't
your thing I can't say I blame you it's
a lot of money to buy into the new tech
but it's only going to improve from here
and I'm glad to see that it's happening
much more quickly than we thought it was
we're still waiting on other titles
because right now this is a single title
title graphics card going to be
technical about it and I personally play
it with SLI in dx11 I don't even run our
TX when I'm playing this game so anyway
do with it what you will I don't really
care just want to share the performance
with you guys thanks for watching and as
always I'll see you on the battlefield
benefit 5 with RDX now mostly playable
anyway do with it which bit that is a
poke is a put the bet is this opposed a
try we were seeing like 30 FPS that's
we're not gonna do a video about how
much are they sound out about
so today so we're gonna do it's it's
