cents I'm bringing you a video today on
to an extreme budget card I mean this is
doesn't get a whole lot more extreme
budget than this the r7 250 here from
AMD now this is an msi branded card but
it was sent to me from AMD so i want to
go ahead and say thank you guys over
there and team red for sending me this
OC edition r7 250 to take a look at your
a7 250 series is good for people that
want to do dual graphics with mini
Kaveri ap use or maybe some of the older
ap use where you can boost the
performance of your integrated GPU by
allowing them to basically crossfire
with one of these lower end cards I
don't know exactly how well it scales
because I do not have an AMD APU system
here to do the testing with but I can
tell you who's going to be doing your
review on this in a APU dual graphics
situation that is colbert tech repair I
definitely suggest you guys go check out
his channel if you're interested in
finding out how this performs in dual
graphics configuration in his test bench
now let's go ahead of the card just a
little bit here nothing too impressive
but the bare bare minimums of this card
aren't too bad it does have one gigabyte
of gddr5 PCI Express 3.0 compatible
DirectX 11 point 2 compatible the
graphics memory bus here is 128 bits and
your outputs are you know your DVI D
your HDMI your D sub solid caps Super
ferrite chokes on their supports multi
GPU MSI Afterburner real time live
streaming and all that stuff with this
card so I mean it's got basically all of
your basics covered now just like some
of the other graphics cards we've looked
at in this price range it is super teeny
tiny you don't cute yeah I mean it's got
the MSI fan on there it tends to make it
nice and quiet very basic cooler it
actually looks a lot like the Intel
stock cooler and cut in half sort of
thing you know but whatever
so there's your outputs as a standard
VGA which i think is kind of strange
foot anyway there's your HDMI and then
there's your DVI
and then your back plate with the msi
branding on there very lightweight card
does not require any sort of exhilarate
that said let's just go ahead and see
how the benchmarks do and then I'll tell
you guys pretty much whether or not this
is a card you should consider or pass up
depending on what your scenario or your
situation is so don't go away well you
know I think I've got a pretty good idea
of where this card fits in now now
performance wise it pretty much did
exactly what I thought it was going to
do it did not put up any sort of
impressive numbers but then again it's
not really intended to I played some
battlefield 4 on this guy and I put it
on an ultra preset which I knew was
going to just basically rip this card a
new butthole but you know an FPS we're
sitting in the mid-teens an average of
14 frames per second which you know is
absolutely unplayable but where this
card really stood out was in the medium
preset in the medium preset on 1080p I
was able to get an average of 43 frames
per second on medium which was very
playable in fact I scored some pretty
awesome kills while doing the
benchmarking for this unfortunately I
wasn't recording so you guys just going
to take my word for it but where this
card really comes in is if you're one of
those gamers are running a really old
panel like a 900 P or even a 720 or 720p
then this thing really jumps up into the
60s and high 50 frames per second range
without any problems whatsoever so I
really consider this card to be you know
exactly what it is for the entry-level
gamer or somebody who has a low
resolution panel doesn't need all the
bells and whistles and just wants to
have consistent smooth frame rates at
low resolutions if that's you then
that's exactly where this card fits in
now where I really feel this card
belongs is sitting in some sort of an
AMD APU system particularly Kaveri if
you have that now but it still works
with any of the eight and a ten APU
systems but if you could set this up in
dual graphics I think it's going to
really show you know its true potential
when it's able to be working in tandem
with another internal GPU or APU or
something like that so make sure you go
and check out Colbert tech repair his
channels down in the description he's
going to be taking one of these r7 250 s
and he's going to be doing a dual
graphics demonstration and showing you
it's just how well it can do so guys I'm
gonna go ahead and get on out of here
tell me what you're using when it comes
to entry-level graphics and what kind of
resolutions are you running with those
entry-level cards or what games you
playing help each other decide what's
right for you guys depending on your
playstyle and your preferences and as
always I thank you guys for watching and
I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
