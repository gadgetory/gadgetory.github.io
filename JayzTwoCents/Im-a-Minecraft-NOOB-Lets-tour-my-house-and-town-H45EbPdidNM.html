little bit of Minecraft because that's
how I've been sort of vegetating lately
never played it before and I really
really like it if you don't like it well
you should try it if you have tried it
you don't like it well I don't oh jeez I
hate those guys
it's not their guy he saw me oh god no I
hate these guys they're like duh hey
stop it go away hate those guys oh my
god they're always hanging out of here
alright as I was saying before I was so
rudely interrupted today we're gonna
play a little bit of Minecraft the new
z170 classified motherboard from EVGA
features eight phase PWM 4 Way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want a badass motherboard with
no compromises click the link below to
learn more so this is my hilltop house
up here in John's Village John from
John's game exchange our games channel
somebody have been friends with meta
flog affair and really enjoying his
company and this is his village so this
is why you haven't if you've been
playing with me this is why you have not
been invited to come look at my house in
person because this is John's private
area by invite only and it's not my
place to invite people over here so
anyway there's my house up there on the
hill everything over here is very
village e he's working on a castle over
there he's building a castle we still we
got some smaller houses over here and
then my house up there on the hill which
is clearly not really meeting the decor
of the village but nonetheless it's it's
my house my humble abode we got a random
chicken not anymore
so I built away from the village because
I didn't know how good I would be at
Minecraft and I've already torn down the
house and rebuilt it a couple times and
I'm pretty happy with it could be bigger
but if it were bigger than it would take
up way more space and just be more gaudy
so I kind of went with a modern theme
something like you'd see on the
Hollywood Hills because that's kind of
houses you see a lot of around here but
yeah this is this is it so you walk up
here a little curly little pearly gate
thingy to a front balcony and then you
join my house and you're greeted with a
nice warm fireplace mod
living room with a wood hardwood floors
flat-screen TV entertainment center and
a little leather ottoman leather couch
not bad
some pictures on the wall here's my
kitchen breakfast nook the kitchen even
has a working refrigerators or both of
them work if you click on it
food pops out at you and you can eat the
food mmm although I didn't crab what is
this
an enderpearl how to get that that drop
off one of the bad guys all right so
I've got a little island out here that
you can you know cook on we got a dual
stainless steel sinks stainless steel
appliances yeah it's kind of the wife's
idea although I should probably do the
refrigerators to be stainless huh this
is a outdoor balcony area with the
recliners we've got a pool sunbathing
deck spa overlooking the little forest
over here I've got really nice forest
view actually it's kind of a weird stone
picture there so I've got really nice
force V on that side over here on this
side we've got a nice village view looks
pretty I haven't done anything with this
area I don't all do yet so we can see
the village in the castle going up over
there nicely and then if you come around
the other side and you put pressure
plates in so I don't keep well there we
go house weird so I had to keep closing
my doors manually you can see the
staircase here it's like a tall glass
thingamabob er here's a view of the
forest we get a sense a sunrise view
here the Sun comes up on that side so
it's a nice sunrise thing going on over
there um over here we've got another
balcony that overlooks the wife's she
shed she started playing she calls us a
she shed I'm not sure what that means I
don't know if she if she sells sea
Shores down by the sea shed or she shed
whatever you see someone else's building
a house way out there but she's learning
how to play minecraft last night was her
first night in here and this is what she
started and we'll see how it turns out
but yeah that's going to go up to the
second story
that's over here it's like a little art
area um I haven't decide when we do over
here this might be like a desk like a
little office area I'm decided so if you
come up these stairs
then you are greeted with the landing
area where I've got some suits of armor
on display having decided what I'm going
to do with this room area here so kind
of a weird rectangular shape with doors
on two sides that make it kind of weird
to try and do something with I might
take out the suits of armor and make
this like a sitting area I haven't
decided
or an upstairs living room we got
balcony looks down to the first floor
handle low reading area this goes out to
upstairs deck where you can go watch the
sunrise if you wanted got a friend
building up right there and then the
master bedroom where all of my secret
stuff takes place we've got our
fireplace balcony the whole front of the
house is about me overlooking the
village and the castle out there and
then the bedroom where I do all of my
sleeping and so yeah that's it for my
house it's not a lot going on here now
if you want to come play with us you can
come into the server the IP is down the
description just play nice don't be dumb
or you'll be you'll be banned and kicked
and all that stuff and you can when you
come in you accept the rules you can
warp straight to my town by doing four
/warp J space J's town and then you were
brought to J's town and this is what you
see a list of lots and lots of rules now
J's town here I am a mod so I'm going to
fly to kind of show you around you can
see the town it started look pretty good
on you no I probably should have
mentioned the beginning of the video I
am using shaders derp I'm only like six
minutes into this video and I've yet to
mention the shaders so I am using the
conquest of the Sun shaders pack with no
texture this is just default textures
but I am using Optifine so it loads
pretty good and even though we're
recording right now 60fps you can see
I'm not really getting any lag or
anything fps is sitting locked at about
a hundred because that's where I
actually have it locked in the settings
so I don't get fluctuation but anyway
this is
the center here things were me going up
right here we already got a fish market
right there and it's up to me to build
the rest and I just haven't done it yet
we've got some unfinished houses but I'm
gonna show you a couple of houses that I
think look amazing this guy over here
has been building this kind of a stone
cathedral looking thing it's very
medieval looking but man this is awesome
he's uh he's definitely going to be
invited to build in Jays Ville which is
going to be my official town kind of
like Jays little village this is sort of
a free-for-all where people are allowed
to build whatever they want as long as
they finish it and don't build it right
in the middle of town so this guy is
clearly going to be invited to come
build yeah this looks amazing I mean
even got like wrought iron fences going
holy what does that made up I don't even
know I'm such a noob at this game
we do have a railroad system that goes
around here just kind of neat somebody
else over here has been building a big
giant glass orb thing that glows at
night because it's full of glowstone I'm
not going to say it's the prettiest
thing I've ever seen but it's a thing
all right someone else built what looks
like Bowser's Castle from mario 1 the
original mario brothers so exactly the
prettiest looking thing he hasn't even
been back to do anything with it in fact
most of his stuff is on the ground I
don't know but yeah we got some things
over here that look pretty nice and I
would like to invite some of these guys
to come build like this house looks
fantastic
so village like Villa thing here looks
amazing these guys haven't been back to
finish this but I wish they would
they're building like a chateau like a
river chateau and if the blocks would
actually load and guilt you can see this
is going to turn out really amazing as
long as they come back anyway would be
nice if they would but yeah this is
going to look really really good
somebody built what looks like a giant
telescope observatory thing and then we
got a really funky tree house made out
of stone it's very heavy treehouse yeah
that's Jays town right there people are
building kind of having fun so if you
guys want to come build in here you're
free to do so just don't do it right
here in the city center
we go out down the roads somewhere and
yeah there this something else I've been
working on here is a skyscraper because
I want to build like a modern city it's
also very dangerous out here you can see
there are tons and tons of like bad guys
that spawn around here anyway this is a
skyscraper all the floors exist
they haven't been filled in yet I want
to have people come and help me build
this city but I want people who are
willing to build structures that look
good like this not you know Minecraft
dirt houses and wooden houses that's not
going to work for a modern city so I eat
one of these floors could actually be
occupied by people to make an apartment
in there so people want to come help me
build a city and they're good at
building then we can do that the upper
floor tear section right there is mine
it's gonna be like a penthouse type of
thing but yeah I think whoa you didn't
see me that's good I'm gonna go stick
the spider in the butt with my sword
hold on ow all right uh yeah I want to
build all of this out like I've
flattened a lot of this land I spent a
lot of time I say week is one of the
other fellas on the server help me do
this otherwise this would have taken me
forever just hear something oh geez I
hate these guys what do these guys have
against me why are these guys always
here damn it where'd you go
they're a big blender ah stop it set up
a story new can I kill you I don't have
a bow and arrow I mean he's running away
from me and don't they normally come and
attack you I'm fine run away
Missy so if you want to help build this
out then you can go build in Jays town
and then you can tell me you show me
what you built
build it modern style and then I'll
light you'll be humbly built but I want
this to be kinda like a Miami type of
city because I have this area I'm not
allowed this is sorry if it's too loud
but I have this area on the water I
shall finish that oh gosh it's getting
dark this area at night even though I
put up all these torches I think every
single one of these little shadowy spots
spawns a pad it's almost like there's a
spawner in there anyway there's a beach
over here you can see we've got a lego
Peninsula the island right there I kind
of haven't I I want this to be like a
beach city and look really awesome
so if you guys want to help with this
then you just you need to come play and
show me that you can build nice modern
structures like that it's about to get
really dangerous around here really
quickly so I gotta put down some torches
as a floating pickaxe I think somebody's
spying on me anyway every time to end
this now let's do some more minecraft
videos I guess we can do that but I'm
not talking any tutorials or like how-to
with Minecraft because I'm not very good
the buildings might look nice and all
but I haven't done anything with
redstone of definitely not great at that
and they all appear to be stuck in the
water
alright well time to turn this off let
me know if you guys want to come and
hang out check out the link in the
description or not link but IP in the
description you can come hang out with
us and I hope to see you guys on the
server otherwise I'm going to continue
to kill spiders and zombies and try not
to get blown up cuz I don't wanna lose
all my stuff meanwhile I'm is gonna be
sitting here putting down torches
because that's what we do in Minecraft
put down torches all day every day and
try not to get killed by this skeleton
shooting bows and arrows at us while we
find random sheep butts to stick our
swords in that sound really bad did
alright one thing about our server two
is the they have a plug in so that the
zombies don't blow up the ground and
your buildings which is cut another
zombies with the creepers so that's kind
of nice
anywho thanks for watching guys we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
