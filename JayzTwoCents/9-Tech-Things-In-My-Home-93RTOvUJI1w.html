you a pretty interesting video that I
hope that you guys are going to enjoy

YouTube where people are showing 9
technology related items in their home
so I decided hey this could be kind of
fun maybe i'll go ahead and show you
guys nine different things regarding
technology that i just went and randomly
collected from around my home
a police scanner this can be a whole lot
of fun when you're driving around town

time on her iPad then this thing a
13-inch MacBook Pro made of aluminum
nice and sturdy for those of you who
want to make fun of me for saying oh
