gonna do you know a full AMD themed
around the Radeon seven because I did it
for the Titan r-tx I was like I'll do it
for the Radeon the problem will has
availability and because of the lack of
availability on this card a lot of the
block manufacturers were like we're not
gonna be making water blocks so that was
just like crap now what do I do if I
don't water cool this thing I'm was
gonna be shit like I did with the r-tx
Titan and then this arrived origin PC

in the description below what we got
here so we've got a block dang that's
heavy holy crap seek handout that is so
heavy what the hell all right
so this is gonna be interesting because
if you've seen gamers Nexus video about
why they use like that sort of a
graphite pad instead of a thermal pad
it's because of apparently the extremely
uneven nature of the HBM and the 3d
stack in there so I'm curious as to how
they will moly that's a lot of metal -
it's big big that's the right size ok
this oh yeah I forgot they didn't
increase the height on these that's why
I was like why is this feel like an
aftermarket card anyway I'm curious as
to how they have us doing this because
oh yeah ek and the whole like if you
want the manual scan this QR code look
at the amount
of thermal pads that come with this and
two tubes of thermal paste what I don't
know yet if I can use the stock
backplate with this which I would really
like to do because it would retain at
least something Radeon although the
stickers are really ugly on there so
we're gonna set that aside because we
are going to go ahead and tear down this
card so here it is with the block
installed and the factory backplate
retained it was actually pretty easy in
fact you can't even include longer
screws because I think they figured
someone would probably want to keep it
it looks pretty good though I think Phil
thinks it would look better with the
clear block I tend to usually agree I
just wanted to keep it sort of black and
silver like the theme we have obviously
back there for the all AMD build and
then this is what it clearly looks like
you know we start so yeah now we have to
do is we're gonna throw this one on the
test rig we're gonna see what the
temperatures are cuz I can't remember
and rather than just using our old
numbers in terms of temperatures we are
going to run the loop let it get nice
and warm with the air card and then we
are going to throw this guy onto a
radiator and stuff to make it a little
custom loop for it and we'll see what
how it improves on water I'm not
expecting the overclocking to really
necessarily get better but I'm
definitely expecting thermals to get
better and expect us to stay into the
booth frequently long a frequency longer
and probably even perform a little
better with under volting so we'll have
to see but now we can get to the whole
point of this video we've had the
graphics card running now way longer
than we needed it to probably like 40
minutes or so we just want to make sure
it was nice and saturated find the worst
case scenario here it's all stock
settings no undervolt no / volt no
overclock just out of the box set it up
and off we went remember the Radeon
seven has two temperatures you have
eighty like a max
temp which is junction temperature and
then you also have like the standard
temperature which is kind of like edge
temp and hottest is really weird so
we're just gonna look at both of those
numbers to compare air cooled cards get
hotter way faster than water-cooled
cards do because of how long it takes to
heat up the water so we know for a fact
we have saturated this way more than we
need to we look at our temperatures
right here our max temp that we hit on
temperature was 74 and our max
temperature in junction a hundred and
eleven C we were we would definitely be
throttling there our max core temp that
were its frequency we got was 1806 and
if we look at the chart right here it's
that orange line so that orange line is
turbo boost and that's specifically
because of temperatures and all that
junk so you can see something on this
yellow line right here that's fan curve
so something stressed it suddenly and as
the temp and the stress one up the fan
curve went up the GPU came down all the
way down as low as 17 11 doesn't look
like we went any lower than that so 17
11 no 1702 appears to be our low so we
obviously want to see how our max
temperatures fare I mean this Delta
right here is more than 40 C right no no
I guess 40 C we've been 114 so it's 37 C
Delta between junction temperature and
temperature so now we're going to throw
a water cooled card on here with a 240
millimeter UK fan Vardar and PE radiator
and C at those temperatures improve
obviously they're going to is our water
cooled as long as we make good
connection with the thermal compound cuz
what I'm concerned about is if you watch
gamers Nexus video about when he used
the contact paper and it showed what the
spread is like between the GPU and the
cooler granted the thermal paste is
thicker so that's gonna make up for some
of that gap but it wasn't very even
because of manufacturing tolerances on
the top of the 3d stacks so I'm curious
as to how well it's gonna cool what
we're anticipating is that the
temperature will clearly come down what
we're expecting the junction temperature
to come down the most and be closer to
the standard temperature so let's set it
up do the same thing and see what
happens
that looks so much better already well
it's not getting any warmer in fact the
rad is even cool to the touch with the
amount of CFM we have with this VAR DARS
the air coming through is like how to
make a guess it might be a degree or two
warmer than ambient it's barely any
different touching the back of the card
it's like slightly warmish the front of
the card is like room temp so we're
gonna go ahead and stop this test and
see what it is together because we can't
see any of the overlay while we're in
here so let's see our max temperature
cut to 77 but max temperature itself was
47 so still still a 30 C Delta so like
no matter what that number doesn't
really get closer together but if we go
ahead and look at this chart though look
how much more steady everything is
everything is clearly much more stable
GPU temperatures stayed pretty much
locked to like the 1750 1782 1764 1760
58 but we didn't do any overclock or
anything so I'm kind of curious now if
we play around some of these settings
real quick what will happen it's not
going all the way to 2000 those at 1956
for the junction temperature went up to
99 so on water so clearly clearly it's
different something because the
temperature shot up to 55 and 99 see
that was our max right so where do we
actually at right now 97 on water I want
to see if it up at 2000 - that's a 1977
oh there's 101 1999 you could do it 1948
2003 it shot right back down in 1987 but
I started bringing the voltage down oh
alright 2052 though we couldn't get
anywhere near that on air I guarantee
that I mean the fact that we were still
seeing 101 C on junction temperature on
water but the max we saw on the edge
template 56 C so there you go that's the
GPU we're using for the AMD bill that
will be water-cooled obviously as we did
so you can now kind of get
what the graphics performance is gonna
be like it makes me wonder now if we can
compare this to like a twenty eighty how
much faster right but then you go over
twenty whatever
this isn't an argument about NVIDIA
versus AMD or anything like that it was
just fun to be like graphics card now
has a block available for it and we cut
well over 2000 megahertz out of it
something I would have never in a
million years guessed could have been
achieved with with what AMD has a whole
I guess especially let alone Vega how
hot it gets did you imagine if we tried
to push that on under water would not
have happened yeah yeah exactly like
that 64 it would not have happened on
air heck no we were getting air Junction
temperatures and the fact that dating
the crash hard enough to where the
system locked up because that it just
recovered itself so alright well thanks
for watching guys and as always we'll
see in the next I can at least show you
guys the block and stuff so here it is
right here the block I mean yeah it
looks like any other EK block and what
do you expect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
