the last video you will see with my
friend barnacles I'm going back to
Washington
woo and I'm equally as sick of him as
you guys I promise not really like a
liar big dirty filthy liar well first of
all right now I am currently in New York
City what I like currently currently
just at the time of watching oh yeah we
own those like time matrix things going
on all of them that I'll be in Seattle
yeah so he's not here I'm not here you
guys are watching this because I didn't
want to leave you guys without any
videos we're going to go ahead and turn
some laps here and then I'm gonna coach
Jerry in the BMW z4 gt3 on Lime Rock
which is pretty easy it's a small track
it's wide
yeah and you've already seen how I've
driven on that track it's pretty
horrible so left side down left yeah
pretty much left to my own devices I
can't drive for on that course so
I'm curious to see if with Jays coaching
I can actually do a lot better in a
little amount of time okay so here's how
this is going to work I'm gonna do a
couple of laps here I'm pretty much just
gonna tell you what I'm doing what I'm
thinking while I'm doing it half of its
gonna be like food and the other half is
gonna be like sex okay and then when
that stuff isn't actually coming out of
my I was gonna say coming out of my
mouth uh this video is just coming out
of your where so I'm gonna basically
coach this guy and do some laps tell him
why I do what I do see if we can't
improve his lap times and maybe you'll
beat my time
let's hope so now disclaimer I am NOT a
professional driver I have had my racing
license back in the past but that was
well over 15 years about 12 years ago
he's just covering his ass in case this
all goes horribly wrong yeah well that's
a disclaimer so there's plenty you guys
out there who could turn a faster lap
and for that I genuinely applaud because
that is it's not easy so if you're on a
faster lap tell Jerry how to drive tell
me how to drive so let's go ahead and
get in some lime rocks some z4 gt3
action and let's let's just go ahead and
get onto it
alright guys well Miran J's piece of
 simulator right here and I'm going
to go ahead and turn a couple laps my
way on Lime Rock in the gt3 BMW here the
M it's the z4 right it's z4 gt3 z4 gt3
stock pedal stock wheel this is all
bones Dom 27 all bone stock stuff but J
already kicks my ass even with my like
$2,500 rig so I'm gonna turn laps my way
and then we're gonna have J coach me and
then we're gonna turn some other laps
and let's go ahead and compare the times
it's kind of like it went down in Days
of Thunder yeah
watch your next right now
paralyzed my time last time idea was a
50.1 weather oh yeah
all right we're just coming off the
warm-up lap so here we go first official
one
oops
oh man
I saved it give me a lot of time cutting
hammer
fine art
my baby
plus I get it all
all right so very first thing to
remember guys first lap is always a
warm-up left the tires are cold you're
not going to be able to turn you pretty
much just have to drive a pole that was
one of my wrecks yes
all right so in this turn this is a
second gear turn okay you spent every
turn in here in third I did that's the
second gear turn okay
now my line here is because of the s
turn followed followed by this turn
number three right here you want to
actually come wide on this turn you want
to get high on the groove that way you
can come in tight and you're already set
up for the next turn I was otherwise
yours
yes Quigley through here okay and then
it could be full throttle all the way
through here your tires might touch the
rumble strip and then you're set up for
the next turn okay so the most important
thing in racing is your entry and exit
need to make sense for the next turn
okay
sometimes it make the entry may not make
sense until you exit the turn that you
realize you're lined up for the next
turn got it coming through here this for
me is going to be a fourth gear turn
flat out fourth gear ape exit to the
outside this car has so much downforce
in such a big wing you can go full
throttle through and I was lifting on
everyone in my lap yeah you don't get to
lift unless you're in the middle of a
turn if you're on if you're in the
middle of turning through there you have
to lift or you're going to get light and
come around got it this is also a fourth
gear flat-out turn for me it's a bit of
a slide if you get this turn the apex it
right you pretty much right about here
on the turn will just kind of slide out
to about right here under full turning
force okay and you're perfectly lined up
for this you spent this turn does that
was tricky this one always gets me this
is the hardest turn for most people you
spent this turn in fourth gear yes I'm
always flat out fifth here oh my god how
because if you come out of that turn
lined up properly you come out of the
turn previous to this you down sugar you
up shift into fifth and you're perfectly
lined up to eight PEX this
just like I mentioned in the last turn
you're going to slide out to the outside
line flat out so it's a very it's a very
harsh apex okay all right so I'm gonna
go ahead and do an actual warm-up lap
then we'll turn some labs and see what
my times are all right
on right here I break on number three
full braking force down shift to second
coming into here okay so it's full
braking force notice I did one thing
right yeah oh you were braking on August
breaking on for ya
all right sighs warmth
all right so Jays best lap he turned was
a fifty three one six and I'm actually
turning about a fifty one point five ish
so I've got nearly a little over second
that I need to make up a lap at one
point two seconds so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply what J's showed me and see if
we can go ahead and increase my time I
think I will because I was doing my
lines were dramatically different than
yours
the line yeah my gear appearing yeah
alright let's go ahead and give this
shop
all right so I tried to do some coaching
here and I think ultimately it might
have been a little bit successful I felt
like there was a vast improvement okay
so my time was a fifty point three one
six and your first time your best time
which took you a few laps to get there
was a fifty one point five ish yes now
your best lap after some coaching was a
fifty point nine and I think was a 908
yeah and I've never broken into the 50s
so the cool thing is we drop to a whole
point six seconds which on a track like
this is actually quite a bit it's a
short track there's none of many areas
to make up some time but I don't know
what the entire message of this video
was maybe we just wanted to bring you
guys some fun can Jerry actually drive
sort of videos I think we were just
trying to prove that you are faster than
me and with a little instruction I could
be faster too and with a little
instruction I could be faster yeah so my
goal now is to go home use your
instruction improve upon your
instruction and then come back next time
and instruct you how to get into the 49
which is where I'll be here in like a
week or so yeah but I think and people
are pretty people I've seen people put
forty sixes in this car on this track
and I don't know where the hell they're
making a bad time that's called cheating
oh no I think ultimately you shaving
point six seconds off your time is
pretty impressive considering it's in a
car you didn't know correct so it was
interesting because it was it was purely
virgin yeah virgin for life am i right
fellas girls no I think the fellas might
be more into you they are actually they
like plumper fluffers the fact that you
pulled six point six seconds off of your
time in a car you didn't know on a track
you knew by changing up your driving
style so I mean it's not easy to be used
to one thing and then you change it all
up it worked for you you started
slipping back into your old driving
power was yeah so but at least you
learned just kind of some things to look
at when it comes to the track I mean it
most people know that general apex rule
you know you outside inside outside on a
turn yeah but you got to think not just
the turn that you're in especially on
track like this where they have s turns
you have a complete decreasing radius
hairpin turn yeah so there's a lot of
things to think about and sometimes the
entry point may not make sense that's
what she said
but you basically just got to line up
the car for the next turn that's what
you got you guys think ahead you got to
think ahead so guys I hope you enjoyed
this video is just a little bit iRacing
just seeing if we can improve on his
times and my times need some work too my
god Dan I kept trying to push it really
hard
kept like slamming the wall like 140 you
have to admit it you can't get your
fastest time when you're on camera and
people are watching absolutely not
you can't second you turn this thing on
everybody loses a little bit of time
it's very nerve-racking but I think once
you get home you get in your sim you're
familiar wheel you're familiar pedals
with that you know that load cell load
cell brake the fact that you can stand
on that thing
pedals aren't sliding around you're on
carpet pedals here you read so I think
your times are ultimately going to prove
on this track now I think would be
really fun in the future is teaching you
how to really do some oval racing no no
that's what I want to get into next
without slamming into the back of the
car on the start yeah all right guys
well I'm gonna genuinely miss Jerry in
fact I guess I already do because again
you're watching this into the future
yeah I'm already back in Seattle and if
you're from the future please give me
the lottery numbers and I'll build you
all a system I promise yep
well with that guys I guess we're gonna
go ahead and out of here follow us on
twitter at Barclays at Jay's 2 cents
make sure you sub to him if you not 3d
printer stuff 3 46 inch monitors yeah
all right guys as always we'll catch you
in the next later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
