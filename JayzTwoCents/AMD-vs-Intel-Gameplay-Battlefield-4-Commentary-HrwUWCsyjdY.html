and I'm bringing one of those rare
gameplay commentaries on the channel a
lot of you guys really like this some of
you people who've never seen a
commentary ur like what the heck is this
why are we watching gameplay this is
weird actually this is kind of the norm
and every single year I like to do a
video about AMD vs intel and since this
is kind of the way i started my channel
I kind of like to go back to the
nostalgic feel of gameplay commentaries
so I do this a couple times a year now
where I do AMD vs intel to bring you
guys information on which processors are
right for you and try and keep the
information as current as possible so
without further ado let's go ahead and
jump into some battlefield 4 here play
an engineer class with a pretty specific
load out specifically for myself when it
comes to engineer class i love my mtar i
love my small but today we're going to
go ahead and use the straw rocket which
turns out to be pretty beneficial we're
also gonna do some main battle tank
action here and without further ado
let's go ahead and jump into October
2014 AMD vs intel and how to choose the
right processor for you
alright so let's face it when it comes
to trying to pick the right processor
it's very difficult in this age because
there are some very very biased
reviewers out there and let's be honest
we're all biased to a little degree now
with this I want to say this take my
opinion here with a grain of salt and
compared and contrasted to other
opinions that you're hearing and try and
formulate your own opinion based on a
lot of different peoples of the point of
views and only then can you start to put
together the big picture of what's going
to work for you now i have my
preferences but I do the best I can to
remain unbiased but let's face it we all
do have a little bit of biased in us and
I am real enough to admit that now one
other thing I want to also stress here
is you're going to hear a very common
thread in this video from every other
video i have ever made that talks about
how to choose a particular product
whether it be a power supply or cpu in
the past or a graphics card or ram the
common thread being what are you doing
with your computer now that's a hard
question for a lot of people to answer a
lot of people are building their very
first computer and they've have no idea
what they can do with their computer so
how are they supposed to say what
they're going to do with it so they're
afraid they're going to buy a cpu and
they're going to get the wrong cpu and
it's going to keep them from doing what
it is they want to do but here's the
reality when it comes to that every cpu
can do with any other cpu can do they
all just do it at a little bit different
speeds that's it I don't care if we're
talking about the x 99 59 60 X or the FX
4100 which is just a little bitty baby
little quad cpu on the FX side which you
know it's not very very strong but it
tries it's like a little engine that
could they both can do the exact same
thing it's just one's going to do it
better than the other so don't be
worried that you're going to buy a CPU
that simply can't do something because
it will it's just going to depend on how
fast it is really it's not like the
program's going to pop up and say sorry
brah you can't do this function because
you didn't buy it until 59 60 x better
luck next time
Wow yeah that's not gonna happen I
promise you AMD vs intel well let's go
ahead and face it the realistic realism
reality reality it's a lot of ours there
are realistic reality here is that Intel
is faster than AMD on just about every
front at this juncture when it comes to
the technology I lasted this video in
January and since then intel has
launched several new cpus and a brand
new platform AMD on the other hand has
not really launched anything but a few
refreshes of an existing platform that
has already been around for going on
three years that being the FX line now
they came out with some new FX 8350 and
8320 style processors were there a
little more efficient but they are no
more powerful that so yeah kind of
disappointing to see that AMD is not
coming out with brand new architecture
groundbreaking technologies but guys
let's face it AMD is not trying to do
that they are really trying to improve
the apu which is going to take quite a
while to get up to the current standard
of what standalone CP user are being
offered from intel so it's going to take
some time now with that said this is not
a fanboy comment this is just a
realistic fact Intel's faster than AMD
on every front but that's not to say AMD
is something that you should overlook in
fact in my opinion I'm more often than
not will recommend AMD CPUs people
looking to build a very budget oriented
CPU or computer tower because I feel if
you're doing gaming you need to be
putting the majority of your money into
your graphics card your graphics card
should be the single handed most
expensive piece inside your computer
hands down period I don't care who you
are the reality is if you are a gamer
the GPU needs to be once again the most
expensive part in your computer end of
story dot period ship it yes that is my
opinion on that now the AMD CPUs are
still very strong the 8350 came out in
2012 and folks if you haven't looked at
a calendar lately we are moving into
2015 it is getting a little bit old but
it is still one of those horses that
just won't die and it just keeps going
so the 8350 is still my go
to processor at the two hundred dollar
range when it just comes to all-out
value now there's a lot of debate of
whether or not it's faster or slower
than its Intel counterpart at the same
price range which would be the e46 90k
from Intel which is a new cpu by the way
it launched in june of 2014 both are
great cpus but Intel's a little more
power efficient and a little bit more
powerful on some applications but the
8350 beats it and some others they trade
a lot of blows that's the kind of thing
you're going to notice now when it comes
to the lower end CPUs now I would
recommend going with an 8350 if you are
an AMD fan now if you're not and you
have absolutely no bias my personal
payment opinion would be to go with the
46 90k because I feel the Intel zalgar
algorithm dobelle guru the measure makes
sense Intel's architecture is going to
be a little bit more tailored to and
biased when it comes to the developers
of multi-threaded applications
multi-threaded applications are becoming
more than or more single core
performance is not fantastic on AMD and
a lot of these programs are going to
start looking to do multi threading
functionality inside of their api's
which is going to say the more cores or
more threads the better now that's why I
would say the 8350 is pretty strong if
you're going to be doing like live
streaming or live game streaming or
recording or rendering videos and you
had to choose between the 46 90k or the
8350i really feel like it's a toss-up
I've owned both cpus I started this
channel with an AMD 8350 and it served
me very well and I publicly said moving
from the 8350 over to the 3770k back in
2013 was the most costly non-beneficial
move I ever made with a CPU so that's
saying something I noticed absolutely no
difference whatsoever with day-to-day
processing power or gaming experiences
or even rendering experiences when
moving from one to the other minion tell
rendered a little bit faster but if
we're talking a difference of two
minutes yeah if you're running a bit
rendering videos as much as I am two
minutes could really add up over time
but you know for the most person for the
moat the average person may be doing
one or two videos a week you're not
going to you know for four minutes a
week is not going to add up to a whole
lot of time for you now like the 59 60 X
which I'm currently using which is
rendering videos at three times
real-time rate which means I can render
a 12-minute video in four minutes that
actually matters but the 59 60 x that's
not a processor i would really even
recommend for the average consumer I
mean it's got very expensive motherboard
requirements very expensive ddr4
requirements I don't even really want to
include it in this video I kind of
regret that I even brought it up right
now but yeah we'll do a separate video
in the future about x99 and 59 60 X
because I get a lot of people saying
should I upgrade from the 47 90k to the
x 99 59 60 x oh my gosh I feel like I
should have done that that's like what
are you doing with your computer they
say things like oh I'm just gaming oh
yeah bro you're not going to notice any
differences in fact gaming's the games
tend to be slightly faster sometimes on
the 47 90 k than the 59 60 X so once
again the CPUs are also tailored to a
certain function 59 60 x 16 threads
absolute rendering beasts and I went
with it because I am obviously rendering
videos like this one which you're
watching right now yeah so AMD is not
something I feel that people should be
overlooking and I'm saying that loud and
proud there's a lot of people who are
going to be fanboys of Intel and just be
livid that I even said consider getting
an AMD cpu because they are gonna be
like no bra intel is the best you gotta
go in till you gotta go into oh my god
AMD is garbage and they're like pooping
all over themselves while they're saying
it I really hate that mentality i don't
like fanboyism it only makes it harder
for new comers to the pc community try
to decide what to buy so if you're
finding yourself listening to this video
right now and you're on the edge and you
just don't know what to get your you're
looking at your shopping carts and
you're looking at pc part picker and you
just can't decide on a limited budget
i've only got seven hundred dollars
should i get the i5 you know 3200 or
whatever it is i'm sorry guys i don't
know a lot of the i five numbers by
heart a little bit of a snob in the
sense that
have you know I seven stuff but again
that I would never say go get an i7 bra
and get a cheap GPU now that just
doesn't make any sense but if you're
finding yourself on the fence thinking
about getting a lower end I five because
you just are scared of the AMD 8350 or
the 5970 or whatever it is the five
gigahertz CPU on AMD side don't let
people scare you away from that there
are fanboys out there and do nothing but
try and steer you towards a brand out of
blind loyalty rather than being
realistic about performance of these
CPUs the CPUs have come a long way in
the last 10 years some people don't know
this i worked at cpu i worked at cpu yes
I worked at CPU now I worked at circuit
city in two thousand and I was there
when the very first AMD one gigahertz
CPU ship they were the first to hit the
one gigahertz mark and it was it was
great everyone was just loving the fact
that technology was moving fast but the
reality here is that technology is not
moving as fast as it used to when it
comes to CPUs because we're hitting the
limits of where we can go on the current
you know silicon or or the structure
that makes up the CPU and it's really
making it difficult for people to decide
if you're a gamer by Intel be loud be
proud if your life's dreamer by
something like the 8350 and be proud if
you're the kind of person that's like me
where you're willing to spend more and
say I will pay gladly twenty to thirty
percent more to simply say I have the
best then by all means go at Intel that
would be really the only thing I could
suggest I mean there are no other
options AMD or Intel but just if you
hear one message in this video and
you're new to buying a computer you're
looking to build your first computer do
not be afraid of going AMD in fact look
at their graphics cards their graphics
cards are an amazing offering in fact
for the longest time they were just
stomping all over nvidia I mean the 7000
series a 7970 gigahertz edition was
destroying the 680 back in 2012 and
everything about the competition between
AMD and NVIDIA was just great for the
consumer so don't let people scare you
make
sure you get what's right for you and
please listen to as many people as you
can when it comes to suggestions that
are reputable reviewers and come up with
a decision that makes sense for you guys
have been Jase two cents thanks for
listening to this video today go ahead
and ask your questions on Twitter to me
directly if you have any questions or
head on over to Facebook them over there
as well and as always guys I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
