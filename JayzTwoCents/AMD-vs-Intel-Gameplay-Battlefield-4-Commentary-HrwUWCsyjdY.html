and I'm bringing one of those rare
gameplay commentaries on the channel a
lot of you guys really like this some of
you people who've never seen a
commentary or like what the heck is this
why are we watching gameplay this is
weird actually this is kind of a norm
and every single year I like to do a
video of out AMD versus Intel and since
this is kind of the way I started my
channel I kind of like to go back to the
nostalgic feel of gameplay commentaries
so I do this a couple times a year now
where I do AMD versus Intel to bring you
guys information on which processors are
right for you and try and keep the
information as current as possible so
without further ado let's go ahead and
jump into some battlefield 4 here play
an engineer class with a pretty specific
loadout specifically for myself when it
comes to engineer class I love my mtar I
love my small but today we're going to
go ahead and use the straw rocket which
turns out to be pretty beneficial we're
also gonna do some main battle tank
action here and without further ado
let's go ahead and jump into October
2014
AMD versus Intel and how to choose the
right processor for you
all right so let's face it when it comes
to trying to pick the right processor
it's very difficult in this age because
there are some very very biased
reviewers out there and let's be honest
we're all biased to a little degree now
with this I want to say this take my
opinion here with a grain of salt and
compare and contrast it to other
opinions that you're hearing and try and
formulate your own opinion based on a
lot of different people's of you point
of views and only then can you start to
put together the big picture of what's
going to work for you now I have my
preferences but I do the best I can to
remain unbiased but let's face it we all
do have a little bit of biased in us and
I am real enough to admit that now one
other thing I want to also stress here
is you're gonna hear a very common
thread in this video from every other
video I have ever made that talks about
how to choose a particular product
whether it be a power supply or CPU in
the past or a graphics card or Ram the
common thread being what are you doing
with your computer now that's a hard
question for a lot of people to answer a
lot of people are building their very
first computer and they've have no idea
what they can do with their computer so
how are they supposed to say what
they're gonna do with it so they're
afraid they're gonna buy a CPU and
they're gonna get the wrong CPU and it's
gonna keep them from doing what it is
they want to do but here's the reality
when it comes to that every CPU can do
with any other CPU can do they all just
do it at a little bit different speeds
that's it I don't care if we're talking
about the x99 59 60 X or the FX 4100
which is a little baby little quad CPU
on the FX side which you know it's not
very it's not very strong but it tries
it's like a little engine that could
they both can do the exact same thing
it's just one's gonna do it better than
the other so don't be worried that
you're gonna buy a CPU that simply can't
do something because it will it just
gonna depend on how fast it is really
it's not like the program is gonna pop
up and say sorry brah you can't do this
function because you didn't buy it until
59 60 X better luck next time
Wow yeah that's not gonna happen I
promise you
AMD versus Intel well let's go ahead and
face it the realistic realism reality
reality it's a lot of ours that are are
realistic reality here is that Intel is
faster than AMD on just about every
front
at this juncture when it comes to the
technology I lasted this video in
January and since then Intel has
launched several new CPUs and a brand
new platform AMD on the other hand has
not really launched anything but a few
refreshes of an existing platform that
has already been around for going on
three years that being the FX line now
they came out with some new FX 8350 and
8320 style processors where they're a
little more efficient but they are no
more powerful that is so yeah kind of
disappointing to see that AMD is not
coming out with brand new architecture
or groundbreaking technologies but guys
let's face it AMD is not trying to do
that they are really trying to improve
the apu which is going to take quite a
while to get up to the current standard
of what standalone cpus are being
offered from intel so it's gonna take
some time now with that said this is not
a fanboy comment this is just a
realistic fact intel's faster than AMD
on every front but that's not to say AMD
is something that you should overlook in
fact in my opinion i'm more often than
not will recommend AMD cpus people
looking to build a very budget oriented
cpu or computer tower because i feel if
you're doing gaming you need to be
putting the majority of your money into
your graphics card your graphics card
should be the single handed most
expensive piece inside your computer
hands down period i don't care who you
are the reality is if you are a gamer
the GPU needs to be once again the most
expensive part in your computer end of
story dot period ship it yes that is my
opinion on that
now the AMD cpus are still very strong
the 8350 came out in 2012 and folks if
you haven't looked at a calendar lately
we are moving into 2015 it is getting a
little bit old but it is still one of
those horses that just won't die and it
just keeps going so the 8350 is still
might go
- processor at the $200 range when it
just comes to all-out value now there's
a lot of debate of whether or not it's
faster or slower than its Intel
counterpart at the same price range
which would be the B 4690k from Intel
which is a new CPU by the way it
launched in June of 2014
both are great CPUs but Intel's a little
more power efficient and a little bit
more powerful on some applications but
the 8350 beats it and some others they
trade a lot of blows and that's the kind
of thing you're gonna notice now when it
comes to the lower end CPUs now I would
recommend going with an 80 350 if you
are an AMD fan now if you're not and you
have absolutely no bias my personal
payment opinion would be to go with the
4690k because I feel that Intel's Algar
algorithm novela grew the measure makes
sense Intel's architecture is going to
be a little bit more tailored to and
biased when it comes to the developers
of multi-threaded applications
multi-threaded applications are becoming
more the norm or single core performance
is not fantastic on AMD and a lot of
these programs are going to start
looking to do multi-threading
functionality inside of their api's
which is going to say the more cores or
more threads the better now that's why I
would say the 8350 is pretty strong if
you're going to be doing like live
streaming or live game streaming or
recording or rendering videos and you
had to choose between the 4690k or the
8350 I really feel like it's a toss-up
I've owned both CPUs I started this
channel with an AMD 8350 and it served
me very well and I publicly said moving
from the 8350 over to the 3770k back in
2013 was the most costly non-beneficial
move I ever made with a CPU so that's
saying something
I noticed absolutely no difference
whatsoever with day-to-day processing
power or gaming experiences or even
rendering experiences when moving from
one to the other
I mean the Intel rendered a little bit
faster but if we're talking a difference
of two minutes yeah if you're writing a
bit rendering videos as much as I am
two minutes could really add up over
time but you know for the most person
before the moat the average person maybe
doing
one or two videos a week you're not
going to you know for four minutes a
week is not gonna add up to a whole lot
of time for you now like the 59 60 X
which I'm currently using which is
rendering videos at three times real
time rate which means I can render a
12-minute video in four minutes
that actually matters but the 59 60 X
that's not a processor I would really
even recommend for the average consumer
I mean it's got very expensive
motherboard requirements very expensive
ddr4 requirements I don't even really
want to include it in this video I kind
of regret that I even brought it up
right now but yeah we'll do a separate
video in the future about X 99 and 59 60
X because I get a lot of people saying
should I upgrade from the 4790k to the X
99 59 60 X oh my gosh I feel like I
should have done that and it's like what
are you doing with your computer they
say things like oh I'm just gaming oh
yeah bro you're not gonna notice any
differences in fact gaming's the games
tend to be slightly faster sometimes on
the 4790k than the 59 60 X so once again
the CPUs are also tailored to a certain
function 59 60 X 16 threads absolute
rendering beasts and I went with it
because I am obviously rendering videos
like this one which you're watching
right now yeah so AMD is not something I
feel that people should be overlooking
and I'm saying that loud and proud
there's a lot of people who are gonna be
fanboys of Intel and just be livid that
I even said consider getting an AMD CPU
because they are gonna be like brah
Intel is the best you gotta go in till
you gotta go in till make out AMD is
garbage and they're like pooping all
over themselves while they're saying it
and I really hate that mentality I don't
like fanboy ISM it only makes it harder
for new comers to the PC community try
to decide what to buy so if you're
finding yourself listening to this video
right now and you're on the edge and you
just don't know what to get your you're
looking at your shopping carts and
you're looking at PC part picker and you
just can't decide on a limited budget
I've only got $700 should I get the I 5
you know 3,200 or whatever it is I'm
sorry guys I don't know a lot of the i-5
numbers by heart a little bit of a snob
in the sense that I have
you know i7 stuff but again that I would
never say go get an i7 bra and get a
cheap GPU now that just doesn't make any
sense
but if you're finding yourself on the
fence thinking about getting a lower end
I five because you just are scared of
the AMD 8350 or the 59 70 or whatever it
is the five gigahertz CPU and AMD side
don't let people scare you away from
that there are fanboys out there and do
nothing but try and steer you towards a
brand out of blind loyalty rather than
being realistic about performance of
these CPUs with CPUs have come a long
way in the last ten years some people
don't know this I worked at CPU or I
worked at CPU yes I worked at CPU now I
worked at Circuit City in 2000 and was
there when the very first AMD 1
gigahertz CPU ship they were the first
to hit the 1 gigahertz mark and it was
it was great everyone was just loving
the fact that technology was moving fast
but the reality here is that technology
is not moving as fast as it used to when
it comes to CPUs because we're hitting
the limits of where we can go on the
current you know silicon or or the
structure that makes up the CPU and it's
really making it difficult for people to
decide if you're a gamer by Intel be
loud be proud if you're livestreamer by
something like the 8350 and be proud if
you're the kind of person that's like me
where you're willing to spend more and
say I will pay gladly 20 to 30% more to
simply say I have the best then by all
means go at Intel that would be really
the only thing I could suggest I mean
there are no other options AMD or Intel
but just if you hear one message in this
video and you're new to buying a
computer are you looking to build your
first computer do not be afraid of going
AMD in fact look at their graphics cards
their graphics cards are an amazing
offering in fact for the longest time
they were just stomping all over Nvidia
I mean the 7000 series of 7970 gigahertz
Edition was destroying the 680 back in
2012 and everything about the
competition between AMD and NVIDIA was
just great for the consumer
so don't let people scare you make
sure you get what's right for you and
please listen to as many people as you
can when it comes to suggestions that
are reputable reviewers and come up with
a decision that makes sense for you guys
have been Jays two cents thanks for
listening to this video today go ahead
and ask your questions on Twitter to me
directly if you have any questions or
head on over to Facebook them over there
as well and as always guys I will see
you in the next one
