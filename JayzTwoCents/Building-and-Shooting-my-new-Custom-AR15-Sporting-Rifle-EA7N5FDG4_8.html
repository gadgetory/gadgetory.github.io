at the delay I get I still look up
things and I don't okay we're never
gonna get through this this this video
was doomed before it even started
hey what's up guys Jase $0.02 here over
on the vlog channels and jay says and I
said on Tech Talk the other day I was
building my very first ar-15 and you
guys wanted to see it so I am sitting
here with prototype somebody who has
been on the channel before has helped me
on quite a few projects including when
we beat the shit out of a computer with
a bat 20,000 subscribers special we're
at one hundred and sixty one thousand
dollars a long time so this is Jake with
evolution sports in Redlands California
and actually that's where we picked up
all of these parts not a sponsor didn't
pay for this I just want to give them a
plug because they have Ivan actually
known these guys since they started
before they started their business so I
just wanted to go ahead and say that's
where everything is from here evolution
sports so go ahead and talk real quick
about the lower we're using we're gonna
put together some parts you guys will
see some cool montages and then we'll
talk about the gun at the end of this
video well to start out we have the ATI
Omni hybrid lower receiver here so
basically this is going to be a polymer
receiver where it's strengthened with
aluminum right at the buffer tube and
that's why at the hybrid yes I was
really worried about buying this lower
but I did a lot of I did a lot of
reviews on this it's steel no I heard it
was aluminum it doesn't matter it's
reinforced bottom line I great reviews
on this it's lightweight and you know
it's funny is Taylor over at evolution
sport I asked him I said this is polymer
really gonna live up to the to the
standard he's like looks cars or polymer
he's like there's so many guns out now
that are polymer like em cars or try
bars there are Tavares they're all
polymer he said the reason why the AR
was built out of aluminum was because
when they designed the m16 those were
the only materials they had at the time
so this is actually an advancement of
the platform yes so what we're gonna do
now we're gonna go ahead and put
together the the the the weapon here the
rifle and we're gonna have some fun with
the videography and then we're going to
talk about the gun at the end of the
video and he knows more just as much if
not more about guns than I do computers
that's why he's doing it and I'm not
because I'll probably poke an eye out
with a spring
trying to put something together it's
true I suck it
alright guys so we went ahead and built
the rifle last night actually I should
say Jake here built the rifle I'm
actually really impressed with your
efficiency skills in the way that you
it's almost like you had four arms well
I do what I can
no that's crazy I'm gonna be honest here
guys I've already said this I don't know
a lot about rifles I mean I was trained
to shoot my father was a weapons
instructor he trained me to shoot but I
don't know much about the modern
sporting rifle and this is a sporting
rifle I just want to point that out so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hand it
over to Jake here he's gonna tell us
about the parts we chose why we chose
them and we're gonna gonna have some fun
shooting this badass sporting rifle
remember it's a sporting rifles Jake go
and tell us what we got here
all right so just to start off the stuff
you can't see in here we threw we went
ahead and threw in a tactical ambush
lower parts kit we also have a lower
profile gas block here this will let us
accommodate the utg pro free-floating
rail okay this will also have our MFT
for grip here we're gonna be having a
Bravo Company pistol grip and we went
with the Magpul a CSL and that's gonna
be the adjustable and locking stock
that's a badass little stock it doesn't
wiggle or anything and it's got
compartments for snacks and then for the
optics we went ahead and went with the
vortex Spitfire it's a very nice red and
green dot reticle and so this is the 1x
but they do have a 3 X version as well
yes again with a few modifications that
we did this was a very hard gas block to
remove we actually ended up needing to
cut and hack and get it up and running I
had to break out the dremel and take it
to my brand new upper and a block or the
gas block a posts a front sight whatever
you want to call it to my brand new
barrel had to Dremel on it before it
even got shot but as you can see nothing
stops us yeah and then besides that just
do the quick polish on the trigger or
the trigger
I love trigger polishes but other than
that's a very great firing weapon can't
wait to shoot alright so let's go ahead
and have some fun shooting shit
California guys we do have some
restrictions I want to dress that real
quick is do you notice I cannot get the
mag out the button right here is not
actually not a button it's called a
bullet button and it's basically a block
that causes it so that you can't push
the release for the mag I call it a
bullet button because it's designed to
take the tip of a bullet and stick it in
there and then you can release the mag
basically it's designed to restrict
quick reloads problem number one with
California but hey I digress
number two this is a 30 round mag from
Magpul however you can see there's a
rivet right here and I'm using my middle
finger for a reason this actually limits
the capacity to ten rounds so really
that's what it takes to make this in
California legal sixteen and a half inch
barrel ten round magazine and a bullet
button now that's like I stopped me from
shooting this thing we had a lot of fun
out here today I got it I got to say I
love everything about this gun the
adjustable stock we just a rapid-fire
way that not a single Jam or a
malfunction of any kind
absolutely fantastic now optics take
some it takes a while to get used to
this type of optic for me I was trained
to shoot on iron sights and I was
trained to shoot on a n8x and 20x scopes
so the whole idea of a red dot was
really new to me and I had a lot of fun
I mean we were killing bowling pins and
whatnot so guys you guys wanted a video
about the AR here it is thank you Jake
evolution sports Redlands California if
you guys are local go and check it out
everything you see here with the
exception of the optic that was Amazon
sorry but they do carry optics was
actually bought purchased
background-checked everything was done
at evolution sports so again not a
sponsor I just really like these guys
and as you can see we put together one
hell of a rifle so guys thanks for
hanging out today
Jase two cents over on the vlog Channel
tell me what you guys think about this
if you guys have a RZ you live in the
beautiful United States of America tell
us what your shooting and most you guys
will probably be another in a southern
state where you can have like 40 round
mags
bitch okay ever get the hell on out of
here let's go shoot some more right take
it easy to you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
