summer months are quickly approaching
some of you are just now starting to
fall out but us over here in California
are already starting to smoke out I
guess that sounds wrong right what are
you doing
shopping for a case when you build what
are you looking for I want something
designed for water cooling fractal
design define us all the way check it
out
plenty of air flow plenty of open
interior for water cooling radiator
support it even has mounts for your
reservoirs I don't have enough room for
my hard drives okay
fractal design r5 look at all those hard
drive cages and you can fit your
radiators and water cooling in here no I
got a lot of hard drives but I also have
an e ATX motherboard okay I'm gonna try
something here okay
bear with me you might wanna stand clear
I never actually tried this before
yeah it worth fractal design to find r6
you could fit all your radiators a
crap-ton of hard drives and if it's a
ATX dude this is perfect
nailed it so as I was trying to say it
is starting to get hot in plenty of
parts of the world so we're gonna start
taking a look at some a i/o cooler is
some more water cooling content and
first step on the chopping block is
inter Max's new lick fusion which is an
RGB take on there a IO what I've always
liked about inter max is the fact they
do they don't just go with the ASA Tech
rebranded stuff they design everything
in-house so we're gonna take a look at
this one today we're going to slap it on
our 8700 k and we are going to see how
well this thing can actually handle the
heat otherwise it ought to get out of
the kitchen or something like that
now obviously the lick stands for liquid
they've always called their a iOS lick
tech or lick fusion or lick whatever but
the fusion is obviously the RGB and as
you can tell by looking at the box they
spared no RGB on this guy but we've also
got a flow indicator so what makes this
one a little bit different is the pump
is actually in line on the tube and the
block is just a flow indicator and a
block so rather than having the pump
crammed into the block it is separate so
I've never actually seen that yet on an
AI oh so that's gonna be interesting to
take a look at you get a lot of stuff
that comes with it though you get a here
that this is some sort of a jumper
interesting so it is a jumper and I
guess the reason why they do that is and
we'll look at this in a second here they
actually provide you extra coolant so
that you can top it off if you need to
so it is technically a serviceable piece
in fact here is that 100 milliliters of
coolant right here which of course has
your anti corrosive additives and all of
that stuff says avoid direct sunshine
exposure so this is our RGB header right
here we've got a fan splitter for our
fans I guess an extension cable for our
fans a SATA power cable everything is
detachable from this which is kind of
neat we've got our brackets of course
because this does support basically
every socket from LGA 775 and up with
the exception of tr4 it does not support
the Red River so keep that in mind we
have got our
TV control module our thermal paste our
brackets our screws
we've got to RGB fans right here from
interacts and I've always felt like
enter max goes above and beyond in terms
of their fan quality they are a lot
better than you would typically find in
just your run-of-the-mill AIO
static pressure optimized you can tell
by the swoop of the blade the number of
blades the density of where the blades
actually you know how close together
they are they're close together the
blades are the more static pressure you
have because there's nowhere in between
the blade to the fan air to escape so
high pressure of course and then here is
the obviously the entire purpose of this
video the a IO little dial right here
appears to be some sort of a purge valve
so that's kind of neat you can purge the
system of air so here is our flow
indicator slash block combo this is also
RGB lit so that's kind of neat you're
gonna see this thing spinning as it's
going so you always have that visual
indicator that your AIO is running
that's always a concern of people with a
iOS is did it die and you didn't know
until your computer shut off well you're
gonna know because his little wheel is
gonna spin and tell you that this is a
sort of questionable move though putting
the pump in line like this I can see
where that makes sense but it's not
aesthetically that pleasing with it
being in line like this it does sort of
kind of get in the view I mean and
depending on where you've got this sort
of arranged it's questionable about
whether or not it's going to even be as
aesthetically displeasing to your build
so I guess that's gonna be up to you in
your case but that's pretty much
everything you get in the box let's go
ahead and install it on our 8700 K and
see how well it does so here's the look
fusion all set up I want to start off
with something you might notice there's
no RGB showing on the pump we actually
killed that RGB because we plugged it
into the motherboard until we realized
it's addressable five volt and not an
actual 12 volt RGB address this system
and it's not mentioned until page 15 of
the manual regarding that so it's an
important thing to point out that you
need to make sure if you're gonna be
plugging in directly to your motherboard
which it does support it has to be a 5
volt addressable RGB something like the
NZXT motherboard with cam
would support that the asus boards has
all 12 volt so we fried the RGB on our
pump we did have it running with our
controller first which we wanted to test
and it looked great
unfortunately we tried to sync it with
the motherboard and killed it but at
least you can see with the fans how that
looks that's totally on us I just want
to put that out there in case you're
considering getting one of these that's
something you definitely need to keep in
mind but here's what the controller
looks like it's pretty neat so it's you
use the up arrow and down arrow to just
cycle through the different modes and
then if you want to speed up the effects
let me get to enough like a changing
effective they like this one which has
kind of a marquee sort of a color change
if you push the M button the LED turns
red and then you can speed it up or you
can slow down the effect so you can
control this via this little control box
if you don't have a motherboard that
supports adjustable RGB but what about
cooling right RGB is a cool thing but
cooling is obviously what matters most
we've been running our test here on OCC
T off and on where we've been four
minutes on this test and it looks like
our max CPU temperature has hit 82 we
are overclocked to four point seven
gigahertz on all cores so it's not as
far but overclock as a 8700 K could go
but it is an 8700 k that has not been
deleted so we are talking about a hot
CPU we are sitting anywhere from the
upper 60s to the low mid 70s with a
couple of cores hitting the 80s again
characteristic when 8700 K but far from
our t.j.maxx of 105 Celsius so yeah it's
definitely doing the job the fans are
adjustable both through PWM which we do
have it connected to a PWM on this
motherboard from 500 rpm to 2,000 rpm so
the temperatures you're getting right
now are based on the fans completely
maxed out and the pump is completely
maxed as well one thing worth pointing
out though the flow indicator on this
moves very very slowly so if you're
expecting it to see it just turn it away
like a crazy looking pinwheel like you
see on clothes or open loops on custom
loops that's not what you're getting on
this because some of the fluid does
bypass the little flow indicator so even
when it's running extremely low our
PMS on the pump the indicator does not
move very fast at all this kind of looks
more like a carousel than it does a flow
indicator but it's a nice visual
reference if you have a window on your
case you can look in and see that your
pump is indeed running as long as
running a hundred percent as soon as you
slow it down then it definitely doesn't
give you as much of the effect but it's
a nice bonus it's not something I would
rely on I would definitely set up
warnings in your bios if your
temperatures go above a certain degree
that way if your pump was to die then
you would definitely know now this is
let's talk about the serviceable aspect
of this pump real quick or this unit it
is technically serviceable it has a port
on the side that you can and has a
sticker on there too telling you where
to go in the manual to learn more about
it you can add more fluid to this if you
need to typically an AIO like this does
not require service and does not need to
be opened up this has a bleed port on
the radiator making it easy to get the
air out I'm just not entirely sure why
that's necessary most a iOS are not
going to require any sort of service so
I don't know why that's an option I've
never had one evaporate on me because
they're sealed to the point to where the
evaporation isn't really enough it's not
something you deal with I think they
just might be trying to appease - maybe
the enthusiast but again I'm not
entirely sure why maybe because you have
the clear top on the block they're
thinking that you might put in a fluid
that is colored or something like that
to make it just that much more I don't
know custom but I mean at least the
option is there and as long as you don't
go messing with it and opening up plugs
and stuff you probably don't need to
serve as service this whatsoever but
they do obviously give you both the
jumper to run the pump so that you can
bleed the system as well as additional
fluid if you need to top it off for some
reason so anyway guys that's been my
first look here at the inner max lick
fusion obviously there are GBA i/o
cooler I'm personally a fan of the older
lick tech coolers they used to have
which were much more simple they were
single you know plugs for the pump they
had just a single led in their single
either white or blue LED very robust
beefy reliable and didn't you know have
all these wires and stuff one drawback
to having all this RGB is the fact that
you had
have a lot of wires coming off of this
two plugs per fan obviously a plug for
the block for the RGB and then obviously
you have your wire for your pump which
is now in line which makes it more
difficult to actually route these wires
without being seen obviously in an open
test bench like this are pretty obvious
in a case a little bit easier to hide
but it's something definitely worth
talking about so what you guys think
about the inner max lik fusion let me
know in the comments below and if
there's any other coolers you guys want
me to check out as we move into the
summertime make sure you guys let me
know by hitting me up either on Twitter
or commenting down below again a huge
thank you to inter max for sending us
this cooler to take a look at we're
going to get out of here and as always
we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
