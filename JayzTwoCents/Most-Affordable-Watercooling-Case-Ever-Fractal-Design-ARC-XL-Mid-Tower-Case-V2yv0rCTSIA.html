cents and I'm bringing you what is going
to be the last review of 2013 what we've
got right here is one of fractals
biggest cases that they make the fractal
design arc XL and man is this thing
extra-large just like me you know
fractal design is one of those companies
that I really really have liked this
year they've made a huge presence in the
gaming and computer building industry
this year and they've really come to the
market with something I feel is unique
whereas a lot of case manufacturers over
the past have really kind of gone flashy
bling and lights have you wear crazy
designs all over the case funky window
designs and just a lot of it looks
really really gaudy and just ugly but
fractal design has really looked at the
approach of less is more when it comes
to aesthetics so the design of their
cases really seems simple on the outside
but they put a lot of effort into what
goes inside the case now the XL has a
lot of compatibility in it in fact you
know rather than talk about what's on
the box I'm just going to go ahead and
open this thing up and we'll just we'll
get right into it I don't care a whole
lot about talking about the box because
who cares now this thing is going to
look a lot like the rest of the arc
series obviously they are committee the
arc mini and this just takes those cases
and just stretches the crap out of them
so that you can fit in all kinds of
components if you're building yourself a
custom water loop or going full-on
gaming or maybe you're just
overcompensating I don't know it doesn't
know Who am I to judge
that's up to your designer to decide if
you're overcompensating I've got a 900 D
right let's not go there now until
you're knocking this thing we ate off
the table
I think I just broke my closet that's
okay I don't keep anything important in
there anyway except the closet monster
now the foam that they pack this in is
pretty brittle so I wouldn't go see it
just kind of broke right apart there
I wouldn't go ship in the system in this
I would certainly repack it with
computer-type packing material so all
right here it is in all its glory and
this thing is pretty big I mean this is
certainly a full tower now a lot like
the ark mini and the ark MIDI you've got
the same style window here with your
protective film on there and this smoked
out which looks pretty damn awesome
now the features that are on this case
are very very similar to the other cases
that we've already looked at so rather
than go individually over each feature
on this I'm going to talk about some of
the main features and then we'll talk
about what you could fit in this case
now on the top it's a lot like the other
cases where you have a completely
removable top screen here that has nice
soft filter in there for dust filtering
the entire top now you have some
interesting stuff going on here when it
comes to the top of the case now you
have 140 ml 2 x 140 millimeter
compatibility and you have 3 x 120
millimeter compatibility here on the top
now what makes it interesting is the
140s are offset you can see they've
already included 1 140 millimeter fluid
bearing fan in there but if you want to
do a triple read it is in the center but
that looks like there's plenty of depth
here to where you won't have any
interference with your motherboard which
is like on the arc Mini where they
offset that that way you can go with a
full sized radiator and push pull and
not have any issues so they've done that
here with the 140 if you want to put a
dual 140 millimeter rat in there with
push-pull fans there's more than enough
room for it on the top here you have
your 5 7 and 12 volt fan controller that
is built in your
a reset power button there you have your
microphone and headphone output and
input 2 USB 3.0 2 USB 2.0 now moving
around to the front of the case you've
got your your same brought a full
brushed finish it looks a lot like it's
brushed finish but it's just plastic I
think it looks good at it keeps costs
down but giving you a nice design to
take a look at on there we're going to
take the front panel off on this bad boy
and expose the guts of this case now it
is a steel construction so the case does
have a little bit of heft to it but I
think that's good because you
I don't like flimsy cases you know that
a real thin stamped steel with plastic
on there this is really rigid I mean it
is riveted together there's very little
on here that's actually screwed together
so it's going to be harder to take apart
in mod shouldn't stop any hard core
matters but look at the inside here
you've got your hardware - for hard
drive - times for hard drive cages here
so you have total eight hard drives you
can mount there you've cut what looks
like one two three four five and a
quarter expansion bays plenty of
grommets here to get all your wiring
through again all black sleeves wiring
exactly what you come to expect from
fractal design sleeved wiring here on
the fan and it does look like you have
one 140 millimeter in the front one
exhaust on the back and one exhaust on
the top that's included but plenty of
expandability I mean you can fit another
140 in the front and you can fit all
those fans on the top that we've already
talked about now let's go ahead and talk
about the back of the case and let's see
what comes in there they've been pretty
good about supplying SSD mounts that way
you don't have to use up hard drive
cages to mount your SSDs and this case
is absolutely no exception as you can
see right here you have two SSD mounts
so you can put your SSDs right there
there little offset but who cares are in
the back you're not going to really see
them anyway you've got all black cables
sleeping which we've already mentioned
and they're already twist tied to the
back of the case to give you an idea of
cable routing
but you've got a lot of little cable
ties on here to give you adequate places
to mount your cables to so you can have
really organized cable management now
looking at the bottom of the case you
can see you do have a full length filter
for your power supply and you do have a
120 and a 140 millimeter fan mount on
the bottom so you can put a bottom rat
in there or a bottom fan which I don't
recommend bottom fans personally but
that's just me but what you can also do
is you can remove the the hard drive
cage right here in the front and you can
put a 120 millimeter fan or a Sudan 120
millimeter rad in the front a 240 rad in
the front it may or may not natively
support 2 x 140 we'll check that out but
we're going to do right now is we're
going to go ahead and stick some
radiators in here and see just how well
they fit to give you an idea of how
crammed it gets once you start filling
this thing up with some water cooling
components putting water cooling in this
case was extremely easy there's really
no other way to say it I mean take a
look inside this case right here do you
see how open and expanded this is inside
this case right now I have a triple rad
on the top a triple alpha cool radiator
on top with three fans I have a dual 120
millimeter fan in the front with fans on
there I have the light tower with the
pump and the reservoir attached to it
and look at all this space that you
still have in here
this took probably 20 minutes to put
together and I'd say half that with
finding the screws for the radiators and
fans because have so much crap I
couldn't find it so one thing I forgot
to show in the beginning of the video is
the front filter and how easily it makes
accessing the front fans I mean as you
can see out there we've got the alpha
cool elope fans in there and I mean look
there's the top with the triple rad and
the three fans in there
I mean look at this you see and the pump
is flopping around it's not actually
mounted down but look at the amount of
space we have in this build here we
could have put a taller rez in there if
we wanted we could have gone push pool
on all of this and still had plenty of
room I mean you can see the amount of
space you have here before you even get
near the bottom of the rad
because the fans are up on the top the
140 and the fact doesn't come anywhere
near the radiator yes I could stick my
whole hand in between the radiator and
going getting close I want people to see
this the amount of space that there is
in this thing I mean look at this do you
see the upper rad right here you see the
amount of space you have in the back of
this the radiator here look at the front
right here there are fans on the front
of that because the case has an indented
spot for the France two fans to mount in
the front giving you plenty of room for
radiator here and to go push pull or
even go as thick as an 80 millimeter
radiator if you want and still have room
to use your hard drive cage and you
still have room right here for a
full-size power supply even a modular
one now you have to be mindful of the
depth of that if you go with like a 1200
watt PS a PSU or something but you
everything in this is just so well
thought out and everything is so easy to
build in this case fractal design I kind
of hate you and I want to tell you why
I'm an old school mater and you've
really taken a lot of the fun out of
making this stuff fit in these cases
where you have to get creative with it
and start cutting and Dremel ingen and
and welding or making panels just to
make everything fit look at that
everything is in here and it looks as if
it was native and all came with the case
to begin with fractal design you're
taking all the fun or should I say the
headache out of coming up with custom
cooling solutions in a case like this so
guys this has been the fractal design
arc XL it certainly lives up to that XL
name check it out down in the
description remember guys we are going
to be going to CES in two weeks that's
