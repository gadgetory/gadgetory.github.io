you know what I'm impatient I don't want
to wait a whole nother month to spoil
someone with some elite PC goodness so
I'm going to get this party started a
little bit early here celebrating the 1
million subscriber giveaway this channel
has allowed me to play around with a lot
of very high-end hardware that is
otherwise unobtainable by most people
even the extreme PC enthusiasts can't
get their hands on some of the hardware
that I get a chance to play with so
that's why today I want to start a
giveaway that's literally going to make
someone today
now one lucky winner is going to win
everything that you guys are about to
hear so let's go ahead and kick it off
with my Intel 59 60 X CPU this CPU is
actually sentimental to me it's the very
first high-end elite CPU I ever owned
and this is directly out of skunk works
it's the exact same CPU so to say that
it's got some sentimental value to me
would be an understatement
you need a way to keep it cool so I'm
gonna be giving away my NZXT Kraken X 62
coolers it's going to do a fantastic job
at keeping the CPU cool and you'll still
be able to clock it well over 4
gigahertz with this cooler now you need
something to put it in so of course EVGA
has joined this giveaway by donating an
X 99 s for the win K it's going to give
you amazing overclocking stability great
cooling a very solid motherboard and
it's got all the features you would
expect like USB type 3 port or 3.1 and
all the other features that you would
expect with a x99 enthusiast motherboard
now for memory I'm giving away 32
gigabytes of G skills tried at V ddr4
quad channel memory way more memory than
anyone would ever need for gaming and a
great sweet spot amount of memory for
anyone doing content creation editing vm
programming whatever you might as well
go overkill where we can and I think 32
gigs is a pretty good number for that
now for a graphics card EVGA is also
thrown in there gtx 1080i CX that's our
new icx cooler with the nine sensors on
there allowing you to monitor everything
happening on your PCB prm's GPU memory
temps the whole deal
so that is going to allow you to run
pretty much any game you want at some
very high eally frames per second I mean
who wouldn't like that of course you
need some of them put these parts in so
a fractal design has also donated a
define best case it's the exact in case
I used in the surprise build I did for
my friend it's got a lot of room in
there you can upgrade to custom
to cooling later if you want to is going
to fake the crack in with no problem a
tremendous amount of airflow so you're
going to keep all these parts nice and
cool so you guys can take your hardware
and your storage and throw in a power
supply and you have got really an
extremely high-end system right here
that's going to last you for years to
come ok here comes the boring part guys
all the illegality stuff this is open
world wide its open world wide except
for where giveaways are prohibited
believe it or not not all country to
like people to get things for free and
if you live in one of those countries I
apologize
now for everyone else look in the
description of this video you're going
to see a list of the parts that are
being given away you're also going to
see a link to the gleam page which keeps
everything fair all you have to do to
enter though is be subscribed to the
channel and a bonus entry for following
on twitter that's it there's not like a
list of 25 different things you can do
one entry per subscriber and twitter
follower if you're already subscribed
it'll verify that and then you'll be
good to go
other than that guys that's pretty much
it now if you happen to live in a
country that's got vatt tax or any sort
of import tax you guys are going to be
responsible for the taxes on this stuff
as you receive it so unfortunately
that's probably going to be some cost
involved to receive this product I
apologize for that out of my control I
have no control over that whatsoever and
now I'm not going to be putting down a
value of zero on all of this to try and
avoid import taxes because that would be
called fraud it's going to take about
another month to hit the 1 million
subscribers so this is going to be
ongoing until we hit that number as soon
as the timer runs out we will pick a
winner and it will be announced in a
giveaway announcement video it will also
be announced on Twitter now you have to
claim your prize within 48 hours of
being notified of winning if you don't
your entry will be forfeited and a new
person will be drawn it's actually
happened in the past where someone
didn't respond in time and they
responded after a new winner was already
chosen and unfortunately for that guy he
didn't get his prize so check your email
check your spam filters and yeah other
than that guys good luck as always
thanks for watching and I will see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
