part three of this project update this
acrylic tubing update here for this
client build that I did last year and
today we're going to actually touch our
tube and we're going to do some acrylic
tubing bending okay so the first thing
you might notice is that the heatsink is
red again well I'm going to go ahead and
paint that thing red or black instead of
using the tape on there only because the
3m tape does have a tendency to shrink
as it gets hot no guys it does not
unstick it does not fall off 3m tape is
actually designed to be heat resistant
so it will last through the heat
especially the heat that that heatsink
can put on there but I don't want it to
shrink it does actually shrink as it
gets hot that's how it gets tight when
you do like a hood wrap or something on
a car so we're going to go ahead and
just spray-paint that black the
customers okay with that I'm going to be
using some blue painters tape which is
low adhesive tape but the wife had to go
pick that up for me while she ran to
Target so I asked her to grab that so
we'll be doing that a little bit later
as you can see I've already got one tube
kind of running right there I just want
to see how well that 45 degree lines up
with the fitting on the left side of
that as you can see it lines up perfect
so all I've got to do is a single 90
degree Bend and then just cut it to
length and that's going to be an easy
Bend right there I'm also going to be
doing just like I did for skunkworks
where I'm going to take some more of the
3m this is the 3m wrap people keep
asking me where to get this no
automotive supply eBay whatever so I'm
also going to be taking the hole punch
that I did with skunkworks so I'm going
to be putting on the fans there and
there and that's really all the rest to
do today I guess I don't know if I'm
gonna go through all the tubing because
there's a lot of funky bends I have to
happen especially down here this is
going to be weird so anyway I'm going to
kind of figure out how I'm going to do
all this but first I'm gonna go ahead
and cut out these little these little
disks here and we're going to go we're
going to go from there
okay so these are the three rings here
just made with the 3m stuff so we're
going to go ahead and just stick it on
now easy easy mods I like it and there's
what it looks like with the little
carbon fiber rings on there so I love
that mod that's such a cheap and easy
mod to do now some people have said why
you leaving that fan white oh I'm not
going to go through the trouble of
removing those fan blades just to paint
them when when the case is on it or the
covers the side panels on it covers up
pretty much all of that from the
perspective he looks at this PC you came
and see it anyway so alright there's
that I guess the next thing to do now is
start routing out our tubing which is
well the majority of this project takes
quite a while and hopefully it's going
to look good when we're done okay so I
always recommend starting with the
easiest part of the loop that you can do
and for me that's literally a straight
pipe from the radiator outlet to the
reservoir endless so I've measured it to
length and it actually measures a 10 and
3/4 inches so that's exactly what I cut
this piece of pipe down to and as you'll
see this is quite easily well the
easiest part of the installation that
you can do and well you just compression
fit it down to O rings and you're good
to go
overhangs actually slide into place ya
see as you can see straight pipe
straight across nice and clean I like ok
so another question I'm often asked is
how I know where to make my Bend so one
of the things I do is I take a wire coat
hanger or quite a few of them and then
I'll cut the straight pieces off and
then I'll bend them exactly as I need
them so for instance this this Bend
right now it's perfect for
what I need to get from the graphics
card to the backside of the radiator and
I now know this is the bend that I need
and what's most important is knowing
where the where the ends need to line up
so this is what I use as my template for
bending and then that's usually going to
lead to one maybe two attempts depending
on how good actually bend the thing so
there's a little tip for you use a metal
coat hanger and use it as a template all
right well there is the finished product
because I had my template and I knew how
I needed to bend it because of my hanger
this is now bent perfectly exactly how I
need it now how do I know where to I
mean obviously it's a lot longer than it
needs to be well now what I need to do
is actually measure and cut the ends so
that everything lines up oh yeah there
you go that's basically how you guys get
nice clean bends that line up a lot of
people ask me how the heck do you know
where to bend it well now you know all
right well there it is
and because I had such a good template I
was able to actually incorporate the
tube kind of going right through the
graphics card it actually goes in
between the block and the cables right
there and right down into the radiator
as you can see now the next tough Bend
is going to be from there to there and
all the other bends won't be so bad this
one's actually this one right here is
only going to be a single 90 degree Bend
to there to there and then that one with
that little offset it's going to be kind
of a pain in the butt but all in all
it's not too bad there's a straight tube
up there we did first but I do like the
way that this one incorporates that kind
of a you know through the graphics card
look now this one isn't exactly perfect
straight up and down it does kind of
lean a little bit but that's just going
to have to stay because as way too much
work to redo for the sake of it leaning
a couple of millimeters you might also
notice there's a slight blue tinge to
this tube this is actually the UV blue
tube it's just going to help with some
of the blue color of the coolant there's
no UV lights going in here but I just
think it's going to help a little bit to
in terms of the the color and I really
like that though but this looks really
tricked the way it kind of goes through
you know the graphics card like that you
couldn't take the graphics card without
undoing out without undoing that anyway
so it's not going to be
problems I I think it looks awesome
alright so the wife got back with the
low adhesive painters tape I'm just
going to be using some black itching
primer on here to well paint that black
and I've kind of created myself a little
bit of an over spray cup there as you
can see we're not going to be doing a
whole lot of spray in there it's just a
tiny little strip so we're going to
paint that sucker black I turned off the
fans that way nothing is blowing fumes
around and this part shouldn't take too
long this primer actually dries very
very quickly so that's the next step
because once I start putting in the
tubing then I can't do what I just did
so that's that's next all right there
she is all her tubing is installed
pretty pretty a pretty good loop I think
the only thing I don't really like too
much is right there that comes up the
graphics card and that's because that's
such a sly offset right there that it's
got like this kind of a crazy angle to
it but I can't do anything about that 45
degree fittings we're too sharp so the
tube came out way over here I just had
to do kind of a crazy bin there which I
don't really like but as you can see
compared to before it's a very very
straightforward very clean looking loop
what I really like though again is that
tube right there and how it kind of goes
in between the power cables and down to
the radiator so that one's just sort of
stealth tin there and but I think I
think I think the buyer is really going
to like it I like how streamline this
this really is okay guys so the next
thing we're going to do now is we're
going to go ahead and take our Mayhem's
x1 UV blue concentrate we're going to
mix it to my distilled water here
measured out and you guys are get to see
the color of the fluid here
so as you can see it's uh it's blue
the bed is blue yeah blue it'll look
good all right well we filling this
sucker up pretty damn soon how come it
seems like every time I'm working on
this computer geez
moocher much we just went to the gym and
worked out work out even work out bro
I work out how do you feel yellow you
like jello you don't work out there we
go guys it's not done I saw some more to
do I'm working out the lighting but as
you can see it may look slightly purple
on the camera but I promise you it's not
purple it's actually very blue right
coconut is it blue or the purple yeah
see it looks purple on camera but you
know color balance bro
anyway we're done for today you can see
all of the tubes are in there and got
some of the lighting in there but I
think it I think it turned out pretty
good I think the buyer is really going
to like this
oh and that red tube is just as you can
see where I'm felling it and stuff so
not to worry about that there we go guys
part three of project no-name whatever
projects uh overhaul I've been calling
the series water coolant overhauling
because that's all we're doing so
alright guys if you follow on Twitter
like and subscribe if you've not done
that already what if you do you
be pretty cool guy not you're still cool
all right guys get your neck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
