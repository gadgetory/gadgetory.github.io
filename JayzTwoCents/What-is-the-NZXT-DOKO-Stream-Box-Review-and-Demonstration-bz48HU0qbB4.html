two cents here and I've been trying to
reach out to NZXT for a long time well
guess what before CES they reached out
to me and asked me if I want to come by
their suite and see what they were
showing off of course I was like hell
yeah now when I went into the suite I
expected to see some suite that no pun
intended but I expected to see some
awesome new cases or maybe some new
peripherals or something along those
lines maybe a new cooler no actually
they were showing off something called
the doko the heck is a doko EVGA ACX 2.0
cooler with its three phase six slot
motor 11 swept fan blades and double
ball bearing design offers reduced power
noise and thermals for the optimum
gaming experience click the link in the
description to learn more now basically
all the doko is is an encoder or a
decoder basically as a software that you
install on any PC in the home and then
this will take that signal that's being
sent over the network wired network by
the way we'll talk about why in a second
and then decodes it into a 1080p by 30
frames per second video that you then
can play on any TV in the house and
we'll talk more about the 30 fps in a
minute I'll get to that trust me we will
talk about that but the doko then
becomes a tiny PC that has very basic
specs because it's not actually playing
the game but map master PC that has the
software is serving the signal to the
doko which then has four USB devices
hooked up to it or up to four devices so
that you can have your mouse keyboard
controller headset whatever hooked up to
this and it's as if you're sitting in
front of your main PC but at the dhoka
which can be hooked up at any TV in your
home so that essentially makes steam
in-home streaming no longer all that
important to me which is something I was
kind of starting to do a video about
because now you can stream any game on
your PC any program any video content
Netflix you can even access your Nazz
through your main PC through this and
watch videos and you could plug this in
anywhere you have a TV with an HDMI
connection or monitor with an HDMI
connection and basically have a
completely mirrored experience of what
your master PC is so basically I could
have skunkworks playing battlefield
theoretically in the living room and
play it now there is some 50 to 80
milliseconds of latency introduced in
the network so if you're playing
competitive like competitive csgo or
you're playing battlefield you take it
very serious there is gonna be some
extra latency added to the world latency
so let's say you were getting a hundred
milliseconds or 150 milliseconds of
latency on the network or excuse me on
the Internet to your game server you're
gonna add about 50 to 80 latency getting
from your master PC to the doko so you
could essentially have 200 + ping
depending on what your world latency is
so that's something to keep in mind they
did actually say they don't recommend it
for things like you know twitch game
like twitch basically a twitch game is
like FPS something that has precision
it's very important it may not be the
best but things like you know - well I
was gonna say titanfall but I guess
that's not really all that relevant
anymore let's say something like Tomb
Raider or thief or anything that's just
kind of a role-playing game like that
yeah this would be perfect for that or
you could even just be doing work in the
living room when you don't feel like
sitting at your desk you could do
anything your main PC is doing on this
that is what's so exciting about this
thing and the cool thing is you can have
the software loaded on any PC in the
house at the same time and you can just
switch between any of those pcs on the
doko and in their built-in dashboard so
really I think the best way to
demonstrate this thing is rather than
just talk about it let's go ahead and
hook this up in my living room we'll get
out of this office for once and we'll
just go ahead and do a live demo of what
it's like yeah see I'm really getting
email saying come on man where's the
doko video no I'm just kidding they're
probably not anyway let's go ahead and
hook this thing up so let's go and roll
that transition cue the minion guy
now setting this thing up is extremely
easy it only took a few seconds to
install once you start them the the what
they call the sender then it
automatically gets picked up by the doko
once you turn on the doko and it's
automatically showing the desktop if you
don't set up a password if you set up a
password on your client or your main
machine then you need to put in a
password to actually log into the doko
now I didn't do that because I'm the
only ones gonna be using this thing but
I am using wired peripherals on here
because I don't actually own any
wireless stuff this is my CM storm
Reaper Mouse which are actually bringing
back and I just received today in the
mail the brand-new Asus Strix tactical
keyboard so consider this the start of
my review for this thing and yeah we'll
be doing a review for that and this is
we starting the testing for this now I
am using the mouse on a wooden surface
here and it's not the greatest for the
optical or the laser mouse but you know
I'm too lazy to go get my mousepad now
so let's go ahead and as you can see
we've got my desktop working right here
I could go to say the Internet we could
go to some J's to sense let's see how
this works I got you here playing in the
in the office - I mean that's pretty
neat alright so as you can see this this
would be perfect for like netflix and
stuff productivity if you want to maybe
some programming in here maybe some
spreadsheets business and you just want
to do it from the comfort of your own
living room let's go ahead and see what
else we can do here let's go ahead and
load up some steam and let's see what
we've got here I was playing to evolve
beta yesterday that was a lot of fun
actually looks like it might still be
going but let's do something on here
maybe that let's do some BioShock
Infinite just for the heck of it to see
how that works because it is a shooter
game but it's a stole oh shoot or game I
I can feel some slight network lag but
not a lot so I wouldn't really go
playing like competitive csgo but I
would play battlefield
this as an engineer or something with
some vehicles so as you can see it load
it right up flawlessly it's very sharp
now as I mentioned in the beginning part
this is 30fps but what I want to point
out is this is a consistent 30 FPS 30
frames per second when you're watching
this a TV or a movie which is either 24
P for cinematic like in the movie
theaters it's 24 P at least if you're
NTSC and not pal pal the European
standard it's actually a little
different but you don't sit there and
say wow this movie's framerate is
terrible do you know because the frame
rates are being consistently delivered
and that's what you're getting here
we'll do a continuation I have no idea
where we're gonna continue I mean I
played this game when it first launched
and then that's kind of where I left it
or when I beat it I never came back to
it alright woah hey Elizabeth
uh yeah some slight delay but I mean
it's still doable oh yeah that's right
so I don't know where else we'll be
doing here
it's been too long of a shoot you in the
face yeah shut up shut up yeah I mean I
don't know how else to say it okay that
I mean that the grin I just walked
around the room for a few seconds there
let's try something else let's try say
how about some Tomb Raider check out
some Tomb Raider where is it there it is
let's watch dogs there Tomb Raider let's
do that alright I mean it's failed to
initialize direct3d with current
settings whatever it still went yeah I
don't know how else to put it this is
like gaming on a pretty decent computer
in your living room and it's all
handling through the network on a $99
device hooked up to a TV if you already
have the computer I understand why you
wouldn't want this thing I know I love
this sort of stuff that's in-home
streaming stuff this is really cool in
fact this little box if you've already
got a powerful PC really kind of makes
the home theater PC I guess a little bit
obsolete really I mean why would you
want to build out multiple pcs and have
to handle updates and everything I'm a
bunch of them
let's see so I was in a tomb last time I
was here I have oops that's right middle
mouse button is how you do that right
oh whoa yeah I'm not having any problems
controlling I just suck it's really the
only way to put it
I'm not gonna sit here and turn this
into a let's watch J play video but I
just wanted to try this out and I think
this fits the bill perfectly for what I
was looking for I've been actually
considering doing it in home theater PC
or home theater PC for a long time and
I've talked about that several times
actually on the channel and I didn't
know exactly how I wanted to handle it
but not since skunkworks is so strong
the wife's PC is so strong heck even
Little J could access her PC in here if
she was you know doing uh maybe she was
she likes to watch some of her kids
learning programs or she has some
learning games she could do it right
here without being in her bedroom so wow
this is I mean for 99 bucks I don't know
how I could go wrong alright so let's go
ahead and do some Netflix shall we now I
can't like sit here and play a lot of
the songs and stuff but I don't know
because I don't want to get flagged
let's say okay Breaking Bad don't watch
some Breaking Bad yeah really
I literally just loaded up the episode
where they're getting it on ok well it's
really dark so let's go skip forward
yeah so there you go freaky bad is now
playing cut that off before I get in
trouble 99 bucks for this thing oh I'm
totally geeking out over this I know
thank you NZXT for sending me this this
is what I got to look at at CES expected
some cases or some some peripherals of
some sort maybe a cooler and this is
what we got and I'm actually really
happy about this I mean that for USP
devices you can plug into this you can
actually play games in here with
multiple people you can have friends
over place team games that are
multiplayer and we were playing at the
CES suite we were actually playing gang
beasts which was it's a game where you
feel like these little cartoon guys and
you beat each other up and try and throw
each other out of the ring
that's actually a lot of fun if I can
want to buy that game now so there you
go guys the NZXT dokgo $99 in-home
streaming device that can handle
multiple pcs at the same time and you
don't have to buy another home theater
PC to get a PC in the living room and
the wife was actually really really
excited about this and so am i the only
thing I need to do is get some you know
wireless stuff hooked up to that which
brings me to the razor turret I really
want the razor turret still a couple of
months away from that review alright
guys there you go Jase two cents take a
look at the NZXT dokgo giving you a
little sample of what it's like I think
it's amazing for 99 bucks I mean the
gaming experience yeah it's not like
sitting at your main PC there's a little
bit of network lag and the graphics of
course are compressed a little bit 1080p
compressed but for 99 bucks what do you
expect
I wouldn't go playing Battlefield on it
but you could play a lot of the games
that you don't need ultimate precision
on and still have home theater PC access
can access your nas watch media content
do work homework all from the comfort of
your living room without having to buy a
new PC tell me what you guys think down
in the comments as always guys follow on
Twitter if you've any questions Facebook
all that fun stuff and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
