watching J's two cents and if you can't
tell by the title of this video this is
way way overdue but I wanted to make
sure I brought it to you right and this
is going to be my Intel overclocking
guide and this is a live commentary so
you may hear some dogs barking you may
hear some helicopters flying you might
hear some fans going it's really really
hot where I live in fact today it was
over a hundred and eight degrees and
it's not even July yet but whatever I
digress this what you're looking at
right here this is my desktop and this
awesome right here this isn't for me
this is for you guys because of all the
support that you've given me through
this entire YouTube venture I just
wanted to go ahead and let you guys know
that you are awesome and for that very
reason is why I'm doing the giveaway in
my previous video the infomercial I did
or tilt I'm linking it right here
shameless plug go and check it out enter
to win one of those amazing powerplant
battery packs for your mobile device you
know you want to win it so go check it
out right now pause the video go over
there watch it it's only two minutes
long and you could be winning yourself a
$90 battery pack to keep all of your
mobile devices charged so with that out
of the way first of all this is do it at
your own risk
there are no guarantees when it comes to
overclocking there is no guarantees you
won't fry it there's no guarantees your
chip will even overclock overclocking is
100% luck of the draw
you may get a good chip you may get a
bad chip you may get a mediocre chip but
whatever you can just keep your fingers
crossed and hope that you get at least a
few hundred extra megahertz and if
you're lucky with AMD or excuse me
with Intel you may get a gigahertz or
more so keep your fingers crossed and
let's go ahead and talk about some
programs that you're going to need when
it comes to stability testing because
simply getting your computer to boot
with your overclock is not good enough
you have to make sure it's stable
especially for the different tasks that
you perform so starting from these
programs right here in this square oh
and by the way when it comes to
recording my desktop because
no you guys are going to be asking I am
using the Elgato Game Capture HD it is a
HDMI capture device I just have it
capturing my monitor and we're recording
it on the laptop including my microphone
my blue Yeti there we go
starting left to right you've got OCC T
this is a stability program as you can
see over here it's loading it a bunch of
guys hammering on their computers
because I guess metaphorically that's
kind of what you're doing when you
overclock so it's got some warnings here
it's telling you it's not for commercial
use blah blah blah a lot of information
about your system is displayed right
here you've got a moving graph here when
it comes to your core temperatures
voltages frequencies usage you have all
the setup right here when it comes to
your stability testing we're not going
to go into depth on how to use these
programs I'm just showing you the
programs that I use when it comes to
mice ability testing next on the list
here we have intel burn test this is
burn test right here it's just a little
bitty program and it's got this little
flame right here which initially when I
first saw this it was kind of scary I'm
like wait a minute it says freeze test
and it's a it's a flame it's fire that's
scary but what it is is when you hit
start here and it starts running its
algorithm and testing your CPU it's got
this little moving image so that you can
tell if you have a system lock up so I
know it's freeze test but it's fire it's
almost kind of like an oxymoron almost
like a little joke but anyway we're
going to stop that right now is where
I'm going to do a stability testing
we've got Cinebench is what we use here
for benchmarking once you have a stable
overclock and you want to benchmark it
to compare between your other overclocks
you can download Cinebench it is free
and you have a 32-bit and a 64-bit
version this is what it looks like
disclaimer of course and the basically
just when you turn on the CPU for a
rendering test it just renders out this
image with however many cores that you
have and we're not going to let that run
because that's not what we're doing
right now when it comes to Hardware
monitoring I've got two programs
Hardware monitor and cpuid Hardware
monitors shows you everything going on
with your system I've showed you this
program in AMD video if you expand this
here it shows you a lot
shows you what motherboards you're using
right here it shows you the voltages now
you're going to want to kind of
nor were these voltages for the most
part I mean they're software monitoring
of voltages I mean it's mediocre at best
it's usually very very off from where
the voltage meter shows so ignore the
voltages here you've got some of your
different temperatures here you've got
fan speeds mine tends to freak out as
you can see it thinks that my fans are
running like you know jet turbine speeds
sixty five thousand rpms I just know
it's because I have some fans jumper
together and and weird things like that
happen so just kind of ignore that but
you got your core temperatures here
including your package temperature so if
you want to understand for instance my
3770k has 4 cores cores 0 through 3 and
right now they are currently running in
the 30s and you've got here your value
which is current your minimum recorded
in your maximum recorded and then
packages the entire socket what all of
those core is including the socket make
up when it comes to the die you've got
your powers here which is right now
showing that I'm using about 23 watts at
idle this number does jump around again
when it comes to your power consumption
it's software monitoring it's mediocre
at best and then it's going to show you
you know all the other temperatures for
hard drives graphics cards and whatnot
and look my graphics cards running at 29
degrees that's it's nice my phone just
fell over fail alright so there you go
this is what I use when it comes to
monitoring and last but not least to
verify your overclock you use cpuid this
brings up here just a little bit of
information as you can currently see I
am running a 3770k 1.26 5 volts and I am
running at 4.7 gigahertz right now
through a multiplier overclock and then
you can click memory here to see what's
happening with the memory you can see I
am using DDR which is double density Ram
at a thousand megahertz times 2 because
it's double density running at 2000
megahertz on the RAM right now at 1011
1030 plots so there you have it guys so
where you're going to go ahead and do
right now is we're going to go ahead and
we're going to reboot my machine ok so
now we're back in BIOS and as you can
see here everything is in default we're
going to ignore this NIC sits
sis overclocked profile because he does
have profiles as he's that he's added
onto here but we're going to go ahead
and do right now is we're going to turn
on OC tweaking you may or may not need
to turn that on on your board most
boards especially the ROG boards and
other Asus boards they have a you know
over manual overclocking you have to
turn that on are on so you're going to
have to consult the manual for your
motherboard but when it comes to
overclocking the CPU there's a couple of
things that you're going to have to
disable right off the bat so for Intel
you're going to disable the sped
spread-spectrum which it says right
there in the right in this area right
here to suggest that to disable when
you're overclocking so we'll go ahead
and do that stable it multi-core
acceleration you want to keep that on
obviously
intel speedstep technology you're going
to leave that on and the Intel turbo
boost technology you can go ahead and
leave that on additional turbo voltage
what that means is when you're
overclocking and the turbo mode engages
you know where the multiplier changes
it'll add more voltage we're going to
leave that as it is an internal PLL over
voltage that is going to be enabled that
you're going to enable that if you're
starting to push about 4.6 or higher so
unless you're going for point six or
higher just basically leave that where
it is all this other stuff when it comes
to short duration power limit power
primary plane and all that stuff leave
that on auto that's very advanced stuff
and most importantly to when it comes to
your RAM
I do have 1866 RAM in here but we are
going to leave this we're going to set
this static what I mean by static is
we're telling it what to put in there
not letting it use an auto feature at
1333 because you want to make sure that
when you're checking for overclock
stability that you're leaving the RAM
out of the equation because last thing
you want to do is be messing around with
your CPU settings for days or in my case
what the AMD is you guys may have known
months trying to find a stable overclock
when it turns out all along it was just
your RAM that was overclocked too far so
we're going to go ahead and leave that
at 1333 which is just the default memory
controller inside the chip so we'll
leave it there to nice nice save setting
we're going to go ahead and power saving
mode disabled that's good extreme
voltage we'll go ahead an able that and
we're going to go down here to a lone
light lined load calibration I'll leave
mine at one that way it doesn't really
reduce the voltage at all during load
because I have a really adequate PSU or
power supply unit very very good one
it's a gold rated is an Corsair ax 750
but of course you need to make sure you
have the hardware to support your
overclock so you need to have a nice
powerful efficient and very stable power
supply unit don't just go by the Watts
rating there's a lot more to power
supplies than just the Watts rating it's
also the efficiency the the efficiency
of the rail whether or not it's a single
rail dual rail quad rail 12 volt all
that stuff matters because if you have
dirty energy getting into your CPU where
the frequency and the power coming in is
fluctuating all over the place you can
accidentally damage something so anyway
internal GPU load line calibration we
don't use internal GPU will leave that
off and when it comes to the voltage
here I like to use a fixed mode and I
like to start out at right about 1.2
volts there we go so that's where we're
going to start it we're going to leave
things right here at the default 35
multiplier where do we go in here how
embarrassing I have lost my old
multiplier okay there we go host CPU
ratio all cores and then stock is 35
because the way this works with Intel is
the base clock is at 100 times whatever
the multiplier is gets you your
frequency so base clocks 100 set that
I'll core 235
so we're basically static here we've
told the computer use these settings in
ignore Auto so we're going to go ahead
and reboot that into Windows we are
going to perform our first stability
test with Intel burn test and I will
show you guys that as we're going to go
ahead and cut a chat here for a second
as the Windows boots up should only take
about 10 or 12 seconds or so and I like
to use Intel burn tests
when it comes to the initial testing of
the overclock and then or even the just
the base clock and what I'd like to do
with that is just leave it on standard
because it only takes about ten minutes
to do its test open it up and then hit
start let that go it'll have you know
it'll it'll run the test ten times as
you can see right here and then once you
know you're stable or it completes the
test stop reboot into BIOS and we're
just going to pretend we finish that
test because we know it's going to work
at the base clock go back into BIOS and
then we are going to bump up that
multiplier just a little bit okay so
here we are we are back in the BIOS now
we are going to go ahead and immediately
let's just go ahead and jump right up -
lets go multipe multiplier of 42 and the
reason why I say multiplier 42 is
because it's most 3770 and 35 70 KS even
your 2500 s in your 2600 KS are more
than capable of running a 42 multiplayer
without very much
tweaking needed whatsoever so once you
do that you can just f10 save and then
reboot into Windows now it's really
important I can't stress this enough you
have to have adequate cooling you can't
just plop on the stock cooler and expect
to get massive overclock so you can only
get it with the stock cooler I wouldn't
recommend you try an overclock at all
and even with a decent air cooler like a
hyper 212 or even a v6 or v8 or even one
of the Noctua coolers
I don't recommend that you push your
overclock too far because you know air
cooling is entirely dependent on the
ambient temperature and that's why I
water cool because I like to overclock
as far as I possibly can so now that
we've rebooted with our new multiplier
you come to cpuid and there it is right
there
4200 megahertz so you can go ahead and
run your Cinebench if you want to go
ahead and test that and see how it does
and just for the heck of it we'll go
ahead and run Cinebench right now this
is assuming that you've gone ahead done
your stability test for the sake of the
video we're not going to do a stability
test every single time we're just going
to kind of assume that
you guys have done it make sure every
time you change the setting you go back
and you do your stability test and once
you get to an overclock that you feel is
your maximum stable overclock you then
can run OCC tea or even prime95 that's
another program that I use for Intel at
least I said I don't like it for AMD but
for Intel it's perfectly fine run your
prime95 for at least a few hours a lot
of people recommend 24 hours I find that
to be extreme overkill usually on
prime95
if you're going to run into any problems
it'll happen in the first hour or two
so I ran mine the other day for four
hours just for good measure perfectly
stable and as you guys saw with my
livestream the other day absolutely no
problems whatsoever but this this
lighter color orange right here this is
the test we just performed and you can
actually see that compared to my four
point seven test right here nine point
five six versus an eight point five four
it's a whole point difference just with
a few hundred megahertz so yeah let's go
ahead and save that school or sure why
not so let's go ahead and restart into
BIOS and let's go and talk a little bit
about voltages and RAM and then that's
pretty much it guys intel has really
made overclocking extremely easy it is
literally nothing more than making sure
you have adequate cooling good Ram a
good power supply unit and changing a
multiplier even if you change the base
clock to 101 at least with my chip if I
change this base clock to 101 one
megahertz faster my computer won't boot
so you know it's it is what it is and my
overclock that I use my 24/7 stable
overclock is this four point seven right
here I do have a four point eight stable
it's just a little bit harder than I'd
like because what you're going to notice
as you start to bump up the overclock
and go ahead and ignore these other you
know these other numbers you see right
here this is advanced stuff here when it
comes to the delivery of the power but
at 2,000 megahertz on my ram and a forty
seven multiplier right here as you can
see right there forty seven multiplier
I am running at 1.26 where'd you go
1.27 bolts so as you can see I didn't
need much more voltage at all to get up
to 4.7 but now let's take a look at the
overclock that I needed for for 4.8 so
check this out I just loaded my 4.8
profile and if you look at the voltage
look at that one point two nine and one
point I mean we're talking 100 megahertz
and I had to add a whole point zero two
volt so now you can understand what the
way it works with Intel the voltages
once you get to about one point two six
one point two seven and up start to get
much much hotter exponentially I mean if
I if I was to take this right now
and I was to demonstrate even with my
water cooling at one point two nine I'm
going to reach about 74 273 degrees
Celsius on the course but at one point
three it starts to bump up into the high
70s and at one point three one I start
to see low 80s at one point three five
and up I start to see 90s and at one
point four which is what it took for me
to get five gigahertz on this chip I
started to see 100 degrees Celsius on
the core so I immediately stopped it
when I saw those temps but what does
that tell me
it doesn't tell me that my cooling
system is inadequate because the heat
coming out of my radiators was not even
warm whereas my AMD's just feel like a
furnace it tells me that my chip suffers
from the bad thermal paste that was used
on Ivybridge
and unfortunately is plaguing a lot of
Haswell chips as well so guys that is
really it once you get onto a ratio that
your CPU likes at a voltage that is nice
and comfortable and you get it stable
then what you do is you leave your CPU
multiplier where it's at and then you
take your your voltages here and you run
your stability test and you get okay I'm
stable so then you would load back into
BIOS you reduce the voltage one notch
and you just keep performing that test
reducing voltage reducing
voltage every single time you run that
Intel burn test once your Intel burn
test fails bump it back up a notch and
then you run your test again if it's
stable run it again if it doesn't crash
for a second time then you run your
prime95 your OC CT for at least a couple
of hours if it fails then you got to
bump the voltage up another notch and
redo repeat your long tests that's
really all it comes down to when it
comes to Intel there is one other
setting that you can try here for
stability it's the CPU PLL voltage as
you can see the voltage showing here on
the left this is current it's not going
to match what's on the right because I
loaded a profile what I haven't rebooted
yet you can bump this up to one point
eight one five it's actually one point
eight one three I guess you can bump it
up to that voltage for a little bit of
added stability that's where I've found
that I've got the max stability right
now is at that particular voltage once
your CPU is nice and stable then you
start bumping up your RAM frequency one
notch at a time and right now I found
that to thousands perfect at 2133 my CPU
fails to boot but as you bump up your
ram voltage or excuse me your ram
frequency you're also going to have to
come to your DRAM voltage and pump that
up as well so as you can see stock
voltage for my ram is 1.5 volts and the
value that i run it out from my
overclock is 1.5 v i'm pretty lucky that
it didn't need a whole point 1 volt to
overclock sometimes the ram you have to
bump up a decent amount as well to get
an overclock fortunately I don't have to
do that so we're good I am going to
reboot with these settings here and
we're gonna go ahead and run this in a
bench and I'm going to show you one
other neat utility that you can use when
it comes to overclocking the RAM and
checking for RAM speed increase and how
well overall your ram is performing so
anyway if you're wondering why my
Windows boots so fast it is because I
want to solve the state drive obviously
this is that right here max min so we'll
go ahead move maximum over here we'll go
ahead and start Cinebench all right so
it's going to load cinnamon 6 64 bit
let's go ahead and run this in real time
that's the cool thing about using a
capture card like this is I can actually
run these benchmarks in real time for
you guys and you guys can see them you
can also see when I'm doing this video
and what time it is look it's 10 o'clock
at night the families in Beijing we have
to be quiet I don't want to wake up my
four year old because if I do oh my god
if I you know the nickname for my
daughter for a while there was Megatron
we used to call him Megatron because she
was just ah anyway this test is running
nice and fast eight threads running here
four cores eight threads got to love the
hyper threading and it's just about done
yep this is a benchmark of my four point
seven overclock and look at that the
bright orange nine point seven nine that
other test that you saw where it was a
nine point five six it didn't save it
that's weird I got this boost because
that nine point five six was at 1866 Ram
that was with my old Ram my Patriot Ram
that would not overclock beyond the XMP
profile of 1866 no matter what I did
however I am running Corsair Vengeance
in here now and this is the first time I
ran this test with my overclock at nine
point seven nine at 2000 megahertz on
the RAM so as you can see Ram plays a
big part in the overclock as well so
there you have it this was the first
overclock we did together and here we
are right now after the fine tuning and
playing around with it and as I promised
here we'll go ahead and take a look at
maximum and what that does is it just
takes your memory and once it's fully
loaded up you click start benchmark and
what it's doing now is it's testing all
of the latency it's sending information
to your RAM having a process and it will
benchmark the transfer speed of your RAM
and this vengeance Ram if you follow me
on Twitter I talked about I will always
use this stuff look at this memory copy
twenty seven thousand eight megabytes
per second memory read twenty four
thousand eight hundred seven megabytes
per second memory write twenty-three
thousand 80 megabytes per second at a
forty eight point five nanosecond
latency
that is fast people extremely fast my
Patriot Ram was only nineteen thousand
there you have it guys
overclocking the Intel 3770k the same
process applies to 2500 K at Sandy
Bridge in up Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge has
well because of the fact that they all
use the same type of overclocking and
multiplier because you're not having to
be able to North bridge or north side
bus here we are four point eight I
loaded the four point eight profile and
we are stable so I'll probably bump it
back down to the four point seven real
quick before I hop off here why don't we
go ahead and just run so you guys can
see in real time what the temperatures
look like and why it is so important to
have proper cooling for your overclock I
cannot stress this enough so on the Left
right here we've got my and we're going
to just reduce this you can see the core
temps only how's that all right here is
core temperatures with a package okay as
you can see right now we're sitting in
30s minimum was low 30s with a high of
13 over there and then in the 40s and
forty seven max so far but watch one I
turn this to let's say maximum or
maximum stress it's going to use all the
RAM available to it and once I hit start
on this look what happens to these
temperatures keep an eye on this boom
it's going to start to climb and climb
and I mean I've got pretty good cooling
on here as you can see we're just
sitting at about sixty but the longer
you let this go especially with water
cooling the water temperature starts to
warm up and you know it's going to start
to rise and over time I'll probably see
this 4.8 overclocks it's somewhere in
the 88 degrees range so there you have
it guys I know this was a long video I
know it's probably really boring and I
know it's long overdue
just put down in the comments if you're
having some trouble with your overclocks
put it down in your comments what your
settings are
and what problems you're getting you're
going to get lot it when you're testing
this stuff you're going to get lock ups
you're going to get blue screens you're
going to get all sorts of stuff
that's going to freak you out and you're
also going to notice that when you start
to bump up your voltage and you hit that
save and exit button from your BIOS
sometimes your computer is going to shut
off and I know when I first started
overclocking that really freaked me out
and real quick as you can see the
temperatures look a high they're jumping
up now see this so cooling very
important people so your computer may
shut off on you that's just the voltage
regulators resetting because they can
only adjust so much with the current
being sent to them so they'll shut off
readjust to whatever voltages are you
set and then the computer will reboot so
it's very hard to actually break
something with your CPU when it comes to
overclock if it's too much it just
simply won't boot most of the time there
you go guys jst sense make sure you
