we're going to talk about a piece of
your computer that often gets overlooked
and quite often I hear people say yeah
you just get a cheap one that's not
gonna really matter well in this case it
actually can today we're gonna talk
about case fans and radiator fans and
how much of an improvement they really
can make in your system with its
aluminum bezel solid construction and
adjustable base the vast 35 inch ultra
wide 100 Hertz VA panel for mass drop
offers performance at an affordable
price learn more about this drop by
following the link in the description
below so what we're looking at right
here is my in windy frame build that I
did last year well getting the year
before I think technically whatever
doesn't really matter this was my
personal computer until I ended up
bringing skunkworks back home so it's
got two Titan XP or little piece so it's
the biggest Titan of the ten series that
was made it's in a parallel loop a
single loop with dual rad so to 360 rads
by ek we've got our singularity computer
computers reservoir we've got our single
block right here for the CPU and vrm so
it's a mono block for our rampage
motherboard and it's got a 70 900 ex in
there so it's not a crazy system in
terms of like core count and all that
but it's certainly no slouch either it
definitely gets the job done with 20
cores
well 10 cores 20 threads whatever but
the issue with this is although this is
a very tubular like cubular type of
frame here it's very open there's no
fans on top it's not sealed off in any
way if you look at the temperatures
right here we have had heaven running
now for about 45 minutes and you can see
the temperatures are at 54 and 55 it
will bounce between 54 and 58 degrees
right now depending on the scene and the
crazy thing about this is you may know
heaven does not stress the system nearly
as much as games can so what I saw when
I was gaming on this is that my
temperatures would reach the low 60s in
playing things like battlefield 5 and
stuff entirely too hot for a
water-cooled system especially one that
it's got an open chassis like this that
should not be impeding air flow in any
way the top right here is if I had to
make a guess I'd say this is probably
about 45 maybe even 50 C like it's
extremely hot to come out of here when
you touch the metal the metals heat
soaked
it's heat soaking in something that is
not sealed which is a problem so the
polaris fans that I'm using on here
they're in when Daisy chainable fans
that are 12 volt RGB so not addressable
they're just a standard 12 volt RGB
that's hooked up to the asus motherboard
being controlled by the AI suite now
they're running a hundred percent right
now so these temperatures that you're
seeing the 54 and 55 c is with the fans
on the bottom bringing cool air in
there's plenty of gap down here for it
to get air from underneath the chassis
it's bringing cool air in and up through
the top and this is also bringing cool
air from the front like that so the
airflow is kind of like this and the
idea was if we've got all these fans
pushing in it will give us positive
pressure to push the air out the problem
is you cannot feel any air flow in here
the polaris fans although greatest case
fans and daisy chain able making it easy
to have one wire able to connect like
six fans and i think it's eight actually
i don't that doesn't really matter the
point is they're not good with static
pressure and overcoming the resistance
of the radiator fins so what we're
getting now is the air is just kind of
coming through the radiator very slow
and stale and what we're getting now is
a convection effect so what we're
dealing with right now is this is heat
soaking to the point to where it finally
gets hot enough to where the air rises
and pushes itself out but it doesn't do
it nearly efficiently enough and what's
happening is the radiators cannot get
enough air flow through them meaning
that we're getting this heat soak
problem in fact my cpu right now is even
sitting at 57 C with heav'n running no
that's not super hot but again it's
water cooled and it's not even that big
of an overclock it's like 4.2 gigahertz
because anything higher and it was
starting to get way too hot now no I
have not lapped the CPU and I have not
done a deal it on the CPU which would
probably benefit it quite a bit but how
hot the GPUs are getting to are telling
me that we clearly are having a cooling
inefficiency so what we're gonna do
today is we're gonna try a couple of
things one I just want a sort of proof
of concept that if I can get this hot
air out of this case that it will help
the overall cooling makes sense right if
the hot air is trapped in here that's
causing a heat soak it means the
radiators aren't efficient at this point
then the hot air that's just sitting in
here soaking everything is causing the
temperatures as a whole to rise so I'm
gonna start by taking a 140 millimeter
fan this is one of the the new fractal
Prisma fans I'm just gonna set it on top
right here plugging the
to the motherboard to let this assist
with the exhausting of air to where this
fan is pulling a good chunk of the hot
air out rather than forcing the positive
pressure coming through the rads to do
the job with a convection assistant or a
natural convection assistant shut up
shut up ah well the whole ring turns
there we go
that'll do it
now what we're looking for here before I
go through all the work is to see if
this is gonna drop the temperatures at
all because if it doesn't well then I
don't know at that point it's at 50 51
right now so after only being like 60
seconds in front of it it's dropped like
three degrees up 49 15 all right so
proof of concepts working more air means
cooler who would have thought so we're
bouncing around between 48 and 50 right
now yeah so this is actually a good
proof of concept because you turn this
off this fan is not actually pushing air
through the radiator it's just lowering
the temperature as a whole inside
because the fans are still kind of
working as resistance so the air is
still all gonna be able to go through
the radiator as fast as the fan can push
it so this was probably speeding up
those blades a little bit and we saw a
good 5 C reduction maybe even a little
bit more than that so we're gonna go
ahead and push forward now with changing
out those front fans possibly the bottom
ones as well and seeing if we can't get
these temperatures down I'd be fine with
anything in the mid 40s but Pascal
sitting in the mid 50s on water that's
way too hot that means something isn't
right
what's a forties high forties is better
than mid to high 50s which is what we
were seeing and like I said in a bedroom
environment that's was hitting the 60s
so all I did was I changed out the in
wind fans for the ek VAR DARS in RGB now
yes I'm well the way that they're louder
as you can hear yes I'm well aware the
different blade design and that they're
spinning faster obviously that's the
point of this video is to show that by
adding more rpm and more static pressure
and more flow through these radiators
our temperatures greatly increased what
the efficiency of the radiators
increased the temperature decrease which
is kind of what we were looking for here
the polaris fans are not good radiator
fans and and when Amy told me that but
they were pretty and I was like they're
daisy-chained and it's fine I've told
people before you could go with more
radiator surface area in this case to
360 rads and just go with some slower
fans and you'll be fine but the problem
in this particular use case is the fact
that what I said is partly true you can
use cheaper fans fans that are not going
to be you know 20 30 bucks apiece and
just use more radiators and get the same
benefit of cooling without the noise and
all that stuff as long as your chassis
has fans that are exhibit assisting with
the exhaust the problem is the radiator
fans who are responsible for not only
pushing air through the radiator but
also the only air flow in this chassis
whatsoever so it was just too much for
the players to overcome the resistance
of the radiator fins as well as having
to deal with the exhausting of air with
even the assistant the assisted
effective convection with heat rising it
just isn't enough cuz he doesn't rise
until it gets hot and then obviously
well he just hot right so the air
doesn't rise until gets hot enough for
convection to become a thing which at
that point it's already too hot for the
components also too if you're if you're
commenting like well you sure to use the
different fan with the steam specs to
test know that that's not what we're
testing we're testing if we can if we
had the same CFM as we had before we
would have the same problem so that
would have done nothing so in this case
because of in this case get it so in
this case our sacrifice has to be noise
to overcome the amount of airflow and
stuff so if the radiator was up top
however
and this air was coming in to the front
and then just going out the top like a
case would be like a normal you know
rectangular case then the Polaris would
have probably performed a whole lot
better than what this radio drew on the
bottom the problem is all the heat
coming off this radiator both of them
actually is pushing into the chassis
which is causing some of that heat so by
flipping a rat up here where to fix that
problem not possible in this particular
chassis so as you can see with the test
still running we're sitting at 47 and 49
respectively
so heck of a lot cooler than it was
before at the sacrifice a little bit of
noise so the whole point of this video
was just to show you that there there is
a point of where the fans in the speed
and all that does matter even with the
amount of radiators because if I had had
another radiator on top let's say had
one in the front one of the bottom one
on the top it would be the same issue in
fact it could have potentially even been
a little bit worse only because if we
were still using Polaris fans on a top
Brad with on the front and on the bottom
it still wanted to be moving enough air
we'd have added a little bit more of a
choke point in my opinion and then this
would it ended up becoming just as heat
soaked and the temperatures would have
risen just the same it just might have
taken a little longer to get there so
there you go at the case you guys
haven't seen in a while and a build that
I'm very fond of and I don't want to
take apart but it's got some damn good
pieces in here that I could use in other
bills it's got an M about to drive it's
got the rampage motherboard on X 299 and
of course we've got the two 360 rads and
the class 2 Titan X bees
it's like wouldn't be funny if I took
these all out just to build another
build which means I could've just left
for this one together all along
yeah whatever I digress you know give it
to my 9 year old sorry guys I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
