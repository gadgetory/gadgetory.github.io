I'm going to talk about a topic that
it's just gonna be mostly a talking head
and so if you guys don't really want to
look at this ugly mug unfortunately it's
the only face I have I don't worship the
many-faced God therefore I can't change
my face so shout out to all my Game of
Thrones fans out there last night's
episode oh yeah but I want to talk to
some of the beginner builders about
things that are branded as gaming and
whether or not that really makes them
better for you I get a lot of this in my
inbox and even the comments on my recent
gigabyte gtx 1080
g1 gaming video a lot of people were
like really a gaming 1080 show me the
one that's not meant for gaming would ya
yeah I kind of felt the same way guys so
we're gonna talk about that today the
new z170 classified motherboard from
EVGA features 8 phase PWM 4 Way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want a badass motherboard with
no compromises click the link below to
learn more now over the last couple of
generations of graphics cards we have
seen a little bit of a trend going here
for instance as I already mentioned GT X
1080 g1 gaming well does that mean they
have a g1 that's not a gaming MSI GTX
1080 gaming X and they even have a
gaming Z does that mean that that one's
better for gaming or does it mean it's
better than this one here the EVGA GTX
1080 super clocks it super clocks to the
super clocks I did it again
it doesn't say gaming so clearly those
are better than this one right quite
honestly guys you can just sort of
ignore the name when it comes to
graphics cards now gaming motherboards
aren't quite so black-and-white when it
comes to whether or not they're truly
built for gamers this is something you
really got to determine for yourself for
instance gaming motherboards tend to be
right in the middle ground they're
higher than the basic entry-level stuff
but they're not as high as the
workstation motherboards now gaming
motherboards tend to think have things
like killer Nick's in them which are
supposed to prioritize gaming traffic
giving priority for you know gaming
packets to reduce your gaming lag and
stuff like that I don't know whether or
not those truly work I've never actually
tested that to see if it really makes
any sort of a difference but they also
seem to have a little bit better sound
cards built onto
and usually they'll have some sort of a
amplified headphone jack so if you use
high impedance headphones then you're
going to be able to run them off of your
motherboard without the need of a deck a
lot of people who care about sound are
not going to run on board audio they're
going to run some sort of an external
amp and DAC or they're going to have an
amp like a full-size amplifier or
something network cards or network cards
as far as I'm concerned so I don't know
if the prioritization of packets really
makes any sort of a difference but
pretty much all motherboards these days
are going to have at least a Gigabit
Ethernet built in on skunkworks I just
use the built in Intel Ethernet and I
don't have any issues regarding lag and
stuff when it comes to games it's not
even branded as gaming when it comes to
the network it's just a basic you know
one Gigabit Ethernet built into the
gigabyte board now workstation
motherboards tend to have the best
quality of components on them things
like the best quality capacitors best
quality chokes best PCB layout they're
thicker they're more durable they're
going to tend to have better heat sinks
on them more power phases what designed
to make them extremely durable and very
robust because they're meant to deal
with very heavy workloads from people
who work in professional environments
things like very high-end video editing
and stuff like that typically they're
functions that gamers wouldn't use they
would have you know 10 or more SATA
ports on their SATA Express tons of em
2's things that you're just not going to
need sometimes you know eight or nine
PCI Express slots because they're meant
to have enough room for expansion cards
and raid cards and things that you just
aren't going to need but when it comes
to graphics cards don't seeing the word
gaming put in the title it really is
something that's just considered bit of
marketing to try and get your attention
to go hey I'm building a gaming computer
so I want the stuff that says gaming
yeah gtx 1080 is a gtx 1080 and custom
boards tend to you know they really do
perform within 1 or 2 percent of each
other at the most typically this 1 or 2
FPS difference which is less than 1 or 2
percent when it comes to how they
perform compared to each other and just
because they say gaming on there doesn't
mean they're more suited for gaming
really the only features are going to
find that are different between
different graphics cards are going to be
things like RGB or how many fans are on
there or how much RGB control do you
have does the LEDs breathe especially
this year it's kind of like special
Compu textures like the year of RGB RGB
all the things and then you slap the
word gaming on it and it must make it a
better product but unfortunately that's
just not true the only thing you really
need to concern yourself with what
building a gaming computer is the
quality of graphics card that you're
putting in there the graphics card is
going to be the number one most
influential part in your system that's
going to determine how good of a gaming
experience you have and if you could put
gaming RAM and gaming motherboard and
the top-of-the-line CPU you've ever had
and heck even gaming branded SSDs but
put in a substandard graphics card
you're going to have a substandard
gaming experience is as simple as that
it's unfortunate to see so many things
marketed now as gaming but anyway I hope
this videos helped some new buyers and
new shoppers understand that there's
more to look for than just whether or
not something is branded as gaming check
out all the reviews for the products
that it is that you're interested in and
even take things like Newegg reviews and
and Amazon reviews into account and if a
lot of people are saying something is
garbage then it probably is now the last
thing I want to talk about here is can a
gaming computer also be a workstation
absolutely skunk works right here has an
overclocking motherboard in there not
any sort of a workstation motherboard
I've got three gtx titan X's in there
which aren't even that great when it
comes to workloads because they don't
have any double-precision or anything
going on in them but I still render
every video you guys see on this system
which pretty much doubles as a
workstation and a gaming system
typically the parts you would use to
build a gaming machine are going to be
very good at doing dual purpose a lot of
people want to get into live streaming
their video games but they're concerned
about do I need to build a streaming PC
to capture all the output from my gaming
PC and typically that's just not
necessary it's it's simply not and you
can easily build a gaming machine that
is capable of dual double duty doing
your rendering and doing your game guys
I hope today's videos helped you
understand that you should probably
ignore the word gaming when it comes to
shopping for your parts for your gaming
computer and try to make the best
decision you can based
the features that are included on the
product if you guys have any other
suggestions for topics that you think I
should cover then make sure you let me
know in the comments or head on over to
Twitter let me know there you can find
the information for that down in the
description and don't worry guys we have
some more content coming up here
regarding graphics cards in games are X
480 stuff coming up right around June
29th which is NDA lives on that we got
the gtx 1070 super clock from EVGA then
i'm benchmarking right now and we're
going to start getting into some more
lower end stuff as well to try and cover
as much ground as we can when it comes
to people who are shopping in all sorts
of budget ranges in fact I want to kind
of do a budget build to see how far we
can stretch some money so we'll be doing
that here in the future as always guys
thanks for watching subscribe to the
channel if you're new and you liked what
you saw and if you didn't like what you
saw you know what to do but if you did
you know you got to mash the hell out of
that like button alright guys thanks for
watching it as always I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
