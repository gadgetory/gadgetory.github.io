welcome to the ventures night with Jays
two cents and coconut monkey tonight
we're going to be reviewing the dxracer
chair so buckle up because it's going to
be fun form with the new silencio
performance optimized fans the cooler
master neptune 240m delivers the perfect
balance of noise and performance click
the link in the description to find out
more a chair a chair now what we're
looking at here like I mentioned in the
beginning DX racers King Series chair
obviously for kings or king sized people
now I had a chance to talk to these guys
in person at CES this chair was designed
specifically for the husky fluffy
individual or if people who would just
want a little bit more moving room in
their chair a little bit more moving
room I guess as you can see the back is
much wider here there's a lot less
bolstering on the side which a lot of
their smaller chairs have bolstering
where you feel like you're in a race car
but this is meant for wider individuals
is wider part here at the shoulders
wider but it's a little bit longer
you have adjustable hem or armrests
which are actually part of all their
chairs they go up and down forward and
backwards with a button there and then a
button on the side to actually go in and
out on width so the armrests themselves
also can move in and out by loosening up
the bolts underneath now the frame on
this thing the actual butt frame is
rated up to 400 pounds so if you're a
bigger individual then this is
definitely gonna be the chair for you
and the base where the part where the
wheels attached is actually rated to
1500 pounds that's like more than two
people sorry it's like a few days but
did you really just call me 790 pounds
that's uh
Hey so you go now when it comes to
warranty on this thing it does actually
have a lifetime construction warranty
any of the welds if they Bend they break
the hinge all that stuff is actually has
a lifetime warranty and a 2-year
warranty on the stitching and the fabric
so if the fabric tears where the
stitching comes undone anything outside
of what's like normal wear and tear then
they'll actually cover that for two
years now the frame on the back here is
steel frame this chair actually has a
lot of weight to it try to pick it up so
heavy this thing is
oh yeah yeah it's saying it's very heavy
good it's solid steel construction
actual advocate office chair the fabric
design on here on the kingÂ´s series
specifically has a very nice carbon
fiber kind of look to it that guy was a
first thing coconut monkey said you love
carbon fiber given fake carbon fiber
looks really good it comes in a bunch of
colors this is gray they have black blue
red yellow white they have a lot of
colors but one of the things that I
really like about this chair is the fact
that it's completely adjustable now of
course that's not unique really to this
chair there's been a lot of other
companies that have kind of taken this
design and ran with it
but I'm gonna go ahead and ask coconut
monkey to plop his foot in this chair I
choose coconut monkey because if you
remember the other chair we looked at I
said was too small for me and that's one
of the things I cared most about this
chair was am I gonna fit in there
comfortably because I am a big
individual let's go ahead and move this
way I try not to get all spread-eagle
sir
alright so as you can see right now it's
not locked so he can freely rock back
and forth right now the spring is
actually loosened all the way it's got a
very stiff spring on it so you could
like when you sit down in it sometimes
even a big guy like me I had to push
hard to get it to recline the wife
couldn't even get it to recline when it
was all the way stuck like this as it
would go but go ahead and show how the
butt can lock in any position let's turn
sideways here so loved it right so it's
locked so you know he doesn't recline so
and he's perfectly safe and secured his
desk around start shakin that's actually
a problem in California go ahead and
recline the butt part oh that's nothing
yeah that's the butt so now you can lock
it there let's say you just kind of want
to sit in this
position whoin locket this this is what
they showed me at CES this is actually
considered a zero gravity position
because he's now reclined a little more
he doesn't have 90 degree vertical
weight on his spine he's relieved some
of that and if he wanted he could
actually not all support it he can bring
this chair up the back a little more if
he wanted to do that or he could lock
the chair back just like a car seat you
have full access over that or if he just
wanted to come sleep at his desk he can
go all the way back he's not going over
hecta close partners oh god yeah a
little over it's balanced that's one of
the things they advertise is you're not
going over because the chair is
perfectly balanced I mean look I can go
just shake it a guy he's not Dhoni
right crap you're not going anywhere
it's scary though it is scary because
it's very unnatural yeah okay I don't
know if I would personally ever sit that
way but you could I guess are you making
snow angels earrings or what if they're
angels are just angel cuz your groom is
pretty cute yeah dust angels hey hey hey
Wow oh hi one two at least it's not a
bunny uh no there's one thing I do want
to point out though go ahead and flatten
out the the butt part of it
god you're better than I thought oh
those are very hurtful words coming from
the hurt forward look who's talking
fatty alright so is a lot no and lock it
like that oh yeah oh yeah
alright so if he wanted to know sit like
that if he was flat like this and he
sits up now I did this actually if you
just pull the lever it'll smack the crap
out of your back you know it actually
doesn't feel good because that's a
pretty heavy back spring back spring and
it's just Bama to the back obviously has
up-and-down adjustment on the right
right now it's all the way down now it's
all the way down as low as it'll go
it's still a little bit higher than a
standard office chair but that's because
in order to get the reclining but part
of it actually has like a V bracket on
there but it is lower than the GT Omega
racing chair which I took a look at
months ago so it actually fits under my
desk which that chair did not now the
construction of it it's all solid steel
really high-quality hinge on here
there's a lot to say about this chair
it's just I wish you guys could all sit
in it now it's got the body lumbar
pillow
right there and just kind of goes right
here yeah what you do is you just put
one through the base and then one
through the neck and then you can just
slide the whole thing up and down
wherever you want it tell me if you
would use it it's put it in the lumbar
position right there or you can move it
where you think it's comfortable I'd I'd
use it if I'm like watching Netflix I
wouldn't say like for gaming or anything
do you tend to sit more upright when
you're gaming or slouch it just depends
like how the intensity depends on the
mood yeah it does you're playing lead
you to layer you're probably slouching
playing what I just dated myself hit
like if you actually know what game it
is it was a game or the whole point was
never mind never mind okay so he's
looking for love in all the wrong places
it's actually the title oh yeah so yeah
role-playing game literally mmm but yeah
the dxracer King series chair I guess
it's time to find out how I feel about
it so let excuse me
normal sized monkey dude take your
pillow oh right any that cuz I don't use
those headrest pillow I do actually use
that so here we go Todd on oh yeah come
on I got I got a little a little
experience yeah
paid for what can I say I am actually
very comfortable in this chair I can
cross my legs I can do activities and
stuff I mean I do that sometimes when
I'm gaming you've heard me game I'm like
gee god dammit yeah then everything
clanks around turn down the mic volume
face ears I'm a passionate hey Murray
you're going to PDX Lane don't leave me
like a ton jelly like I'd even know what
PDX Lane is I don't buy her land all
right so now we're gonna test out me I'm
300 pounds let's not pull my mic out I
don't want to die it's holding him oh
wait at that there we go whoa oh my god
it's so scary why my journey are you
dirty me no okay yeah all right so as
you can see it totally held me so always
all right there we go almost vertical
right there
we're opening up oh is it that joke I'm
sorry there we go the King racer chair
one of the things I saw or did in the
other chair which I straighted how much
my back boobs hang off the side no back
man check it out yeah yeah yeah there we
go so if you are a larger individual and
you were looking for a chair that you
can do this in or you can do this in
which I don't really recommend I like to
sit on my leg your nose but people tend
to sit on their leg like this
you wanna get any more attention to
what's going on around you please you
can sit however you want but this chair
forces posture now I have a bad
piriformis muscle which it squeezes the
shit out of my sciatic and that's what
the problem of my back is so this
actually forces you to sit right and
because of that zero gravity position I
can take that weight off of the
piriformis bring the back up a little
bit and this is actually how I sit at my
desk just like this this is how I sit
and I like it a lot you're a regular
sized individual king sized chair so
comfortable right you're pretty average
average American dude
you're to about 240 right 230 230 okay
so it's about 230 pounds six foot or 512
as he put it in the last video yes
you were comfortable in it yeah I mean
it's a lot more moving room than the
previous chair now for price it's about
it's over $400 it's closer to the $450
range now I know a lot of people would
hear that and go oh oh my god that's so
much money but let me put it in
perspective for you I work in IT and my
chair at work costs $1,200 it's one of
those 24-hour ergo NAM ik fully
adjustable chairs 1,200 bucks you know
the reality is I'm more comfortable in
this chair that I am at the one at work
so really it's an office chair that you
could put in a standard office
environment get 24-hour ergo spinal
support not be doing any damage to your
back that's how they actually rate
chairs is hours of city that it's
recommended if you go and you look a lot
of like office max chairs or like 100
bucks 200 bucks 300 bucks
like 8 hours 4 hours 6 hours so what
that means is be like spinal Institute
or whatever the people who do the
ratings on these chairs have determined
that sitting longer than that
recommended time is actually doing
damage to your lumbar in your back so
that's why a 24-hour rated chair
basically means you could sit the thing
all freaking day and not be doing any
damage to your back so you can get a
spine safe spine friendly chair for your
office gaming mancave whatever for 450
bucks it's got a lifetime warranty on
the frame and all that stuff that's
actually a big deal that's a lot cheaper
than a back brace I'd assume cheaper
than back surgery yeah so there you go
guys I know this review is kind of all
over the place but really the best way
to talk about these is just plop your
button um and talk about how you feel
yeah now you have to put the thing
together but it's pretty simple it's
about 10 bolts and diddly on this rectum
and it actually came with a very nice
instruction manual in a lot of different
languages oh alright and it came with a
spare bolt and the tool needed to put it
together nice yeah so this is my chair
now and I'm very very happy with it now
even if you're a smaller individual my
wife who happens to be 5 foot 4 and not
a big person at all right she's she's
pretty small person yeah she sat in this
chair and went whew she really liked it
the cushions are kind of stiff out of
the box but I can feel that they're
gonna break in they're gonna break in
and toe into a comfortable shape unlike
where you sit in a nice soft chair when
you first buy it and and what happens it
breaks down yeah the time and you're
sitting on like the plywood or whatever
it's made out of over time this isn't
going to do that in fact there's a
warranty on the cushion as well so yeah
all of that stuff guys definitely worth
taking a look at so dxracer calm no
affiliates or anything like that just
checking out a chair that hopefully make
my back feel better and I've got a lot
of great things to say about it so there
you go guys you can check out the link

website again it's not an affiliate I
get no kickbacks or anything like that
just sharing some info any last words
I like chair sure I like chair now

even though it is that wider base like
he said but it's just more wiggle room
so get more comfortable you know what
are you doing in your chairs I'm playing
games what are you doing is that what
we're calling it
