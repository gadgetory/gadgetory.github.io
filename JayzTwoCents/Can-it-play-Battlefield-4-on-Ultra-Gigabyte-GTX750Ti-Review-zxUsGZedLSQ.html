and I am of course Jay but who else
would I be if I were somebody else that
would be entirely weird but anyway
recently Nvidia launched its brand-new
750 and 750 Ti graphics cards so that's
what we're going to look at today
gigabyte has sent me one of their 750ti
windforce Edition graphics cards and
it's saying it's pretty powerful for
given what it is so let's go ahead and
talk about what this is how it performs
and maybe this card is right for you who
knows okay so when it comes to the
construction of this card gigabyte is
widely known for their ultra durable
series and that's exactly what they've
implemented here on this custom PCB it
does feature their ultra durable design
which are solid caps upgraded compare
MOSFETs and chokes and it's got their
what they call their low RDS MOSFETs so
the power delivery to the graphics card
GPU is very very clean now what makes it
also unique is the fact that it's got
their windforce design on there but what
I think is really interesting about this
card and what makes it really cute it's
the fact that it's so damn small but
we'll get to that in a second when it
comes to other features on the card of
course it's supporting DirectX 11 point
2 API as well as it has 2 gigabytes of
on-board gddr5 memory and has a 128-bit
memory bus so the specs are incredibly
impressive in fact I don't even know
what the stock clock is on this thing it
doesn't even say on the box with the
stock clock is on this but obviously
we'll check that out when we do the
benchmarks and one thing I do find in
kind of incredibly interesting regarding
this graphics card is their video output
options it has a DVI I a DVID and 2 HDMI
you would find that there is no
DisplayPort output which is kind of
curious because of the fact that it does
feature 4k resolution at 60 Hertz
support but in order to get that
resolution you have to use two HDMI
outputs I don't know I don't know why
they went that route I'm sure they have
their reasons but there's no DisplayPort
on this which would natively support 4k
a little bit better anyway let's go
head and talk about the physical
properties of the card itself when you
open the box everything will fall right
out no I'm just kidding guys the driver
discs in manual out on me there so
anyway there they are there but as
always I recommend tossing those aside
and going on what did I hit tossing
those aside and going over to their
website and downloading the most
up-to-date drivers just toss the
software quite honestly now also
contained on that driver disk is their
OC grew overclocking utility once again
you can grab the most recent version of
that from their website as well now when
you open the box you're going to find
some accessories in here the cutest
little 4-pin molex to 6-pin PCI Express
cable again just toss that and you'll
find the graphics card itself now when
it comes to the graphics card I'm
serious this is just the cutest thing
I've ever seen it so adorable look it's
so small they can only fit two of the
fans on there you guys know typically
there's three on here but we've got two
of the windforce fans on here there it's
just so adorable it's also got one
copper heat pipe that expense extends on
the top as well as the bottom here you
will find that it requires one PCI
Express six pin connector and you also
have obviously your PCI 3.0 slot on
there now on the top for connectivity
you'll notice that there is no SLI
bridge
unfortunately this card does not support
SLI so that's pretty much all we're
going to talk about here when it comes
to the specs of the card I mean you can
see out there you do have your two HDMI
ports and your two DVI ports so let's go
ahead and stop talking about the card
and let's go ahead and stick it inside
my test rig and see exactly what kind of
performance we get out of this gigabyte
win force gtx 750ti so I don't spend a
whole lot of time playing around with
the mid and low end cards and let's face
it for what it is given where is placed
in the lineup the 750ti is a low-end
card is a it's an entry-level budget
solution as what it is
now with the stock clock of eleven
hundred and seventy-six megahertz
missing overclocked to 1311 megahertz
and what's kind of cool about that is
the fact that it would have gone farther
and I'm almost positive of that because
I maxed out the sliders I couldn't go
any farther but the overclock on this
was
just asking for more now it didn't do
like fantastic in benchmarks or anything
but I mean as I've mentioned before when
it comes to benchmarks and things
they're just a number they're just a
number that some chart you know
populated based on average frames per
second of a synthetic loop of something
that's happening so it doesn't it's not
real world representation of what to
expect gaming wise with a card now when
it comes to battlefield 4 you guys know
I like to stress the card as hard as
possible so I always test the first test
on the ultra preset and then I try and
find where the card really fits in now
this is naturally not an ultra preset
type of card but I figured says this is
a 1080p test you might as well just go
ahead and see what it does now the card
averaged 44 frames per second on Ultra
with a max frames per second of 66 in a
minimum of 23 now I'd say with the
minimum it wasn't they must have only
happened a couple of times because when
I was playing the game I didn't really
notice it in fact it wasn't even
affecting my gameplay at all I was still
owning in the game I was getting
immersed in the game and I wasn't
noticing flags or frame spikes or frame
dips that were so significant that my
that my brain being used to playing on
high-end card stock
oh this really sucks I mean it was
obvious that that the average frame rate
was lower but it was still very very
playable and smooth the frame latency
felt really good on the card now it
wasn't actually measuring frame latency
but my perception of it was that it was
very very good so I wanted to see how it
does at the recommended settings level
for Battlefield 4 which happened to be a
mixture of medium and high now we got an
average of 68 frames per second 68
frames per second average when a minimum
of 57 and a maximum of 94 averages that
1080p on a tiny little card like this
never got any harder than 52 degrees
Celsius never even heard the card it was
so quiet that it got to the point to
where I kind of stopped letting my
benchmark run because I let it just kind
of I have to hit a key bind and it will
run for a minute and then it
do a verge frames per second and then I
just kind of keep it going and just keep
hitting it in heat while I'm playing and
on 64 player map parcel storm man these
are the kind of numbers I was getting so
this kind of flipped my world upside
down because I'm realizing that cards
are getting so much stronger with so
much less resources necessary at least
when you gaming at a resolution like
1080p now I'm not going to put 1200 PE
or anything higher than 1080p at this
card it's not where the card is aimed or
placed in the market and if you're low
if you're gaming on something lower like
10 1050 1600 by 1050 or even the 720p
monitor my god you could play ultra
preset maxed out and just be butter
smooth but the super efficiency of this
card using less than 80 watts of power
only needing one six pin connector and
if you're on a tight budget I would be
sure hell-bent to find a better card for
a hundred and fifty dollars 150 bucks in
the past I would have said the r9 270
was a really good bargain at 179 but we
all know cryptocurrency destroyed that
market so the 750ti
man it's no powerhouse but it sure as
heck surprised me on how well it
performed so guys tell me what you think
about this card I mean I know it's
really new it shows us that we have a
lot to expect out of Maxwell if they're
able to pull this kind of power out of
this tiny tiny little really is no other
way to explain it it is a tiny card so
guys have been Jays two cents I hope
this review has helped you make a
decision if you were looking at buying
this card and as always see you on the
website and I'll see you in my next
