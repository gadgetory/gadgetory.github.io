the saddle it's going to be back we're
gonna talk about some thread Ripper
we're gonna rip some threads rip apart
because oh man there's some pretty good
memes going around the internet right
now we're AMD is just uppercutting the
 out of intel and this is like man
that AMD not pull any punches
cooler masters master key Pro Series of
keyboards offer sixteen point seven
million color RGB genuine cherry
switches a variety of sizes as well as
surface mounted controls allowing full
customization without the need for
stand-alone software learn more by phone
first and foremost guys I'm not going to
talk about specs really I mean a little
bit but it's not expect overview video
late to the party on that that embargo
lifted a few days ago plenty of tech
youtubers have already covered it go and
check out those channels or probably
just look at your sub box make sure
there's information there there's going
to be a lot of information out there
also too if I'm looking out this way
it's because I have a laptop right here
with notes nine pages of notes to be
exact
nick is quite the note-taker because we
went to the AMD press conference thing
and Nick took some a lot of notes you
can tell like I went to college damn it
I just shrunk them oops I have a really
big now okay four back so the point of
today's video is just to kind of talk
with you guys about my take on thread
Ripper what are my plans our thread
Ripper and what can we expect moving
forward because you guys have been
asking me that for a while now and I
refuse to talk about it until I had more
concrete information and we'll talk
about rumors because I want to see the
information firsthand
I think AMD for for once was very
forthcoming and honest with a lot of
their marketing material you guys I'm
sure you guys would agree there's been
some past issues with some of the slides
and things they would present but they
were very forthcoming with information
and how it compares to Intel and where
they win and where they lose most brands
will show where they lose they just
highlight where they win and I felt like
they did a really good job at answering
a lot of questions so let's start with
this there's three SKUs obviously 1950 X
for a grand 16 cores 32 threads
you've got the 1920 X a 79 799 processor
12 core 24 threads later on this month
thing with 31st of August is going to be
to 1900 X which is 549 8 core 16 threads
essentially it is a
in 1800 X but with 64 PCIe lanes and
quad-channel memory so it's not a single
die they're still dual dies on the chip
but the way the Infinity fabric works in
the way the memory is it is still a dual
died ship droid River is kind of
interesting because it's the first time
we've seen any HP DT or high performance
desktop out of AMD in a long time they
have not been concerned with competing
in the high-end desktop arena in fact a
few years back they even publicly said
we are not interested in competing with
that well obviously there has been some
command changes in Intel over the last
few years and yeah they came out
swinging man and this is this this fight
between AMD and Intel right now is
almost as good as the Mayweather vs
mcgregor showdowns at the press
conferences but yeah obviously time will
tell how these really play out now 16
cores and 32 threads that's a lot and
the problem with that is when you start
to have that many threads a lot of
applications may not actually take
advantage of it so AMD was very
proactive allowing resources to be able
to have backwards compatibility with
spread Ripper on day one and given the
fact that right then being a new
architecture and there were some growing
pains with that and this being the same
architecture we can see some pretty good
day 1 compatibility with both memory
modules and software so that's going to
be a good thing I've seen a lot of
people asking they're like who needs 16
cores and 32 threads it's ridiculous
games only use yada yada yada well if
you're thinking about thread Ripper and
you're thinking about gaming you're not
thinking about it in the right way
you're right it's absolutely overkill
for something like gaming unless you
want those guys like me who's also an
enthusiast and you're like you know what
I know it's overkill but I like overkill
I want overkill does there's no
justification needed to go out and buy
it but if you're also that guy that's
like I want to play games and I don't
know what this whole live streaming
things about let's try it out it is a
monster when it comes to multi-threaded
performance now we did see an average of
about 28 percent performance improvement
across the board
when compared to the equally priced
Intel 7900 X so that's pretty that's
pretty badass right there and I think
we're going to see some more performance
over time as applications become more
optimized for this level of
multi-threaded performance but maybe the
kind of person that doesn't need 16
cores but you still want to do the live
streaming and stuff then being 1920 X is
definitely going to be an attract
CPU with its 24 threads or maybe even
the 1900 X at only 50 dollars more than
the 1800 X Rison chip but still giving
you the 64 PCIe lanes and quad channel
ddr4 so that's going to be worth taking
a look at you know I've said this before
and people have called me out calling me
an Intel shill or an Nvidia shell or
whatever and you guys might notice I
haven't talked about Vega yet because
that's going to be a different video I
want to get my hands on Vega I don't
know when we're getting it so time will
tell on that so that's a video for
another time but I've always said if I
go work performance is best and in the
cpu part side of things guys I think
most people would agree with me maybe
even some fanboys would agree with me
that AMD has not been competitive on the
CPU side of things until 2017 all right
I mean the last time I had anything new
was when the bulldozer architecture came
out and obviously excavator and
piledriver and all that stuff but we're
talking like 2011 guys uh six years ago
so the law and even then it only
competed with like Sandy Bridge and then
with Ivy Bridge came out and Intel kept
you know actually seeing some
incremental incremental good
improvements jumps it hasn't been
competitive since then and then Intel
stopped really improving things and just
giving us more minor refreshes they got
away from a tick-tock and it became
disappointing and we get where we are
today where you get companies that are
complacent like Intel and they just are
not pushing the envelope like they could
but AMD has changed all that and the way
I know that is the way that you can tell
what's happening in the market you can
tell what's happening internally in a
company with the way that they present
themselves and Intel has taken a lot of
flack this year regarding their choice
of Shaving PCIe lanes as you move down
the stack AMD is obviously not a paid
attention what's happening with Intel
and all I owe all of your lanes all of
your cash and all that stuff is
completely available on all of their
thread Ripper chips 64 PCIe lanes going
down the stack there's three SKUs this
time and all more coming later but it is
they they're just like we heard the
market we heard the outcry and there's
no reason to do that that's greedy why
would we do it
so they're open which is amazing because
now you can have multi GPUs multi dint
to S you can have your raid cards your
sound cards your capture cards no
problem guess it's an Intel right now if
you try and run a dual 16x SLI
configuration
threads that well it's more than 28 so
it's going to go 16x and 8x and you
don't have a lot available it's just and
the fact that they would even have their
8 core 16 thread 7820 XOR K I came with
a skew but anyway 28 PCIe lanes on a CPU
that cost $600 so a couple of funny
things have happened though regarding
Intel and NVIDIA since the thread ripper
launch and the Vega announcement which
is kind of interesting to me because it
tells me that these two companies are
concerned at least a little bit I mean
they both lost a little bit of market
share until more than Nvidia obviously
but it's funny because Intel and NVIDIA
have this whole like we're not scared
right where our performance numbers
stand by themselves but they both made
some interesting decisions I think is
kind of funny to princess I I get this I
get this notification that suddenly an
Intel 7820 X has been shipped to me I
didn't ask for it I don't want it and
it's on the way so that tells me Intel
without even like getting any sort of
approval of like hey can we send this to
you was like we want to get Intel's name
out in front of the audience guys I
don't play that game sorry I have no use
for it don't know what I'll do with it
but for now I mean you're not going to
see that end up in anything so it's
obviously a marketing tactic and then
Nvidia let's talk about that one for a
second because although Vegas
performance is not going to be anywhere
near the Titan X performance its compute
performance is through the roof right in
terms of games Vega is right around the
1080 which I think it's disappointed
some people they were hoping for 1080 TI
levels of performance in games but it's
it's definitely a stop-gap card between
gamers and content producers like myself
we can leverage a lot of the compute
performance pretty much like the
estimates a lot of what's out regarding
in video right now and so Nvidia
responds with a sudden driver
improvement that improves the compute
performance on Titan by up to 3x
I think everyone can see right through
that right they've already already like
ringed a lot of money out of the market
with the first tighten and then released
the official tighten xp for the same
price of the Titan without what it was
like a very quiet launch right so you
could have bought the Titan the day
before the new car came out and you
didn't even know I did a video about
that and I stand by my statement with
that but now suddenly a driver that
improves improves performance by like X
amount that's insane
I mean it's obvious what was happening
there but then the funniest part was
that remember back to the Terry Crews
build where I had requested the Titan
XPS for him and they were like it's not
a gaming card it's an AI card
we recommend the 1080 TI it's like uh
there's no reason why this card wouldn't
be an amazing gaming card look at all of
the CUDA cores I get all the ROPS and
stuff so why why why not call it a
gaming card well it's not a gaming card
but we'll go ahead and divide it and
then now in their new marketing material
they're calling the Titan XP built for
not only costs like professional
workflow but also for gamers
I just found that kind of funny and
laughable guys I just wanted to share
with that anyway um so those are my
thoughts on thread Ripper and I'm going
to say this right now and I told this to
AMD I told them this at the event I said
if what we see on paper here turns out
to be true and factual then my next
system for myself and the custom system
you guys have all been waiting for will
indeed be an AMD thread referred 1950 X
I'm happy I'm excited about the Nick
will tell you I'm super excited about
thread Ripper man and yeah that content
coverage is coming water blocks and all
waiting on that there will be ETA water
block support on day one so once I get
my block in and all that then we will
definitely talk about that but also on a
final note though because I completely
skipped it is cooling cooling is
something that you're gonna have to keep
in mind with this though they're
shipping with it an ASA tech bracket so
that any ASA tech based coolers the
round coolers anyway will be able to
hook up to your motherboard immediately
and there's something like 20 or 25
water cooler supported at launch there's
only five air coolers right now
supported not to a I think cyborg and
Coolermaster but not to ones they said
we're going to be a little bit delayed
so technically is only a couple air
coolers available but we're looking at
180 watts ish of heat that needs to be
handled at stock speeds so I wouldn't
consider even overclocking this on air I
mean I guess you could spend if you get
a winning chip that doesn't require a
lot of voltage but will obviously cover
all of that in my future videos so
thanks guys for listening to this
rambling head video it was kind of nice
to get my mind off things and talk about
something fun and exciting from this
company which who would have thought
just came out swinging
kind of like McGregor and Mayweather are
going to give me a good fight and this
is kind of like but the tech version of
that I'm excited you guys sound off in
the comments and tell me what you think
you're probably going to love it you're
probably going to hate it fanboy isms
aside it is what it is
thanks for watching guys and as always I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
