the singularity benchmark showing that
two of these guys at just under two
thirds the price of a single GTX attend
80 founders Edition was actually beating
it so obviously people have ran with
that saying that that means that two of
these are better than a 1080 in pretty
much every instance well let's go ahead
and find out today on whether or not
that's true because fortunately I've now
got my hand on two of these little
beasts what are you doing I start it's
time for an upgrade that's little Jays
Xbox ah much better
how did you even get in here yes made a
key last time I was here no big deal
well I could go for a drink right about
now though I kind of feel like you've
already done this whole living room
thing before no there's a different
channel these are horrible man well you
are breaking in anyway no not I've
witnesses the new defined nano s from
fractal design supports full-size power
supplies full-length graphics cards room
for a complete custom water loop and
heck even room for a couple of
freeloaders put the link in the
description for more details
tractor Josh not included we should
order pizza now a couple things to kind
of get out of the way here first of all
I want to say huge thank you to Ed over
at tech source for sending me his rx4 80
because as you guys know we were all
sent one of these and that kind of made
a lot of people in the public really
like what the heck man AMD showed these
crossfire results and I didn't send
anybody two cards and that means we
couldn't test it so I reached out ed
responded and pretty much right away he
like responded immediately saying hey
man you can borrow my card so I was like
sure absolutely so do me a favor guys
look in the description check out the
link to his channel check out his rx 40
review he's also going to be doing a
crossfire review because I'll be sending
him my card
in exchange you know for scratching my
back because butt itches
it's been itching for a while and I
couldn't reach it and he got that for me
because you know he's a bro so anyway
I'm gonna send him my card and you guys
can see the same results over on his
channel as well the other thing to
mention here
is there's obviously been a lot of
controversy especially on reddit over
the last couple of days about power
consumption on this guy and PCI e-cigs
standards and whether or not it's
pulling too much power through the
motherboard I'm not going to comment on
that because it's obviously a very deep
issue I don't know obviously a whole lot
about it but there's a lot of
controversy saying it's out of spec and
other people are chiming in saying no
it's in spec and then supposedly PCIe
sig said no it's fine there's no
problems there's no issues here that
it's not going to damage your
motherboard so I don't know so I don't
even want to comment on that but I will
say that I did not run into any sort of
hardware issue with running two of these
for what two days now in crossfire can
pig come Pig config I guess crossfire
could be kind of a compact at power
consumption depending which card you're
using but anyway I digress that's that's
pointless we're not going to talk about
that today because that's just
admittedly an issue that's much deeper
than my comprehension on the standards
for a PCIe slot power draw but I will
say that I did not run into any issues
while doing my testing and it also goes
to show that apparently if you look at
any cards power draw almost all of them
pull more than 75 watts from the PCIe
slot and then if you overclock it you
pull even more than that so if you've
ever overclocked card guess what you've
pretty much gone out of standard so
there's that anyway enough of that let's
go ahead get into results and then we'll
talk about this and whether or not it's
even worth to consider doing that's
always the point of these videos is it
worth it
okay so as you guys could see by looking
at the benchmarks these two cards lived
just in the shadow of the GTX ten eighty
founders Edition and was nipping at its
heels the entire time now some people
look at that and go see see there was a
lie it was a lie no it wasn't a lie
because I only showed asynchronous
compute game like ashes of the
singularity which we know AMD is better
at so I didn't actually test that
because again I don't know how to use
the damn benchmark and I'm willing to
admit it I keep getting extremely
sporadic results sometimes FPS down into
the 30s while running 1080p so again so
I didn't want to use the benchmark I
just it's confusing to me and I'm too
stupid to figure it out so that's why I
just stuck to my usual lineup of like
GTA 5 and Crysis and witcher and far cry
and a good mixture of both nvidia and
AMD titles obviously firestrike is in
there this thing has the highest score
amongst the entire configs I tested in
fire strike but as you guys know you
can't take a synthetic benchmark like
fire strike and convert it to real-world
experience when it comes to games
synthetic benchmarks don't use nearly as
much RAM that means nearly as much CPU
and they also scale nearly perfectly but
that doesn't mean the developers have
scaled it when it comes to the games so
that's why my testing testing
methodology is the way that it is but
also one thing to keep in mind too is
yeah this thing did not exceed the GTX
1080 and pretty much any of the games
that I tried out but it was right there
was like literally biting the heels like
a rabid Chihuahua at the GTX 1080 the
entire time at just under 2/3 the cost
that's the thing that's actually worth
mentioning these come in at 478 dollars
in a crossfire config $239 MSRP for the
8 gigabyte model nipping at the freaking
heels of a GTX 1084 considerably
considerably less to over $200 less
that's a big deal you could buy you
could buy two of these for one rig and
another one for another computer for
less than it would cost for a single GT
X 1080 founders Edition and that's kind
of a big deal to me but one other thing
to also mention is these were running at
stock speeds so if you overclock these
the extra hundred megahertz they were
capable of then it does go just past the
1080 but if you overclock the 1080 on
the
flipside which we all know it's very
good at then it pulls even farther ahead
like way farther ahead but again for
something that cost more you would kind
of expect it to do better I would hope
anyway one of the thing to also mention
though is although these were better
than a single 1070 in pretty much every
instance they do cost about forty to
fifty dollars more than a 1070 so that's
also something worth keeping in mind and
you're going to use a lot more power
because these cards are about a hundred
and sixty watts apiece just over the 150
TDP they advertise depending on whether
or not it gets to ramp up or fan speed
that there are things that play there so
these do consume about twice the amount
of power as a gtx 1070 which means more
heat in the room and more noise now I
didn't mention thermals and I didn't
mention noise because blower style
coolers like this from AMD they suck
they really do suck in fact blower
styles in general are loud and they're
extremely inefficient at their method of
cooling so we just need to wait for
board partner cards to come out with our
multi fan configurations to see how they
really stack up which is nice because
that means you have more overclocking
Headroom with better temperatures
especially on AMD and that means the
acoustics are also going to come down
quite a bit but these sounded like a
freaking ac-130 going down the runway
when these were under load they were
really loud but also - one thing to keep
in mind my motherboard configuration for
crossfire instead of having dual slot
spacing like that forced them to be like
this so this card did get up to 85 C
under load but it didn't rattle it
stayed at 1200 and 66 that's a good
thing so that really brings us into the
portion about whether or not it's worth
it and you've got to ask yourself what
games do you play are you primarily an
indie game or are you a side scroller do
you play MOBAs do you play games that
typically just don't require a lot of
demand from your graphics card if that's
true then two of these might not be the
best option for you one of them would be
more than sufficient to play games like
Starcraft and League of Legends and all
that with all settings maxed all the eye
candy up and have a great gaming
experience but that also means you'd
never even consider something like a
1080 if that was your gaming expectation
anyway but I am really pleased to see
that it scaled very very well on the
triple-a titles that I played with now
there that's not to say though that it
was completely bug free in Crysis 3 on
4k I was getting some weird
textures on the water with it was some
really weird flickering that was only
there in 4k it wasn't there in 3 and
1440 and it wasn't there in 1080 and it
was the only game that had any sort of
issue with but actually before filming
this video but after doing my testing I
did get notification from AMD that they
actually have an updated driver to
actually address some crossfire config
stuff and even give a little bit more
performance to crossfire so we're
already seeing drivers pumped out from a
Indies camp which is a good thing
because there was always this huge
stigma of the AMD drivers suck and then
the next year it's like oh the Nvidia
drivers suck and then the next year it's
like ah both companies drivers suck an
AMD was actually pretty bad with going a
long time for a while there with no
wickel certified drivers and only
dealing with betas and lots of bugs but
it seems like that might be squared away
but at the end of the day I can't say
whether or not this is worth it to you
you're going to just have to see the
benchmarks that are out there look at
everyone doing crossfire testing and
look at the games they're using the
settings they're using and try and
determine if you can get a better gaming
experience versus what you have now with
two of these personally I would always
recommend if you're on a budget going
with the fastest single card you can get
versus any sort of lower end crossfire
config I never personally recommend
going with to lower cards in place of a
single high-end card because you
introduce things like the glitching
textures like I just showed you with
crisis or you deal with driver
optimization or you deal with the devs
or the devs even going to code for
crossfire you know it's one of those
things with the single card you're
always supported but if you're just
enthusiast and you like having multiple
graphics card do you think it looks cool
then that's something you could do too
you know and are these gonna actually be
supported for water cooling that's
another thing people ask me yes they are
actually
I have ek water blocks on the way right
now as we speak
so I can actually do some water cooling
testing on this which is going to be
interesting because I also usually never
recommend water cooling a graphics card
this cheap I would usually recommend
taking the extra hundred bucks the block
costs and putting it into a better card
but who knows might as well test it
since it's on the way but anyway guys
tell me what you thought about this
again when it comes to the PCIe slot
thing let that one play out I have no
idea I have no idea the players involved
there I have no idea who even like
started this rumor or why I don't think
it's going to blow up your
the board based on what PCI usig is
saying that the slots the slots
apparently are good for up to 300 watts
and someone was saying that in tech talk
the other night but I don't know enough
about that standard to say it's going to
hurt anything I didn't experience any
issues with running two of these and
even playing around with overclocking so
who knows maybe I'll set up a low-end
test rig like a budget motherboard and a
budget CPU and set it up and just let it
run and loop under load and see if
anything goes pop and sizzle I don't
think anything will but maybe that's
worth the test hit like if you want me
to do that test anyway guys thanks for
watching I'll see you in the next video
and as always have a great day actually
normally I say as always see in the next
video but I want you guys to have a
great day damn it it's the weekend enjoy
it alright see you in the next one I
just kicked the camera
