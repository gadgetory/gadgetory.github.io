tells me I'm not the only one what
really makes me more excited than a
graphics card is a graphics card
shootout and you guys have been asking
me for a long time to do a 1970 SLI
versus 980ti or vs. tight next and today
we're finally doing that video gigabytes
flex display technology automatically
detects and connects up to four displays
with the best gaming experience in multi
display Ultra HD click the link in the
description to find out more
now here the graphics cards we're taking
a look at here today we are looking at
the EVGA ACX 2.0 970 and sli we're
looking at the nvidia 980 TI the EVGA
980 TI hybrid and the nvidia titan x so
if you guys want to check out more about
those individual videos i'm not going to
spend a lot of time going over each
individual card we've already done
reviews on all these cards and you can
see those right here
so if you want to pause this video head
over there check out the individual
reviews you can do that now it should be
no surprise that of the bunch here the
most bang for your buck is going to be a
GTX 970 in fact it's still one of the
most recommended cards of price to
performance for 1080p on the Nvidia side
if you guys are looking for Nvidia and
staying current with all of the new and
video game work stuff that's going to be
the card you want to put in your arsenal
so it comes without surprise that so
many people have requested a 970 sli
versus the new flagship cards from
Nvidia the 92 TI and the Titan X now to
970 s is going to come in right around
$700 a little bit less give or take
which model you go with there's a lot of
different custom PCBs and we're going to
be looking at the 980ti reference model
which comes in at six hundred and fifty
dollars so technically two 970 s would
be a little bit more than a gtx 980ti
and it would be less than a 980 TI
hybrid which comes in currently at seven
hundred and forty nine dollars and then
of course you have the massively very
expensive Titan X at $1000 which is well
as we've already figured out with the
980 TI becoming a little bit of an old
news
when it comes to flagship graphics cards
by cutting off only 256 cuda cores and
six gigabytes
vram more than the 980ti coming in at 12
gigabytes of vram and we still are not
even coming close to even touching that
amount of buffer it really becomes
nothing more than bragging rights
now I ran the exact same tests on all of
these cards and actually I went through
in random multiple times because I
wanted to make sure that my numbers were
as accurate as possible now of course
the 980ti hybrid was run at full max
overclock the 980ti was running at 1400
because that was matching what my Titan
X was running comfortably at 1400 and
then the 970 slis were both running at
fourteen hundred and forty eight
megahertz right I got to consult my
spreadsheet fourteen hundred and forty
two megahertz as six megahertz could
make a huge difference so that's where
the core clocks came in now before we
start talking about my conclusions on
all of this why don't we go ahead and
just take a look at the benchmarks
remember the titles that we're taking a
look at tend to be more demanding titles
I stayed away from titles that have a
lot of customization because it's hard
to get a uniform experience across the
board when your results are definitely
going to vary based on mods that you
have so of course minecraft is out
Skyrim is out and shadow of Mordor is
out because of the HD resolution texture
pack that meant the 970 SLI was
technically out so we are going to go
ahead and stick with the titles which we
have been doing all along and you guys
are going to see those right now
transition
you
now I've said it before and I will say
it again and I'm going to say it again
now graphics cards are all about your
unique situation and it's going to
depend on a few factors it's going to be
what resolution panel are you running or
what refresh rate is that panel what
games what type of games are you playing
are you playing shooters RPGs
customisable games simulators they all
have a different need when it comes to
GPU power so in this situation this Jeep
mounted GPU power you're looking at is
probably overkill for the vast majority
of people watching this video but we can
still find it interesting and do it for
the sake of science nerdy science I like
nerdy science keeps me with a job I
really wish that I had the ACX cooler
for the Titan X as well as the ACX
cooler for the 980ti
because then it would have been a more
across-the-board comparison when it came
to noise levels now obviously when it
comes to noise levels the 980ti hybrid
wins because the fan on the PCB never
speeds up it doesn't have to and then a
fan on the radiator runs at a pretty
constant low rpm of about a thousand rpm
and doesn't speed up doesn't slow down
doesn't make a sound and the card is no
louder than any of these other cards at
idle while under full loads when it
comes to noise clearly the 980ti Hybrid
wins but what about performance it's all
about performance it's always about
performance when it comes to performance
it should be no surprise at the 970 SLI
held its own against even the top dog
Titan X Titan X as we know is only a few
percent faster than the 980ti so that's
really where our focus should be
obviously buying something like the
Titan X is going to have a pretty
significant loss of return on investment
when it comes to FPS per dollar or
dollar per FPS whichever way you want to
look at it you're going to get the most
bang for your buck technically with the
980ti because it's a little bit cheaper
than two 970 s in SLI but of course the
970 SLI is giving you a few FPS more but
then it comes down to it do you want to
pay more for a few more FPS well if the
argument doesn't hold true for the Titan
X that paying more doesn't make sense
and it shouldn't really hold true for
the night
seventy SLI in this case either even
though we're talking only about 50 bucks
versus 350 dollars the argument should
stay the same when it comes to the 970
SLI you're getting 980ti and tight next
performance but for a heck of a lot less
than the tight necks and about the same
price as the 980ti and i don't think
that's going to surprise anybody NVIDIA
has always been very good at making sure
that whatever the top-tier card is is
about double the price of whatever 2
cards in SLI would match that's kind of
always been that way and it will
probably always be that way
it should be no surprise how performance
$2 ratios work with Nvidia they've been
very smart on that so one of the reasons
why we didn't see a 970 price drop like
we did on the 980 because then it would
have meant for cheaper than a nine
eighty or ninety eight ETI sorry you
could have beaten the performance for
significantly less so not too surprised
with where we're landing here on
performance per dollar SLI versus
standard now the only title that really
exceeded the three point five gigabytes
of vram that is or fast vram that is
present on the 970 boards was far cry 4
and that was at 4k with 2x msaa on and
everything on you know the the high
settings now I didn't notice any
stutters or slowdowns I did notice of
course that 4k to me is still unplayable
at the 40 FPS range that it tends to
hang out at and I prefer 60fps or higher
obviously it's kind of sad that 2 970
still can't get you 60fps and 4k so that
really means the single GPU power found
in the 980ti and the Titan X really does
come to light on just how powerful that
GM 200 GPU is where to GM 204 s barely
matched the power of 1 GM 200 so well at
least for the 970 anyway now should you
buy any of these combos behind me here
the 2:9 70s or the 980 TI custom 980ti
or Titan X well obviously if you're
running a 1080p panel that's a 60 Hertz
panel the answer is no get yourself one
970 be happy or get yourself a single
290 or to 90 X whatever you'll be future
compatible for titles for a long time
and you're not going to be brave
the bank the 3.5 gigabytes of vram is
still going to be good for most titles
for several years to come it probably
upgrade before 3.5 gigabytes of vram
becomes a real limiting factor and if
you're running 144 Hertz panel then it
might make sense to you because you
would want those high refresh rates
without screen tearing and you could
take advantage of the amount of
horsepower found behind me but if you're
running a 1440p panel or a 4k panel
obviously you're going to need this much
horsepower and in my opinion needing
more horsepower than to 1970s in SLI are
going to give you so what's my
recommendation if you're running a 4k
panel well none of these honestly my
recommendation would still be to 980 s
naught T is choose standard 980 s and
SLI if you have the budget running about
a thousand dollars and you would get a
lot of future compatibility you could
run 4k in the future even if you don't
have it now
and with dx12 coming out you're going to
get really good overhead when it comes
to CPU performance GPU performance and
you're going to find that 2 980 s is
going to be a much better return than
getting say a single tight next but if
you're running a 1440p panel or 4k panel
as you can see 2 970 s holds its own
against these other cards but of course
it has quite a bit less memory so my
opinion would be to get a 980 TI if
you've got the $700 price points that
you could spend in your system and you
want to stake future compatible with any
title as long as you possibly can the
980 TI still is the king as far as I'm
concerned
high resolution panels for that type of
price point but if you already have a
970 then all by all means get a second
970 the 3.5 gigabytes of vram at 1080p
is not going to be a problem for still a
while on most titles there's always the
exception to the rule don't flame me in
the comments I know there's exceptions
but remember guys those are exceptions
and at 1440p and 4k who knows how long
that's going to actually stay compatible
as companies start to tap into that vram
as it becomes available so there you go
guys GTX 970 SLI vs. 980 TI vs. 980 TI
hybrid vs. tight mix hope you guys
enjoyed today's video you guys have
asked for it for a long time I've teased
it for far too long and here
as always guys I couldn't do these
videos without you it means a ton that
you guys watch and follow on social
media and all that stuff and you guys
take an interest in all of this nerdy
crap that we take a look at because it's
a hell of a lot of fun got a lot of
stuff coming up on the channel and not a
lot of time to get it done so I need to
end this video and get going so as
always guys thanks for watching I'll see
you guys in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
