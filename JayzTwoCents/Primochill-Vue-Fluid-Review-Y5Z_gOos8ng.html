it's been a long time since I had been
excited about any sort of product that
has to do with fluids you guys know I've
had some hard past time past times some
past experiences when it comes to fluids
especially things that are like pastels
trust me when I say that this this is
different place I hope so now what
you're looking at right here is not just
a regular old pastel trust me it looks
like it in fact it's not even from
Mayhem's this is from primo chill they
sent this over in fact that sent over
three bottles on my request I requested
a green UV dye reactive fluid for the
thread Ripper build that we've got all
the parts on now we can actually start
that but this is different
they asked me if I was interested in
something cool and unique that they've
been testing for ever and they are
confident this is gonna hold up to the
heat it's gonna hold up to long-term use
and it's not gonna clog this I can't
remember the name of the guys I'm sorry
I forgot the name go to primo chill comm
I'm sure they'll have it there but check
this out this is an Aurora style fluid
that doesn't fall out and it doesn't
clog and here's the proof of that this
has been sitting now for obviously for a
while you can see it's undisturbed but
watch this do you see how that is not do
you see how it's not falling do you see
that this is one of the craziest fluids
I think I mean it looks a lot like the
Aurora but they promised it comes with
all of the effects but none of the
headache so that's what we're gonna do
today we're gonna put it in the test rig
for calling this a tester it's actually
Nick's system we're calling it the dummy
rig for this because you guys know this
one gets hot remember I had some
temperature problems in here too tight
next Maxwell cards an eight-core sixteen
thread rise in 1800 X in there and so
what we're gonna do is we are going to
drain all the blue out of here we're
gonna flush this out we're gonna install
this and we're gonna see how it looks
and it's UV reactive this is exactly
what I wanted but check this out this is
like it's the craziest thing and how
much it moves like I'm not even moving
the bottle right if I just twist the
bottle like that that is the craziest
thing
that means it's obviously like even got
some sort of surface tension from just
the bottle otherwise why would it react
to a spin like that what were you doing
earlier you like rolling it yeah and
then you stopped it and it keeps going
that did it oops
oh there we go look at that so anyway
this should give us a really neat effect
as its flowing through the loop because
the the cool part about filling a loop
is you can see it moving but then once
it's full all the airs gone you can't
see it going anywhere anymore but this
you're gonna see it moving and it comes
in a ton of colors I think I said 15 so
if you want blue or pink or purple they
got it
well it's in it looks pretty neat I mean
alright the fluids in you can see it's
moving it's doing its thing
the pump is moving really fast though
for some odd reason this is a PWM
controlled d5 pump for some reason the
motherboard in the BIOS settings does
not letting me slow it down so it's
running like Mac's speed I would ideally
like to slow the pump down a little bit
once we're not aerating it as much so
some of the foam that's starting to well
not starting to form but that is going
away that formed when I I kind of let a
little bit of air get into the system
when I was filling it the manufacturer
told me like hey don't don't do that
don't let air in there that's why you're
getting foam so yeah it's going away
though we've got it totally heat cycles
we've been running another benchmark for
like an hour at least time someone for
like an hour because remember the whole
reason I'm doing this is I'm testing
this fluid to see how it reacts to the
temperatures making sure it can cool
well and seeing whether or not a 360 and
a 240 is gonna be enough for the 210 ATT
is now these are too tight next Maxwell
cards they're still 250 watt TDP cards
although they're not the same
architecture they are still gonna be
roughly the same amount of heat but if
you could slow the pump down you'd have
a little bit cooler looking effect
rather than zooming by but at least you
can see the flow which is something that
you couldn't see before now in terms of
temperatures we were running for an hour
like I said top is open on the case
front is open on the case and the side
is open on the case because that's
exactly how the Cougar conquer cases
it's not a sealed chassis so letting all
the air flow come through is definitely
going to be the best sort of a
recreation of the parts we're putting in
the conquer case but temperature-wise
here we're going anywhere from 46 to 48
C on the hottest card and 43 c 42 C on
the second card because we are of course
running SLI and they are overclocked to
1400 megahertz
I wish I could go farther but this is
overclocked these are overclock
temperatures I'm okay with this hey guys
this is the Primo chill view it is not
entirely out on market yet it's still in
advanced research stages they've been
working on this for years and I'm
fortunate enough for them to have sent
this to me so if you guys want to learn
more about this and keep your eyes
peeled and keep your ear to the ground
when it comes to primo chill I'm glad
they let me check it out we probably
should've put in the test bench too but
this
Nik sister what do you think of it I
like it you're like like wish you could
kind of see under the blocks there but
the way it is you can't really yeah
it's just we need to do like a mirror
finish down here so you could see your
card that'd be cool but anyway just a
fun little blog showing you guys this
really neat product I've not done
anything with fluids in a while and it
doesn't fall out it just stays suspended
and and that's something else I want to
talk about real quick to like the
consistency of this it looks like it
should be like slime like slimy thick
but it's not it's like you can see the
way that pore is right that is just I
don't want to waste it but that's like
water when you touch it because I was
really concerned like well what do this
feels like was it gonna feel this Kasich
was it gonna feel like a disc ASSA t-to
it
does it feel like oil because it looks
like a whale right no it feels just like
water and the other crazy thing is it
has no smell whatsoever like
glycol-based stuff was that one time I
was like it smells like Russia cuz it
smelled like alcohol yeah all right it
was glycol not alcohol water it's a
whole other matters yeah it if you
blindfolded someone and then stuck their
finger in this it probably just think
it's water hey I'm gonna go guys thanks
for watching today's video as always I
will see you in the next one
it's Jung cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
