insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 you
guys have been asking about 290x custom
cooling solutions and gigabyte has
certainly gotten you covered there there
windforce cooler design is something
that's not new to the market but it's
always been a very tried-and-true proven
method of air cooling graphics cards
from gigabyte so what you can see right
here is a whole array of graphics cards
that look exactly the same
that's because they have a cooler that
works so good but they're not really
changing up the design but they are
adding it to graphics cards and one of
those being specifically D 290x which
well right here what we're looking at
right here
now the 290x you guys know runs really
really high and the wind force is a very
good cooler when it comes to keeping it
nice and cool and keeping the volume
levels down but one of the things that
they've integrated here with the wind
force I'm getting close to my cameraman
can see this is the fins on this on the
cooling solution are actually angled so
not only are you dealing with a nice
giant heat sink which is very beefy and
is actually a good amount of weight to
this you are also dealing with
channelled airflow so you're getting
maximum airflow through the heat sink
which of course means maximum cooling
there's a lot of copper heat pipes in
this thing keeping this thing nice and
cool now no it does not come with a
backplate on the back but you know the
cooler is beefy but I don't feel like
it's putting any major torque on there
so this particular graphics card we're
looking at is the r9 - 9 x OC 4 gigabyte
it is a 1040 megahertz core clock okay
so maybe AMD is not your flavor maybe
you're an Nvidia fan well they've got
you covered here with Nvidia as well we
have got the
760 OC it's a 4 gigabyte model right
there nice full-length PCB with the same
wind force coolers you've come to expect
from gigabyte you've got the
and 70 the 780 and of course these 780ti
gigahertz edition 3 gigahertz card right
there yes you heard me right
780ti gigahertz edition running at 1,000
65 megahertz and 1150 megahertz
comes with a really nice backplate
cooling all of your VRMs you've got a
lot of a lot of copper heat pipes and of
course the same tried and tested and
proven gigabyte wind force cooling
solutions with the same angled fins on
there so guys if you're shopping for a
graphics card make sure you take a look
at a gigabyte here they've got your wind
force cooler keeping things nice and
cool allowing for massive overclocks as
well as a very stable solid performance
guys have been Jays 2 cents bring me
