insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and why
Sennheiser the pursuit of perfect sound
and of course by generous viewers like
you so strapped in with J's two cents as
he takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 you guys have been asking about
290x custom cooling solutions and
gigabyte has certainly gotten you
covered there there windforce cooler
design is something that's not new to
the market but it's always been a very
tried and true proven method of air
cooling graphics cards from gigabyte so
what you can see right here is a whole
array of graphics cards that look
exactly the same that's because they
have a cooler that works so good that
they're not really changing up the
design but they are adding it to
graphics cards and one of those being
specifically d 290x which well right
here what we're looking at right here
now the 290x you guys know runs really
really hot and the wind force is a very
good cooler when it comes to keeping it
nice and cool and keeping the volume
levels down but one of the things that
they've integrated here with the wind
force I'm getting close to my cameraman
can see this is the fins on this on the
cooling solution are actually angled so
not only are you dealing with an ice
giant heatsink which is very beefy and
is actually a good amount of weight to
this you are also dealing with channeled
airflow so you're getting maximum
airflow through the heat sink which of
course means maximum cooling there's a
lot of copper heatpipes in this thing
keeping this thing nice and cool no no
it does not come with a back plate on
the back but you know the cooler is
beefy but I don't feel like it's putting
any major torque on there so this
particular graphics card we're looking
at is the r9 290x OC for gigabyte it is
a 1040 megahertz core clock ok so maybe
AMD's not your flavor maybe you're an
nvidia fan well they've got you covered
here with NVIDIA as well we have got the
760 OC it's a 4 gigabyte model right
there nice full length PCB with the same
win for schoolers you've come to expect
from gigabyte you've got the
and 70 the 780 and of course these 780ti
gigahertz edition three gigahertz card
right there yes you heard me right 780
ti gigahertz edition running at 1065
megahertz an 1150 megahert boost comes
with a really nice backplate cooling all
of your VRMs you've got a lot of a lot
of copper heatpipes and of course the
same tried and tested and proven
gigabyte windforce cooling solutions
with the same angled fins on there so
guys if you're shopping for a graphics
card make sure you take a look at a
gigabyte here they've got your wind
force cooler keeping things nice and
cool allowing for massive overclocks as
well as a very stable solid performance
