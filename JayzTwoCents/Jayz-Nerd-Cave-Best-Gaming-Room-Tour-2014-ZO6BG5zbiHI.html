guys have been asking to take a look at
a new updated room tour so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that for you guys now now I
do the best I can considering I don't
really have a wide-angle lens and this
room is a lot smaller than it looks I
mean this room is only about eight feet
by eight feet and I'm 6 feet tall for
six and a half feet tall or whatever
however tall I am so yeah we'll do the
best we can so coming in from the door
here the first thing you guys usually
notice Hey look it's me in their
reflection ho ho to go fat me anyway uh
people always ask Jay you hate call of
duty so why do you have a Call of Duty
poster I got that poster when I liked
call of duty and I just haven't replaced
it yet but this is like the wall of
bosses I mean we've got Gears of War
oh of course we've got my daughter check
that out I mean she is definitely a boss
not for entertainment here we have just
the cheap-ass insignia TV from Best Buy
and a Vizio sound bar and a Samsung
blu-ray player and of course we've got
the the Joey for the hopper system
sitting on top of some storage there I'm
watching some show that sharks and I
think that's a commercial but anyway
here is the guest PC right here you guys
have asked a lot about that and yeah I
just recently put that together it's
technically my test bed but it's a
perfect clone basically of this PC I
clone the drive over to this so it's got
battlefield 4 and all of my Steam
library and everything on there that way
you know friends can come over and play
you know I've got the k70 on there now
but that keyboard is going to be
changing soon and we got it sitting in
the fractal Ark XL but again it's one of
those things where it's kind of a
temporary thing because it is going to
be going back into my testbed which is
on its way from Germany anyway check it
out there's my my iPad chilling in the
cooler master Rock holder that they gave
me at CES so thank you for coming by the
suite now we've got my rendering slash
gaming setup and I've got a 27 inch Acer
and I don't even know if that's in the
focus game until anyway got 27 inch Acer
and a 24 inch Acer now the acer is
currently sitting on an articulating arm
which I particularly like as you can see
so I can move it out however I want
maybe in focus at may not be I'm not
really sure but I'm working on getting a
dual arm that way I can get both
monitors up on that because that one's
just sitting on the table got my Nexus 7
