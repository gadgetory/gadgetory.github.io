wholly lifted no more the crappy
unboxing things most people don't care
about especially when it's a box you
don't even yet we've got all the gooey
details at least with our experience
with Radeon 7 it
Radeon 64 or something dear I apologize
I just they change the name a little bit
from this so no fake it 64 ad on 7 build
from NZXT let's buyers customise their
gaming experience based on their desired
FPS goals in today's most popular game
titles choose a game you want to play
set a budget and build will recommend
the best parts for your build want to
get gaming faster then choose blitz mode
in order before 11 a.m. Pacific time in
your order will be built tested and
shipped same day to learn more about
NZXT tees build follow the link in the
description below alright this was a
heck of a rollercoaster of a review
please do me a favor watch to the end
and watch the other reviews typically
reviewers will just watch there one or
two favorite guys and if it's like what
they expected like I okay cool and off
they go but typically when you have an
interesting experience it was called an
interesting experience it's important to
watch everyone else's videos to see if
they're getting similar experiences and
make your own opinions don't follow my
opinion don't follow any one person's
opinion make a collective objective
opinion of your own on whether not the
product is worth it but unfortunately
our testing here didn't go as smoothly
as we had hoped and I want to talk about
that but we did get through our testing
and obviously we tested our typical
suite of games now we're adding to that
slowly the problem is some of the games
I really like testing like battlefield 5
and now Resident Evil 2 and doom and
stuff like that don't have built-in
benchmarks and I know a lot of you guys
are like well synthetics are not real
indicative of performance I understand
that but what we need is a repeatable a
versus B taste test when it comes to
seeing the the differences between the
cards you're not looking for necessarily
a figure that says this is the FPS I'm
getting its this is the FPS versus this
and this and this in the same test
that's the way you should be looking at
these charts where there's enough
reviews out there with enough games
tested you can get a sampling of what to
expect if you're looking for a specific
performance number obviously it's gonna
be better than the Vegas sixth for the
question is how did it stack up versus
the 2080
and there by default the
because you know those two cards are
like competing with each other even
though they're two different generations
as long as DL SS and the touring car the
tents of course are doing nothing and
the RT cords are doing nothing
the 2080 and the 1080 TI are essentially
the same thing in terms of performance
so that's why we compared this to that
and we threw the 64 in there so that you
can see the generational improvement
what that said watch the slides and then
listen to the discussion because we have
a lot to talk about
okay so the Radeon seven is a few
differences here in terms of the PCB but
obviously the coolers different blower
style cooler triple fan PCB wise we look
at the back you'll notice that not only
is the card a little bit taller it's the
same length we don't have the dip
switches anymore which would change the
GPU tach the GPU tach has gone entirely
also to this is a dual BIOS card which
had a performance bios and a standard
bios which basically changed
I believe the fan curve and maybe a
little bit extra GPU boost but they got
rid of that again on the Radeon seven
this card is $700 which makes it one of
the most if not the most expensive
single GPU AMD has ever made I believe
the 295x2 might have been somewhere
around that price point or maybe was
like $9.99 but that was a dual GPU card
and for its time was an absolute beast
of a card rivaling even that the of the
Titans II which was $3,000 at the time
so that was that was that was like the
last amazing card AMD made in my
personal opinion and then they went away
from that dual GPU design so in terms of
our experience we're gonna talk about
temperatures first because with the
triple fan it's obvious that more power
smaller process more focused heat means
better cooling I'm not gonna tear it
apart in this particular video because
there is a like a graphite thermal pad
in there I don't want to destroy I'm
gonna do another video where we do
temperature testing by replacing that
pad with thermal paste to see if things
change but the thermal pad is what they
use you can actually see gamers Nexus
did a video about that we have a massive
copper heat plate that actually touches
the entire die array and everything
around it be RMS and all that giving you
direct copper contact a much more
improved design over the Vegas 64 the
triple fans obviously exhaust air
basically from all three sides not four
because the rear is not open so yeah
bottom top front the bottom
unfortunately goes kind of down against
the motherboard so this is kind of
useless just like on the Nvidia card
which kind of sucks because if you look
at the top it's much more restrictive
here versus the bottom because they had
to get the giant Radeon in there as if
you forgot who it was it could have made
it smaller and a little bit less
in-your-face and gotten more cooling but
they opted for making sure you remember
who made the card rather than how car
cool the card stays speaking of cooling
though there are you need to understand
the way the temperatures are being
reported
a lot of people don't seem to understand
the edge temp versus junction
temperature so they renamed the hotspot
temp on the 64 to junction temperature
which is the same thing and then GPU
temperature on this has changed Vega 64
is GPU temp was just that it was like
was the GPU temp like you'd expect to
hear on Nvidia cards and whatever it's
like that's the temp of the core is that
there's like 60 some odd temperature
sensors in here now and what you're
getting is edge temp versus Junction
temperatures so Junction temperature is
the hottest of all of those sensors it
tells you whatever the hottest one is
and on this in this card throttling
starts at 110 see now a lot of you
already are like oh my god I got me all
over again for a hot litter that that's
not the case here it's just that of the
super concentrated dye of the seven
enemy process with these 16 gigabytes of
HBM to that stack there's a lot of
focused heat in there so what you're
able to see is the hottest of all of
those different sensors which is no
different than any sort of like your CPU
die or VRMs or whatever that's normal
that is a normal temperature we did see
this get all the way up to about a
hundred and fourteen see though at stock
settings which we were really concerned
about and I'll come back to that in a
second the lower temperature is edge
temp that is the coldest of the die so
no longer are you getting any sort of a
rolling average or any sort of like a
just a singular number to look at you're
getting a range you're getting the
coldest and the hottest well what's your
GPU really running at well pick any
number in between and that's it so and
it can't really tell you if it's running
necessarily hotter or colder than Vega
64 because we don't really know like we
don't have that that same volumetric
metering of temperatures it's not done
in the same way so I can't tell you but
I can tell you we saw a 114 see with
stock settings which then led me to
immediately call AMD and be like guys I
need to talk to somebody and see if this
is normal because I was experiencing
quite a few issues with this we had
several games just completely lock up on
us wildlands was one of them now
remember we're a media drivers here
these are drivers that are said to media
probably not the driver that's gonna be
released when it's retail ready it's
kind of this weird limbo driver which
kind of sucks because I mean
performance as you know can change and
make or break with a driver same thing
with stability so we experienced
number of issues black screen freezes
complete restarts of the system when
loading games in fact even complete
restarts just sitting at the desk top
which is extrude Woodson was extremely
frustrating seeing the temps go to 114
and the fans not ramping up to the 90%
to whatever they're supposed to was bad
enough to make you get on the phone and
being a good I need to know what's going
on here my first first issue here was
with the exception of the fans not
ramping up as high as they should the
black screen restarts the overclocking
persisting in the driver even after
clearing profiles causing crashing
because if it was a crashed if it was a
profile that was crashing even if you
wiped it and got rid of it some of it
was persisting and still causing crashes
Steve probably will talk more about that
he had a bigger experience with that
than I did they knew about it they every
problem I mentioned they were like we
know we know we know we're working on it
we're working on it which was really
disappointing to me because it was like
if you know about this why weren't you
telling us why weren't we warned why
weren't we given more time why didn't
you delay because it's Chinese New Year
the driver team apparently is working on
testing new drivers to be more ready for
retail and my problem with that is when
you take a card like this and you give
it to media and you go here you go
that's our offering what do you think we
have to go by the experiences that we're
getting and unfortunately we caught some
of those experiences but I was really
concerned with the fact that they seemed
to know about these issues we were
talking about in fact one of the issues
regarding the black screen restart was
it was sort of disclosed to us that it's
known with two major brands of
motherboards on the market one being
Asus which is what we're testing with
right here so what I what I asked them
was can I please get a test driver
something to validate whether or not
I've got some sort of a physical problem
with the card here in terms of
temperatures and the fan control versus
the actual you know hardware that we
could be experiencing so they were like
let us send you a new card please and
they sent me a new card fortunately
FedEx is plane got delayed and broke and
stuck in snow somewhere so that card did
not make it in time they did however
send me the the non validated non
testing driver one that we did not do
our tests with in terms of scores all of
our scores are with the media driver but
for sanity testing I wanted them to send
me the driver that I could test that
they were testing to see if my problems
went away fortunately some of the
problems we were experiencing
like wildlands crashing that was fixed
the fan curve acted normal again so that
was resolved but unfortunately the black
screen restart persisted so here's the
bottom line regarding this this card
when it performs as it should in games
like hitman this card decimated Nvidia
in hitman
I mean hitman was an AMT title I believe
but this card tells me what that engine
in that game absolutely dominated the
competition so it's one of those things
where when it performed as it should
like when it didn't have any sort of
weird driver bugs or crashes or whatever
in all resolutions it just scaled
beautifully it ran well it wasn't overly
noisy I mean it's not the quietest
cooler the fans still have a bit of a
chop to them if you look at the fan
curve they're very aggressive like the
actual fan pitch on there is very steep
which means you're gonna have a very
much more choppy sound to it but
obviously in my personal opinion
thermals take precedence over acoustics
because I tend to game with hip bones
and stuff anyway so I don't care we saw
temperatures on the GPU - AGP I mean
edge temp one sitting usually about 59
to 65 C but we saw a 30 C Delta between
that and the junction temperature
hitting 90s and in the mid 100's with
the latest driver so we no longer saw
the 114 that we were seeing 110 to 114
and 110 is where throttles by the way so
we did see temperatures and and
throttling kind of occur right around
that range but for the most part it
stayed just under 1800 megahertz which
is the advertised boost on this which
was actually pretty decent the 64 card
would definitely throttle down lower
cooler not good enough to kind of keep
that where it needed to be the thing
that sucks is the card performs
beautifully when it performs when it's
not dealing with any of these random
lock ups or restarts or glitches on the
screen whatever it may be
the card performs exactly as it should a
couple of tests that you saw in our
slides were just there just anomaly is
it's it's it's way behind in stuff like
Metro at 1080p anyway and then it's it's
closer at higher resolutions but we feel
there's something in the driver that's
causing it to not keep up with 1080
maybe we know AMD performs better in DX
12 in a lot of instances but
unfortunately this particular card just
obviously needs some maturity with the
drivers which is why I wish they had
waited I wished AMD had she had just had
the the balls really to push this out a
little bit and say we need a little more
time it's more important to put out a
product to maybe make people talk about
it positively then put out one that
feels rushed and if you want to compete
in the space as we all are die early
hoping you can bring some competition to
Nvidia for the sake of pricing your $700
graphics card that you sent to media and
say we're ready tell us what you think
should definitely feel like it's ready
to be scrutinized at the $700 price
point I I think the card is going to do
amazing things when the drivers are
ready but as of right now while we're
seeing all these glitches and the
freezes and the black screen restarts
like I said the temperatures did improve
with the latest beta driver that they
let us test with it just needs a little
bit more if you guys can't if you if I
feel like I'm suddenly over my words
because I am I want this card to do well
I want the card to be I want this to be
the savior I want to see this card
literally
well like Kyle did in his little
thumbnail right like I did yeah I want
to see that I wanted to see Nvidia just
feel a little bit pressured to do better
but unfortunately this card until the
drivers are resolved is not gonna do
that it also does not crossfire this is
where you guys sound off you guys can
call me all the names you want he can
see I hate him AMD whatever which is
absolutely not the truth I wanted AMD to
do well on this and they're going to do
well later do me a favor please watch
other people's videos see what they're
saying because you're gonna probably
find that there's a common thread here
of a lot of the folks I've talked to you
my problems are not one off my problems
are more so the norm and Kyle told me he
had a lot he didn't have most of the
issues if hardly any of the issues I
mentioned that makes him the one-off we
all know Kyle's a little off anyway I
got another card coming like I said
FedEx delayed it so at least we can
determine if the card that I was sent
was faulty which doesn't change anything
I said because I can only go by what
they sent me and that's what we got
alright guys thanks for watching try not
to kill me in the comments I really want
AMD to do well I really do is this this
this driver didn't get it its driver I'm
sure
they're already clicking dislike the
audience won't let us have fun if we
have any fun in this video they'll
assume that we're not taking aim be
serious no serious no go go go
okay well the I really want aim dd-do
well I'm going to jump but they did it
we did but did you know I had a thought
and it's me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
