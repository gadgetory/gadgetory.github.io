here and I've started putting together
the parts for my white and green build
which I you know I'm terrible at come up
with names for these things I'm thinking
something like a project peppermint or
something like that I don't know that's
kind of cheesy but whatever the case may
be I'll be taking the opportunity when I
build this system here to do a few like
how-to videos especially when it comes
to water cooling because I mentioned in
the last video that we just don't have
enough water cooling stuff this summer
so one of the things that we're going to
be doing obviously is water cooling the
graphics card that's going inside this
unit so even though I have done a one or
two of these in the past I thought this
would be a perfect opportunity to do
another how-to video on how to install
your ek water blocks graphics card water
block now it does pretty much apply to
most graphics card blocks on the market
some of the you know instructions are
going to vary a little bit based on the
block but anyway you get a general idea
of how easy it is to actually do this so
you guys will feel a little less scared
and daunting it at doing this because
really it's not hard at all in fact you
I'm going to do this video you guys are
gonna realize how easy it is and you're
going to be like we need to watch J this
stuff is easy enough don't do that
the octane gaming gear combo from
Coolermaster features seven backlighting
colors turbo mode a vago 3050 optical
sensor along with four levels of dpi
adjustment now you can po noobs without
boning your wallet click the link in the
description to learn more ok so what
we're going to do now is we're going to
go ahead I'm gonna take the camera angle
I'm going to push it down into kind of
the workspace here and show you guys how
I install these water blocks of tools
that I use and like I said just show you
guys it's not hard it's not hard at all
it's really easy I think people get a
little bit scared at the idea of taking
their coolers off their graphics cards
because they think these things are
extremely fragile and they're gonna
they're gonna break it if they breathe
on it the wrong way and that's just not
the case so let's just go ahead and stop
talking and let's go ahead and do it now
no making fun of my cycling tan line it
hurts my feelings and it makes me sad no
in all seriousness I don't care anyway
there are three general tools that I
pretty much use when I do these jobs
I've shown this before a million times
I've had this stupid little husky 6 in-1
or whatever they're called screwdriver
for quite a while it's got a big
Phillips and a big flat head on either
side plus a 6 mil in an 8 mil driver bit
you're gonna need some scissors and
you're getting the anti-static workspace
now I've been using this thing now for a
couple of years this is a CM Storm Power
rx mousepad but it's a rubbered surface
and so it's a perfect anti-static
surface because it's not going to
generate static as opposed to working on
carpet or maybe a cloth match or
something I like to use this guy that's
why it's all beat up I've been using
this as my workspace for quite a while
now we are using the e KFC Titan X block
which works on Titan X as well as 980ti
this is the nickel plexi version now
this is not the full-length water block
like you would see right here on my 980
this is one of the nine 80s that came
out of skunk works and you can see the
full-length water block comes all the
way to the end of the card but this guy
right here is only going to come to
about right here it's not going to do
the entire length of the card which is
going to make the card a little bit
lighter overall plus it's in the nickel
plexi so it's going to be see-through
you'll be able to see the coolant and
it's going to look really really nice
now optionally
the back plates do not come with the
blocks so of course I do have a back
plate and this is the nickel-plated back
plate I think it's going to look real
nice especially in this system being so
reflective and of course you need your
graphics card now before you start
taking this thing apart or doing
anything on this just go ahead and set
it aside and open up your water block
packaging and get familiar with the
instructions I know we guys like to be
like we don't need instructions we can
just look at it and figure it all out on
our own well you know that can be a
costly mistake if you don't pay
attention to what you're doing so I
suggest you eat a little bit of your
pride and you read the instructions
inside the box to find a packaging of
hardware a number of who checked it as
well as some thermal compound now this
thermal compound is important because it
is non conductive so you're going to
want to use the compound that comes with
the card I've been using it all along
I've never had any issues whatsoever
you're going to have some pre-cut and
some non pre-cut thermal pads on here
this is going to be for all your RAM
chips and then you've got your
instructions and of course you've got a
beautiful piece of hardware itself the
waterblock now that we're ready to start
taking apart the graphics card I take
note of where all the screws are you
don't want to miss any of these screws
and try and take the thing apart because
you could damage the board that way you
could over bend it could crack it could
break a lead something so you're always
going to have four main screws right
here surrounding the GPU with Springs on
them these are the four main screws that
are actually holding the cooler to the
GPU die I tend to personally start with
those but again you're just going to
want to make sure you get all of the
screws out now in nvidia graphics cards
there's also two screws right here in
the right here in the front of the
graphics card that are holding the
cooler don't forget these two guys right
here i've seen how many times people
forget these and they start trying to
yank their cooler out and they cause
damage because they get didn't get these
two main screws now don't confuse those
two with the three smaller ones on here
the three smaller ones on this card are
actually holding the display ports and
the HDMI to the card itself so you don't
want to undo those
it's kind of nice and NVIDIA started
using Phillips screws on these there was
a while there where they used hex head I
don't know if that was just to try and
deter people without hex head
screwdrivers from being able to take
apart their cards but I think now that
water cooling has become so much more
mainstream a lot of companies are
actually including Nvidia are starting
to become much more friendly with
allowing people to water cool their
cards without even voiding warranty so
that's always nice
you
alright once you've double-checked that
you've gotten all your screws out
- from the front as well as everything
on the back of the PCB this is a part
right here you want to be gentle because
you do have cured thermal compound on on
the actual heatsink itself which is
going to become like a glue once it's
you know completely cured as well as all
of the thermal pads on each one of the
GPU vram chips as well as the VRMs back
here so those all are sticky and it's
going to make it feel like the card
isn't coming apart if it's not coming
apart and you try and try and try you
twisted and you've rotated and you can't
get it to come off then you want to make
sure that you didn't miss any screws but
if you're confident that you didn't miss
any screws then all you got to do here
is I tend to start from the back and
just kind of do a little wiggle yes
there's going to be a little flex in the
card don't want to freak you out and
then it will come apart now don't just
yank the card apart because as you can
see you've got two plugs in the back
you've got one for the LED and one for
the fan so you're going to want to be
very gentle when you unplug these that
way you can use them again if you need
to in the future if you want to put this
thing back to stock so you want to make
sure that you don't break any of those
wires so here is the naked graphics card
it's actually not too big huh people
seem to think graphics cards are so much
bigger than they are because the size of
the cooler adds but for now go ahead and
set that aside and we don't want to lose
any of these screws so we're just going
to go ahead and put all of these screws
back where they go in the in the actual
cooler stock cooler that way if you ever
need to put this thing back to stock
even if you have these things sitting in
a ziplock bag or something you could
still lose that bag but if you screw
them all back into their respective
slots you'll know where they go and
you'll know where they are as long as
you don't lose your cooler if you lose
your cooler well then you're kind of
you're kind of ass out of luck I guess
you would go into some forums trying to
find somebody someone I used one time I
guess I forgot to mention you're going
to probably need some rubbing alcohol as
well as a microfiber cloth or a coffee
filter or something that's non fibrous
even though microfiber says fibers I I
use it because we need to clean off all
this old thermal paste right here so
just take some isopropyl alcohol
anything 70% or higher and just get off
all of that old rubbing comp or that old
thermal paste on there now it's not
important that you get down in all these
prax and all of the different traces
that are around the GPU I just like to
do it because when you put on the new
block inevitably it's going to get down
in those crevices so it just keeps there
from being too much build up on there
but that's it we've now got a nice clean
GM 200 chip here ready to receive a nice
water block now what you can do - and I
do highly recommend is just take a
little bit of alcohol to the top of each
one of the RAM chips because it did have
that heat pad on there or that thermal
pad on there which has a little bit of
grease on it which will make the new
thermal pads a little bit hard to stick
on they won't actually stick to the
chips if they've got any of that residue
that's left on there because it makes
them slick so once everything is nice
and clean pretty much what we're going
to do now is go ahead and get the block
ready to install now this next part here
you're going to need the instructions
because we have to know where to put all
the thermal pads now all the pre-cut
pads are going to go on the RAM chips
that are surrounding the GPU and the
ones that are not pre-cut you'll have to
cut to length to put on the VRMs now pay
attention to the instructions they tell
you which pads go where and it is
different per cards you're going to have
to look at your instructions and not
just look at this video so we're going
to go ahead and do that now
now an easy trick that you can do to
figure out what you need to cut and
where is the thermal pad material is
actually pretty soft so if you take it
and you put it on top of the chokes or
anything that you need to actually cut
and get an outline on you can kind of
get an imprint on there
of where you would need to cut so now
you guys can see you can do I can just
cut a strip based on where these are
actually indented right there and if the
camera actually picks that up but now I
know exactly what size I need to cut it
alright so this is the most
controversial part of the video every
single time I make it and that is the
application of the thermal interface
material now you want to be careful when
you're using their little applicator
thingy because it tends to just kind of
like shoot out huh anyway so you're
going to want to be a little bit careful
maybe start it somewhere on a piece of
paper and then once it's flowing you can
its unstuck I should say this little
syringe kind of get stuck now they
recommend an X as well as a plus type of
a pattern on their GPU now I'm going to
trust ek over all of the armchair
quarterbacks on the internet because
they're the ones who made it so they're
the guys who I trust if you don't want
to do it their way then do it your way
it's all there is to it I know why this
has to be such a big o debate and I know
this looks like an awful lot of compound
it kind of is but you really do want it
to fill the entire die because unlike a
CPU which has a heat spreader that shiny
part is the GPU so you want every bit of
that covered and it is going to run over
the sides and into that channel around
the GPU and that's fine because it's non
conductive but you do want every bit of
that shiny part covered once it
compresses and actually spreads out now
for this next part I like to take the
box and set it underneath the GPU like
this because now when you take the block
and you actually apply it you'll find
you'll see that the actual I Oh or the
the display mechanism here whatever you
call that it
taller than the graphics card so when
you flip it upside down this would just
plop off but if you take the box you can
hang that part off the edge of the box
and you can keep the card nice and flat
so that as you are installing all of
your screws then you're not going to
have any issues with the block wanting
to fall off so now go ahead and dump out
your little baggy of bits here don't
lose any of them though that would make
for a bad day and follow the
instructions when it comes to putting
everything together now I am going to
start with the four main screws that
surround the GPU just like we took them
off we're going to put everything back
together pretty much in a reverse order
and make sure you use these little
rubber are these little plastic
standoffs there as well because those
are going to be giving you protection
for your boards you don't actually break
or crunch anything now also make sure
you don't over tighten this remember the
block is made out of copper which is a
soft metal and the standoffs are made of
steel so you can't easily strip those
out these don't need to be super tight
this isn't a car you don't have to
torque them down to inch pounds or
anything like that just get them snug
now the cool thing about the ek back
plate if you look at the instructions is
even though this is not a Titan X so I
don't need to put on any of the
standoffs or the chips it does actually
provide some cooling to the back of the
GPU socket as you can see right here we
are going to be putting in a thermal pad
right behind the GPU die as well as the
backside of the vrm so we are going to
be transferring some heat to this plate
so that we have a bigger surface area to
carry away some of that heat so this is
why the debate of whether or not back
plates actually do anything for cooling
really depends on the way it's applied
to the back of the GPU if they're just
stuck on there with screws and they're
not touching anything on the back then
they're not offering any cooling benefit
whatsoever but the nice thing about ek
back place is they actually do offer
some cooling benefit now what you can do
right now before we get to the back
plate is just kind of hold it up to your
graphics card and you can see which
screws are actually going to be used
through the back plate right here so you
can just kind of go okay well these two
screws I can go ahead and put in there
these guys right here I can go ahead and
put in there
and then the other ones are going to be
screwed through the backplate now these
two screws up here in the front actually
you're going to use the longer screws
that come with the ek kit because they
are going to be using a nut to actually
hold them together because the block
doesn't come over that far but it does
come with these with these little nuts
nuts and you're going to just screw
those together and they're going to
squeeze together to hold the front plate
together to the graphics card otherwise
the whole graphics card would just kind
of flop around so you're going to do
that for both of the two farthest
forward screws at least for the 980ti
remember guys your applications may vary
ok so if you weren't doing a back plate
then you would just go ahead and do
these last two or last four screws here
and then you would be done but of course
we are doing a back plate so we're going
to do now is we're going to apply the
thermal pads to the back of the inside
of the back plate here and then we will
screw it on and then we'll be done
I'm a little disappointed in the way
that when you do this square here that
you have to actually cut two pieces to
make it fit because ek used to give you
a square that was pre-cut to fit in
there lately they've been kind of
cutting that corner and not doing that
for you so that's kind of unfortunate
but other than that I mean I guess it's
not it's not too bad so we also we're
going to need to put a strip of one
millimeter right here on this guy now
the hardware that came with your back
plate is the hardware that you're going
to use on the back they're not the same
screws as you can see these are sort of
a stainless steel they're entirely
different in fact they give you more
than you even need but hey that's good
right so we're going to do is we're just
going to push these through and we are
not going to tighten these down until we
get all of the screws into all of the
holes for the same reason I mentioned
earlier now two of these on the back
here actually I need to mention are
going to be very similar to the front
where I mentioned that we have the the
nuts that go through there's going to be
a couple longer screws that are going to
go in the back here as you can see maybe
you can't but they provided two nuts
that go on the back as fun to say
it give you two nuts that go on the back
and that's where those these these nuts
are here going to go with the longer
screws well there she is
one gtx 980 with a brand new EK nickel
waterblock on there last thing to do is
take off the little protective films on
the ek logo and installer in your brand
new or maybe it's not brand new but your
new water-cooled graphics card into your
PC well there you go guys it makes a
little bit of a mess behind me as you
can see but then you end up with one
sexy-ass graphics card I really like the
way that the nickel water block or the
back plate looks on this thing
especially when you have a white build
like I'm doing unfortunately it shows
fingerprints and stuff really badly I
have to clean this off but yeah I think
it looks freakin amazing look at that
Oh like a signal airplanes with this
thing alright guys well there you go let
me know what other how-to you'd like to
see we will do some more how to's with
this build behind me as it's going
together anyways thanks for watching
guys and as always we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
