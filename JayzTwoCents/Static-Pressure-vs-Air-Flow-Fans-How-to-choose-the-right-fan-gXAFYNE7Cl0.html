as you know I'm a little bit of a
water-cooling elitists are probably just
downright snob now there's a lot of
things I've covered on this channel I've
covered water cooling radiators we
talked about pumps dual pumps SLI
configs talked about parallel configs
we've done a lot of things when it comes
to water cooling but there's one thing
that I've not talked about a whole lot
and it really seems to be tripping a lot
of you up when it comes to part
selections when putting together your
custom water cooling kits that's right
guys today we are going to talk about
fans specifically airflow versus static
pressure now there's a lot of different
specs when it comes to fans and I don't
want to freak you guys out and have you
guys at the end of this video be like oh
my god up so much more confusing when we
started I don't know what fans to buy
this whole thing is stupid
I'll be honest there was a time when I
was there and I just didn't know what
fans to buy because there are probably
more fan combinations on the market than
any other component combination you can
think of so that's why today I'm going
to simplify this and we are only going
to talk about static pressure versus
airflow because pretty much that's all
you need to know now of course in terms
of the big picture there are a lot of
stats that play a part in this amperes
Watts voltage RPMs motor bearing type
sleeve bearings fluid bearings I mean
there's a lot of different things to
talk about when it comes to fans so I'm
really going to try and focus today
simply on airflow versus static pressure
that seems to be the part most people
get tripped up on when it comes to
picking their parts now I've got three
fans in front of me I've got the cooler
master jet flow 120 I've got the phobia
nbe loop this is pretty much a noise
blocker rebrand it's the same exact fan
and then we have got the Corsair SP 120
now this is the fan right here that I
blame for all of your confusion and mine
in the past
you see Corsair came out with the stands
a couple of years ago and they were bold
enough to brand them specifically based
on their optimization SP 120 s being
static pressure and AF 140 s being air
flow now when it comes to air flow and
static pressure let's talk about what
that means air flow is the amount of air
that
is capable of being moved by the fan
blades at maximum RPM in an open and air
environment that means no restrictions
either behind or in front of the fan
it's the fan is just free to move all
the air that it can and the only thing
stopping it is the atmospheric pressure
that is it static pressure means you
take that same figure but it's also the
amount of resistance it's able to push
through or the amount of torque if you
will of the fan to be able to move that
air when resistance is introduced
now what fan should you use and how do
you know where to use them well if we're
talking about chassis fans specifically
the arc XL behind me we'll use that as
an example if you have hard drive cages
right in front of those intake fans
let's face it a lot of systems do that a
lot of cases do that where you have the
fans are right there in the boom there's
a hard drive cage right against those
you've got like a quarter of an inch and
some slats for air to go through that's
a situation where I would personally
recommend going with an SP fan in fact
those are the fans I ran in my 900 D
because I had the hard drive cages right
in front of it but if you've got an
open-air case or you've got hard drives
that can be relocated so you have a nice
open environment I definitely recommend
going with some sort of an airflow
optimized fan or in this case here the
MBE loop but we'll come back to this one
here because this is a little bit of a
unique fan it's a little bit more of a
hybrid but the open air performance of
something like the jet flow 120 s would
certainly be more optimal in a chassis
environment than an SP fan would now if
you're talking about heatsink towers or
radiators where you've got all those
tiny little fins to push through then
it's definitely more optimized to put
some sort of an aesthetic pressure fan
okay now we've talked about where you
put them let's go ahead and talk about
what makes a static pressure fan a
static pressure and an airflow fan and
air flow now yes static pressures of
course have air flow we already talked
about that but what makes them different
is right here this the it's it's this
it's the blades the blades make all the
difference if you were to pop this blade
off and put an airflow blade on there it
changes the entire dynamic of the fan
regardless of what the motor specs are
and with that said it's the closed off
narrow gaps between these static
pressure optimized fans that make them
static pressure
optimised as the air goes through these
fans these blades as they're turning
they have nowhere to go but through the
fan now there is a drawback to static
pressure fans and that is that on the
backside of the fan or the exhausting
side of the fan the air tends to come
out at a much wider degree and see if I
can do this the air out of this fan
would come out more like this rather
than being very channel like that now
that would also mean that the air that's
coming off the sides of these fans are
very very pressure optimized but it also
means the very center portion of the fan
is not going to be quite as high
pressure as the outside there's a little
bit of trade-off when it comes to the
blade design of course there are other
blade designs that try and make up for
that that's where all the fans differ is
in their blade design on the eat eel
oops right here you can see they also
have that very narrow spacing between
the blades but this particular fan also
has a scoop on the side that eliminates
the amount of air that gets lost coming
out of the edges of the fan and tries to
redirect them more straight now when it
comes to the airflow approach you could
just do like coolermaster does and have
these massive gaps I mean I can stick my
finger straight through there not in a
in a dirty dirty sense but the idea here
is that as the fan blades are turning
and is creation creating this pressure
zone where the air is able to travel
straight through the fan and you get a
much more directional airflow now that's
what makes this fan right here pretty
good in a in a pressure optimized or an
airflow optimized scenario the
difference is you sometimes need to
really crank up the RPMs when you stick
these on a radiator in order to get the
airflow through all of the thin
resistance I know it seems like I threw
a lot of information at you guys but
here's the bottom line if you're putting
case fans in a case go with something
that's airflow optimized on the exhaust
side and if you're going with something
that has a lot of hard drive cages or
resistance in the front you definitely
are going to want to go with static
pressure when it comes to cooling towers
and radiators I always recommend static
pressure now the static pressure rating
is always measured in mmh - oh you don't
even need to bother yourself with what
that means just know the higher the
number the higher the static pressure
but the next thing you want to concern
yourself with is the RPM at which the
fans are producing those specs some fans
ramped up to 2500 3000 rpms to get the
same specs as fans that are running at
half the speed the higher the RPM the
higher the noise so guys I'm going to go
ahead and get the heck on out of here
this was just kind of a brief discussion
on static pressure versus air flow and I
hope it's helped answer some of your
questions put your questions down in the
comments I will do the best I can to
answer those and guess what I got a
nifty little check mark next to my name
now that's pretty freaking cool I guess
that means I'm verified on YouTube after
106 thousand subscribers YouTube finally
believes I am Who I am so if you guys
see any comments from anybody that
doesn't have the little check mark it
ain't me just doing it I get the heck on
out of here guys as always I appreciate
all of your support
especially during this fundraiser
campaign for CES I love you guys for it
continue to bring the best content that
I possibly can regardless about anything
turns out with that campaign and I'm
gonna go ahead and get the hell on out
of here so go buy some fans buy the
right fans the ones that work for you
and don't break the budget whatever that
budget may be see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
