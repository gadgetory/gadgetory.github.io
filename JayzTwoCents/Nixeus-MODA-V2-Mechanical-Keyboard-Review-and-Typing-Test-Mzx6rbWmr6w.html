at a keyboard here mechanical keyboard
from Nick CS which is the same brand
that also makes AMD freesync panels now
granted it's not as cheap as say a
membrane keyboard but it is a lot
cheaper than other mechanical keyboards
on the market so we're gonna see how it
stacks up and if it does stack up then
maybe we'll find some use for it around
here or something but other than that
guys we're gonna check out the cattle
keyboards today to see if it's even
worth you know your money and stuff it's
kind of the point
usually the mastercase 5 and mastercase
5 pro from Coolermaster combines
modularity with creativity giving you
the freedom to build it your way make it
yours by clicking the link down in the
description now mechanical keyboards
they're they're kind of a funny oddity
if you will and the reason for that was
back in the 80s that's all that existed
were mechanical keyboards membranes and
the PCB keyboard as you know it today
didn't really exist then they were
individual switches under each key that
sent the signal to the computer to say
the a key was pressed or the Y key was
pressed or enter or whatever the people
also complained back in office spaces
and stuff then these keyboards are way
too noisy which gave birth to the rubber
dome membrane style keyboard well the
reason why I say mechanical keyboards
are kind of funny is we as people are
fickle
especially the enthusiasts and the gamer
because most people now are like screw
membrane we want mechanical and it's
kind of like you know how fashion makes
a big circle over what is it every 20 or
30 years fashion kind of recycles itself
which is why we're now starting to see a
lot of dudes with long hair like girls
and stuff kind of like they had back in
the 70s yeah we're going full circle
again here especially with keyboards so
this is the Nick seus Moda v2 it is a
mechanical keyboard and it features Cale
switches now that's kind of the first
thing you noticed between companies that
are trying to save a little bit of money
to make things more affordable is
they're not going with cherry switches
they're going with kale
now kales can actually interact with
cherry keycaps because they use the
exact same style of key cap holder
mechanism if you will they just simply
pop right off you can actually put
cherry key caps on there without any
problems whatsoever now it is a very No
keyboard as you can see right here there
is no 10 key whatsoever
there's no macro keys on here whatsoever
it's not even backlit no a lot of people
especially myself like that lit backlit
keyboards but there's a lot of people
that have spoken up in some of my
peripheral reviews and said Jay we don't
like backlit keyboards I don't
understand why companies keep making
backlighting now there's people out
there that don't care for that so that's
exactly what this is kind of tailored
towards now it's got all the standard
features that you would expect for a
mechanical gaming mechanical keyboard
that is also good enough for gaming I
keep saying gaming keyboard it's really
not even branded as gaming it's just
branded as mechanical and it's got three
color options from kale red brown and
blue which pretty much do mimic the same
feel and weight of their cherry
counterparts are much more expensive
German cherry counterparts kale are made
in China it has a three year limited
warranty free tech support and key role
over all the sort of stuff that you'd
expect including a Windows gamer lock
which is kind of neat because you know
bumping Windows key when you meant to
hit croucher alt and getting kicked out
of your game is super annoying now it's
got a fairly long rubberized cable but
it doesn't seem to really get tangled
it's kind of thick you do have multiple
routing here as I'm bumping keys in the
keyboard you have multiple routes in the
bottom of the keyboard so it can go
straight out or either side big rubber
feet on the bottom so it's not gonna
slide around as long as well as big
giant rubberized feet that pop out on
the bottom so you can get as you can see
I mean that's that's not sliding as you
can see you push that thing it just how
that hurts it's not going anywhere which
is kind of nice and then you get a nice
you know tilted upright
typing angle if that's what you want as
well and I tend to like my keyboards
that way but also it does have function
buttons on there with IQ multimedia keys
play pause rewind fast-forward volume up
volume down mute in that sort of stuff
now in terms of durability this thing is
pretty weighty because it's got a steel
reinforced plate on the top where all
the switches connect to so you're not
gonna be able to twist this thing it
makes no creaking sound when you twist
it what you are hearing is my hands slip
on it oh yeah it feels like it's a
quality piece the only question I have
is how do the Cale switches really stack
up well I've already use this thing for
a little bit in fact it's got
those scratches on it because I I'm a
little clumsy at times but for the most
part all the switches feel pretty
uniform in fact I'll go ahead and do a
quick typing test here so that you guys
can hear the way it sounds the problem I
have with Cale switches though as a few
of them feel onion where cherries are
very very very high-quality they're also
pretty expensive for manufacturers to
use but anyway some of them feel like
they're a little firmer than others and
some of them downright make a spring
kind of a springy sound in there which
is not something you would ever hear
from a cherry switch but anyway it's
going to do a typing test here I'll do
the best I can to make it so you guys
can hear it I'm using a lav mic so
that's the distance we'll be using right
here but I guess it makes sense
considering my mic is fairly close to my
ears and it's gonna give you a good
sense of how things would sound remember
these are the brown variants here so
they have the same type of feel as at
Brown which is going to be a smooth
linear action with a tactile bump it's
not going to have a click click would be
like a blue and then red has no bump
whatsoever in fact I even did a video if
you guys look all about mechanical
switches I explained the different feels
and stuff
really old video of mine but still
relevant today alright so let's go ahead
and just type something
so I typed this is me typing on my new
keyboard from Nick seus this isn't so
bad but I'm thinking that some of the
keys are not feeling as uniform as I
would like it's okay though it could be
worse I suppose it's better than typing
on a membrane keyboard in my opinion but
there are a few keys on here like I said
they're a little bit noisy allow me to
demonstrate here's the X key which
sounds perfectly normal now here's the Z
key and a few of these keys make this
sound listen to the spring now for
contrast here's the X so you've got your
little tactile bump in there and then
you can hear the key bottoming out but
now listen again to the Z and listen to
the spring in there you can actually
hear the spring kind of clinging around
so that gets a little bit annoying and
there's a few keys like three or four of
them on this keyboard that are actually
doing that but again like I said they
are kale so there is going to be a
little bit of a quality variant there on
the Chinese switch versus the German
switch and one thing to mention before I
get out of here too is they do include a
few other switches now usually gaming
keyboards will give you like WASD switch
replacements so that you can feel them a
little bit better a little bit different
texture on there sometimes even give you
a number okie replacements like Corsair
started that with the red keys on the
k-series keyboards but they do include
in here a key cat puller and they give
you Mac keys I guess they assume that a
lot of people might be using these on
Macs you you can get the command key
that's going to replace I I guess you
got the option key here which I think is
what we're places the windows key and
then to command keys to replace what I
believe is control on Mac keyboards made
a long time something used in Mac it's
kind of neat if you are looking at
getting this for say a Mac or MacBook
Pro or something like that then you
can't take out the window specific keys
and change them out with Mac Keys I mean
it's kind of neat I don't know if I've
seen anyone else actually include that
with their mechanical keyboards probably
I'm just an idiot and don't know but I
haven't seen it anyway guys I thought
I'd bring you this quick video here to
kind of show you the Nick seus keyboard
a few people have asked me how I feel
about this keyboard because it's not a
brand that's is well-known as say
leaking a Corsair or Coolermaster you
know cm storm or even asus is getting
into the keyboard mix now so anyway tell
me what you guys think about this
keyboard the fact that it's not backlit
I hope that the imprinting on the top of
the keys will last longer you know
sometimes we have backlit keyboards and
you have that translucent part of the
key the paint around it starts to chip
off and it starts to look really really
bad hopefully as you can see I was
typing all over there hopefully this one
will last a bit longer in terms of
construction it's fantastic I just would
have personally liked to see a cherry
switch I don't know how much more it
would have cost but anyway you guys can
also check it out on Amazon at the time
of doing this video you can get them for
$69.99 on Amazon Prime if I could put a
link in the description weird enough the
brown switch costs more it's 74 dollars
for the Browns with just five dollars
more and I understand why that is maybe
it's just a supply and demand thing
anyway guys time to get the heck on out
of here if you'd have some other
peripherals you think I should check out
let me know I I'm not that super picky
with my peripherals I have my favorite
Mouse which happens to be a CM storm
Reaper Mouse not even available anymore
by far the best Mouse I've ever used I
don't know why they discontinued that
but I turned down peripheral views all
the time because I don't know I don't
think they're that interesting but if
you guys think there's something out
there that I'm overlooking and I should
look at make sure you let me know over
on Twitter or Facebook or something like
that maybe guys thanks for watching as
always I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
