going to take a look at a new laptop now
before you start saying blah blah blah
is just another laptop who cares it's
overpriced piece of junk I get it I get
it I hear you guys I've got massive
desktops myself and I've said it before
these exist for a reason laptops are
part of our world they're not going
anywhere
laptops are getting better than ever
because of the efficiency and the power
of the components we have today that was
proven with the GT 73 VR Titan we looked
at a couple months ago with a GTX 1080
in there and a quad-core i7 with
hyper-threading and what was the 64 gigs
of RAM something or ridiculous like that
I don't remember but this is a little
bit more reasonable now I've had this
for the last couple of months and Nick
has been using it for the last several
weeks as his primary laptop you've been
carrying around us well you already
graduated but you were taking it like to
my house to here playing games on it
editing pictures you don't some photo
editing on this a couple edits okay well
anyway this guy right here is still a
17.3 inch laptop but look at the form
factor of this look at the footprint it
is extremely thin coming in at just
about an inch at its thickest point but
in other ways 5.9 pounds now I know that
still sounds kind of heavy when you
compare it to things like a MacBook Air
and whatnot but when you look at what
this can do and what's in there and it
maintains a 17.3 inch panel if that wait
that's actually pretty amazing and it is
a full metal construction it's a metal
body brushed aluminum to be exact
unfortunately it's a fingerprint magnet
so like as I do that you know it's the
fingerprints get pretty bad but anyway
that's minor just keep a microfiber
mirror behind I guess now I'm going to
run through the specs quickly I don't
spend a lot of time on the specs I want
to spend time with gaming on this and
doing some stuff to kind of show really
what it's like using this thing now this
version right here is actually seventh
gen Intel Core i7 so it's a 7700 HK
you'll see 6700 HK as advertised but if
this is a 7700 HK it's got 16 gigabytes
to 8m sticks ddr4 2400 it's got a gtx
1066 gigabyte the panel as i meant
17.3 inch 1080p 120 hertz 5 millisecond
94% NTSC panel so although the color
gamut is not quite as accurate or as
wide as we would like it still is
perfect for middle ground of content
creators productivity and gaming hard
drive wise it's got a 256 gigabyte SSD
you can order them I believe with a 512
and it has a one terabyte 5400 rpm hard
drive what I've liked to have seen a
7200 rpm in there that's more or less
for like mass storage 256 gigabyte SSD
will fill up very quickly especially
with how big games are today what's
Ghost Recon like seventy-nine gigabytes
yeah it's like 79 gigs so when you open
it up and you look inside right here you
can see we saw a brushed aluminum finish
on the inside surrounding the keyboard
we've got our trackpad here which is
lined up with the spacebar which is kind
of nice sometimes when they're in the
middle it's kind of weird because that's
not like where your hand is if you come
straight down and you can use the
trackpad that's kind of nice a keyboard
is actually a SteelSeries keyboards a
membrane keyboard individual LED
backlighting so you can customize the
lighting profile to whatever you want to
be but the throw on there is really nice
too it's about a three millimeter throw
which gives it a very mechanical type of
feel because it's very positive when you
push it you got a real good feedback
from the key it's not mushy and sloppy
like a lot of keyboards are so it's
actually a decent typing experience I
personally hate typing on laptops but as
you don't have a problem typing on this
it's not that bad at all obviously is no
optical drive I think a lot of laptop
companies have done away with obstacle
drives I haven't seen a laptop with an
optical and a while least not ones that
I've got my hands on now let's do this
let's fire it up let's play some games I
mean I know like when it comes to
traveling professional editing and all
that stuff it can do it obviously but we
care about the games right do it
are you coming so this is the msi dragon
center and this is like a dashboard
where you can control all the different
things happening with your laptop when
it comes pre bundled and most of the
time I'm not cool with dashboard apps
like this but this one's actually pretty
good you've got a system monitor you can
see what's happening temperatures you
can see what's happening with your fan
speeds how much memory you're using the
LED wizard allows you to change your LED
backlighting or your keyboard as we
mentioned system tuner this one does not
actually have unlocked overclocking for
things like your CPU and your GPU
however on one laptops I do support it
this is where you would do it but you
could change your fan profile here your
shift mode that's basically like your
CPU power profile now the other side
true color is where you can control the
color profile for your panel for
different scenarios now remember this is
not an IPS panel so the colors are not
going to be as accurate so 94% color
accuracy on this but if you see designer
mode it turns a brightness way down holy
crap you can turn that back up so you
got designer mode you've got your srgb
modes to your like your your color gamut
anti blue mode keeps turning the breaks
all the way down that's crazy
gamer mode did you do this give me some
of this a little weird anyway office
mode movie mode but yeah there's s well
put it in gamer mode cuz you know I
don't want to be gamer looks like it'd
take a lot of cut with the contrast out
there that looks very flat so this is
the heaven benchmark you can see were
King Wow 123 ish fps right there's
boosted up to nineteen hundred and
eleven megahertz temperatures currently
at 65 we'll let this run for a minute
and see that the temps kind of equalize
at 61 fps there so yeah this is 1080p
right now with Ultra settings
tessellation on normal and 4x msaa four
times MSAA that's a lot to ask out of a
GTX 1060 but yeah it looks like our
temperatures are hovering just under 70
so Hitler will let this run for a minute
and we'll let go and knock another loop
or two and then we'll see if the temps
are
so it seems like we've kind of equalized
right around 75 see now that's not bad
at all for a laptop obviously I was
especially with this thing then form
factor but here's what it sounds like
it's a little bit on the noisier side
but I mean you do have to give up
something obviously when you do laptop
camming I've got a shotgun mic literally
out of frame right here so you can touch
it
there we go a lot more turning speakers
up a little bit right here I want you
guys to kind of hear the pitch of the
fans in this so you can kind of get an
idea of what they sound like so we'll do
that now our original go through recon
here it's a game that is definitely not
as optimized as it could be but it's
still a very good benchmark of how
strong your hardware is so here we are
in Ghost recons you can see we're
sitting about 63 FPS our current
settings are set to high such a high
preset I don't think that's unreasonable
for a game like this I feel like asking
a laptop to play Ghost Recon on high
setting is actually a lot to ask of any
laptop I like to make wheelie oh God
ah ok oh he wants to play
nope yeah
so that 58 right now with all this
vegetation no complaints here boom yeah
yeah that was very tacked to cool this
game is so pretty I've heard some people
say they don't think this game looks
very good I think they're okay I'm out
here whoo well she forgot the tree whoa
spiral of death death spiral
I think Ghost Recon is definitely no
problem for this okay so earlier I
called this in 7700 HK my bad especially
at 7700 HQ we got a 725 score on the
first run I'm just doing this one more
time for redundancy to see if we get
some pretty consistent scores in this
looking for like thermal throttling or
anything like that but so far the
temperatures have been kept really cool
now the CPU sticks right around 65 C and
the graphics card never got any hotter
than 70 60 when gaming so that's
definitely not bad for a thin laptop
like this and our second round with 706
is slowed down a little bit but take
still not bad for a laptop save our
score there so anyway let's go and talk
about this and see what my final
thoughts are I'm gonna say this first of
all you've got to give them credit for
the amount of hardware they've been able
to put into this machine and the form
factor and footprint they were able to
maintain I mean yeah it's a 17.3 inch
laptop but it doesn't really feel like
it because a lot of the 17.3 inch
screens on the on the market when you
close the lid they kind of extend out
like they go farther but this one's done
a really good job at having the hinge be
the extremity of the footprint so it's
actually not that bad something else
though that I really like about this
laptop is I think the GTX 1060 was a
perfect sweet spot in terms of discrete
GPU to give you good gaming performance
but while keeping costs down yeah I mean
obviously we'd all love to have 10 70s
and 10 80s in our laptops but then
obviously heat becomes an issue and
price obviously is going to go up quite
a bit because as I mentioned the
as it sits right now is about fifteen
hundred and forty-nine dollars
now you can spec it up obviously with
bigger SSDs in fact if you want to even
swap in your own SSD don't know what
that would do to your warranty but most
of you guys watching are very clever di
wires and you can do that with no
problems whatsoever but it's not perfect
there's a couple things I want to
mention one the brushed aluminum looks
nice but man is it a fingerprint magnet
that's why there's always a rag nearby
for the laptop I swear it you're just
constantly having to wipe off
fingerprints and it doesn't matter where
I was almost rubbing the skin off to see
if I could get enough skin oils off of
my hands to keep their from being any
fingerprint or oil transfer not
happening no matter what you look at
this laptop you think about touching
this laptop and fingerprints are going
to appear the other thing is obviously
it's noisy what I mean by that is the
fans have to spend very fast because
they're very thin fans and so they have
to spend fast to get enough airflow to
keep it cool now the temps are good and
you can obviously slow the fans down by
controlling the stand curve inside the
software I showed you but the trade-off
is going to be potentially more
temperature thermal throttling of the
GPU and the CPU as the temps go up so
it's a trade-off
just like desktops to the noise the
performance my other complaint is the
audio is not very good and instead of
having the speakers built into like the
bottom bezel here of the monitor where
they can fire at you or even at the top
of the keyboard or on the side of the
keyboard like a lot of brands do they
are actually down fire speakers on the
bottom of the front right there so if
you're putting this on your lap chances
are you're going to kind of cork off the
sound and it's going to sound extremely
muffled and the sound you do get when
you have it on a flat surface is
bouncing off of a table which gives it a
just not a very good sound so I'm
assuming that's a trade-off with the
form factor I don't know how easily they
could have made them fire up out of the
keyboard tray but nonetheless that is a
complaint of mine but other than that I
don't have many other things to say
about this that are that are negative I
know a lot of you guys hate laptops oh
you just hate the idea of a laptop and
you just feel like everyone should take
their desktop with them everywhere they
go and pack it up and wind up the cables
and throw it in your trunk and take it
to
anywhere your going to go but the bottom
line is these exist for a reason and I
think this is doing a very good job at
what it's meant to do give you a laptop
that can kind of do it all productivity
gaming and obviously portability which
is some things you sacrifice with the
the VR Titan anyway guys you tell me
what you think about this guy right here
while I wipe off the fingerprints which
is just destined and doomed to have for
the rest of its life
I think $1,500 although not cheap but
still isn't ridiculously expensive
you're getting a very well-rounded
laptop experience for both the traveling
professional and gamer so sound off in
the comments um what you guys think and
as always I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
