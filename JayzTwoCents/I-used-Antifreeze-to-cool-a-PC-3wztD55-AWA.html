up I'm frustrated and I don't want to
make this video it's also about a topic
I didn't even want to do every time I do
a water-cooling video there's always
those guys that think they're being
original by saying hey I had an idea use
any fries as a coin
well it's anything but an original idea
and it's also a bad one for a few
reasons which we'll talk about in this
video as well but we'll go ahead and
we'll go ahead and roll the little logo
first with its unique freeform modular
system the new master case maker 5 from
Coolermaster allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description ok this is anti-freeze now
what I have right here is a pre-mixed
50/50 antifreeze which means it's
already pre-mixed 50 percent with
distilled water so that means this is
actually little bit diluted in terms of
how strong it would be compared to
getting a dissapears gallon of
antifreeze that you would already have
to dilute so keep that in mind now there
are some disclaimers here on why you
shouldn't use antifreeze as a coolant
the first one being is this one is
ethylene glycol based and if you're
using a PE tgd tubing while the G stands
for glycol and you don't want to use
glycol-based coolants with PE TG tubing
you could have chemical reactions or
actually you will have chemical
reactions it's not a you may have you
will have the differences depending on
the mixture and how concentrated it is
and what type of coolant it is with the
other inhibitors that are in there it
could happen within as quickly as seven
days as some chemists say with a little
bit longer out in the future depending
on the the concentrate of your mixture
if you just pour straight up antifreeze
with no water in there it probably
happened a lot faster we will do another
video with the test where we take some
ptg put it in a jar with some some of
the antifreeze in it or maybe I'll just
cap off the ends and pour some in the
tube we can try that as well where we
see exactly what happens but that's not
the point today's video I've got a
prediction here well we'll get we'll get
coconut Lucky's prediction - I predict
the temperatures will be exactly the
same as what we're using over here
right now what do you think I think it's
gonna melt the stuff on the inside
what stuff the internals it's it's gonna
melt my my motor instead of the poem
that why would this with the glycol but
what I don't know K what's your
reasoning mind that though cuz the motor
steel
I like the blade there to wait huh okay
okay what no the d5 it's plastic but
it's not it's not glycol plastic okay
it's just like it's just like I think
FTP or even maybe an acetal I kind of
wanted to see catastrophic they there
you would I'm sorry
now before we can see whether or not it
actually works better or worse than bla
bla bla products we need a baseline now
this right here is the same exact fluid
that I have in skunk works right now
this is the newer generation of the
pastel fluid now what might look like
brown tubes here you can see the cool is
nice and green still just want to point
that out the the tubing is actually
discoloring because it's let's reuse
tubes I want to point that out it's
still nice and green but we do a
baseline here I've got a 59 30 K and
they're running at 4.4 gigahertz 4.38
effective because I believe the the bead
clock actually steps down to like ninety
nine point eight instead of being at a
hundred but anyway I digress it's not
important we are gonna go ahead and run
a stress test here on a 264 extreme for
ten minutes we're gonna record the
temperatures and then we will drain this
clean it put the Prestone in there and
then we'll see if it's any different so
I'm gonna go ahead and start the test
here see it's a trial version then like
we got no budget we're gonna budget for
this this this stuff right here was
already like 16 bucks before this way
over budget in this video so alright
yeah we're just gonna go ahead and start
the test
we'll come back in ten minutes okay so
we just ran ten minutes here on ADA
extreme here the temperatures 75 for the
CPU as a socket and then here are the
core temps I need to take a picture of
this too because I'll never forget but
74-61 76-66 74 and 62 that's quite the
swing but that's just how Intel works
also to keep in mind these temps seem
high for water we are stressing CPU FPU
and the cache so we are literally
hammering the CPU for everything it is
worth this is actually a stability
stress test not just
generating test so it also means that my
4.4 gigahertz clock is stable which I
already knew but there's our baseline
now we're gonna take the press tone
we're gonna clean out the system put
this in there and see how it does if it
doesn't do too badly I might leave it in
there for long term and see what happens
but then I'll come out and see it the
soft tubing melted and leaked everywhere
someday this is how I flush out my
systems here I always have a drain plug
connected to the lowest point of the
loop which in this case happens to be
where the pump is I take an empty jug
place it somewhere in this case is just
gonna go like that staircase holding
that down I will crack open the valve
slowly and as I start to take open take
off the lid here let some air in you can
see it starts to go down
now if I want to keep that from going
too low what happens now I'm just gonna
keep adding water to this and eventually
this will completely flush itself out
face the camera miss taking my tube is
flopping around here alright we are
pretty much empty with the exception of
a few drops cotton like a tube right
there or whatever and that's fine it's
just distilled water side note though
check this out
I noticed that like I mentioned earlier
the tubing was starting to look a little
Brown actually turned purple crazy never
really experienced that before like I
said I know the cool it didn't change
color cuz it stay clear in the thing
here but the tubing actually turned like
purple huh yeah I can just fix that by
going with purple fluid okay we need to
now make sure everything's tight we are
going to pour in our ethylene glycol
mixture might even call it antifreeze
we're gonna call it what it is that's
when glycol yeah biggest green I think
yep that's neon green
well yeah it's any freeze would you spit
well my name is pretty ink thick alien
oh that's likely
what does it do it's like off-gassing
what is happening there guys we're
getting some sort of a reaction here oh
dude you can actually see all the glycol
in it look at it zoom in on that yeah
you see this I'm taking a risk here now
like destroying an X 99 system for you
guys for the sake of science look at
that look at the reaction is that eating
away at the o-ring no but it's like
coming up from the bottom there yeah
that's weird let me go ahead and turn
this on real quick
wait what this flash me wants ever fear
is great dad okay that's crazy I was not
expecting that that's got to be the glee
at the link like hole okay dude you can
see it like right there it almost looks
like a gel it's crazy I don't know man
this feels very - idiot see like this is
a bad idea
I can't told you that I should make it
all the way from
now that's well it's aerated right now I
didn't put this thingy back in there oh
because I'm not entirely sure that this
like does anything other than restrict
their BP water flow it's supposed to be
a diffuser for these tiny bubbles I know
how well it works you can see the
bubbles moving around but whatever so
what do you think your five best
qualities are that you were into juice
juice ends media well you're hired
alright guys here we go it's up its
running we've got our any fries ethylene
glycol mix in there and we're gonna go
ahead and run the same test again and be
attempts with the same and has barely
gotten any colder in this room and we
are gonna run it for ten minutes and see
what happens so I've started it they did
not initially explode which is a good
thing the only difference to if I took
out this tube from inside there as I
showed I took up these internals on this
reservoir it was it's dumb there there
was dumb internals on this alpha cool
thing it works just fine without it it
doesn't for text so we're good today
we're going and just we're just gonna
let it go okay we're done it ran for ten
minutes and four seconds but anyway just
to kind of compare the temps I'll put
them up here side-by-side but here's
what they were our CPU temperature as a
package here reach 76 see previously
hits 75 guys all these temperatures are
plus or minus one or two so honestly it
went exactly as I thought it would right
I said that didn't I mean I said it
would be exactly the same as attempts
you saw before the question here is
longevity will it will it hold up I
would think it would it's designed to
handle extreme temperatures like in your
car the question is how is it going to
react to the different metals and the
different plastics that are in here not
so much the metals the metals in it says
right here at least this one here it's
got its corrosion inhibitors right
that's good we want that in our systems
but what's it gonna do the plastics
that's the big question I don't know
what happened to the soft tubing with
this stuff I'm kind of feel like I want
to just let go and see what happens but
then I don't feel like having it leak
and destroy the system anyway so anyway
this video was probably completely
pointless you guys keep asking me can
you use any freezes of coolant and the
answer is technically yeah but we also
proved you could use milk and you can
use orange juice and you can use
Gatorade
the question is for how long and what's
going to happen in the long run I don't
know I'm not willing to test it so this
video was entirely pointless thanks for
watching we'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
