well I've always wanted to be Paul's
hardware today's video is sponsored by
master of the largest Community commerce
platform in the world had to master up
today and suggest something to be
dropped not like literally drop but you
know where they bring the price down and
stuff hey what's going on guys Jase
$0.02 here and we're going to do a
review today but products sent over by
my friends over at mass drop and if you
like what you're going to see here today
then you can actually pick this up at a
discounted price over at mass drop and
there's a link down in the description
so make sure you guys check that out if
you're interested but today we're gonna
be looking at a peripheral we're looking
at the my onyx castor Mouse from well my
onyx now this mouse right here is
designed to be all about craftsmanship
it's all about high quality parts and a
mouse is one of those things where it's
very subjective so what I'm a like what
you may like and what someone else may
like probably are going to differ quite
a bit so I'm gonna do the best I can to
tell you about the specs of the mouse
I'm going to kind of do a little bit of
a live demo while doing some gaming and
see how it feels and then we'll just
kind of do the best we can to determine
whether or not this is a mouse you'd be
interested in now it's going to a DNS
3310 optical sensor in here adjustable
up to 10,000 dpi that's a bit overkill
for most people in fact at 10000 dpi
you'd have to move the mouse like a mile
to get it across the screen but in any
case you have adjustability up to ten
thousand dpi and it's adjustable in 50
steps so you have 50 steps of adjustment
in there it does have a built in ARM
processor it's a 32 megahertz
32-bit processor handling all the
processing on the mouse so all of your
profiles are going to be saved onto the
device all of your settings are be saved
onto the device so if you're switching
it between say desktop and laptop you're
not going to have to reset up all of
your setup your your settings it's going
to travel with the mouse now it's got
six fully programmable profiles in there
so you could switch different dpi
settings or profile settings depending
on the types of games that you're
playing so if you're switching between
like say an FPS or an MMORPG
or a MOBA those are going to all require
different types of mouse movements and
different types of twitch movements so
you can set up different
files based on the games that you're
playing now it does have a truly
economic design and it's actually
considered compatible with all three
cloth or grip types which is palm grip
claw grip and fingertip grip so the cool
thing about that is you don't have to
buy a mouse based on your particular
grip they've kind of got the the mouse
ergonomic design so that however you're
holding the mouse it's going to be
comfortable the sides of the mouse are
all soft rubber so you're not going to
have any slipping if you are gaming in a
hot environment or maybe you get sweaty
hands you maybe you get sweaty hands
when you're gaming so you're not going
to be losing any of your grip but it
also has eight sixteen point eight
million color adjustable two different
zones of LEDs in there so you can
control the custom colors on this thing
which is kind of a norm now it's
actually kind of weird now if you see an
LED lit mouse or keyboard or headset
that does not have RGB adjustable in
there that's kind of thing now so that's
what you're getting with it you can
adjust the colors in two different zones
to meet the you know the needs of what
you guys want for your color and there's
not much actually inside the package
you've got the mouse with its soft
paracord braided cable which is going to
keep it from getting bound up it's not
going to be stiff and you know one of
the things I hate about gaming mice is
if you're struggling with the cable and
the cables yanking back at you because
it's not bending or conforming with the
movement so as you can see here it's a
nice soft cable nice long cable to
actually that's going to allow easy
movement of the mouse now the mouse is
all black when it's powered off and
that's fantastic looking it's a very
stealthy matte black but when you power
it up the LEDs turn on and then the sexy
colors that you've set up are going to
show now the rubber on the side is going
to attract dust and things like that so
you're going to want to keep that clean
damp rag something that's non fibrous
otherwise this is going to build up a
lot of fiber in fact it has fiber on it
already and I haven't even used it you
do have nice what looks like
polyurethane feet on here to make things
nice and smooth when it comes to the
gaming surface that you're using and the
other cool thing with the software is it
has what it calls its surface analyzer
where it's going to give you our actual
feedback in a percentage a number on the
surface that you're particularly gaming
on so you know some surfaces especially
dark colored surfaces black tables glass
things like that don't work very well
with optical or
laser sensors sometimes you get no
feedback whatsoever and the mouse
doesn't work so if you're wondering
whether or not if your mouse is acting
kind of funky and you're not sure if
it's the surface you're on or not then
you can use the surface analyzer and
it'll tell you if the surface is a good
surface for the gaming or the movement
of the mouse so that's kind of neat it
gives you direct feedback now something
else that the caster has but just
becoming kind of a norm with high-end
gaming mice is the fact that it has
adjustable lift off so what that means
is if you lift the mouse off the table
you can tune how far it has to come off
the surface before now it's no longer
registering movement that's a good thing
because if you're moving the mouse all
over the place and you lift enough
because you're doing MOBA or other games
that have a lot of mouse movement to
first-person shooters tend to not have
liftoff but a lot of MMORPGs and Lobos
do have constant liftoff or lift off of
the surface it can be really annoying if
you only lift up a little bit move the
mouse but the sensor is still bouncing
back off the surface at a low distance
then the mouse is still going to move
even though you lift it off the surface
so you can adjust that to your liking
all right so we're going to do some
battlefield here because battlefield and
fps to me requires some pretty precision
movements Wow okay that's actually very
smooth so you can adjust the DPI right
here on the mouse and make it super
super I'll kill this guy oh you can make
it extremely sensitive or as you can see
not as sensitive all on the fly so
that's pretty neat I think right here is
where I like it I have no idea what dpi
this is but it's it's perfect as far as
I'm concerned so let me hop out this is
really nice holy crap because it has
zero acceleration and deceleration it's
just flat-out responds to whatever you
tell it to do this is super smooth I
mean I don't even know how else to
explain it I'm not sure I felt a sensor
this mood yet
oh no truth
I got hiding there like I doing one of
the things that's annoying in
battlefield is you know when you get in
doubt of tanks unless you've gone in and
adjusted the oh hey there's a tank right
there
Wow you just said you just stood there
and took it like a man
you took it like a man I don't know you
can adjust it inside the game you know
say the vehicle has its own sensitivity
but I like be able to do it on the mouse
chase down the hardy truck alright let's
try a little soldiering it's nice I feel
like where it's set up out of the box I
don't need to touch it and I like a
sensitive Mouse I really do
yep you did trying to snipe me from a
parachute just miss
let me repair you alright well I think
that worked out pretty well what we went
eight into so I think that worked out
pretty well well there we go the my onyx
castor Mouse it's very very comfortable
it didn't really feel like it slipped
super super accurate that I mean I know
I said smooth a lot but a cure is what
really comes to mind
I haven't played battlefield and forever
and as you saw I wasn't having any
problems with the mouse I wasn't having
to fart around what that I wasn't an
adjusting thing this is literally out of
the box just playing with some of the
preset dpi settings in here you made a
very enjoyable experiment experience in
fact I might actually lead this hooked
up for a while it's nice and light it's
only about 96 grams without the cable
and with the cable it's 114 grams total
weight so it's not heavy at all it's
actually very very light but on a nice
gaming mat like this right here which is
the Thunderer k7 I think is what it's
called from Oris it just moved very very
well even on the table it moves pretty
smooth my tables kind of rough and
scratched up and stuff but anyway the my
onyx cast your mouse if you guys are
interested in this mouse just check the
link in the description you can get a
discount over at mass drop because it's
a group buy otherwise you can check it
out over on my onix's website or eBay or
Amazon or wherever it's really all there
is to say about it thanks for watching
guys I know I don't do a lot of
peripheral stuff because they're so
subjective they're hard to do reviews on
but I really like this I really do and
you guys know there's mice and stuff
that I don't like a very adamant about
that this I like all right guys time to
get out of here I'll see you in the next
one and speaking of next one I don't
know if it's going to be the next next
one but coming up soon I'm going to
tease the hell out of this we've got the
theory Nano in the house OMG that thing
is freaking small
