you follow me on Twitter he know I've
got my hands on something that's really
elite and really hard to get no get your
mind out of the gutter guys we're
talking about the r9 290 OC gaming
edition graphics card jeez what the heck
kind of viewers do I have now if you've
been following Hardware for any length
of time you've known over the last
couple of months that crypto mine
cryptocurrency mining has really created
a shortage of graphics cards when it
comes to AMD I mean AMD's graphics cards
particularly the r9 in the seventy eight
hundred and seventy nine hundred series
graphics cards have just shot through
the roof in popularity because of how
well they do at that cryptocurrency
mining so that has made this card very
difficult to get just to hold this card
right now kind of feels like an honor
now I'm not going to spend a lot of time
on the specs because the r9 290 it's not
an X it's a 290 which I kind of feel as
a better bang for the buck honestly and
I'll kind of get into that in the
conclusions spec wise is pretty much
identical to the reference model with
the exception of a couple of things
obviously we've got upgraded cooling on
here quite a bit of upgraded cooling ii
msi is implemented their military class
component tree into the PCB with better
ferret ferrets and chokes better
capacitors just all-around beefier
componentry and the weight of the card
is certainly evidence of that they've
also included on the back which I feel
every graphics card should have simply
because this is what you spend all your
time looking at a aluminium backplate
this beautiful brushed aluminum finish
it's got the MSI name branded right on
there and it looks amazing now when it
comes to the cooler on this thing the
the actual heatsink itself runs the
entire length of the card as well as
being taller than the height of the card
which means if you're going to be
putting this in a small form-factor case
maybe might rip micro ATX or even a mini
ITX you need to be mindful of the
additional height AMD's mantle api did
drop which means if your run
program or a game that utilizes the
mantle API you can get a boost in
performance because of the reduced
strain on your CPU which is really good
for your graphics card it's a little
less evident and higher-end cards like
this a lot more evident in lower end
cards like the 270 sitting behind me but
otherwise it is going to be using
DirectX 11 point 2 and you know the
performance on this is amazing we'll get
into that at the end of the video there
are some physical things I want to talk
about here on the card it does have a
dual BIOS switch right here and there is
one thing I need to point out when it
comes to the physicality or the physical
properties of this card that I kind of
feel MSI overlooked and I want to make
you aware of it if you take a look at
the six pin and eight pin power
connector the heatsink rises up
basically over top of the clips where
you detach those power plugs so
unfortunately you can't get your finger
down in there to release the power clips
are the clips that hold the power plugs
into their socket so I have to get a
small flat-head screwdriver and kind of
push up and pull out and they pop right
out I just want to make you aware of
that that I think that might have been a
little bit of an oversight on MSI's part
where you can't actually get your
fingers in there to release the thing
and then it's not even a matter of
having fat fingers like I do I don't
think anybody's fingers would fit in
there but that's really the only thing I
can point out in this card that is
physically maybe a downside now just
like all the other GCN architecture
graphics card from AMD
there is no crossfire bridge because
it's all handled through the PCI Express
now let's go ahead and talk about what
it is I know you guys want to discuss
temperatures we'll get to the
performance in frames per second number
soon let's talk temperatures because
let's face it the 95 degree temperature
threshold the AMD said was perfectly
normal for the reference model is just
way too damn high sorry AMD I know you
know best but we hear the ones that the
deal with the temperature and heat kills
componentry 95 degrees temperature no
bueno
so the Twin Frozr cooler on here runs
default at 18 percent at idle and it
never got higher than 30 percent when it
comes to the fan speed even at its
hottest temperatures now without
touching the overclock this thing runs
at 1007
megahertz out of the box that's up from
the 941 which is basically the standard
boost clock on this thing
when it comes to AMD's r9 290 so you are
getting an overclock on this thing out
of the box
hence the OC on the box now the 1007
megahertz mark and the 5 gigahertz
memory clock this thing was sitting
right about 77 degrees Celsius in my
open air test bench with the
thirty-first 30% fan speed now I wanted
to see exactly where we could push this
thing so I overclocked this and spent a
lot of time in fact I spent hours trying
to find the stable overclock on this for
mine which happens to be 1085 megahertz
and about 5500 megahertz on the memory
bumping up the core voltage a little bit
as well as the power threshold and I
also ramped up the fan speed to about
60% which is pretty much matching what
the case fan profile was when it comes
to audible audio so it wasn't really any
louder than the case already was which
kept it from being intrusive and I found
that the temperatures ran right about 75
degrees Celsius while overclocked so
depending on how noise sensitive you are
you can lower the temperature of this by
ramping the fan speed up higher onward
to the things it is you want to know
about and that is how are the
temperatures and how are the frames per
second just stop ladder data blabbing
and tell us exactly how it performed
well guys when it comes to battlefield 4
I was seeing an average of 93 frames per
second
temperatures never exceeded about about
79 to 80 degrees Celsius depending on
ambient temperature with the stock fan
profile of 18% ramping up to 30 if
you're willing to push the fans a little
bit faster to about 60% which I still
found to be extremely quiet and nowhere
near the audio range of what the
reference blower style card is you can
get those temperatures all the way down
to about 75 degrees Celsius while
pushing the overclocked even farther
speaking of overclock I happen to get
this card - about 1085 megahertz which
is a bit lower than some of the people
have gotten on their cards but man when
it comes to the power this thing puts
out 1085 is no slouch and at 1080p
gaming it is just massive
overkill and when it comes to
frames-per-second there was certainly no
surprise there it just shattered any
game I threw at it and when it comes to
the benchmarks at bench right where I
thought it would and everything about
this card was actually really pleasant
to benchmark and mess around with in
fact when it comes to being air-cooled
it really performed a lot better than
better than I thought it would
considering how hot these cards are from
the factory I mean MSI and all the other
brands out there certainly have their
work cut out for them keeping this card
cool now with that said you're going to
want to keep various things in mind
depending on the size of your case
smaller cases are obviously going to
create a hotter ambient temperature for
this which is going to create a
situation where you're going to
definitely have to keep the cooling and
ventilation of your case in mind when it
comes to this card now guys tell me what
you think about this card it's certainly
an interesting market at the time that
this video was created considering that
what cryptocurrency mining is currently
doing to the price of these cards versus
what their team green opponents are
doing on the other side of the fence for
the same price ratio and sometimes even
cheaper so what do you guys think what
would you pick the r9 290 or gtx 780
which is in many cases much cheaper than
this card guys has been jays two cents
make sure you leave a comment tell me
what you guys think if you liked this
video it helped you out in any way make
sure you share it with somebody you feel
would help follow me on Twitter for more
teasers like this videos you guys knew
was coming if you follow on Twitter and
as always I will see you guys in my next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
