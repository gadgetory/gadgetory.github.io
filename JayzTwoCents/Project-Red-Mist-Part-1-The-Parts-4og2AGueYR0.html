bringing you a really informal and very
candid video as I try and get
comfortable here of a client bill that
I'm doing called Project red mist now
this is something I've never done on my
channel before and I'm really excited
about it I'm going to be bringing you
kind of a progress build log of all the
things that are going to be happening in
this system as they happen so make sure
you guys stay tuned to find out what's
going in project red mist find out just
how beastly overkill uber awesome mode
this computer's going to be and you can
drool over it just like I can even
though it's not mine
kind of wish it was it's quite literally
gonna put my system to shame and that's
just depressing now it's going to talk
about the parts that are going in this
build and that's going to be part one
we're going to talk about what's going
in the system the you know the the
rationale of the parts that we chose and
we're going to talk about the $1,500
water cooling system that's when you're
going in this beast absolute beast of a
computer okay so as you can see behind
me I have a whole gambit of parts in
fact you may or may not be able to see
it super clearly but I have a case labs
sm8 Magnum case it is absolutely massive
and we went with white because I think
white cases are just I love white cases
they don't show dust very much and they
just look really clean when you do the
build right I know some of you guys may
be going oh like case that just seems
really weird wait till the build is done
and you guys might change your tune as
you can see inside the case we have an
Asus Republic of gamers Maximus 6
formula motherboard that's a z87 chipset
with all the bells and whistles that
you'd come to expect from Asus Republic
of gamers line it's hard to say
the Asus Republic of gamers line and
that is going to be the backbone of the
entire system going inside that of
course as you can imagine is an Intel
4770k now the buyer bought all these
parts he had them shipped to him and
then delivered to me so I hope he has
better luck
the chip lottery the knife had what has
well I've had some pretty poor
overclocking 4770k s so I hope his luck
fares better than mine now supplying
that CPU with all of its memory needs is
the corsair dominator Platinum 20 133
megahertz ram 32 gigabytes of it way way
way more RAM that's ever going to be
needed for this system but you know the
buyer was kind of like go big or go home
so that's exactly what he did with the
RAM right there now we are also for
storage going to be putting in it's a
little bit underwhelming actually for
storage we've got a samsung 500 gigabyte
840 Evo SSD so 500 gigabyte SSD and a
one terabyte Western Digital black drive
now he can easily add more storage if he
needs it later but it is a little bit
underwhelming though considering the
rest of the parts going in this system
but he'll find out soon enough if you
know one point five terabytes is or is
not enough storage space and then if he
needs to put in another hard drive he
can certainly do that I'll have it
pre-wired for him in case he needs it
simple enough now when it comes to
powering at all we have a corsair 1200
eye power supply it's kind of covered by
some boxes there but a 1200 i power
supply way more than enough power to
power the gtx 780 Ti Super clock Edition
graphics cards from EVGA so we're going
with 2 GTX 780 Ti is in two-way SLI and
we are to be overclocking and water
cooling those cards as well so we can
expect a lot of power with a lot lower
temperature threshold in the card I'm
guessing somewhere in the 40s mid 40
degrees Celsius range water cooling
stuff as you can see we've got a lot of
boxes here in fact that's not even all
of it I just kind of put the cool stuff
on display where you could see it it's
mostly an ek build when it comes to the
water cooling loops and I say loops
because we have two loops going in this
system a dedicated graphics card loop in
a dedicated CPU motherboard loop that's
right we are going to be water cooling
the motherboard but we're not using the
built-in motherboard a block that is on
the Maximus we've gone with the ek full
kit for the Maximus 6 formula that
includes the Southbridge as well as the
V RMS and chipset up on the north side
of the motherboard so we're going to be
putting in the
block for that and as well as the EK
supremacy block for the cpu now when it
comes to GPU blocks we're going to be
putting in the exact same blocks that I
put on my seven 80s on the 780 Ti is
there the nipple version full cover with
acetal and they're matching back plates
I think they're called the jet stream
back plates a really nice machining job
on there they look very very slick so
we're going to be putting that on the
GTX 780 t is now housing all of the
fluid is going to be 2 ek 250 multi
option reservoirs they are the what they
call them the res x3 so they're going to
be a lot of different options and
configurations for the res two of those
which are going to be you know like I
said independently feeding the CPU
motherboard and as well as the GPUs now
for radiators down in the bottom we are
going to be putting a 4 x 140 millimeter
radiator for 560 millimeters of
effective cooling space that is massive
in fact if you take a look you can see
that the 560 red absolutely dwarfs the
480 red which is already huge I've never
really seen a 480 rad look so small but
yeah because it fits it natively we're
going to go ahead and put in that
massive radiator and we're going to be
putting some corsair AF 140 fans on
those to keep them nice and cool
I wish coursera made an SP 140 for the
static pressure but it's not going to
really matter these are low FPS low fpi
or fins 4 inch radiators anyway 4 pumps
are going to be using two of the EK d5
Vario ex tops they're basically are just
like a solid piece of palm on there with
a couple of different fitting options
and they just look really really nice so
we're going to using two of those and
sleeving the cables because the cables
are not slaved from the factory to power
both of our independent loops now one
thing that I'm really excited about with
this build as I'm going to get to
finally bring you guys a project
featuring something I've wanted to show
you for a long time and that is bending
acrylic tubing as you can see we have
got 24 feet of acrylic tubing 24 feet
that way we can make sure for any
mistakes that I'm guaranteed to probably
screw up on because bending acrylic
tubing is never easy but I did we did
get the
acrylic vending kit with the proper saw
and the heat gun and and the tube that
you entered into it for a mandrel Bend
it's gonna it's going to all be shown in
the later video in the series so I
finally will get to show you guys that
and of course we have all of the
matching promo chill revolver fittings
right here which are basically a
compression fitting for rigid tubing
that is going to be keeping everything
plumbed and connected together quite
nicely so there you go oh and for fans I
forgot to mention because we are going
to be putting a 560 alpha cool on the
bottom and a 480 on the top we've got
four x SP 120 quide Edition fans for the
upper radiator 4 x 140 millimeter SAF
140 fans for the bottom we've got AF 120
fans for the front pull and air in and
then we've got an AF 120 fan for the
rear exhausting air as well and as well
as the top rag will be exhausting air
out of the case so there you go guys
now this kit wouldn't necessarily be
complete without all of the
miscellaneous stuff to put it all
together and that's what this looks like
basically lots and lots of basic
different fittings here here that are
needed to make various bends and angles
on certain areas we're bending the
acrylic may not make sense and an awful
lot of cable management guys these are
these are cable splitters cable
extension sleeved cables
I mean you mention it we and as well as
adaptor boards where we can divide power
to multiple fans with one plug so that's
what all of this looks like and there is
quite a bit of it there and we've got
all sorts of miscellaneous stuff only
one thing I did forget to mention be
nice if I told you guys what we were
actually using for coolant so we are
going with Mayhem's pastel white for one
of the loops this is the concentrated
for that and then we are going with
Mayhem's x1 blood-red for probably the
GPU loop so that's going to look really
slick since this is an ROG theme build
we've got white black and red heavily
going on in this build so guys that has
been project red mist here on J's $0.02
part number one I hope you guys will
check out the series as it happens as I
make progress on the build which will
take several weeks maybe even a month or
more putting this all together paying
extreme attention to detail with the
lighting which is not here yet the
lighting and just making everything look
is hidden yet clean as possible I'm
going to take you guys along for the
ride
I'm going to show you the progress as it
happens and we'll keep this series
updated with the awesome computer porn
that is going to be happening absolutely
no doubt and since this computer puts
mine to shame it's at least fun then I
get to be the one to fondle it the
computer that is yeah you computer
husband hey hey perfectly clear I mean
this isn't bump hunting or anything like
that so anyway guys I'm gonna go ahead
and get the hell on out of here we'll
see you guys in part two as always
follow me on Twitter if you want to talk
about project red mist Facebook or I'll
just see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
