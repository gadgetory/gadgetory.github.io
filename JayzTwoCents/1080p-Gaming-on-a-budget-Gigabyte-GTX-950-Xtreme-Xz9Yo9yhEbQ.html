playing with high-end video cards is an
awful lot of fun but I will also admit
that it's not a lot of fun to sit there
and constantly look at videos about
products that you can't afford so today
we're gonna go ahead and talk about a
new product from gigabyte which is the
new gtx 950 Ti extreme edition it looks
an awful lot like their gaming series
edition we're gonna go ahead and see
whether or not this 950 deserves the
actual title of extreme putting the
words extreme and 950 together seems to
be a little bit odd so let's go ahead
and see if this guy even deserves the
title the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5
pro from Coolermaster combines
modularity with creativity giving you
the freedom to build it your way make it
yours by clicking the link down in the
description now you might notice
immediately on the surface this thing
looks an awful lot like it's bigger
brother series the g1 gaming where it's
got the same act aluminum accenting here
it's got the wind force logo that
actually lights up here it's got the
silent light that turns on to tell you
that your fans are running at low speed
because you know as it's sitting like
this in your case you typically can't
see the fans I mean it feels it like
that you could see it and you wouldn't
need the light because you wouldn't even
be able to see the light but since it's
sitting like this in most cases you
always know what's going on with the
card because the LED indicators here
will tell you you've also got the stop
light right here which turns on to tell
you that your fans are not turning at
all which is one of the benefits of
these low power consumption cards is you
can get away with idle or 2d operation
or even low demanding games with
completely silent operation because the
fans won't even turn on until they reach
a temperature threshold which typically
non-demanding games won't even reach
with these low power consumption cards
now the wind force logo does light up
and it is adjustable using the OC guru
app from gigabyte where you can change
the colors to between you know pretty
standard colors you've got blue red
yellow white of course green and then
you've got purple and teal and a couple
of other colors I think there's seven
colors in total now for cooling again it
uses the exact same fan blade design as
the g1 gaming cards that was only two of
them because it's a very
PCB so it doesn't have three but it also
has a large aluminum heatsink very
lightweight though it's a very
lightweight card running the length of
the card actually running past the
length of the card with a single heat
pipe running in an S shape across the
heat pipe giving you a lot more length
to the heat pipe also giving you more
heat dissipation you do have a small
heat sink up here on the front for the
vrm delivery it's not touching the main
heat sink but in all of my testing so
far it has not been running into any
sort of cooling issues whatsoever on
this card the vram is also being cooled
by the heating so you have a lot of
active cooling going on here for IO it's
the usual suspects you've got your DVI
and HDMI 2.0 and then you've got three
display ports on here so for a small
card like this you can hook up a lot of
displays if you want to have a lot going
on kind of like I do behind me over here
now the gtx 950 is the smallest brother
of the current lineup of maxwell based
cards if we're not including the 750 and
750ti which are technically maxwell
based cards but we'll just say for the
900 series the 950 is the little brother
it's the it's the run running around the
room annoying everybody you know saying
I want to play I want to play and you're
you know the big brothers are like go
away go away leave me alone so the specs
are pretty much according you know to
the lineup so it's got 768 CUDA cores
it's got a 1024 megahertz base clock and
eleven hundred and sixty eight megahertz
boost clock from the reference model
obviously this card is pushing that much
higher you've got two gigabytes of gddr5
running on 128-bit bus four six gigabit
per second bandwidth on there this card
right now at 179 dollars has an amazing
bang bang for buck at 1080p and we'll go
ahead and show you why I say that right
now
all right so I was kind of curious as to
what exactly would make this an extreme
card then the only other thing I had to
compare it to so far was the EVGA gtx
950 SSC now as you can see here if we
compare these two cards the 950 from
EVGA
is much bigger however they both have
back plates they both have duel fans
they have the same IO on the back or
output on the back so the very similar
cards although the gigabyte does have
the lighting on there but other than
that they are pretty much identical in
terms of the features that they offer
they both take 8 pin PCI Express power I
mean that very they both overclocked to
nearly identical frequencies same amount
of RAM same Ram speed even so it was one
of those things where okay what makes
this thing extreme well you know I'll be
honest if you saw the benchmarks right
now this thing beat the 950 from EVGA in
every single test even at stock speeds
which were again nearly identical this
thing was pulling out a couple of extra
fps in every single category so I'll be
honest I don't know what it is that's
making this card faster but it is faster
than the EVGA card you guys know I love
me some EVGA so it's not like it's
something that I would just throw out
there but if you're looking for a small
card it's lightweight it's got a
backplate it's got light on it it's easy
to fit in small form-factor builds and
it comes with a lot of extra bells and
whistles and blings that you otherwise
wouldn't get in a card that's under $200
then you definitely should put the
gigabyte gtx 950 extreme edition on your
shortlist
now I had originally planned to instead
of comparing the two 950 s taking this
950 from gigabyte and putting it against
the Sapphire 380 nitro card that I
reviewed a few months back but it became
pretty quick a quickly came apparent
that that was going to be a bad idea and
the reason why I say that is the only
380 that I had the opportunity to
benchmark one was a loner card so I
could not go back and redo the test now
to see you know just for the sake of
continuity if my results were the same
the second time around
to the card was a four gigabyte card
which made it more expensive than this
card so we'd be comparing two cards that
are not in the same category of price
where the Nitro came in at $219 and this
thing comes in at 179 dollars so in
order to do that test and make it
properly apples to apples in terms of
being price point comparison I would
have needed a two gigabyte card and I
don't have that so it really wasn't
going to be very fair in doing that test
because the price points were different
the amount of VRAM was different which
became apparent in all the tests the 380
nitro card was beating this card in
every category hands down by quite a bit
of fps so I don't know how much of that
was attributed to the RAM especially at
1080p in games like Crysis 3 and Witcher
which dude like the vram I just went
ahead and threw that test out the window
and maybe I'll try and see if sapphire
will loan me a 380 2 gigabyte card maybe
the solution here is I just take all of
the low range cards that I have you know
960s and 950 s and 380 s and 3 70's and
and we just kind of do like a budget
shootout on all the graphics cards I'd
be kind of fun it would take a while to
do all that benchmarking but it probably
worth doing but anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video gigabyte 950
extreme card I think we're gonna be
seeing more cards using the extreme
nomenclature I think they're planning on
bringing that out two more cards
hopefully we'll learn more about that
here in the future I'm curious as to
what's gonna make if they do the extreme
cards on the higher end models like the
979 89 atti then what's gonna make it
different than the g1 gaming so I don't
know if we're gonna see that I guess
time will tell
anyways I'm gonna get on out of here
thanks for watching guys I hope this
videos helped you in some way as you can
see you don't need to blow all of your
money on a high end graphics card to get
a good gaming experience in games you
could like battlefield 4 for instance as
you saw we were getting over 70 FPS once
you overclocked the thing 60 is no
problem without overclocking it so that
means games like battlefront will have
no problems running on a 950 and of
course you can always sli that later if
that was your only option
but anyway it's time to go guys thanks
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
