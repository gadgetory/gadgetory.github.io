cents here yeah I just said
crack-a-lackin' no idea why I said that
so I sincerely apologize for that we're
going to take a look at a little bit of
a combo pack here today from EVGA we are
going to take a look at the EVGA
supernova 1000 G - I think they call it
G for gangsta because it's pretty
gangsta if you know what I mean
gangsta gangsta is that even a gang sign
somebody tell me it might maybe I just
said hello and Mandarin sign language I
have no idea so yeah we are going to be
taking a look at this 1,000 g2 supernova
here from EVGA and a little mystery
package that goes along with this that
we'll take a look at once I kind of get
past this bad boy this sexy beast right
here okay guys let's be honest this is a
power supply there's not a whole lot you
can say about it I mean you can talk
about the cable quality you can talk
about the efficiency this is gold rated
so that means it's pretty efficient and
you know build quality 12 volt rails
things like that really boring stuff so
you know taking a look inside here I
don't know really how much there is to
say now the packaging obviously I think
is pretty damn nice I mean it's a look
at this they've got this cable pouch
here here's your cables I'll just take
out a few of them there's actually a lot
now I actually have a gripe about this
power supply and that is being that all
of the accessory powers are red now I
know EVGA really likes red I know that
their motherboards tend to have a lot of
red in them but you know what if you
were doing a blue build what is what if
these cables just aren't what you're
after I mean there's sleeve nice look at
that they're not individually sleeve but
they've got nice leaving on there
they're nice and heavy-duty it's dense
the 24-pin are all black cables
underneath there the red cables are all
red cables under there so you don't have
a rainbow plethora of colors going on
which you guys know I really really hate
in fact that's probably one of my
biggest pet peeves when it comes to
power supplies is the fact that so many
companies use
non dents are very thin thinly dents
leaving that allows you to see the all
the ugly colors through there but not be
is there densely sleep but I do have a
serious issue with them being red but
there is a remedy for that and we'll
talk about that in a minute now inside
here you get your power supply and a
nice little pouch and it's got some
pretty nice texture to it I mean this is
a sexy power supply it really is the fan
on here it's PWM controlled so it's it's
going to ramp up and slow down most of
the time you not even gonna be able to
hear it because unless it's under an
intense load something we're going to
turn on thanks to the 80 plus gold
rating on there but this is a very
nice-looking unit I really really like
this a lot it it just it looks nice if
it's going to be displayed in your
system somewhere you know it would be
worth looking at except for those damn
cables now I really do like EVGA I mean
cables aside if you were doing a red
build by all means the cables on this
look amazing if they were all black they
would fit everybody's needs in my
opinion but you know for whatever reason
they chose to go with the red but if
that red doesn't suit you and you like
the power supply there is an option out
there and that other thing we're taking
a look at today is their custom power
supply cable sets now this I really like
to see because you guys know I used
Lucho customs for my custom cables on my
rig redness is getting them but they
carry a hell of a price tag you guys
know when you want the best the best
comes with the price tag and loot row
custom stuff just like the case labs
it's not for the faint of heart but you
know you're getting the best when you
buy it so what if you want that custom
look
without breaking your bank well you go
with a power supply like this it has a
custom cable set now what I really love
about the EVGA cable set over the
Corsair cable set is they include
everything the 24 pin the SATA cables
the molex cables the eight pin EPS power
cable the PCI Express cables they're all
in here they're the exact cable
replacement for their modular psus any
modular cable that's on your psu gets a
fully single sleeved or individually
sleeved cable for it and this is only
$89 at the time of filming a cable set
for 89 bucks it includes the 24 pin and
all of that the thing I really don't
like about Corsairs is it
out 79 bucks or so but then it's another
$20 for the 24 pin and if you need more
PCI Express it's all extra charges and
it can get up to a couple hundred bucks
by the time you're done depending on how
many cables you need so they throw
everything together in a kit here
without breaking the bank now to add
another $90 on top of your power supply
does add to the cost but this is for the
person wanting that custom look and they
come in all kinds of colors red black
blue I think they might have green I'm
not sure but go and check out their
website you can see what all the colors
are that are available but here they are
right here I mean look at that all the
cables are right here now the first
thing we're gonna take a look at is the
24th of the point we are going to go
ahead and take a look at the 24 pin here
we go how does open packaged there we go
now
nice quality sleeving here is your CPU
power here is another 8 pin CPU power so
guys - 8 pin CPU powers not just one
like Corsair - because they know some
motherboards require auxilary a pin and
more power than just the one plug
depending on what you're doing and here
is your 24 pin cable right here now you
might be able to tell already maybe you
can't
this is heat-shrink list tubing I love
heat-shrink list tubing because it looks
so much more clean now the length on
here I think could stand to be a little
bit longer but that's just me I mean
this isn't gonna this might not reach
something like in a case labs case but
in your standard you know full tower mid
Tower this is going to be plenty long
but look at the sleeving
quality of this there it's really tight
sleeving you just really couldn't ask
for anything better that's going to plug
in directly to your power supply and
have absolutely no compatibility issues
I mean allow me to demonstrate that
right now here's the side that says
power supply you go over to ash that
says motherboard huh we should we learn
to read I promise
plug in power supply plug it into the
power supply
and there it is red sleeved cable for
your OEM power supply you didn't void
the warranties you'd have to take the
time doing it yourself for $90 now guys
this is something I highly recommend for
the do-it-yourselfer who doesn't have a
lot of time and you're willing to shell
out 90 bucks for some cables that are
heat shrink lists just look perfectly
well done I mean there I have no
complaints all the cables leaving is
tight on here there's no bulging they're
all perfectly straight for all the exact
same length and they got a zip tie in
there right there but you're going to be
able to do some custom looking cables
inside your system and absolutely you
know really killer rate I'll take a look
some of the other cables you get here
yeah you get a SATA with three SATA on
there another Saito three SATA another
SATA 3 Satyam another SATA with three
SATA 3 molex plugs on there and two more
mullets plugs and a floppy drive the
floppy drive kind of makes me laugh
quite honestly care why we got floppy
drives stuff okay
whatever and this is obviously going to
be our PCI Express stuff so how many PCI
Express cables do you get well here is a
6 pin 8 pin here is a 6 pin 8 pin here
is at six p okay here is another 6 pin 8
pin another 6 pin a pin and another 16 a
pin so that's one so there's one
graphics card there's two graphics cards
and there's three graphics cards so they
actually give you enough cables to do a
3-way SLI or crossfire again 90 bucks
you get all of these cables look at this
look at how many cables you get for $90
that is freaking awesome I'm sorry I'm
just gonna say right now I love this
alright so the test rig is together
behind me now as you can see and we use
EVGA supernova 1000 G to massively
overkill power supply for this test
bench but you know it's going to get the
job done and I can expand the system in
the future if I need to now obviously we
threw in
the cable kit from EVGA here it is right
here now
as with most things in life there
there's no such thing as perfection and
I'm going to go ahead and tell you a
list of pros and cons that I have about
these cables so hear me out completely
before you come to any sort of
conclusion about these now as I
mentioned earlier in the video they give
you a ton of cables I mean look these
are all the cables I have left and
that's a complete system back there with
two hard drives a graphics card water
cooler fans I mean look at all this
that's a lot left so it can be a little
bit wasteful in the sense that there's a
lot of material here that's now just
going to sit in a box and you know
that's kind of a downside and the
downside to that is since these are
complete assembled kits you can't really
pick and choose the cables that you need
or want so I mean it would have been
nice if maybe EVGA offered individual
you know maybe you could buy a cable you
need for 10 bucks or something like that
I mean if they can put this whole kit
together for 90 bucks they could afford
to sell you know VGA cables for 10 bucks
sort of thing to just get the cables
that you need rather than having all
this wastes just sitting here now the
sleeping on here is fantastic it's a
little bit stiff in my opinion it does I
mean it bends like nicely like that but
the thing is the cable still kind of
wants to twist on you as you are routing
it in your case if you try to come out
of your case and you try and go up and
then you have to kind of make a a right
bend it they tend to twist a little bit
on you now that's not really the fault
of the so much the sleeving and stuff as
it is the cable I mean the cables
themselves are made up of really tiny
finally strands of copper that are
twisted together too so obviously
there's gonna be some natural twists in
there for that yeah so I made routing
the cables some a little bit interesting
but it didn't create any problems for me
I was they look at the back panel on
without having to you know shove it or
kick it with my foot and we've all been
there right we've all had such cable
clutter in the back of our system
sometimes if you've got a like edge it
shut like you're trying to get that
suitcase closed for your trip and you're
sitting on it and you're pulling the
zipper yeah I don't have to do any of
that so that wasn't a problem but when
it comes to the the plugs you know I
think a lot of the beauty of these plugs
is really negated by the fact that you
have the real
ugly you know VGA printed on there and
VGA printed there and some of the other
ones say EVGA on one side and so you
take these gorgeous plugs and then you
look in the system you just see this
stamped you know screen printed
lettering everywhere and that's kind of
a downside of my opinion I mean a piece
probably if they you know had better
proprietary plugs on here and they could
only go in the place they're designed to
go in then that would alleviate them
needing to print this out because you
couldn't put it anywhere else but then
you're talking extra costs and designed
a proprietary plugs and it's probably
not worth it for them it's not a market
that they're they're looking at you know
becoming the most expensive on the
market which could inevitably happen so
the cable kit is a great kit it really
is allows you to add some color to your
system get you some you know custom
looks in there without breaking the bank
I love everything about this I just wish
that the cables didn't have that screen
printing on there and they could route a
little bit better maybe if they had gone
with more of like a paracord type of
sleeving than a hard plastics leaving
that would have been a little bit more
preferred on my end so overall guys
these custom cables here from EVGA for
their EVGA line of power supplies go
check out their website you can see
which power supplies are supported and
you know go check out the colors that
are up there and if you think there's
any cool unique color combos they should
put down below like I said earlier maybe
alternate some red and some white or
some black and white or black and red so
you can get even a little bit more color
in there I think that would be kind of
unique so really good option by EVGA
really well-priced and bang for the buck
again if you're looking at doing
something cable or management or some
custom cables in your system but you
can't afford super high-end
sleeve cables like wietrow customs which
are very pricey this is certainly an
option that you should consider
so guys been Jase two sets following
Twitter if you'd like to chat with me
about this video or any other tech stuff
or you just want to tell me how much you
hate my videos or maybe you want to send
me a funny joke or or I don't know what
else kids do these days on Twitter's
maybe you want to make it send me a
funny meme that'd be kind of cool head
on up to Twitter and as always guys I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
