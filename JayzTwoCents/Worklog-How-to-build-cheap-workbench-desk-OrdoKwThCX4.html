one of the last vlogs of the moving I
know how you guys like them but I'm
exhausted
and I need a vacation man I hate moving
anyway today I'm going to tackle the
shop I already kind of started as you
can see getting like shelves and stuff
together getting stuff unboxed and put
up kind of kind of an order but what I
got to do today is I'm going to be
putting together some work benches and
stuff the lik max to 120 and 240 from
enter max is another awesome choice of
AIO liquid coolers for gamers and
enthusiasts without breaking the bank
patented shunt channel technology
provides extra layer of cooling
capability click the link below to find
out more right away I'm going to give
credit where credit is due this is
actually I copied Paul's hardware on
this one he had a really good idea of
going down to Ikea getting countertops
that you would use in your kitchen and
then just getting some of the screw down
legs and using those as work benches but
instead of L bracket to the wall like he
did I'm going to be doing two
freestanding desks so I can move them
around in here as workbenches as I need
so I'm just gonna be screwing those legs
into the bottom of these countertops so
I totally copy Paul's Hardware on that
so that's where credit is due if you
guys want to know the video he used when
he did that in redoing his garage studio
check the link down the description now
as you guys can see I pretty much got my
shelves up and I've got things pretty
much organized on the shelves how I want
them what takes up a lot of room in here
are these cases economy I mean the
monitor boxes are pretty big but most of
those are going to get set up I'm gonna
have a multi panel arrangement so I have
all the different types of panels to do
benchmarking on you know 4k ultra wide
1080p a high refresh rate that sort of
thing these cases take up so much damn
room and a lot of folks are like J once
you just give away the cases the problem
is to ship these cases will cost as much
as the cases cost and that's just not
effective so these companies send over
cases for review and then they just get
thrown in the shed or in the storage or
whatever
pretty much to never be heard from again
unless there's a build that actually
qualifies the need for those cases so
it's kind of sucky but it is the way it
is so I'll figure that out
to do with all of these but they take up
a lot of room here's the racing
simulator I got put this thing back
together put the other panels back up
this is going to be going inside the
house actually in the upstairs loft
slash game room I'm calling it so today
is about getting the rest of this
organized and getting these benches
together and then seeing exactly how
much room we have in here part of my
problem is I believe these are 74 inches
long for the short ones and this is not
that wide of a room and I'm worried
about how much space is going to be
between these shelves here and if the
desk sticks out like a you know sticks
out I don't want them to just be flat
against the wall because sometimes I'm
building on these big systems
I'd rather get up and be able to walk
around it and work on both sides of it
than having to move like these big SMA
heavy cases and stuff around that's not
something that you know I'm looking
forward to so I want them to be able to
stick out into the room but we'll we'll
figure that out
alright so here's the countertop right
here it's literally just a piece of
laminated like MDF or actually this
appears to be little bit more like a
high density fiberboard it's very very
thick it's an inch and a quarter it's
got a nice like wood grain to it again
it's meant to be a kitchen countertop
but then I see as you literally can just
screw the legs right into the bottom of
it this was a 79 bucks a piece so this
is obviously going to be a lot cheaper
and it lays for 15 a piece so 60 bucks
plus 79 bucks 139 dollars per table
that's a lot cheaper than say going to
Lowe's or Home Depot and buying work
benches yeah plus those legs will extend
to 36 inches tall which makes it very
near a stand height which is going to be
good too
all right and that's what it looks like
on the bottom with the leg sticking out
it's really just that simple and they're
very very sturdy it's like I says very
heavy-duty fiber boards so it's not
going anywhere but that's why I got the
adjustable legs that way I can loosen
these up and I can make this really tall
if I want I mean you see how tall I can
make that so it's almost like a stand
desk all right so there's the first one
when that's at the highest setting it's
a little bit wobbly so I might go ahead
and bracket that one to the wall when
it's at the highest setting it's wobbly
like that and I'd rather be at the
highest setting because what I'm working
on computers and stuff I like to be
standing I don't like to be sitting so I
think I'm gonna leave that yeah I think
I'm going to leave that one at the
highest setting like that and I'm going
to bracket it to the wall so it means I
do have to go to Home Depot I need to go
to Home Depot anyway and get some
daylight lights for that the white now
that light is way too warm but anyway
this is also going to work as like a
second set for me so I can do video
production out here as well all right
here it is so it doesn't stick out quite
as far as I thought sup plenty of room
to move through here and get to my water
cooling stuff I figured I'd go ahead and
do that kind of a quick tour of what's
in here anyway
these two shelves right here are my
water cooling items it's all water
cooling stuff this is kind of like
random PC stuff right there and then
over here is all the graphics cards and
motherboards power supplies headsets and
all that stuff it's funny I mean people
will get on to me like you've got so
many and video cards you have no AMD
this whole shelf is AMD right here all
of this right here is AMD that's a
router I'm going to be using the g10
from asrock to be doing to do my bridged
Wireless on the other side of the house
so we have good coverage but yeah I mean
the case isn't stuff like I said the and
this is actually the giveaway system the
owner was very kind to not be too
pressing on getting that right away so
that I can deal with the move he happens
to be in Escondido California so I'll be
planning to meet up with him which would
actually be kind of nice on to
ship that but anyway that's my 6700 K
system these this needs to go upstairs
in the office on the guest PC and then
all of these cases and things take up so
much room and then there's still all of
this out here yeah these are all
monitors right here this is actually a
giveaway monitor but these were all
monitors right here and then the big
would crate was actually sent to me by
LG had like a game in there for the
Super Bowl something strange like that
and then of course the racing sim which
I'll be dealing with later but yeah
that's pretty much it this is you guys
are going to see some videos done out
here probably from this angle right here
very Paul's hardware like again go and
watch his video if you want to see how
these desks were put together he did a
great job showing how unlimited funds
you can you know granted 139 dollars for
one of these but that's a lot cheaper
than say buying you know a computer desk
that would be this size 139 bucks times
2 is what about 100 or 200 80 bucks and
this massive desk 74 inches and 74
inches and I wanted this to come out
from the wall like I said that way I
could actually get to both sides of
whatever I'm working on I'll be building
computers and stuff up here which will
be really nice I want to show a little
bit of progress here in the office as
well so to put this softbox up camera
has its own little spot over there yeah
I like the fact that there's not that
much going on in here now still a little
bit equity there's nothing on the walls
yet but I added this glow right here
which flickers on camera again because
of the refresh rate and camera refresh
rate but in person you don't really
notice that your brain filters it out
but whatever I'm here skunkworks of
course looks great set up here on its
perch all by itself yeah we're going to
be doing some recording in here get some
pictures up on the wall and yeah the fan
kind of messes with shadows a little bit
in here but man is a fan make it nice
you know if you've ever gamed in a small
office you know just how hot it gets
don't want to give you guys a little bit
of an update to the office the amount of
room I have in here for activities this
is what the underside of the desk looks
like a lot of people have asked me where
I've got this thing this is actually
from Ikea I don't know they sell it
anymore but you can see just how long
is and I've got one on each side but
yeah the cables are all zip tied
together you can see over there
yeah it's easy to get this stuff out
because I said dipped I'd actually not
zip tied there velcro see I can zoom in
on one here they're actually velcro
together so I can just undo the velcro
to get out cables that I want and not to
you know cut zip ties and raise em tie
some folks were like usek targeted nor
you get your mouth though blah blah blah
obviously that's not the case because
everything is velcro and even velcro to
the little thing right there anyway guys

one's a little bit shorter I don't have
that many more things to vlog about

updating it from his 780ti - I believe
980 eyes and he wants to go with a 59 60
X I believe and all that stuff so anyway
as my phone is blowing up every time I
start to record my phone goes off anyway
