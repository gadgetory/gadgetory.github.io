over here that's the low-key ghost s1 I
finally got the silver one I've been
waiting on with the two top hats and I'm
getting ready to water cool this thing
and I'm realizing this is gonna suck why
did I agree to this this video is
sponsored by North Vee PN and we live
online our lives are online our social
media accounts the things we post the
things we do and you know what bad
people want to spy on that information
so don't let them encrypt your data with
a Virtual Private Network now Nord VPN

okay so here's the challenge if you're
not familiar with this case I did a
video about it in the past actually
there's a black one back there that we
did a build on
sort of but this is it right here it's
not really screwed together so it's
probably gonna fall apart here's one of
the other top hats its an ITX case
obviously and it's expandable you can
build it up as tall as you want but
here's the thing I was like I'm gonna do
a fully water-cooled with graphics card
and dual radiators and obviously CPU and
then it came in and I looked at it and
it's like you know what what crack was I
smoking thinking I'm gonna fit all that
in here so that's my dilemma it's
actually end up being this tall and the
other top hat is on and in terms of
height that's not our problem our
problem here obviously has a lot to do
with depth as well because the graphics
card goes on one side and then
motherboard goes on the other and then
it's got this riser card as you can see
to connect everything together we've got
a power supply that goes right here and
I'm realizing there is absolutely no
room whatsoever for a reservoir or a
pump so I've kind of been scouring the
internet looking for pump block combos
because if I
can get the block in the pump on the CPU
then that I just realized was half
hanging off the table who look up you
were gonna let that fall for the sake of
the video I know you feel what I realize
is if I can get a block pump combo a CPU
block pump combo that will that will
take up a lot of my space constraint
problems and then I might actually be
able to make this work now there's
another conflict here that I where we're
gonna have an issue here specifically
with the GPU so I was gonna use my
twenty eighty but I thought there's
really no point in that this is gonna be
a mobile editing rig for CES for the
most part and I forgot to loosen the
other screws so this is one of those
things where I promised the audience I
was gonna do this even though it took
loki like a year to get the case built i
guess given how long it took me to do
the post Malone build I can't really
complain about that now can I so that's
a little bit to the point though what I
want to show you guys here and this is
actually gonna be I think an easier
problem for me to deal with but if I put
the side panel on what you're gonna see
is I do not have very much room
whatsoever between these fittings and
the side panel I think those aren't
gonna fit in there if that let me take
this off and actually show you so I can
screw this down in there okay
technically it does work the problem I
had here was the fitting is typically
wider than this piece here if that makes
sense now fortunately I live very close
to a micro Center and they carry water
cooling stuff so I ran down there and
got some barbs because I didn't have any
non compressions my issue is
compressions would probably not work
here it it looks like these I'll screw
in like that so you can see it looks
like these are the exact same diameter
so that might actually work a
compression fitting or like this guy
right here as you can see would have a
collar that screws down on it making
this fitting wider this is the same ID
or inner diameter as this guy right here
but the caller would have then hit the
side piece so I decided to go with
Barb's very old-school and that looks
like that will actually clear it if it
does and that's one less thing I'm gonna
have to worry about today
the barbs actually fit so there is
problem number one sort of sort of
handled now let me show you problem
number two so as you can see I'm gonna
have a bit of a vertical clearance issue
when it comes to the CPU because once
you put on this size now or just
slamming oh you could see there's not a
lot of space in there so there's no room
anywhere in here for me to comfortably
do a pump or reservoir or any of that
stuff because don't forget right here
where this spot goes and everyone's
gonna be like oh you could just do it
right there in the bottom no because
here's here's the radiator tube off jeez
it's a good fit ladies all right so if I
go ahead let me just screw this down so
you guys can have a very good visual
these these small form-factor bills man
if you go on like if you go on reddit or
overclock net or any forum where people
are showing off their ultra small
form-factor builds and it's clean and
they've got like rigid tubing and stuff
man give those guys alike because I
think people realize they might work
this is to get all this to fit right so
then this goes here like this and then
this ends up mounting onto there and
then this goes like this so you can see
just how quickly you run out of space so
that's the thing I'm trying to figure
out now is how I'm gonna make it freakin
work so alright long roundabout way of
saying I decided to use a long
roundabout way of saying I tried to use
a fractal design Kelvin pump because
it's a pump block combo it sounded
pretty powerful the problem was once I
hooked up all of the radiators and the
GPU block and the obviously the CPU and
the GPU it didn't really move the water
too well
so I had this idea the problem is
bleeding the air out of here because
there's no room for a reservoir
at all Jessie that might be room for
something I know of another place at
another time but that's okay I digress
I need a way I guess the water cool hood
got cut so here's here's what I'm
thinking this is one of the Alpha cool
cross flow radiators that I showed you
guys so it all comes in one side goes
across and comes out the other side
instead of doing it you Bend on there
but you see how those fittings on both
sides I'm thinking that might make an
opportunity for me to fill from up top
because as long as the air can get out
if I undo one screw and the other screw
and slowly fill it and let it just get
down into the loop we might actually get
this to work
look how small that is SFX power
supplies are normally much bigger than
this that are this wattage okay this is
this is promising look at that it goes
up like that so that's pretty much all
the main components in there so that's
the space we have to work with well I'm
gonna finish to even mock this up now I
was losing my brain my mind it's gone
you're gonna end the video that way
aren't you
that is that is a hundred percent
plumbed up now that's a fully custom
loop in there so if this pump ends up
not working out there are other options
there's like the apogee from Swift tech
my concern with that one though is the
fittings are on either side and I have
clearance issues all around as you can
see memory here obviously there's spaces
use up top there's a heat sink down here
there's with ITX it's very squished so
I'm concerned that the apogee won't fit
but this is fully plumbed up ready to go
for me to do my fill test I'm not
positive this pumps gonna be able to
push it all through I already had it all
put together on the table which is the
way this video started that's what I was
doing before we started this video but I
found my 90s you know it actually wasn't
that bad to build and believe it or not
I mean the full loop is in there this is
a site I care about this is where you'll
see all the fluid the only wiring that's
not in here is the eight pin EPS and the
PCI Express two cables they're obviously
which are going to kind of hide
underneath the PSU sort of down here
kind of over here which will sort of
fill out this space but when I'm ready
to put it together I can just slide the
top hat back on and you know over this
these wires are in the way but I can
just slide this back on like so and then
put the top cover on then that's
basically what a ghost
s1 looks
with a dual rad water-cooled tight necks
and a water-cooled 9900 k so this is a
beast so here is my hope it's because
this side has a fitting that goes
straight through and straight out to the
air and this side has a fitting that
goes straight through down into the CPU
pump that I can fill it like this like
this top radiator becomes my reservoir
that's the hope here and yes I'm using
drinking water because it's all I have
right now and this is just a test so
bite me this pump just does not have
enough head pressure to actually move
the fluid fast enough to force the air
out jizz why the bubbles are just
staying still and I have been tilting
and turning and you can see I've got a
basically an IV feeding into the top rad
and no matter what I cannot get all the
air out so we're gonna end up probably
going with an apogee drive too which is
my only other option now that's a laying
DDC pump which is a very powerful pump
on top of a copper water block and I
think we will clear our components here
if not then modifications will be
happening but anyway I can get
everything in this system and still get
the sides on which is what today's video
is all about I was hoping this pump
would be good enough for the two rads
the GPU block and obviously the pump
combo it's not so when we do the last
part of this video I'm sorry this is a
two part of it when we do the last part
of this video it will be all done it
will have the fluid in there the
lighting and everything and we'll finish
it off with part two and then this will
be Phil's editing station for CES a 99
hundred K that will be overclocked where
they tighten ex and all m-dot to storage
I know what to go with an external for
our dump drive because of the fact that
there's nowhere else to mount any drives
in this we took all those options out
which was really only one of them this
little bracket right here SSD mount that
goes on to a radiator or a fan which can
probably come in handy in another bill
ater on so yeah sort of guy Philip I
catch you playing games in your hotel
room on this because super powerful well
then I'll be mad that I don't get an
invite unless I got an invite and then
we're cool so that's right all right
guys we're gonna go thanks for watching
it as always we'll see you in the next
one today's video is sponsored no yeah I
mean just I'm gonna and people want
pointing this at some and a free let's
do that again
okay you name it we are online and
connected every single one syllable
today's video is he key click the link
