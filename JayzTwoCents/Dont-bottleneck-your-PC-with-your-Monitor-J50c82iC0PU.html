small footprint together with the
all-new Corsair 1 available with up to
an Intel 9th gen 9900 K processor and an
RT X 20 atti this small PC is capable of
big things convection assisted cooling
with separate loops for the CPU GPU
means the Corsair 1 sucks in the best
way possible to see our review of the
new corsair 1i 160 click the link in the
description below I've said it before
and I'm gonna say it again the monitor
is probably the most overlooked piece of
any setup and in my opinion it has
arguably the biggest impact so let's go
and start with some of the sizing and
then we'll move up to the more complex
specs which aren't that complex by the
NS video I think you'll see what I mean
so we've got two different aspect ratios
here we have a 24 inch 16 by 9 a 32 inch
16 by 9 and a 34 inch 21 by 9 so the
inch measurement I'm sorry I don't have
the centimeters offhand if you guys are
not in the US I apologize for that that
measures basically the diagonal
measurement from corner to corner of the
panel not necessarily the viewable a lot
of people will sometimes go I'm getting
a 24 inch but then you measure it and
it's more like a 22 and a half or
something like that that is corner to
corner of the panel physical size itself
usually you'll find a second number
which has the actual viewable diagonal
measurement so I'm gonna go ahead and
set these two guys aside right here
because we are going to be using these
panels for a different video that we're
working on but I thought that this was
the perfect opportunity to sort of
explain to you guys why it's really
important to not scrimp on your panel so
this is a new LG 34 GK 950 F they also
have a G variant for G sync so f
obviously stands for free sync I'm gonna
be doing a video using this I've alluded
it to it now a couple of times and I
think based on F and G you can probably
figure out with our videos going but I
digress that's neither here nor there
that's for another day this is gonna end
up being my new panel I think for my
personal use at home because it is a
much increased much better spec panel
than what I've been using for the last
several years which is the predator X 34
and we'll talk about that because the
specs about to mention are exactly
why I'm switching to this panel versus
what I'm currently using so let's go and
start off with the one that a lot of
people get confused and can just really
I guess bent out of shape with because
they don't know how these two numbers
relate to each other that being refresh
rate in response time so refresh rate
quite simply is how many times per
second the screen can refresh the image
the higher the refresh rate the more
smoother the image is perceived to be
and also to the lower the refresh rate
can also give you a little bit of a
motion blur type of effect if the
response time is not also fast enough
now I know that probably just confused a
lot of people right there so let me go
ahead and just rewind here just a little
bit typically 60 FPS or 60 Hertz because
you're always gonna hear the refresh
rate referred to as a Hertz rating is
kind of that sought after figure as high
refresh rate panels became more popular
and more affordable a lot of people
started realizing like oh my goodness
the amazing high refresh rate and
smoothness not only give them a benefit
in terms of smoothness of the image but
also reduced input lag for your mouse
and keyboard inputs and if you're any
sort of a twitch gamer and what I mean
by that is like csgo or any sort of
shooter where movement and precision is
important than having the highest
refresh rate with the lowest amount of
input lag would give you like a little
bit of an edge but most average gamers
are fine with 60 fps
so this is a 34 40 by 1440 that means
there are three thousand four hundred
and forty pixels across 1440 pixels high
you can do the math on that number that
times that number is how many millions
of pixels that are in here which is a
lot to push this is somewhere around
three-quarters of the pixels of 4k so
this would be a hard monitor to drive at
144 Hertz or 144 frames per second and
you would definitely need a lot of
graphics horsepower to push that so it'd
definitely be overkill for someone
running something like a 1060 or a 1660
TI or something like that but the other
number that we tend to forget about here
is the response time that is the amount
of time it takes for the pixel there's a
gate that basically allows light through
when the gates closed that is what how
the light is stopped it's always lit
it's always back lit because these are
LCD LED panels this happens to be a nano
IPS panel so it's a nano cell technology
from LG which is what allows them to get
a much faster response time
it's something they debuted on their TVs
a couple years back we actually did a
review on that you can go and check out
but this is allowed it to now make its
way to desktop format where you can get
a faster response time while still
having IPS technology as well as a very
high refresh rate so this panels
actually advertises having a one
millisecond response time so what that
means is it takes one millisecond or one
one thousandth of a second to go from
gray to white to gray again or allowing
light through the the pixel gate and
then closing it once again and obviously
with the Nano sub technology found in
the new LG panels is why they're able to
do this high refresh rate ultra wide IPS
HDR and still maintain the one
millisecond which is something that a
few years ago wasn't really possible you
would get about a hundred Hertz not 144
because if you have a really fast
response time or the pages refreshing
you know 144 times a second or the
display rather but you don't have a
response time and the the gray to gray
fast enough you start to get ghosting
all over the screen and you can test
this right now even if you have a 60
Hertz panel you can check this out if
you take your mouse and you wiggle it
around the screen you'll notice the
cursor appears in more than one spot and
what that means is that it's not able to
turn the light off fast enough before
it's moving out of that spot and so
there's a little bit of a sort of a
dimming effect as the light is turning
off the perfect example is a halogen
light bulb you turn it off it doesn't
just turn off instantly like an LED it's
sort of dims down the same thing can
happen with panel technology if the
response time is not fast enough now
what you're gonna find us the panels
tend to go up in price is extra features
so this panel has a adjustable base
where it can go up and down it can tilt
this one has a base amount so you push
this button the base comes off and then
you can put on a base alarm which is how
I plan on mounting this this one has a
USB 3.0 pass-through so it plugs in
right here we've got two USB 3.0 ports
in the back we've got our headphone
power plug DisplayPort in and two HDMI
is so you could use this single panel
for it input from let's say a DirecTV
box or something like that a console a
DVD player so if you're using this in a
bedroom it kind of turns into a sort of
one fits all because the problem was in
terms of processing inside of monitors
there is a processor that has to process
the image just like a video card inside
of your computer there's still a
processing engine inside of here
has to process the image for us see and
what they found on the several years
back was the only way to get those high
refresh rates with the low response
times was to have only one input and
because of that display DisplayPort was
usually what you needed because HDMI you
know 2.0 B and all that stuff wasn't
around yet so you weren't able to get
the high bandwidth of hdmi displayport
was all you got a single input so you
couldn't use it with your consoles or
any other input devices but now as you
can see we're definitely there so when
it comes to panels the whole point of
this video is to remind you the panel is
what you're looking at it is responsible
for your computer and what it's doing to
make it to your eyes so do yourself a
favor don't necessarily rule out your
panel as being something that you can
scrimp on it's a mistake I made for
years and you can find early videos in
mind where I use very basic very budget
cheap 60 Hertz 25 millisecond response
time panels that just I always thought
out I'm fine I'm fine until I went out
and experienced a high refresh rate low
response time panel I was ruined for
life so also know that the first time
you look at one if you're not prepared
to always look at one it kind of changes
your perspective on panels because your
computer may be held back by your panel
experience so I just want to go ahead
and make this video here explaining to a
lot of people that these specs are not
something to be afraid of if you can
figure out you know where you're happy
60 Hertz maybe plenty but you can still
get a 60 Hertz fast response time panel
and it's going to give you less of that
ghosting effect or if you're like me and
you like the ultra-smooth then anything
about a hundred Hertz are above it's
gonna give you roughly the same
appearance and smoothness but I'm
consider myself pretty sensitive to FPS
so I tend to aim for that 144 and the
reason why this the GK 950 F is going to
be my new daily driver panel is I've
been using the X 30 for predator from
Acer ever since it came out but that is
although it is a one millisecond
response time and it's a 100 Hertz
refresh rate this is a 144 one
millisecond response time nano IPS which
I explained if you watch our LG video
about
nanotechnology and what it is you'll
understand why nanotechnology is better
than a standard regular LCD type of
screen it has the multiple inputs and it
has HDR so I mean that's going to have
the brightness it needs to give us the
nits to be able to get our high dynamic
range which is going to be a feature
that I have never used on a PC so I'm
excited to check that one out which is
why this is a panel I'm going to be
using and probably doing a standalone
review of as I get a little more
familiar with it alright guys thanks for
watching today's video I hope this helps
some people understand monitors and why
they are important and should not be
written off as something that you can
save money on if anything I would say
it's probably worth getting a very good
panel and then building your PC to the
panel specs if that makes sense if I had
a 60 Hertz panel it would make no sense
to put a 20 atti in any resolution
whatsoever but if I was running a 240
Hertz 1080p or 144 or 1440p panel then
going with a higher graphics card would
certainly make sense don't want to over
build your system notes where you go
higher than the refresh rate unless you
have a good sync technology like free
sync adapter sync orgy sink then at
least there's some hardware handling the
smoothness of those frames alright guys
thanks for watching if you want me to
cover another topic like this make sure
you sound off in the comments down below
or hit me up on Twitter because topics
like this come directly from my inbox
and if enough people request it then we
go ahead and take the time to do it
thanks for watching guys we'll see you
in the next one
what am I supposed to do though just
like
I'm punching myself I let me see that
I'm going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
