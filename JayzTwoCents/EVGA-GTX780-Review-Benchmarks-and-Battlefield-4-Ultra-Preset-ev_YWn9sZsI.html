doing a video today that's kind of long
in the making you guys may be surprised
to find out I do not upgrade my own
system very often in fact the graphics
card that's in there right now my GTX
680 I bought back in the middle of 2012
and you guys saw I did a video upgrade
from I did a video when I upgraded for
AMD to Intel and I reuse the graphics
card graphics cards it's one of those
things where I've told you guys before
always buy the best graphics card you
can possibly afford and maybe even wait
a little bit longer to buy a better card
then you can currently afford if you
think you have to extend the life of
your computer if you're not looking at
doing annual upgrades every time there's
a generational refresh you want to get
the best card you can possibly afford so
it'll last you longer
for instance my gtx 680 lasted me
through the entire 600 series and now
through probably half of the 700 series
before picking up this gtx 780 now i
know you guys are gonna be asking me j
why didn't you get the 780 Ti or J why
didn't you get the Titan and I would say
why do you want me to shoot you by ask
me a question like back with the Titan
but anyway regarding the TI this
graphics card actually came directly out
of the system that my cameraman won at
CES because he wanted to go SLI
configuration he has a matching 680 to
mine so we made a trade he traded trips
straight across for my 680 m water block
for his air-cooled 780 so that's what
we're doing today
I like single powerful graphics cards
and he's gonna try his hand at running
an SLI configuration with 2 6 ATS and
ultimately you guys may be thinking wow
you got a 780 for a 680 he's a sucker
no his graphics power is gonna
outperform this 782 680 s is going to
blow away a single 780 but because I
game on a single 1080p monitor and the
rendering and the amount of cuda cores
in this is going to greatly increase
what I do here on YouTube as well as my
gaming
so why am I even making this video this
isn't news this card came out in June
why the hell not this is what I do I
make videos for you guys so I figured
we'd go ahead and talk about the card
this is the EVGA GTX 780 with their
which kind of surprises me it's their
own little proprietary blower style
cooler they didn't reuse on this exact
model the metal cooler that comes from
Nvidia so I don't even know if this
lights up on the top we're gonna check
it out we're gonna stick it in my test
system here we're gonna do some prep
with some benchmarks on it and see how
the temperature is how the software is
for this how how well at overclocks cuz
you guys know I'm pretty notorious for
having very good lottery luck when it
comes to overclocking chips GPU CPU etc
so there's really not a whole lot to
talk about this I mean it's got all the
standard 780 specs that you've come to
know from Nvidia requires a 8 pin and a
6 pin power connector
it's a blower style design it's got
black heatsink which looks really nice
it's got the metal a little trim on the
top again like I said I don't know if it
lights up it might I honestly don't know
we're gonna find out black PCB but you
guys know me I know somebody at this
point is already wondered but you're a
water cooler so what are you gonna do
well I have got actually can you go
ahead and hand me that I I have a
surprise for you guys here I was also
sent a full cover water block from ek as
well as a full back plate so you guys
know me it is gonna be going underwater
but that's for a different video we're
gonna go ahead and benchmark this thing
just kind of see how it stacks up and
then let you guys know how I feel about
this card because you can get this card
for 499 dollars right now at the time of
recording if you're watching this in the
future it's probably even cheaper so
let's go ahead and get it in the system
see how it performs we'll talk about
some numbers and then we'll give our
conclusions
it is a beast so guys make sure you stay
tuned because let me be putting this
card on water that's what I'm getting
ready to do right now after this
recording I'm gonna put this thing on
water and I'm gonna play around then in
my main rig that's a GTX 780 non ti the
performance of this thing is so
outstanding I have a hard time
recommending a 650 dollar card when a
$499 780 Ti is for two $99 789 Ti is
performing this good so unless you're
doing ultra-high resolutions like 1600 P
I don't even recommend a 780ti I
recommend saving saving 150 bucks and
putting it somewhere else honestly I
mean I know I said get the best graphics
card that you can for your money but I
think 782 780ti is a bit of a stretch
when you're getting this kind of
performance I mean unless you have the
money to blow and you already have the
rest of your components are just maxed
out it's really hard to recommend going
with the Ti so guys have been Jays two
cents tell me what you think about this
card it performed a bit better than I
thought it would this was my first time
really getting to get in-depth and
hands-on with a 780 with the exception
of the other build I did but that wasn't
a confined space and it was a little bit
I wouldn't I wasn't willing to push it
like I am here because we tested this in
this test bench here so there's test
rate so guys I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video I hope it makes you
smarter buyers when it comes to graphics
cards and it shows you what you can
expect out of a vanilla 780 as always
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
