usually talk about rumors or turn the
rumor mill but enough of you have been
asking me about what's happening with a
new graphics cards where's the new
Nvidia cards that I thought I would pay
speculate or Ã«peace video right here
talking about my thoughts on where the
new graphics cards are why we haven't
seen them yet and what to expect once
they finally do launch with its
adjustable pmw 3367 16000 dpi optical
sensor for RGB zones 9 customizable
buttons and offering both wired and
wireless operation are only a few
reasons why the Corsair dart core RGB
should be on your shortlist for your
next mouths purchase check out its full
list of features by clicking the link in
the description below and the reason why
I'm even talking about this is because
GDC and GTC have both concluded and some
time has passed since then and we've not
seen anything new from Camp NVIDIA and
there's always speculation as to why
that could be I mean in the last couple
of years NVIDIA has been really big on
holding their own press conferences
rather than kind of doing a keynote at
an event like CES or Computex or GDC or
GTC the last couple of times they've had
their own special events round right
around the time frame of big events I
think Pascal launched right around the
time of Dreamhack in Austin Texas and so
it was one of those things where okay
GDC GTC is over are we gonna see
something and no nothing in fact all
we've heard is that they've squashed the
GPP program because of they were
basically saying a lot of people were
spreading a lot of false information
about it even though the behind the
scenes and anonymous tipsters were
telling us Nvidia is lying that's
besides the point GPP is over us we
don't worry about that and obviously
it's because a lot of you guys were
outraged at the idea of Nvidia even
trying to get involved into the naming
scheme of third-party manufacturers and
their business and I applaud everyone
who kind of you know fought on that
because it's really none of them videos
business on how ASIS or MSI or EVGA or
whoever runs their business and how they
want to name their cards that's my
personal opinion on that you may
disagree and that's perfectly okay but
because we haven't seen anything new
come out it has a lot of people just
kind of wondering what the heck is going
on now it's important to kind of preface
this with
no insider information I have had no
meetings with NVIDIA I've had no
conversations with anybody and so
everything I'm about to say from this
point forward is completely speculative
and it's not from any insider
information whatsoever now it's kind of
talk about the price history of Pascal
real quick because Pascal has just
passed two years old
may 5th 2016 is when Pascal launched
again alongside Dreamhack in Austin
Texas like I mentioned we have now just
past May what we passed May 5th now
which is putting at two years old and
because we haven't seen anything now
from GTC I don't think we'll see
anything around Computex I have not seen
any real emails or anything hinting that
something big is coming in video when
they launch new families of GPUs like to
kind of make it a big deal kind of like
the order of 10 they did when the 10
series launched with the scavenger hunt
and all the clues so we haven't seen
anything like that which makes me
believe that the new series is not right
around the corner now the cheapest
graphics card I can find right now from
the 1080 TI series is seven hundred and
fifty four dollars and ninety eight
cents currently in stock at new wake so
if you guys are shopping and you guys
have seen this video hopefully they're
still in stock but that's only about
fifty dollars above MSRP from where it
first launched it launched I believe
that about seven hundred dollars so
that's really not bad at all it's at
showing a $20 rebate making it 754 so
it's actually 769 but if we look at the
one year history we can see it was
actually one thousand four hundred and
forty nine dollars at its highest so
although I have said prices are not a
hundred percent back to normal they have
definitely been improving but there are
people still selling that exact card
right now for $1000 so the market is
still extremely volatile in where
pricing is so if you put your ear to the
ground you can usually find a good deal
like that but if you look at the price
history chart on PC part picker you guys
and I'll put a link to this one I'm
referencing now so that you guys can
actually see it yourself and you take a
look at where it changes by the time
this video goes up it might change it
has had a downward trend pretty
significantly when we look at new egg
pricing so that's good news and that's
because I think a lot of the ASIC miners
the idea of ASIC mining especially for
aetherium which directly uses GPUs has
put a lot of people in a holding pattern
I think the miners are kind of holding
on going wait a minute if these ASIC
miners are gonna be coming out and I can
get one for roughly the price of one of
these inflated graphics cards and it's
just that much better hash rate then
that's a better return on your
investment so I think they're waiting
and not buying anything new which is why
we're seeing graphics card prices start
to come down but as gamers we're on the
cusp of something new coming so the
gamer doesn't want to buy a graphics
card for 700 bucks and have something
come out that's better for the same
price so everyone's kind of in this
holding pattern right now which is
allowing the market to sort of catch up
but I don't think any of that has to do
with why we haven't seen a new graphics
card family launch yet I have two main
theories as to why that is the first one
we're going to go ahead and go with
something tangible I'm gonna say the
manufacturing process is being held up
by the RAM shortages that right now is
being investigated or at least Ram
manufacturers are being investigated for
price fixing which has reduced the
ability for manufacturers to ramp up
production to be able to keep up with
the demand which is artificially
inflated the price of memory if that is
where the holdup is so price fixing if
these manufacturers have you know gotten
in cahoots and decided to agree to keep
manufacturing low so that they can keep
prices high well that's price fixing and
they're currently being investigated for
that side bar though they have been
found guilty of that in the past so it's
quite possible that that's exactly what
we're dealing with today
now the other speculation is just
straight at market share Nvidia is
holding approximately 70% of the market
right now the GPU market which means
close to three out of every four gamers
has an Nvidia graphics card so what that
means is there's just not a lot of
incentive for them to innovate and spend
a lot of money and drop something now
when they don't have to when they're
already dominating the market and AMD
has not launched anything new in the
last year when it comes to the
mainstream gamer like the RX sep 570 and
580 is all you've got the Vega 56 in
Vega 64 were pretty much launched out of
the attainable price point of most
gamers and the 570 and 580 have just
been kind of falling behind in terms of
where they stack up versus the current
Nvidia offering if Nvidia had considered
to do annual launches like they had been
they would be even farther behind that's
probably reason why NVIDIA doesn't have
more than around 70% of the market share
right now but it's just simple supply
and demand and it's the same type of
thing we saw with Intel where if you are
dominating the market and your only
competitor right Intel only has AMD to
compete with and NVIDIA pretty much only
has AMD to compete with why spend so
much money on bringing new products to
market when you already control the
market you can keep that money in your
bank account keep your investors happy
at the expense of people's murmuring and
grumbling about not seeing a new
graphics card because they already
control the markets so all that mumbling
and grumbling isn't affecting their
bottom line BRABUS see that changed when
it came to the cpu market because Intel
kind of banked on Rison not being that
widely adopted or being maybe a little
bit of a failure in terms of where
people were expecting it to be kind of
like what happened with the FX series
but Rison came out made a huge splash
and from day one started to gain market
share back from Intel so Intel obviously
did a pretty bold move by pulling in two
platforms into 2017 that weren't even
scheduled to come out until 2018
obviously showing that there could be
competition once again in that space so
we need competition to happen in the
Nvidia space otherwise why would they or
the graphics card space otherwise why
would Nvidia care to spend money on
bringing new graphics cards to market
now I'm gonna go ahead and talk to you
the gamer right now who's sitting on the
edge of his chair waiting for something
new because you've got XYZ money to
spend and you want to get the most for
your money if you are gonna sit and wait
for the next family of GPUs to come you
probably aren't going to see anything
until closer to Christmas time this year
that's my best guess on when we can
expect to see based on previous families
of GPUs this is currently the longest
family of GPU that we've seen yet from
Nvidia yes
Fermi was also a two-year family but
that was spread over two different
generations the 400 series and the 500
series where Pascal has now been the 10
Series alive
for over two years and by the time we
see it refreshed with the 1180 or 2080
or whatever they're calling it will
probably see Pascal reached two and a
half years before something new actually
comes out in fact rumor has it too that
we're not going to see the new mobile
chips until the beginning of next year
which is kind of what I'm basing some of
my speculate
because mobile usually launches a couple
of months after desktop but the best
advice I could give to someone who's
sitting around waiting trying to decide
whether or not they are going to buy a
new graphics card now with the somewhat
improved market in terms of pricing is
you probably should because I think when
the new family of graphics cards launch
its if we haven't seen a theory a miners
or ASIC miners become available yet yes
they've been built yes have been
pre-ordered they have not started
shipping yet I think when the new
graphics card family comes out and we
see its improved performance I think
miners are going to gobble those up
again so you might wait and then
unfortunately the market disrupts again
and then you might not be able to buy
anything past gen or current gen so I
also look at it this way if you're gonna
be always afraid of the new next the
next thing coming out and you don't want
to buy then you're always gonna be
waiting because we are in a leapfrog
guys CPUs and GPUs are usually staggered
on when the new stuff comes out so you
could be waiting indefinitely and you
always be afraid of being outpaced on
what you can get for your money but the
way I look at it personally is if what
you can buy today meets and exceed your
needs and you're happy with it then the
only thing you're really missing out on
at the end of the day is maybe a tiny
bit more performance usually about
twenty to twenty-five percent on the
Nvidia yeah that's not a tiny bit but if
it's already exceeding the performance
you want out of it then you can be happy
and enjoy your stuff now rather than
being afraid and worried all the time
and the only thing you're really missing
out on is little bit of bragging rights
but if you're wondering where I came up
with that 20 to 25 percent improvement
that we can expect with the new graphics
card is that's pretty much been
consistent with Nvidia in fact I did a
video not a little while back that where
I tested the 580 all the way up to I
believe the 980ti every 80 series card
and saw an extremely consistent 20 to 25
percent improvement or anywhere in
between generation to generation so I
don't see in videos showing us too much
advancement in GPU technology I think
they're gonna keep it right around the
20 25 percent artificially which
obviously is a pretty good chunk but
like I said if you are not if what you
can buy today is meeting or exceeding
your needs than by today or you're
always going to be afraid of the next
thing
coming out and you're not gonna be
obsolete from one generation to the next
so that mean that'd be my best piece of
advice there is a rumor though that the
new generation in video cards could
possibly be featuring Samsung G DDR six
which is going to be either 16 or 18
gigabit per second depending on the card
or which chips they go with which would
be a significant improvement in memory
speeds which is kind of been where
Pascal is really shined when it comes to
memory speeds so we might see something
new and innovative I don't think we're
gonna see HBM though I don't think
that's gonna be affordable for the
mainstream for a while I still think
we're gonna see a conventional layout
GPU is surrounded by memory but I think
we're gonna see faster memory and
possibly even faster GPU core speeds who
knows I mean Pascal can hit 2000 with no
problem we're just a couple years ago
2000 was only achieved by people doing
ln2 overclocking but guys I'm gonna go
thanks for watching today's video this
was this was a direct response to all of
the people sending me messages and
asking me questions about when I think
the new graphics cards are gonna launch
do I think they're gonna be good should
you wait should you buy now because
prices are starting to improve so I just
wanted to kind of make a central video
that you guys can come in reference and
to get the my thoughts all in one place
rather than trying to dig through
Twitter and all that
although twitter is a pretty good place
to follow for some of this information
speaking of graphics cards oh I'm gonna
be giving away a whole PC and you guys
can find the details to that by watching
the video in the link in the description
and you guys can obviously you know
that's free so who doesn't like free
stuff alright guys I'm gonna go thanks
for watching and as always I will see
you in the next one
