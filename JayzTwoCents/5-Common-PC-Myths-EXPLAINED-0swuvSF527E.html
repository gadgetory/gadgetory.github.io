and before we jump into today's topic I
want to remind you all that I am
currently doing a giveaway of one of my
GT X 1080 founders edition cards one of
my very own cards that was intended to
go in skunk works before when I'm going
to tighten X's it is a worldwide
giveaway you guys will find the link to
the giveaway down in the description of
the video and I'm not only giving away
the card I'm also giving away a full
cover plexi nickel ek water block as
well as a Nickelback plate for it so
yeah you definitely don't wanna miss out
on that is available worldwide except
we're prohibited but the topic of
today's video is definitely guaranteed
to ruffle some feathers upset some
people and that perfectly okay with me
because we are going to talk about five
pc myths that you shouldn't believe hey
guys illness the overwatch Coolermaster
invitational on July 15th and 16th at
eSports arena in Santa Ana the
tournament gives 12 high school robotics
teams a chance to compete for a grand
prize of forty thousand dollars directly
benefiting their school's robotics
program so save the date and come on out
to the eSports arena in Santa Ana on
July 15th and 16th
now the first myth here is kind of a
two-parter and it basically says you
can't build a PC on carpet that kind of
ties into the whole anti-static or ESD
electrostatic discharge argument which
is if you accidentally shock something
in your system you can damage it now
that's very true but there's a lot of
things that have changed over the years
a lot of components these days have very
good ESD protection a lot of
motherboards specifically now have ESD
caps on they're designed to absorb any
ESD that might accidentally make its way
into the system and I'll tell you right
now almost every PC you've seen built on
this challenge just about every PC I've
ever built in the history building pcs
I've done while sitting on carpet and
the argument with carpet is the fact
that it can build up static chart if
you've ever walked across the carpet
with socks on and touched a doorknob you
know exactly what I'm talking about so
the fear is that you would accidentally
shock something on your system and kill
it now that doesn't mean that even
though we have ESD protection today that
you can't damage your component so
that's why I say it's somewhat true but
you could damage some of these smaller
components in your system for instance
HDMI ports USB ports
you thunderbolt type-c ports these types
of things if you get a charge that
accidentally makes it directly into the
port that could cause damage I do know
people who have killed ports that way
but you've never actually destroyed the
system that's we've come a long way in
ESD protection now this next one's a
good one I hear it a lot amongst people
who are sending me build lists or asking
me questions and that specifically is
can an oversized power supply damage
your computer well the problem is a lot
of people who don't really understand
power supplies and electricity and how
these components work together is they
tend to think that if your computer only
needs 500 watts to run under load but
you hook up a thousand watt power supply
that you're sending a thousand watts to
your computer I've seen a lot of
comments saying using an oversized power
supply can damage your system and that
just boggles my mind the way a power
supply works is it's only going to
supply the amount of power that the
computer needs up to its max rating so a
thousand watt power supply can supply up
to a thousand watts of power to the
components that doesn't mean it's
sending a thousand watts at all times
now the reason why you'll see people use
oversized power supplies and me being
one of them is I want to kind of try and
size the power supply to be more in the
peak of the efficiency curve right
around 50 percent is where 50 percent
usage or load is where a power supply is
most efficient so a thousand watt power
supply supplying power to a 500 watt
system would be at the height of its
efficiency curve but of course there's
going to be a huge diminishing return in
terms of cost where you're going to
spend a lot more 4000 watt power supply
then say a good 650 or 700 watt power
supply which could also maintain that
same sort of efficiency curve so you
want to pay attention to diminishing
returns and not go too big the only
thing you're really going to destroy
when you use a power supply it's too big
is your wallet now this next one is a
pretty popular myth and you've probably
seen it if you've ever been to any Co a
PC forum Facebook group or even a
comment section in my videos and that is
you can speed up the slow computer by
adding more RAM or technically
downloading more ram as some people call
it anyway
I digress guys that really depends on
why your system is running slow in the
first place do you have an extremely
undersized or underperforming CPU based
on the tasks you're asking of it are you
talking about gaining performance and
you have a very slow GPU well things
like that Ram is not going to actually
help where Ram is going to help
is if you have tasks that are utilizing
a huge amount of data being stored in
the memory CAD drawings video rendering
or huge Photoshop projects that stuff is
heavily RAM dependent because all of
those previews and stuff are stored in
memory and what happens when you run out
of memory is your computer doesn't just
shut down people seem to think if you
have too little memory and you asked
more of your memory than it has capable
that your systems is going to blue
screen or shut down that's not true what
happens is it starts to access what's
called a page file in the Windows
environment or a swap file in the Linux
environment where that data is then
stored on the hard drive or even an SSD
the problem is even n dot two SSDs are
extremely slow compared to the data
rates and transfer speeds of the
physical memory itself so if you're
starting to have to share data and swap
files with your hard drive that's what's
going to slow down your PC so most
gaming PC's home pcs or home PC
environment are not going to be doing
things that need more than roughly
sixteen gigabytes of memory but having
faster memory and more memory is of
course going to have a diminishing
return just like power supplies so it
really comes down to what you're doing
with your PC now this is one I've
actually heard quite a bit considering
the fact that I used to work in IT in an
enterprise environment was this is a
good one to talk about and that being
gaming PC's make terrible workstation
pcs and and that I don't entirely
understand
now let's we're talking like full-on CAD
rendering pcs with multi CPU Z on
systems with 128 gigs of ECC registered
Ram or whatever you're building servers
then this doesn't really make a whole
lot of sense because I don't know about
you most gaming enthusiasts tend to go
quite overboard with their hardware more
than often than not they build pcs that
are way above and beyond what they need
to play their games because they're
enthusiasts and they like high-grade
Hardware at least most people here if
you can't afford it you would use it if
you could you know what I'm saying so I
don't understand how people can say
gaming pcs are not good workstation pcs
oftentimes they have at least 16
gigabytes of RAM or more they tend to
have multi-threaded CPUs usually it's
some sort of i7 with hyper threading or
now arise then with all these cores
which would make a great workstation PC
and now with GPUs being used in a lot of
day-to-day tasks and a lot of programs
able to offload on to GPU encoding it
makes more sense and ever
a gaming PC is really a dual-purpose PC
you can work on it and you can game on
it and no longer do you have to have a
specific build guide or direction based
on that use case you can now have a
gaming PC that you can also build an
entire business based off of now this
next one I know it's one that we have
all heard guaranteed if you've ever read
any discussion on any website or a
youtube comment or anything regarding
GPUs and GPU performance and high
refresh rate monitors its who cares the
human eye can only see blah blah blah
FPS anyway and you can replace blah blah
blah with any denomination because
nobody can agree on what the human eye
can actually see now I can tell you
there was a really good discussion that
took place on reddit yeah I know right I
read a reddit post very strange a good
general consensus at least amongst eye
experts was that the human eyes and the
nerves can fire anywhere between 300 to
a thousand times per second sending
information to the brain and that
information travels at 200 miles per
hour for me I - your brain I don't know
how to measure that but whatever again
I'm not no I'm McCollum optometrist but
I can tell you that most people in here
actually agree that the human eye can
see approximately one one thousandth of
a second now how that actually
translates to FPS I don't know but what
I can tell you is that what we can
definitely see is the variation between
frame rates yeah TV is only at what
29.97 FPS movies are at 24 p or 24
frames per second and the reason why
that looks super smooth is because of
two things one extremely consistent
frame intervals the frame is being
rerender dinh redrawn exactly the same
amount of time between each frames so
that gives you a lot of smoothness the
second thing is when you're dealing with
video cameras and stuff like that
there's a lot of motion blur so you get
blurred images between those frames
which makes it like that's what we're
doing right now this is this is looking
super smooth at 30fps because of the
fact that the frames are blending
together in games it's not like that is
a very harsh redrawing frame over and
over and over and over there's no
blending between the two so of course it
added things like motion blur to games
try and give it that cinematic effect
that most of us turn that off anyway but
the problem is if you're getting 60fps
and then 75 and then 58 and then 62 and
70 one that's a constant change of frame
rates where you're getting different
gaps between frames as things
adjusting what's happening on-screen so
that's why you have now frame pacing a
technology like free sync and gsync and
v6 of course been around for quite a
while where the point is to draw the
frames consistently there is no
conclusive argument to this and that's
certainly not going to happen today
because the problem is all of our eyes
are different all our brains work at
different speeds again read the youtube
comment so that will make sense to you
not everyone's brain fires at the same
time not everyone's eyes are
transmitting the same speed of
information and not everyone's eyes are
created equal so of course it's a very
subjective subject matter subjective
subject matter if that yeah you know
what I'm trying to say guys go with fast
GPUs go with high refresh rate monitors
and enjoy it I promise you will see a
difference and if you say you can't
why refer back to the the brain firings
beeping so anyway I had basically asked
you guys on Twitter last night tell me
your top PC myths and maybe would make
it into a video and basically what I did
was I took the ones that seem to be
reoccurring a lot of people were
mentioning over and over and those are
the ones that made it in here maybe
we'll do another installment of it we
talked about five more PC myths you
shouldn't believe
here's another myth you shouldn't
believe and that's the fact that Jay is
a PC fanboy Lane doesn't like Mac well
