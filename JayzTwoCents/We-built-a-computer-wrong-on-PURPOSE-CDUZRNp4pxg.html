promise today's video is going to make
you cringe so get that dislike ready
or maybe that like if you just like us
to go out there and debunk stuff but we
are going to build an entire computer
using all of the methods people tell you
not to do just because we can afford to
absorb the cost in case it goes wrong in
case you've ever wondered what happens
if you do the things people tell you not
to do we're gonna find out what happens
when you do all of them build from NZXT
let's buyers customize their gaming
experience based on their desired FPS
goals in today's most popular game
titles choose a game you want to play
set a budget and build will recommend
the best parts for your build
want to get gaming faster then choose
blitz mode and order before 11 a.m.
Pacific time in your order will be built
tested and shipped same day to learn
more about NZXT spilled follow the link
in the description below now one of the
first things people will tell you not to
do is build on carpet we rolled out the
red carpet literally we need a case and
for that we want with the NZXT h 500 i
where's my knife the H 500 I is actually
the replacement to the very popular and
inexpensive s 340 which is a chassis
I've really enjoyed but NZXT has sort of
moved to this entire H I series and
they're intelligent cases they link with
their cam software they allow you to
control things like fan speed based on
chassis temperatures and we chose V
white and black one I just you can never
go wrong with white and black
stormtrooper look it's classy has
nothing do it the fact that my car is
white and black but maybe just a little
bit and as you can see it has a window
and not only is it a window it's
tempered glass so at the price point
that we're at not bad at all so it's got
one exhaust fan on the top one exhaust
fan in the back and then of course it
brings an air through the front and a
big opening right here on the bottom and
the sides why are channeling built in
controller right there for your lighting
and your fans obviously because this
baby right here actually lights up and I
actually had a hard time coming up with
my own list of things not to do because
I guess my best practices have been in
effect for so long I reached out to
Twitter to see what are the
biggest don't do this that you've seen
passed around the internet so we'll
start things off here with Zachary he
says don't touch anything without an
anti-static wristband not only are we
building on carpet I'm not wearing a
wristband and unlike another famous
little youtuber I don't wear them around
my ankles either that one or that one
I feel like I'm peeing on a hydrant
we'll go with an EVGA X $2.99 micro
we'll do that because this allows us to
use one of the most useless CPUs ever
that's seventy seven forty X which is
one of my particular don't do this one
of the things I've also seen people say
not to do was don't place your
components on top of the anti-static bag
because everyone seems to believe that
the static cage that this bag actually
is is designed to only protect static
from the inside not the outside well I
don't guess we're gonna find out right
now aren't we also to treat everything
like it's made of delicate glass and
then with that I would agree treat it is
delicately so my computer buildings so
easy the only thing I would agree that
you should be delicate with though is
actually the socket if you want others
use the socket is fairly delicate
there's a lot of pins in there in fact
this one I believe there's 206 or 200 mm
and 66 of them I believe 2066 socket we
need glue in our CPUs now the boards
directly on the carpet like that
ow I pinched my finger now I swear to
God
there is a scientific ish purpose to
this video
emphasis on the ish but we've never been
known to be exactly the most scientific
Allah round here anyway and that's okay
you know why that's okay we do the
things he shouldn't do to show you why
you shouldn't do them but usually then
the day it works but we still say you
shouldn't do them but I've never
actually done this that's why I'm doing
it now we need to actually flip these
fans around we don't want these
exhausting air no we want all of the
airs to go inside of our case so we are
putting every single fan maybe we should
do every fan as an exhaust so now we're
like literally pulling everything into
the cracks events I put it in the wrong
hole story of my life now I would like
to point out that I am touching so many
components right now I am touching
solder x' I am touching traces hello the
traces are usually coated on the
motherboard to protect them I am NOT
being delicate with this that like that
delete it delete it
it's K&amp;amp;K and dancing no no this Paris
why the 1600 wow we're new wires but you
don't want all the wires behind the
computer where you can't see them
because you want to make sure they're
all plugged in so although NZXT provides
all of this amazing wire channeling that
is not what we want so make sure to
shove them all forward that way you know
they're there we need a cooler for this
one here I'm gonna go ahead and use my
fractal design s 24 if you guys can't
tell this is kind of my baked in aged
500 I review at the same time because I
like to review cases in a real world
format and let's just say this bill
doesn't get any more real than his today
we don't want this bringing in that
dirty nasty air from outside hmm not
what we want we want it bringing all the
dirty nasty air outside so that's why
we're using our brain on this build
you just have a nickname because you're
like one of those cool guys it's like I
have a nickname
yeah like J but when it doesn't start to
thread just make sure you push it even
harder and then it will start see just
like that no my brain is telling me like
like mice my wire management senses are
like big things like metal gear when
someone starts to detect chink
like why did I just touch why did I what
is the sound again sites like chink I'm
not calling anyone that pees now we need
thermal paste should say the methods we
use around here tend to get hit a little
bit with my pinky yeah so here's how
we're gonna do it today we are going to
spread it around with our finger now you
see how it's getting on the little cage
there that's probably I don't think
that's no I think that's flying no I
don't want to actually ruin the hardware
Phil this is not a cheap computer 99%
the right way 3% the lazy way up at 102
percent endeavor bill so I want to place
this the other way that's ok we don't
need to I mean the thermal paste is
already on there we can just reuse it
right so like air can get trapped in
there and make a bad seal make sure to
tighten these down going around and not
a crisscross pattern instead of going
down straight we wanted to just sort of
roll and smoosh onto there like that yes
I have to consciously think about how to
do this wrong time for memory now we
don't have a lot of different kind of
memory around here but we've got we've
got some choices here those are empty
boxes that we can use now there's a
method that I like to use here
everything you know is a lie they want
you to think you should match all of
your sticks and to that I say nice so
we're gonna be putting in a single stick
of this white RGB vengeance memory
that's actually not labeled how fast it
is now we are gonna use this 2,400
megabyte megahertz for gig stick just to
the left of it because this is a this is
a ballast stick when the right stick
gets overused it'll use the left stick
first g-scale flare ex this is actually
an 8 gigabyte 3200 stick optimized for
Rison now here's the thing intel's
jealous of verizon so we need to make
sure that we actually get that some of
that risin and speed in there so we're
gonna stick this one over here now for
the last stick I'm gonna go with this
one right here this is the ddr4 predator
now the reason why I'm using the
predator is not because of you know get
through the chop move or anything like
that it's because America uses the
Predator drone and I not like America so
remember the American flag flies highest
now as I put away all this RAM you might
have noticed that I was doing this with
the pins I don't let people fool you
they will tell you that you shouldn't
touch the pins because oils and stuff
could affect the pins these are these
are gold plated pins to that my response
is actually you want to put oil zall
over it that way it slides in and out of
the slot easier so next we should do
power supply now this is always a point
of controversy your you always hear
people say don't use too big of a power
supply because it never goes under load
and all these problems it's kind of like
a dong is there really such thing as
being too big I wouldn't know but when
it comes to power supplies 1600 is the
only way to go for a build like this Wow
how did I hope I never open this look at
this oh that's heavy
now Platinum it's an overrated metal in
my opinion reminds me of catalytic
converters so that's why we are using
the gold because we like to have what we
call the gold standard around here I'm
gonna go ahead and pre wire this power
supply it is there's no way I'll get
those plugs actually plug in
once it's in there because this power
supply is obviously too big it does have
its own proprietary power cable the part
that goes into the power supply as you
can see is not standard the internet
will also tell you don't put your fan
face up on your power supply okay that's
bad oh wow that barely fit Roarke no the
internet would tell you not to route all
your cables and in the main compartment
of the case because it will block air
flow you know what these just pop in
there so I think we can even just turn
this this way haha yes and 60 has
thought of everything alright the only
thing left to do here is to install our
graphics card now I don't like to put it
in the uppermost lot because that's
awfully close to the CPU well I just
like bent this I'm a USB 3.0 let's
check that so that you don't lose your
cables you want to keep these where you
can usually find them I'll forget that I
put them there and then I'll be like
where did I put those cables now I will
always know that they are in here this
baby's ready to rock and roll and play
some for tonight that's what a computer
looks like when you build it by doing
all the things the internet tells you
not to do but we're not done we need to
see does this baby right here post
turned on and it turned off immediately
okay that's normal for EVGA boards
though actually they always turn on turn
off in the turn back on I asked kingpin
about that once he said it charges the
caps oh it turned off again okay it's
posting oh my god it worked well I just
said skip and I didn't goes okay there
we go CP is currently running at 36 C 37
c it's running at 4.5 gigahertz
overclock why is it overclocked
it was like why not
we'll do a Cinebench run here first
monitor our temperatures things are
currently idling right now in the 20s
right there on our seventy seven forty X
Oh temperatures are sitting in the 50s
50 60 on the package 55 on the core so
I'm gonna do some Metro last light
because I still am a huge fan of how
much heat that can can actually generate
it's sitting at 69 c 99 percent
utilization hundred
utilization now and it bounces between
1860 1835 all the way up to 1936
depending on the scene this graphics
card in a standard case we usually sit
at about 70 to 72 anyway when it gets
completely heat soaked and saturated it
just dropped from 69 to 68 and we've
been running Metro last light now for a
few loops and it just simply doesn't
care in fact the fans have not even
ramped up so the bottom line here guys
is is not to say this is okay
it's to say that you're not going to
destroy your build or wreck your
components or whatever the internet will
try and have you believe especially if
you're a first-time builder I've get so
many messages from people that are just
terrified to build their own computer
because they go to places like Reddit
and various forums and they see these
these fear mongers that are out there
you can't do this you can't do you're
gonna ruin your computer sure these are
not best practices we do not recommend
or advocate for this type of build
procedure slamming stuff around touching
things and just being willy-nilly about
it the point of this video was to show
you that it is not easy to damage /
break or even eff up your build I
thought it was gonna be worse than this
quite honestly so get out there build
your computers get hands-on take the
pride of saying I built it and just
don't do what we did but obviously you
could see even if you do you're not
going to ruin it
guys we've done plenty of builds in the
past where we showed tutorials on how to
build it best practices and stuff so
stick around the channel subscribe if
you're new and you can just go to our
channel look up tutorial or how to build
a computer and you will find those
tutorials we've got more coming in the
future especially with new hardware
launches we'll talk about that also too
if you guys want to support with t-shirt
purchases you can get these link is in
the description below and don't forget I
do have a pretty epic giveaway that I'm
doing both with Kyle over at bit wit
were giving away a computer that he
built during man vs. build and I've also
got my own giveaway going on with
components to get your next build or
upgrade off on the right foot just don't
build it like we did here alright guys
thanks for watching and as always we
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
