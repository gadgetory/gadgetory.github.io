have been bugging me to do the for the
win 3 review from EVGA this is a highly
anticipated card and I'm not mistaken I
believe this is the first time EVGA has
incorporated three fans into the cooler
so when I asked you guys in the last
video which graphics card you really
wanted me to do many of you were
surprised I hadn't gotten my hands on
one of these yet you're right I didn't
get my hands on one I got my hands onto
you cooler masters master key Pro series
of keyboards offer 16.7 million color
RGB genuine cherry switches a variety of
sizes as well as surface mounted
controls allowing full customization
without the need for stand-alone
software learn more by following a link
down below now if you want your very own
EVGA GTX 1080 Ti for the win 3 the long
name they stick around to the end of the
video because we are giving away one of
these internationally well not one of
these these are actually mine these are
these are going into my personal rig ok
you can't have it but you can have one
exactly like it anywhere in the world
where giveaways are legal so with that
said stick around to the end of the
video to find out how but moving forward
here it is right here one of the most
anticipated cards of the year it's one
of EDG A's I believe the TV Jay's very
first design with a three fan cooler
which is kind of neat to see they've
always stuck to the two fan design and
what makes this one a little bit unique
is so far it's the only GT X 1080 that
I've seen that sticks with a 2 slot
width a lot of the cards that we've
looked at so far and cards that actually
have sitting upstairs waiting to be
reviewed and ones that are on their way
are all two-and-a-half slot it's a lot
of heat to maintain so they've decided
to just go ahead and go with bigger
coolers and because of Nvidia getting
away or doing away with 3-way 4-way SLI
is official support a lot of the
motherboards have spaced out their 16x
PCI Express slot which is good because
now the cards are separated enough to
where the extra thicknesses are going to
be a problem it's only be a problem if
you're running it on an older
motherboard that wants you to put the
two the two cards in the slots are right
next to each other if you're running a
two and a half slot card it's not going
to work now I still wouldn't recommend
running a card like this sandwiched up
against itself like this any motherboard
because as you can see you are going to
choke off one of the
those cards very badly when it comes to
airflow it is going to throttle so I
still wouldn't recommend doing that but
that's just worth mentioning at least
that's the reason why to slot in
two-and-a-half slot is even matters at
all
speaking of dimensions it actually
measures 11.8 inches long and five point
six inches high now because I said
inches in my last video you guys wanted
to castrate me for using imperial so
I'll go ahead and make the rest of the
world happy and let you know it is 299
million elite errs the familiar with our
liquids no all right by one hundred and
forty two point six millimeters tall in
the last video I also didn't show any
charts which made some people mad and
most people happy so I'm going to make
you in the middle we're going to put up
some fire strike scores compared to the
1080p eyes we've already taken a look at
on this channel so you can see how it
stacks up we're going to go ahead and do
that right now
now among the 410 ATT eyes we've taken a
look at and mind you with stuff three or
four more coming through here this is so
far top dog in terms of scores but as
you can see the scores are all very
close close enough to where the overall
gaming experience in a blind taste test
you would not be able to differentiate
one card from the other but hey at least
it gives you some sort of an idea of
where it stacks up so we're going to
focus on today is obviously the cooler
and what makes this card still kind of
stand out in the market it still has
their eye cx-9 sensor technology so it's
got sensors on the GPU it's got sensors
on the memory it's also got sensors on
the back side of the GPU as well as the
power delivery so you can keep an eye on
all of the temperatures going on in here
obviously that's because of the cooling
issue that they had with the for the
wind to card which unfortunately led to
some hotter than desirable experiences
with the graphics card so that's been
remedied here not only now had they
remedied it with a cooler design but you
can monitor it as well and they do have
patents on that I believe so I don't
know if anyone else can incorporate that
but it doesn't really matter because
you're getting it with this one
you got three fans here all three of
these fans are independently controlled
by the different temperatures on the PCB
so you have GPU fan curve controlling
one fan
memory fan curve controlling one fan and
then the power delivery controlling the
third fan now if you don't want them
independent you can link them so that
you could have one fan curve that
controls all three for the testing that
you guys saw though in temperatures
they were independently as they come out
of the box no adjustment of fan curve or
anything literally the settings were out
of the box but anyway moving on we've
got two eight pin power plugs on that
that's because we have a two hundred and
eighty watt power draw from this card up
30 watts from the 250 watt that ships
with the founders Edition card and you
have a dual BIOS I love that EVGA
includes dual BIOS on theirs on their
cards I mentioned before that a lot of
companies have done away with that and
they're now going with these profiles
basically they both boost the same the
difference is one has a higher power
target so you have more power draw
available to it but what I thought was
kind of confusing though is it's called
master and slave and I don't like that
not because it's called master and slave
that promise' the old IDE cable days
what what I don't like is it was
confusing
and I thought that master was going to
be the faster power target or the higher
power target bios but it's not the slave
is so my recommendation to them would be
to rename that maybe standard and OC
that way you know which one is better
suited for OC anyway moving on since
we're here here's the backplate vents
where it matters behind the GPU event or
it matters behind part of the power
delivery and then where the MOSFETs are
you have a solid piece of metal where
it's making contact through heat pads on
the backside of the power delivery as
well as the front side lots of heat pads
even the copper pipe we'll talk about
that a second so you have lots and lots
of cooling for the power delivery EVGA
was like ah not today when it comes to
the overheating once again to the prm's
I think they took a problem and I think
they might have overcompensated a little
bit that's okay
we like overcompensating some things
around here and the founders edition
card took away the DB I in lieu of
better airflow for the blower style
cooler EVGA puts it back which is nice
to see and you still have the HDMI and
two or three DisplayPort which is nice
to see one thing I'm not a fan of though
is I'm not fan of the size of the fonts
that faces you it's kind of nice that
you've got an LED that lights up this
right here but I think they made that a
little bit too big in my opinion it's
like really in your face especially we
have two of them in the system and they
light up it's really kind of
in-your-face they are RGB of course all
the LEDs on the card or RGB but they are
white out of the box now on the edge
right here you have the GPU memory and
power delivery LEDs again you can change
the color based on temperature now or
you can turn them off entirely if you
want these are just to give you kind of
a quick glance idea what the
temperatures are like of your particular
components if you're in a game and you
don't have an overlay up those are there
are end up talking about it let's go and
take the cooler off and show you what's
different because they change some stuff
inside the cooler as well this is kind
of a bitch to get off because it's cut
one two three four five power cables
that have like no slack on them you can
see right here where they flattened up a
pins where it makes contact with the
thermal pad which gives it better
adhesion and surface area to touch on
the pins when this is responsible for
cooling participating the heat coming
from the power delivery same thing right
here where touches the heat pipe and
that's what I want to talk about next
check this out so this is where I said
not only do they like solve the problem
they'll play
over-engineered it which I don't know if
it's really such a thing but anyway I
digress these are the pin fins and we
saw these on the icy X 1080 cooler but
one of the things that the CEO of the
company had told me was he didn't think
they were tall enough he want them to be
taller so that's exactly what they did
here I mean look at the additional
height of those pin fins that's pretty
that's pretty ridiculous there but the
idea is to get the heat again coming off
of the power delivery up into the air
flow right here you can see how that
middle fan pushes down right there so
there's where the middle fan pushes down
as well so the heat is going to be
dissipated out the sides there's more
surface area right here on the pin fins
that are pulling that heat up so they're
more like a cooling tower if you know
anything about how a heat sink works
it's just about surface area so it's go
ahead and pull this back and see what we
got for the power delivery cooling look
at that yeah so when they say we're not
going to make that mistake again this is
what they've done but you can see we
have a copper base right here that's
touching the VRMs not just an aluminum
piece or aluminium excuse me or wherever
you're from but you have a copper base
right here with the heat pipe coming
back over here as well so you've got a
lot of cooling for the for the vrm
that's a big deal
all right as long as one thing left to
do I don't know maybe force Nick to put
that one back together and we take this
one and we go and play around it and see
exactly how well it over flux here it is
right now on the slaves bios which
allows a little bit more power tardy but
we haven't just anything yet I haven't
touched any of the sliders I got the new
precision x OC running it's running at
nineteen hundred and sixty two megahertz
and 59 see guys this is 58 it's at 58 59
it's been running now for probably about
45 minutes in total because we've been
doing some testing on this to see if
this was like was something weird
happening here it's the it's the factory
fan curve now mind you on the slave BIOS
the factory fan crypt a little bit more
aggressive but it's still pretty damn
quiet and inside a case you wouldn't
hear that at all so keep in mind to open
air test bench testing means the only
thing limiting the cards temperature is
going to be the cards cooler itself so
make sure if you're putting this
obviously in a case you have good case
airflow and you should
similar results but 58 c57 see it's like
it has not even hit 60 yet with this
particular bios so on the master bios
which is the one that has a little bit
less power target and a little bit less
fan curve hit 6dc we never even saw 61
so that tells me we've got a lot of
headroom for overclocking that is
freaking amazing
this is what precision x OC looks like
for the IC x cards especially the for
the win three cards you've got three fan
curved here if this was a two fan card
you'd see two fan curves but you can
link them through these little link
buttons right here just like you would
sli cards you can see the separate
sensor temperatures by hitting the
sensor button here they are right there
so we can see the power temperature on
the back of the card the GPU temperature
the memory temperature surrounding the
cards you can really keep an eye on what
things look like the temperatures and
speeds you just saw we're all based on
factory fan curve and factory settings
now the GPU clock is not idling down so
we do have preferred performance mode
going in the 3d settings inside the
driver as well as because we're on the
slaves bios - it's going to keep the
fans running at all times so it's one of
the difference - between the master and
slave so as we're going to do we're
going to increase that power target
which is allowing up to 117 percent when
I put the priority at temperature so
that's 90 it's never going to hit
anywhere near that let's just try a
basic 100 megahertz offset on the core
and let's see what happens here I know
the text is really small but it ramped
up to 2,000 76 temperatures currently at
46 C it takes time for that to ramp up
and we didn't get any immediate crashing
so what I want to do now is one I want
to add just a little bit more frequency
it just drops to 20 63 so it starts kind
of high then it steps down as a temp
starts to come up a little bit so we're
going to do here to is I'm just going to
go ahead and add voltage let the voltage
go as high as it can which is 100% that
basically means you're not increasing
the voltage which you're increasing is
how early in the frequency range the
voltage will go to its max setting it's
part of that GPU boost 3.0 curve thing
I'm not a fan of it but that's just the
way it is we have to live with that so
I'm going to also bump this up to 125
keep in mind I have not had any 1080s
come through here yet and be able to
achieve a
above a 20 88 I'm also going to go into
the fan curve I'm going to set it to
aggressive see and we got an instant
crash with an additional 25 so I think
we're going to see about the same
Headroom unfortunately in the for the
wind three-card as we saw in just about
everything it's kind of funny how the
cores this seems to be a lot less
lottery involved in fact the lottery now
doesn't seem to be whether or not you
win it seems to be whether or not you
lose because most of the cores now reach
about the same Headroom mark and then
every now and then the loser is much
lower there's very few winners anymore
well unfortunately the second car didn't
beat the first one in fact it's a little
slower at 2025 so this one's about 30
megahertz faster a difference you
wouldn't even notice though if you put
these side by side that's still over 400
megahertz faster though than the actual
base clock of that GPU from Nvidia so
you're still getting a massive amount of
headroom because of GP boost 3.0 anyway
if you want to win your very own for the
win three icx graphics card 1080p eye
with this awesome looking shroud people
either love it or hate it
either way I really like the looks of
