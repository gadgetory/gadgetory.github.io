it is getting damn hot where I live here
in Southern California we are getting
well over a hundred degrees every single
day which i think is 32 degrees Celsius
I could be wrong I'm sorry guys I just
don't know and I got to thinking we've
talked about radiators and we've talked
about acrylic and PPG tubing we've
talked a little bit about fluid and
water blocks and all that sort of stuff
but we have not spent enough time on
Vance because its face it what good is a
awesome loop do you if you have
shitty-ass fans pushing air through your
radiator keeping the cooling capacity
lower than it really could be so today
we're gonna take a look at two new
products here from fractal design this
is their venturi line of fans brand
spankin new we really get the hf 14 and
the HP 14 i'm gonna assume the F stands
for air flow and I'm gonna assume the P
stands for air pressure now I went to
college to be able to to decipher that
so stay in school kids last year I took
a look at the game zero gaming headset
from Sennheiser and my friends over at
mass drop have just lined up a price
drop for this exact headset so head on
over to mass drop check out the link in
the description and you guys can save
some money on the game zero Sennheiser
headphones now both of these fans
feature a fluid dynamic bearing and and
you know what really kind of sets fans
apart from each other are their bearing
designs and it's actually important to
note depending on how you were going to
mount your fan the orientation it's
going to be in means that certain
bearing types may or may not perform
well and/or could even damage your fan
for instance some fans and this thing
actually is really tight in this box
I'm totally ripping it apart yep I
ripped it
sorry Josh you guys have made the
packaging Jay proof there we go wow that
is a weighty fan if you guys ever pick
up a fan it just feels light and cheap
well that's not the case here all right
so we were talking about bearings this
is a fluid dynamic bearing some bearings
depending on the kite there's a sleeve
bearing there's ball bearing there's
fluid dynamic bearing sometimes it's
actually not recommended to mount
certain fans in certain directions
depending on the bearing type so this is
a fluid dynamic bearing which means that
the actual shaft itself I said shaft the
shaft itself is being surrounded by
fluid now fractal design has actually
spent a lot of time on the bearing type
on these fans to make them extremely low
resistance which is going to help with
noise and power consumption of the fan
but it also means that they're going to
be very very well lubricated and it's
going to keep the lifespan of the fan at
its max now there's also a magnet inside
here that is going to kind of offset
some of the forces that happen when the
blades are moving who said every action
has an opposite and equal reaction but
that holds true for the fans too you've
got these blades that are going around
catching air and moving air one
direction well you can't have the air
moving that way if you're not having
equal pressure pushing back this way
because the only way that the air is
gonna move one direction is because it's
being pushed which takes force so it has
a magnet inside the bearing and in the
hub that is gonna counteract a lot of
that force which would normally push
just a standard cheapo fan back against
the hub housing which would cause
rubbing and wear so they're actually
combating that again for noise and
longevity of the fan the last thing I
want to mention about their hub which is
again found in both of these fans and
their fluid dynamic bearing is that
there are channels and grooves inside
there which are gonna allow the fluid to
have room to move around the shaft and
get a nice uniform coating again on the
show you know this is this is one of
those videos where I could just go
apeshit with the jokes but then again I
would get all the hate comments so I'll
just let you guys take it from here
but you get a nice equal distribution of
fluid around the bearing and around the
shaft which is going to keep it
extremely smooth in fact some fans when
I turn the blade and I know this freaks
some people out some people get all like
oh my god don't spin
with your fingers well you know the
world isn't exploding right now so but
it's very very low resistance some fans
if you turn them you can just feel they
almost feel a little brandy or just not
super smooth well this is I mean you you
barely touch that look how long that
spins so anyway this is the airflow fan
here it's got nice rubber isolating
mounts on here as you can see these bad
boys just pop off now why would that
matter why on earth would you care about
that well because as you can see here
they actually include a couple of
different mounting sets on here and
guess what now a hundred and forty
millimeter fan as long as you put these
on can now mount into a 120 millimeter
spot and it becomes basically just a
round fanned at that point so you have a
single fan
140 millimeter that can mount into 140
or 120 millimeter fan locations that is
something I really really like to see
I'm not aware of many fans on the market
that can do that obviously as you can
see here this rubber mounting is also
going to cause vibration reduction and
noise reduction when it comes to the the
vibration of the fan being transferred
into the case or the radiator or
whatever you haven't mounted so that is
the airflow fan effect if I can get this
stupid thing back in because the rubber
on this thing is actually really tight
the other thing I want to point out on
here is that they use a very high grade
casing for this fan in the fan shroud
it's very very sturdy it doesn't feel
like it's gonna flex around like many
other fans do all right so really that's
not an application issue that's just the
j' ism having a hard time putting rubber
in the in the groove there which is just
kind of ironic makes me wonder how the
heck I ever got two kids out of the deal
alright so included with the packaging
you also get a voltage reducer so this
is gonna allow you to slow this the fan
speed down as well if you don't have it
hooked up to any sort of a fan
controller so now we'll just kind of
take a quick look over here at the
static pressure version of the fan this
does appear to be a pwm fan the airflow
fan here is a three pin
this looks like it's gonna be a PWM
because it actually has a PWM splitter
yes the static pressure fan is a PWM so
they're a little bit different they're
exact same fluid dynamic bearing design
same accessories come with the fan and
once we pull this thing out of here
you'll see that the fan blade shape is
obviously that of static pressure
optimized
so what that means is you're gonna I'm
just gonna rip the Box open and I don't
even care I don't even care anymore
just whatever find something to put it
in alright so as you can see the fan
blades are much bigger there's less fan
blades but there's also less gap between
the fan blades so if you look at the
airflow fan here on top versus the
static pressure fan here on the bottom
you can see that there's very little
room for the air to go once the fan
blade actually scoops it whereas the
airflow fan has a much more straight
airflow through the blade where the
static pressure fan scoops it and really
sends it out the sides of the fan under
much higher pressure which is how it can
push through radiators and things so why
don't we go ahead and take the static
pressure fan we'll mount that one to a
radiator and then we'll go ahead and do
an airflow test real quick here with the
140 millimeter airflow fan we'll just
see how much air it's moving and how
loud the damn thing is what do you think
sound like a good idea
alright let's do it
all right so as you can see I have my
mic unhooked here because I'm gonna be
using it to kind of listen to different
points of the fan to get noise so first
up is 140 millimeter version this is a
three pin not a PWM we'll be hooking it
up to the motherboard and letting the
motherboard run a hundred percent so
we'll see how loud it is like this how
much air it moves based on the piece of
paper and then we'll put in the voltage
reducer and we'll see how that does
alright so there it is at 100% it's
actually moving quite a bit of air as
you can see by that piece of paper there
the fan isn't dead silent but it's
pretty it's pretty quiet let's listen to
it a hundred percent and I'll put the
mic up near the hub so you can hear the
motor noise
and to give you an idea of how much air
it's actually moving you can hear the
wind noise I mean look at that look at
that of all the fans I've tested I've
never had the piece of paper stand
straight out that's insane
okay so here it is what the voltage
reducer on there you can see there's
still quite a bit of air moving can
definitely feel it here's the noise and
in comparison
yeah I would definitely use the voltage
reducer you're not really sacrificing
much in terms of air flow it's damn near
silent and as you can see by the piece
of paper you still have quite a bit of
airflow
okay now I'm the first to admit this
isn't exactly the most optical
application considering you know as you
can see there the fan itself is bigger
than the radiator so they do make 120
millimeter versions of these fans and I
don't have a hundred and forty
millimeter radiator sitting around not
being used so I figured this is more or
less morbid curiosity to see how well
it's going to perform there are some
gaps on each side of the radiator here
so there is gonna be some air loss there
but I guess this will be a good
interesting test just to see how it does
just for the sake of science Wow but as
you can see oops yeah as you can see it
is certainly moving the paper through
the radiator stand it up straight let's
go ahead and stop it so yeah you can see
it is it is definitely moving the paper
through the radiator I need to get my
hand on some 120s though so I could
really test this in a radiator
application so Josh if you're watching
we need some 120s dude well yeah you can
certainly feel the air coming through
the fins not the there's a little bit
getting stuff right there but as you can
see I'm blocking that with my hand and
it's not really affecting the airflow so
well I'm actually kind of impressed with
that so that means if you had a proper
fitting fan on 120 on there you could
slow it down and still get equal amount
of aesthetic pressure going through
there look that flag looks like at the
way being like a flag
well all-in-all I have to say I think
fractal design has got one hell of a
winner here you know I think if I had
any gripe honestly it would be the light
colored the light blue color that's
sitting here on the fan hub but most of
the time you're not going to see that
because the part that's facing you is
pretty much solid hub here that's not
in-your-face and if it was pushing air
through a radiator again that's the way
it would look like that if it's in the
back year
case it would be like this so you
wouldn't really see that but I would I
do think an all solid black or even
black and gray design would look at me I
think the only other thing to that I'd
like to see in these would be other
colors now I know fractal design is very
monochrome with the black and the white
but if they started offering a way to
get custom colors in these I know we're
talking like you know they just launched
these so it's kind of like skipping way
ahead to start talking about colors then
it would be an absolute the only fan at
the current point of making this video
that I would recommend because you could
customize it to your case or your build
aesthetic get static pressure or airflow
options we've got the rubber mount so
it's not gonna be making noise and they
look fantastic so you could technically
mod this too and paint the shroud leave
the fins black and leave the rubber
black and you have two-tone fan so I
could think of all sorts of uses for
this fan the performance is there the
cables links are pretty adequate they're
not too short not too long so it'd be
easy to manage all black cables that are
running into the hub so the little wires
there aren't gonna be you know red
yellow and green like they tend to be in
other fans and you have a nice sleeve
cable on top of that so it goes to show
that fractal design really spent a lot
of time and effort designing these fans
and so if you're looking for fans for
radiators before your cases or for both
then it's definitely a fan worth
checking out so there you go guys that
was my look here at the venturi fans I
know it was kind of a long video for
fans but it was definitely worth taking
a look at I'm glad I looked at these
anyway tell me what you guys use what
are your favorite fans and why fans are
one of those things where there's so
many options on the market I think
people get a little bit lost on trying
to decipher which fan to go with and why
I mean there's so many different bearing
types so many different blade types you
got LED fans you got this just so many
freakin options so tell me what you guys
are using you might be able to help
someone out down in the comments if you
can you know articulate clearly why
you're using the fan that you are so
with that said I'm gonna go ahead and
get the heck on out of here guys
know as always as my eyes are burning
here looking at these lights
