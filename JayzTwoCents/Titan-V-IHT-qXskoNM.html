gonna do a talking head videos so feel
free to go ahead and minimize this and
just listen while you're doing your
things unless you want to look at my
beautiful face here coming at you in
beautiful 4k you know you see my face in
4k oh that's so we're gonna talk about
Titan Volta because ever since it
launched last week my social media has
been exploding what people wanted me to
do a rant video and today we're gonna
talk about it we're talk about Titan
Volta my thoughts on it whether I'm
gonna use it moving forward and what we
could some predictions that we can
expect to see in the future
today's video is brought to you by
precision camera and video and their new
YouTube video kids step up your online
presence with these hand-picked kits
tailored specifically for various price
points which include everything you need
to get started in video creation right
now if you use promo code J's two cents
at checkout you get an extra hood man 32
gigs deal card with the purchase of any
kit for all your camera and video needs
head to precision - video comm now in
the past I've done my rant videos some
of which are very satirical where I'm
screaming and yelling and throwing
things and burning fake money for the
purposes of entertainment so Nvidia
decided to go ahead and come out with
the GTX Titan and they didn't call it
the 695 or the 685 like a lot of people
were thinking because it has the gk110
chip in it when we talking here
$6.99 right 650 something like that
$1000 they review this thing I'm fuckin
$1000 I think I've come up with a more
productive way to burn $1000 Nvidia
Titan that's what it does for your money
so Nvidia held their low key no today
I'm gonna try and stay calm on this one
what is Titan Z it's two of these on one
card with 12 gigs of gddr5 so how much
does the Titan Z cost it costs $3,000
why does one plus one equal three if you
are gonna spend $3,000 on one card the
joke is really on you I mean seriously
yeah so the first titan card I actually
got my hands on was not the Titan or the
Titan black or the Titans II it was the
Titan X the Maxwell Edition Titan X of
course they didn't even send me one but
maybe they were afraid I don't know
because of the fact that they know that
I was gonna tell everybody that the
Titan was just a piece of Shh
grey back so ups just dropped off a
package from Nvidia Corp well it's not
ticking that's a good sign
I mean it's just but it could it's a
tightened wrapping you know I cut my
foot open I actually cut my find
bleeding right I'm bleeding what now you
see what happens when you get a tight
necks you cut yourself
thanks and vidya which unfortunately
turned out to be one of the most
confusing naming conventions of any
graphics card in history as far as i'm
concerned because you have three titan x
cards which are all different so you got
the tight next maxwell card branded
right here right GeForce GTX you've got
the Titan X and then you've got the
Titan X P the problem was we dubbed the
Titan X Titan XP because this X already
existed and then Nvidia decided to go
ahead and come out with their own what
they called Titan XP so we've got tight
next tight next big P and tight next
little peak fast forward now to 2017
we've got Titan Volta or Titan V so I
got Titan X and Titan V a card that is
dubbed as being an AI and deep-learning
monster but for the first time that
might actually be true because the
problem was they said that about the
Titan XP and the Titan X even but the
problem was the architecture was
identical to the gaming card it just had
more CUDA cores and more memory and they
were just calling it a deep learning
card but the architecture was identical
and the problem wasn't even what I
called them out into my last video was
they were like it's not a gamers card
it's not for gaming but they put GeForce
GTX right on the side of every single
one of them which was obviously just
kind of a big load of crap but I digress
because Titan V they actually removed
the GTX on the side now and it just says
Titan because what they are doing is
they are stripping Titan out of the GTX
lineup and making it specifically its
own Titan lineup so we might even see
some bigger or smaller Titan cards come
out as we move forward with Volta which
is of course Nvidia's HBM to
implementation running on a 12 nanometer
FinFET process three stack memory of
course and the inclusion of tensor cores
which are there specifically to aid in
the applications that will take
advantage of them for things like deep
learning ai
and apparently cryptocurrency mining is
taking huge advantage of this as well
but at $3,000 who knows how profitable
it will be for now but other channels
are talking about that I'll put some
links to those down below go and check
them out if you're interested in Titan V
from that aspect of it what I want to
talk about here is some of my
predictions on it now Titan V has got
5120 CUDA cores where we had 3840 CUDA
cores on the Titan XP that's a
significant jump now games use CUDA
cores games that use tensor core so
already that the fact that they say that
this is not a gamers card is in fact
true where in the past it was just a
marketing I was just a line of marketing
right it was marketing meat spinning if
you what's called meat spinning right
spin doctoring is what I tried to say
about mean spin came out but it's got 12
gigabytes of HP m2 which is a
significant improvement over what we saw
at HP m1 on a AMD si which had four gigs
and then of course you know you've got
the Vega cards which have eight gigs now
we've got 12 gigs of HB m2 but the 640
tensor course is sitting alongside the
5120 CUDA cores definitely make all of
the processes that can be used with
professional workloads again the Nvidia
is deeply invested in AI and deep
learning they're always going to push
that but that's just one aspect of what
the accelerated graphics are able to do
in professional environments so that
being said that makes it truly not eight
gamers card so if you ran out and you
spent $3,000 on this card for the sake
of gaming you got a 30% improvement
anywhere between 25 to 30% improvement
over Pascal and the standard
architecture for the well additional
cost of twelve hundred dollars versus
three thousand dollars so we're talking
eighteen hundred dollars more for 25 to
30% obviously a really bad investment
for gamers but if we talk about the fact
that the additional 5121 additional but
the total of 5120 cuda cores at fourteen
hundred and fifty five megahertz boost
clock which is significantly slower than
pascal and the fact that we're seeing
that level of improvement means that we
could see some great things when the
card is actually designed for
gamer's now whether or not we're gonna
actually see Volta and HBM - for gaming
is yet to be seen I don't know what the
limitations are going to be into it when
it comes to court clock because you
remember HBM specifically the GPU and
AMD side was a fairly poor overclocker
at HP m1 vega significantly better but
still not great I'm really curious to
see what's gonna happen with
overclocking on a more mainstream volt
card and whether or not we'll see it now
GDC and GTC tend to be the platforms for
obviously graphics technology and that's
when we could probably expect to see
something new coming we've also we also
know that in video is going to be doing
a keynote at CES but typically in the
past that's where they talk about their
specific deep learning and AI
integration into automotive so I'm
expecting to see some stuff there but I
also saw some blurbs about new hardware
coming out at CES my hope is that we'll
see some new graphics cards then
specifically because I'm doing new
builds now I'm doing the post blown
build I'm doing my build and some stuff
coming forward I would hate to have to
do new graphics cards once those launch
I'd like them all to be ready at the
beginning of the year that way I don't
have to redo loops later on but such as
a builder's life right things happen and
you upgrade as they come along but I
think it's more likely we'll probably
see something around the spring because
GDC GTC that's the stage for graphics
technology and I think we're gonna need
some time here to get Voltas
manufacturing process going for us to
see some bin GPUs that might make their
way down into the mainstream in gaming I
don't think you're gonna see a mid a
mid-range HBM card just because of
manufacturing of it is still slow
expensive which is obviously I was
seeing $3,000 graphics cards here from
Nvidia obviously we don't need the
tensor course on any of those graphics
cards for gamers because that would just
be wasted money I'm hoping that's where
a lot of the prices right now when it
comes to this expensive graphics card
but I think if we were able to reduce
the core count a little bit increase the
frequency get rid of the tensor cores
maybe even get rid of some of that
memory bring it back down to eight gigs
or even ten gigs we could probably see
graphics cards around the $1,500 range I
know that makes it sound like well
that's such a great deal versus volta
but if you look at you know they're
probably going to start the stack
at the top and work their way down maybe
a 20 80 or 20 80 TI and Volta being
around 1,200 bucks for 1,500 bucks these
are just predictions that's what I'm
expecting to see I don't think we're
gonna see them go below $1,000 though in
terms of gaming so I mean you're gonna
be stuck with Pascal tight performance
for a while that's my that's my guess
we're at I read at cusp right now of the
evolution of graphics cards and it's not
gonna be a cheap one now I don't think
you should be holding your breath for
Volta and I hope I'm wrong but I don't
think you should be holding your breath
for gaming Volta I don't think it's
gonna be that affordable I don't think
it's gonna be a for the masses card I
think it's gonna be a for the rich and
the enthusiast cards but I really do
hope I'm wrong so that being said I'm
now so not holding my breath for Volta
and I'm not waiting for it I hope we see
something at CES for gamers if not I'm
still gonna move forward with 1080 Ti
and Titan XPS on the gaming builds that
I'm doing moving forward but yeah that's
it that's my opinion you guys are
waiting to see 5120 CUDA cores seeing a
30% improvement in gaming over the 30
840 CUDA cores in Titan X P and the was
at 35 60 I think it was in the standard
tight next and 1080 Ti that's obviously
a very bad investment if you bought it
for gaming one of the thing I want to
mention too though is there was a lot of
people saying you can't sli it and it
doesn't even work with NV link well
their website says it works with
next-gen NV link so but not for gaming I
mean NV link is is again all about
spreading out professional workloads I
don't think NV leak even works in games
but I haven't tested cuz I don't have
any of these cards and I thought about
dropping 3k just to do a video on this
but I'll be honest it would be a bad
move for me because I have no use for it
so I'm not gonna spend 3,000 on that I'd
rather spend 3,000 on a found a couple
of two terabyte nvme SSDs that makes
more sense to me but I'm gonna go guys
tell me your thoughts about Titan Volta
I thought I would see more pushback from
the crowd on its performance and price
and all of that but the only people that
really seem to be interested obviously
are those people that can actually
leverage the amount of power and if
you're a cryptocurrency miner or
whatever I mean I don't know the
calculations are about $3,000 per
graphics card I have to wonder how long
it would take to make your money back
then again with the way that LTC and
coin and everything is just keeps going
through the roof you probably make your
money back pretty quickly anyway I'm
gonna go sound off with your opinions
down in the comments below and if you
guys want to get some merch obviously
I'm wearing my shirt that make great
Christmas gifts is I'm telling myself
that link to that stuff in merch is down
below as well guys thanks for watching
and as always I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
