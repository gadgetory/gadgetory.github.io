and if you've looked at the title of
this video a lot of you may already be
in a very bad mood and if that's the
case here out this video listen what I
have to say and make your judgments at
the end of this video in january i'm
going to be heading to the consumer
electronics show in las vegas which is a
very expensive week-long world expo that
is the world stage for all new and
emerging technology in the world and i
want to bring you guys the highest level
of coverage that I possibly can and for
that it costs a great deal of expense
and time to be able to bring you guys
the level of dedication and the level of
quality that I feel as technology
subscribers to jsu sense which is why
i'm giving you guys the opportunity to
contribute through a fundraiser if you
feel you would like to do so now i want
to make this very clear i am not asking
for your donation I'm not asking for
your fundraising monetary supplement
whatever you want to call it I've never
done anything like this and if you guys
have been following me on Twitter or
hanging out with me on twitch you know
right off the bat I've actually been
very against this idea but because of
the overwhelming support that you guys
are showing me and this idea I've
decided to go ahead and give it a shot
and just see what happens now a couple
of things that you guys need to know one
I know you guys are saying you're paid
youtuber what about that money I can
promise you every single penny that I
make is going towards CES it's going
towards new equipment it is going
towards better sound equipment
microphones it's going towards the stuff
I need to bring you guys a higher level
of quality with the channel none of that
money makes it into my private bank
account but you guys have to understand
that when it comes to an event like CES
the small amount of money that I
actually make through the ad revenue on
the YouTube channel won't even scratch
the cost that takes to cover something
like a week-long expo of CES hotels are
super expensive meals and eating out for
an entire week is very very expensive
not to mention the fact that i'm going
to miss a week of work simply to go and
bring you guys this type of coverage
which
I'm going to be depleting vacation funds
without actually going on vacation now a
lot of you guys right away or thing are
screaming a beggar a beggar this is not
begging this is giving you guys a means
to contribute because many of you asked
me how you can contribute to this
channel so this is what this is if you
don't want to contribute monetarily
absolutely fine I don't want a dime from
you if it means that you got to take out
money from your family or your bank
account or your needs I don't want your
cash trust me on that I would rather
have your view I would definitely like
to have all of your views anyway but
this is nothing more than giving you
guys the ability to contribute what it
takes to cover an event like this which
is very very taxing being away from the
family alone for an entire week is gonna
be very difficult right away I know some
of you guys are going over to social
blade you guys are typing in there
saying oh look it says on there he's
making sixteen thousand dollars a year
yeah I want to educate you guys a little
bit on social blade first of all you got
a notice that there's a huge range on
there it says 1.5 thousand to 16,000 or
whatever it is or something like that in
my channel you guys have to realize when
it comes to social blade I have no idea
where they get their there's their stats
from but most youtubers are making
almost all the way to the left on that
column there is no way in hell I'm
making anywhere near the money that
they're saying that I am honestly what I
do I do for you guys that's why I do so
many giveaways that's why I'm getting
ready to announce a huge giveaway pile
coming next month because of my one year
anniversary here on YouTube and I think
that you guys who've been following me
long enough know that everything that I
do I give back to this channel there is
no greediness involved which I know a
lot of people are going to wonder about
now with all that said and done if you
don't feel like contributing to the
fundraiser hey that is absolutely fine a
lot of people may say I don't have any
money to donate I don't have you know
ten dollars twenty dollars whatever I'm
not looking for that one dollar can make
a huge difference and I sound like one
of those you for thirty-five cents a day
can help feed a child in South Asia that
this isn't what i'm doing here guys I'm
simply trying to bring you the highest
level of quality that it possibly can if
you don't like it and you want to
unsubscribe or you want to call me an e
beggar or you just want to hate more
power to you guys are free to do that
but I would hope by now you guys realize
it I'm enough kind of person that's here
be begging for money
I've simply giving you guys a way to
contribute to the channel if you should
like to do so a lot of you guys asked
for it and that's exactly what I'm doing
I hope you guys will be understanding I
hope you guys will stick around and
watch the videos regardless of what your
opinion is on the matter and with that I
will see you guys in my next video we've
done three a row three in a row three
days in a row I'm just I'm on fire here
literally anyway I'll see you guys later
thanks for watching I'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
