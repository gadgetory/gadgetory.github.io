I am bringing you what I believe is the
very first review of MSI's new gtx 980ti
gaming 6g graphics card this was
actually one that was highly highly
requested by the audience because people
are quickly becoming a big fan of msi
and what they're doing with the gaming
line and you guys wanted to see it well
guess what they reached out to me and we
are the first ones to get our hands on
it the octane gaming gear combo from
coolermaster features seven backlighting
colors turbo mode a vago 3050 optical
sensor along with four levels of dpi
adjustment now you can po noobs without
boning your wallet click the link in the
description to learn more you guys know
how we do these reviews a lot of people
have asked me why I'm not doing a live
benchmarking anymore which is where I
was playing a game on you know the card
while talking about it that's because I
can't get as much done with the video it
takes longer to create that video
meaning the video is longer and I don't
get to show you guys as much as I want
to so I'd rather keep the information
more concise especially when we're
looking at a graphics card here that you
know it's this is the fourth time we've
take a look at a 980ti
so if I had to make some early
predictions with this card I say that it
would pretty much perform better than
reference and right around you know
where the other custom boards are that
we've taken a look at now back in the
beginning MSI's twin frozer was pretty
much just a custom cooler that was put
on to a reference card
in fact my 680 that I used to have was
an MSI twin frozer that I was able to
put a reference ek water block on
because like I said it was just a
reference card but that's not the case
anymore
MSI has really gone above and beyond
when it comes to their gaming line where
they're bringing you more than just
reference stuff with better cooling on
there they are bringing you full custom
PCBs custom cooling options
I mean they've really gone all out to
make these cards absolutely fantastic
and as best as they possibly can now
let's go ahead and start with the cooler
since that's you know the thing that you
always see it is a red and black as
their standard cooler and they did on
the 960 offer a green and black one
which was an anniversary or a kind of a
milestone commemoration card of them
selling something like 100
million graphics cards so the standard
color is red and black which you know
it's going to kind of clash with some
people just looking to do builds that
maybe your blue orange green black that
is it would look it just all black but
if you're going for like a stealthy
build then the black and red would
probably not be your thing but with that
said if it is your thing and you don't
mind the fact that it's red and black
you are going to find two large 100
millimeter fans on here with lots of
fins which are going to give you good
static pressure through the massive
heatsink that's on here giving you tons
and tons and tons of surface area for
cooling we've got four heat pipes in
here there copper heat pipes that are
nickel-plated they do believe it looks
like they're a mix of six and eight
millimeter pipes on there so you're
going to get a lot of cooling and they
do run the length of the card now
instead of like some graphics cards that
are running them long ways when it comes
to the heat pipe they are running a bend
design where they come up and down
through the front and the back and then
the heat is dissipated out the bottom of
the card and the top of the card so
instead of long straight heat pipes that
come out the back they are coming out
the top and out the bottom as you can
see now the vrm on this is cooled by a
heat sink but it is not touching the
major heat sink in fact the VRMs &amp;amp;
MOSFETs here have their own black
heatsink that are it's pretty beefy
actually the whole rear portion of the
card is a heatsink that's under the main
cooler so the downdraft air of this
cooler is going to be cooling off that
heatsink so I guess it's going to we're
going to see how the overclocking does
on this thing if the vrm start to get
hot fortunately on the nvidia side the
VRMs don't tend to get incredibly hot
like they do on AMD where AMD cards can
be held back by terrible vrm cooling
that doesn't usually seem to be the case
with Nvidia graphics cards so I don't
anticipate this here being a problem now
does require to 8-pin PCI Express power
plugs and that is because this is a
custom PCB as I mentioned before
speaking of custom PCB it is a tall PCB
as you can see here it is taller than
the mounting point here for the bracket
so you can see this is going to be
pretty a pretty high card when it comes
to height so you're going to want to
make sure that this fits in your case
make sure you check out the specs for
that before
you go buying this card if you're
putting this and say a small form-factor
build but other than that if you're
using a standard chassis I don't see
this being any sort of an issue on the
top right here you have an MSI logo that
does light up white it is not an RGB it
does not change color but it is white
and it does show when you have your
graphics card oriented the normal way as
you can see it's just it's very
attractive-looking that this is this is
kind of the side you're going to see
right there when it's installed and it
does look pretty damn good
speaking of looking nice they have what
I think are one of the best looking back
plates on the market with its blast bead
blasted finish but polished dragon logo
on there so you can see depending on how
the light hits it you know you do have
the there we go there's the light
there's the light you do have your
dragon logo which is kind of ghosted
into there and then you've got holes on
the back here as well to let heat out of
the backplate so it doesn't become an
insulator so the back plates giving
rigidity to the card but also allowing
there to be airflow through the
backplate which isn't going to you know
insulate any sort of heat in there now
before we stick this on the test bench
is one other thing worth mentioning of
course you have two sli fingers on here
because it is capable with four-way SLI
but there is no there's no other BIOS on
this it's a single BIOS card so if
you're going to be doing BIOS flashing
you definitely want to pay attention to
what you're doing because you could
easily break this card if it was a dual
BIOS card you could you know flash back
using the other BIOS but other than that
I don't see there really being any
reason to do BIOS flashing I I did it on
my Titans and I did it on my standard
980 s and I didn't see any sort of
improvement but anyway that really comes
down to ASIC quality and overclocking
and voltage so we'll talk about that in
a different video if you guys want me to
talk more about ASIC quality and where
it stands and how it affects
overclocking maybe I'll do a video on
that tell me in the comments if you guys
want to see that so with that out of the
way let's go ahead and benchmark this
thing and let's see how it does I
already have a pretty good idea of how
it's going to do I don't think it's
going to be any surprise but let's go
ahead and find out anyway transition
well the numbers should be absolutely no
surprise to you honestly because this is
the 4th 980ti we've taken a look at and
it is the second custom PCB board that
we've looked at and they are pretty much
right in line with each other I mean
we're talking one or two FPS difference
at the most which is easily accounted
for and margin of error I mean different
things running in the system even though
I make sure all background processes are
ended you know there's a lot of
different things that can happen that
can account for one or two fps not to
mention we're not running at the exact
same you know frequency on all of the
cards now this card was running fifteen
hundred and fourteen megahertz which was
nice to see a solid speed above 1500
that's kind of been the magical number
lately for graphics cards is 1500
especially on the Mac Maxwell
architecture we've got over 1500 on GM
204 which was like really awesome
because we thought well if GM 204 can do
1500 then GM 200 would probably do a lot
less because that was kind of the way it
was back in the past with Kepler and
Fermi but this time around we're still
exceeding 1500 megahertz even on the big
GPU so that's nice to see where you get
all the CUDA cores and the core speed to
go along with it now I've become more
and more impressed with MSI's time goes
on back when their Twin Frozr was
nothing more than an upgraded cooler on
a reference card to them upgrading you
know the Twin Frozr over time through
various generations I believe this is
the Twin Frozr 5 cooler on here now and
now the gaming series cards custom PCBs
completely designed from the ground up
all cooling aspects considered RAM is
cooled VRMs are cooled backplate looks
fantastic on there and I think it really
shows that a brand like MSI is really
working hard to compete to earn your
hard-earned dollars I mean when it comes
to buying a graphics card you know that
there is just so
any options out there it can become very
very daunting it's like it's like going
clothes shopping with the wife right if
you're married you have a girlfriend you
go gone clothes shopping with them you
know you've you've got to look at every
little thing you've got to try on every
single thing and unfortunately graphics
cards are that way there's just so many
of them but it looks good as long as
you're looking for a red and black build
of course that is a going to be a
turn-off for people that are building a
blue system or a green system or just a
plain stealth black system so if you're
into the red and black then it's
definitely going to be a cooler that
looks really really nice the white
glowing LED on top gives you a little
bit of added bling and of course the
nickel-plated heat pipes in the cooler
just make it look it's kind of got that
racing header feel so it's really neat
in terms of aesthetics I think MSI is
really nailed it on the head and I think
that's why they stuck with this cooler
through the 980ti generation instead of
going with you know twin throws or six
or whatever they're maybe working on the
last thing I wanted to mention was the
lack of coil wine you know one of the
things people really complained about
with the nine seventy cards was coil
wine was absolutely terrible
well there's zero coil wine in this card
in fact this card got up to 69 percent
fan speed and still remained extremely
quiet quieter than the pump and the
system fans that are on the radiator and
keep blowing air across my motherboard
so they've done a fantastic job at
making sure that your gaming experience
is not intruded upon or intrudes upon
interpret upon words are not my forte
okay I don't even know forte is the
right word but MSI has done a great job
at making sure that your games are not
going to be interrupted by the sound of
at least your graphics card anyway the
rest of the system is entirely up to you
so there's my two cents on the msi 980ti
gaming 6g from well msi i think it's a
fantastic card you really can't go wrong
with it the performance is there the
sound level is low the coil whine is
non-existent in overclocking is clearly
there at over 1500 megahertz on this
sample which is a retail sample so I I
assume it would be pretty near at least
1450 or higher that would be my guess as
to where pretty much most cards would
land in so that's all for today if you
guys have enjoyed today's video and you
happen to stumble across here wants go
ahead and click that subscribe button it
doesn't kind
anything other than a little bit of your
time which you know admittedly you'll
never get back but maybe you'll learn
something and you know we're going to
have a lot more tutorials and things
coming up here in the near future if you
guys are already subscribed to the
channel make sure you head on over to
social media that's where I spend a lot
of my time on Twitter and the Facebook
every now and then I admit I'm not the
greatest Facebook or out there I I think
it's just I don't know I don't know what
it is about Facebook it's personally not
my thing but I do what I can to try and
keep everybody happy so anyway guys I'm
go ahead and get the heck on out of here
we got a lot more coming up and I better
get back to work so with that go ahead
and others - and get the heck out of
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
