two cents bringing you an update on
project red missed part three now we got
some stuff going on here with the rigid
tubing didn't get as much done as I
would have liked to have but anyway I'm
going to bring you a small update just
showing you what we did manage to get
done before I get into this I just want
to go ahead and let you guys know that I
am going to be heading to Chicago this
week for the entire week got some videos
queued up for you guys but this is going
to be a short update here on part three
didn't get a whole lot done and the
reason for that is the buyer decided he
wants to go with the new PE TG tubing
which is not acrylic it's supposed to be
a better material harder material
supposed to bend a little bit better so
anything that you see here tubing wise
is pretty much just a mock-up where I'm
getting all my planning ready which I
mentioned in part 2 planning is key
especially when once you bend this stuff
it never goes back straight so you're
kind of stuck with it so what do we get
done this time around
all right so this time around as you can
see here we do have a piece of acrylic
tubing that's got kind of a funky Bend
in there I like the way that that looks
because I want to try and keep as many
right angles as I can in this and as I
mentioned this is just a mock-up this is
not perfect by any means in fact the
bend right here I'm not too happy with
the problem with that is I've got a 90
followed by another 90 going to you know
completely perpendicular to each other
which makes a very difficult Bend
especially since when you heat up this
part of the acrylic right here to get
this Bend inevitably it's going to heat
up this part a little bit which causes
it to lose some of its nice squared you
know perfect tea angle overall I guess
in the radius if that makes any sense
but this is not perfect by any means but
this is going to serve as a perfect
mock-up or template for me to follow
when I get the new tubing in stock or in
here which is what we're going to use so
this inevitably is coming out I'm going
to end up leaving these two pieces in
here on the bridge I made for the two
graphics cards because these are such
short little pieces right there whether
they're acrylic or PE TG won't matter
whatsoever same with this piece right
here between the CPU block and the
motherboard block so that's going to be
remaining in there this is going to
change right here
now some people asked me after part two
with the Southbridge block is right in
between the graphics card so how you
going to make that work well obviously
that has what we've got right here now
I've got about maybe about two inches of
clearance between the top of the card
right here or I guess that would be the
edge of the card and the tube which is
going to allow me to be able to remove
this card if I need to and if I need to
remove that card I can just loosen up
these two threading threads there loosen
up the bottom card they'll come apart
pull those tubes out and it'll come
right out so it is going to be able to
be removable the only downside to how
tight it is in here is to get the
Southbridge tube out right here you do
have to remove the top card so that's
why leak testing and allof head's going
to be very very important because
getting out this tube right here and
getting the new one in is actually a lot
harder than it looks so anyway there's
that now here's how I've decided I'm
going to go ahead
and route it I'm going to have the
reservoirs over here and as I mentioned
earlier I have a very special plan or
maybe I didn't mention it yet either way
I have a special very special plan for
the reservoirs and how I want to handle
that if you recall in part 2 I wasn't
sure what I wanted to do so I've come up
with a really neat plan and that's one
of the hold ups was we had to order some
parts for that now when it comes to the
floor right here instead of ordering the
solid panel I wanted to give the buyer
an option or flexibility in the future
if he wants to do something with the
middle here so naturally we have these
three fan cutouts here in this big cut
out there that are a little bit ugly but
what I'm planning on doing with this is
doing an acrylic floor that way it's
going to be nice and smooth that I can
drill my holes and things into that and
just remove these plates when it comes
time to you know put them through the
floor that way I'm not actually drilling
into the floor of these I'm drilling
into the acrylic if that makes sense so
it allows him to have more flexibility
without having to drill holes in the
floor if all goes according to plan
anyway so what I'm going to do with the
routing of this I'm going to have the
reservoirs over here up and down they're
not going to be horizontal sorry guys
who thought that would be cool the
problem is as the tubes would be coming
off the side over here it's too much of
a crazy Bend to get back so I went ahead
and scrap that idea but the bottom loop
here for the graphics cards is going to
be reservoir down into the floor down
into the pump and then up into here it's
going to split both cards and it's going
to come back out here and go back down
to the bottom so the only thing you're
going to really see on the graphics card
loops is going to be these two tubes
right here where it goes into the floor
there and then where it goes back to the
reservoir is going to be a 90 Bend right
here and it's going to come back and
into the reservoir I want more tubes
visible up top just because if you're
going through all of the planning and
all of the trouble of acrylic bending
you might as well have them visible so
some of the tubes will go through the
floor some of them will be coming back
to the reservoir now when it comes to
the motherboard and CPU loop it's going
to be basically the same thing the to
the reservoir which is closest to it is
actually going to feed it it's going to
go from the reservoir into this fitting
here out into the CPU block out of the
CPU block into the motherboard
vrm block out of the vrm with a bend
that comes straight out and straight up
into the radiator and that's going to
come out of the radiator either into the
top of the res or it's going to go
flexible tubing behind the motherboard
tray
whichever looks cleanest so once I get
those parts in I can start planning for
that and then we'll go from there
the only other thing I really got done
was I've got the Flex base removed and I
got the ventilated Bay's in there but I
can't put the fans or the radiators in
yet because the buyer decided he wants
to go with the I can remember the brand
but he wants to go with some custom-made
filters so till I get those filters I
can't put that stuff together so
unfortunately since part two happened I
was like part blocks on doing most of
anything I wanted to do so I allowed it
allowed me to get some things done do
some brainstorming and you know I wish
I'd gotten more done in the last week
unfortunately this is all we were able
to get done but as you can see we are
starting to get some progress made so
guys this has been part three here of
project red mist hope you guys check out
part two in part one if you've stumbled
across this video head in Chicago like I
said I'm gonna hopefully try not to get
in too much trouble I am going for work
not for pleasure unfortunately but
anyway guys I'll make it the heck on out
of here follow on instagram if you want
to see more pictures of this stuff in
progress if you guys are already
following you've seen this as it was
happening because i was putting up some
pictures while the bends and stuff we're
going on it's same thing on twitter the
pictures go up there so guys i'll check
you later and check you later smell you
later whatever huh it's just time to get
the heck on out of here see you later
guys until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
