James $0.02 here bringing a video about
ddr4 now it's kind of been the buzz with
x99 and the new Intel enthusiast
platform lunch and I'm sure a lot of you
guys are probably getting a little tired
of hearing about it by now but we're
going to talk about something that's
actually going to play into the future
of not enthusiasts platforms as well and
that being ddr4 now obviously one of the
things that people are talking about
when it comes to ddr4 is the fact that
holy crap it's really expensive like
some modules cost as much as people's
entire pcs expensive but guys that's to
be expected when you have bleeding edge
technology and there's a high demand and
low stock so with that said I was very
fortunate that the guys over at g.skill
were willing to send me a 16 gigabyte
kit to put in skunkworks so I can tell
you guys all about ddr4 now the RAM
modules that they sent me was the
g.skill ripjaws force and these are
actually pretty damn amazing I may say
so myself
now the RIP jaws have kind of become a
buyer's choice when it comes to gamers
and enthusiasts and overclockers alike
it's some great very versatile Ram now
enabling the XMP profile on the grip job
fours we get timings of 15 15 15 35 at
20 400 megahertz I have 24 megahertz a
twenty four hundred megahertz kit they
are available also in 2133 2667
I believe twenty eight hundred guys ddr4
is already surpassing 3000 megahertz
that this stuff is really really awesome
effort some people say well what's the
what's the big deal I mean that cast
latency seems really really high now you
have to think out of the box this is a
whole new architecture of the RAM and
holy balls as Linus would say is it fast
now I'm sitting here on my test bench
with a 264 going and the memory
benchmark and I'm using a 264 because
when I tried using a maximum was getting
some funky results I don't think maximum
is actually working very well so far
with the ddr4 dimm so we're going to go
ahead and use a 264 it has been update
for the ddr4 now the test bench behind
me is a 4770k and I have 16 gigabytes of
a data 1600 megahertz Ram currently
overclocked to 2000 and the timings on
that right now are twelve twelve twelve
thirty as I overclocked the RAM I had to
relax the timings a little bit when we
go ahead and run the memory read test
we'll see what we get okay so the memory
test is done we've got twenty eight
thousand six hundred and thirty three or
twenty eight point six gigabytes per
second read speed of the RAM so go ahead
and do a write and then a cop we're
going to do write copy and latency and
we will go ahead and compare those
numbers to ddr4 on the x99 machine
behind me okay so the tests have
complete the memory rate is where he
talked about was twenty eight thousand
six hundred thirty three megabytes per
second memory right was twenty-nine
thousand four hundred and sixty
megabytes per second memory copy
twenty-six thousand four hundred 37
megabytes per second and memory latency
at fifty one point two ns or I guess
that would be nanoseconds but I want to
point out though I'm probably can't
really see it too well but it's actually
these ddr3 two thousand megahertz
overclock a data dims or actually at the
very top of the list on the latency in
fact they're between no mic top six or
top seven on the other test now let's go
ahead and do the ddr4 test and see how
these compare transition
now before we actually talk about
skunkworks I want to point something out
the ddr3 is actually overclocked right
now to 2000 megahertz up from 1600 I'm
running these ripped off fours right now
at stock which is a 2400 XMP profile so
we'll kind of do a comparison we're
quick here also on how well they
overclock now on the memory read speed
we are getting sixty thousand forty six
megabytes per second read speed now just
to recap your memory they did here are
three over there at 2000 megahertz did
28,000 633 that's more than double the
speed already on ddr4 now the memory
write speed was a 54,000 104 and the
memory write speed over on the ddr3
setup was 29,000 for 60s so not quite
double there but still quite the gap
fifty four thousand one hundred versus
twenty nine thousand five hundred or 460
I like to round I like to do things
simple now the memory copy speed on the
ddr4 Ram 56 thousand seven hundred
seventy-two and over on the ddr3 twenty
six thousand four thirty seven so again
more than double on the ddr4 this is
pretty amazing now what's interesting
here is the latency though on this dim
these DIMMs right here is 64 thousand or
soomi 64 thousand uh that's not good
no no Scotch at 64 point 7 NS verses 51
NS on the ddr3 now that I think that's
going to come entirely into the castle 8
and C on there and that makes perfect
sense and we were talking 12 versus 15
so the latency on these DIMMs would
actually be a little bit slower but when
you take into comparison the data rates
of ddr4 holy crap is that fast now this
one last thing we need to do here we are
going to go ahead and overclock the
memory to 2667 because that's actually
the max supported speed on this
motherboard and we're going to see just
how well it compares once we overclock
it we're back now and the dims are now
running at 20 667 megahertz and I'm
pretty sure there's a lot more Headroom
in the overclocking of these modules
based on what I've seen on some other
people's results
so once the x99 classified from
uga once that motherboards BIOS is
updated to allow faster Ram will try
overclocking a little bit more to see
what we get now the memory read bumped
up to a sixty four thousand three
hundred forty one megabytes per second
memory right fifty four thousand four
hundred and eight memory copies sixty
one thousand three hundred seventy seven
and the latency drop down to fifty nine
point six it didn't fall a whole lot but
it's still not a whole lot slower than
the twelve castle agency over on the
ddr3 verses these dims at fifteen I
didn't mess up the timings I left the X
and P timings where they are so guys as
you can see ddr4 has a crap ton of
potential and this is why it's a content
creator and renderers dream if you do
Photoshop or video editing or anything
like that the RAM speed is just
absolutely phenomenal guys has been J's
to cents once again a huge shout-out to
my friends over at G skill for sending
me this memory this was not easy to come
by I understand that there was like some
nuns involved and like there was a
shootout and but they that they came
through for me so guys thanks send me a
bill for the damage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
