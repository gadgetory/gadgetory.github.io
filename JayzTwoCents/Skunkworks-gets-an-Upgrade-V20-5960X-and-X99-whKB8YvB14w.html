be doing this one probably somewhat on
the iPhone a little bit sorry for it
being kind of cheesy and cheap but it's
just easier to handle this way so we are
doing our x99 build and once again there
are snags things are never ever easy
hello
I said okay now I just put out an
Instagram saying it's alive but it's far
from perfect let me go ahead and start
elaborating first off this is a pretty
standard size cooler in terms of just
its overall size via the fan sits right
over top of the DIMM which i guess is
kind of normal but you wouldn't be able
to get that dim out if you're doing with
this this cooler you know itself okay
fine I get that but here's the other
problem do you see how close the 16th
the 16x top slot is for the PCI Express
to the cooler you can't really see it
but down in there come on camera stop it
down in there is the release tab for the
graphics card no because I bet the
graphics card adapter cooler was in I
cannot get the graphics card out because
the cooler is blocking it now get the
fan off I can kind of get my finger down
in there to actually release the the
card but I couldn't do that if I had ran
in here right so everything is just like
squished together super tight and
there's another problem with this top
slot then I'm going to but I'm going to
also point out that I'm not happy about
so probably the major gripe I have is
the lower tabs for the memory you see
that do you see how they pop down right
most most motherboards now are going
with a bottom retention clip that
doesn't actually move or only the top
does can anybody spot the problem with
this
does anyone spot the interference with
the slot J you're being awfully hard on
EVGA this is a $400 motherboard EVGA has
been really good to me but it's also
very important for me to be as unbiased
as possible and give real user
experience that's why I started this
YouTube channel that's why I do this
whole thing it's not to get free stuff
and build cool systems and just be like
oh if there's a problem to gloss over it
and and then have somebody else
potentially have a big issue because
they bought something based on my
experience that I portrayed rather than
experience I really had so I'm I can
deal with these issues and actually move
forward with this build for a couple of
reasons one because I'm running water
cold graphics cards water-cooled CPU
rigid tubing and all that I'm not
pulling components in and out of my
system all the time as long as I can get
it all installed then we're actually
good to go but that's not the case for
other people other people may want to
upgrade the RAM you know more frequently
they may want to change out their
graphics cards more frequently or or not
be stuck to everything is kind of like
threaded together in such a way that you
can't pull anything out individually
because these problems I'm pointing out
exists on non water-cooled parts as well
I mean the 290x the 780ti a lot of these
cards have back plates on them so you're
not going to be able to get the memory
out when the graphics cards in there
it's little things like that that really
just have me scratching my head on this
and going I'm very disappointed in the
design choice there's also one other
thing on here that I need to show you so
I just got done talking to EVGA Jacob
over there and he I mean they're aware
of some of these issues like the USB 2.0
goes up where the 3.0 is a 90 that's
kind of weird but the problem is if you
have anything in this bottom slot right
here if I was to say not run anything in
the top slot that way I don't have the
interference with with these tabs right
here then we interfere with the front
panel connectors where the graphics card
comes right over the top of those and I
think if I put a tight Bend on the
cables it would actually fit I'm not
entirely sure so I'm going to figure out
what I need to do on this but
I was talking to him and he was saying
that you know they tried sourcing these
uh single sided latches you know slots
with the single sided latches in black
and they were having a really hard time
so I've actually been sitting here like
practicing okay can I get this slot this
stick out with only doing one side so
yes I can as you can see the question is
you know can you get it back in and if
you kind of like I know it's really hard
to see you guys let's see here if I kind
of finagle that in there just right but
you kind of sucks on enthusiasts
platform you should have to do any of
this I can actually get the dim slot
back in without having to move that tab
so I guess I have a workaround for that
at least it's not ideal but it's
possible so anyway now we'll go with
that I mean I'm kind of calming down a
little bit why why am I upset because I
want you to J to make such a I want them
to come back and be a strong contender
in the motherboard you know realm and
and strengthen their portfolio with good
motherboards and stuff but I just these
little things and I understand that this
is you know this is early adopter blues
and I'm okay with that I really am I
just I don't want to have to deal with
these little things but we're going to
go ahead and go forward with this build
because I'm hearing good things about
the overclocking on this board where
it's actually I guess contending with
Asus in terms of stability which I guess
we'll find out but I'm gonna go ahead
and go forward so yeah EVG I just I want
you to do well that's that it's like a
parent that's like I only want the best
for you guys I want you to do better
than I did I care that's what it's all
about
so I tried Pele enough the aluminum
plates that are on there by using you
know razor blade and you know to peel it
up and two things were happening just
watch what's which I was afraid of gosh
came to talk one it's a it's stuck down
there really good so it starts
Bend no no one event and to you know
actually I could have probably just
pulled them off and said screw it and
clean the inside and it would have all
been solid black hindsight whatever
anyway to it started to scratch the the
metal around it so I don't want that to
happen so what I did now is as you can
see I masked off a pretty massive piece
of the motherboard and I traced out very
defined where those indentations are for
the inner the EVGA II and I actually use
this little round thing here to kind of
get in there in the corners that way to
push down really good now what we do is
I'm gonna take a razor blade I might get
a brand new razor blade this one's kind
of chewed up so it's nice and sharp but
I'm going to trace that out and then I'm
going to peel up the parts on the top of
the II and I'm going to spray it either
black or yellow I can't decide am I do
yellow but either way this is the
technique I'm using to get that heatsink
looking right alright so there it is now
I just have to decide if I want to do
yellow or black and you know I think I
think I'm gonna do yellow ah got to hard
decision though maybe you know what I'm
just gonna do black black it is so I
fixed the bottom heatsink now if you saw
I had traced it out and I was going to
do just black and leave the whole
heatsink the way it was but the problem
was the black that was on here the
powder coating or whatever that was on
there was a like a semi-gloss where if
you look at the top heatsink this is
very dull dusted kind of a satiny black
in it I didn't think the top heatsink
match the bottom heatsink well enough so
I went ahead and just masked off the x99
logo there and decided to do a duster
black primer finish to the entire thing
so as you can see now it would stop over
exposing I think it looks a million
times better now my next challenge is
these guys because I dumped the the
Ripjaws great memory but I don't like
these is these logos as labels so as you
can see I kind of started to peel one up
right there see if it'll focus come on
there I started to peel one up just to
see if they would come off and they do
so
we're probably not peeling off these
labels on here - just so it's black you
know stealthy Ram so I took the neat
approach a little bit farther
there's the Ripjaws right there and as
you can see that just kind of really
clashes with the whole color scheme I've
got going on in there plus I think
they're labeled as gaudy and since these
are review samples they don't have any
warranty really anyway so I went ahead
and just ripped off the labels you can
see this is before and you know and
after this is going to look obviously I
was just this is a gonna look so much
better in there so yeah you know me I
can't do anything simple and quick I
just have to like a DD out and do all of
these little things but I did put the
the info for the rim
you know the sticker for that back on
there so anyway that still looks better
than the ugly label I love g.skill
memory it's great for gamers great for
overclocking but dang their label
department needs some help right well
there it is project skunk works get
ready to come apart yep I'm not to redo
the tubing right they're different
fittings you know for the third graphics
card the tube for the CPU should line up
CPU socket on both motherboards is in
the exact same place so fingers crossed
and figured we just do kind of one last
little video of her before she comes
apart but it she's probably just going
to make her way over there the
motherboard CPU and RAM cuz z97 it's no
slouch but it also doesn't hold a candle
to the eight core 16 thread monster in
terms of productivity and considering
productivity is what I do on my computer
yep the z97 is it's already retired
perfect for gaming though if your gamer
shoot man z97 4790k it's a beast
once again my drain system proves to be
very very worth having so my hands are a
little bit yellow maybe could see that I
got some coolant on my hands and I've
dyed my fingers yellow I got caught
yellow handed maybe you can see that
maybe you can't oh so now it's time to
remove the tubing and stuff
I already unplugged all the cables
except for the 24 pin I need more slack
on that one slide it out and take that
bad boy and we slide it got slide like
shy all right we're getting there now
we're getting to the point oh well let
me back up I did a lot obviously without
the camera being on and that's okay I'm
kind of getting an idea now where all
the wires are going to be because the
layouts a little different and checking
my tubing now in terms of centering the
CPU block and the socket is slightly off
so you can see if I make this tube
straight up and down it's let's see
right about there it's not perfectly
lined up on that that fitting so it's
going to be off slightly as you can also
see the socket is a little bit lower
than where it is on z97 so I'm going to
have to actually just cut a little bit
that length off and then I might have to
do like a little dog bend in there where
it's just kind of like just slightly
jiggered that's pretty easy I'll just
put the silicon tube and there heat it
up and then it'll move it over slightly
and I'll have a slight Bend and they're
just tiny tiny little bend not sure
where I'm going to do it yet I could do
up here in the joint but that also means
because the sockets down lower this tube
to the radiator doesn't doesn't fit
anymore and that sucks because that's
the bend I hated the most so I'm going
to actually have to read that net but
that's okay
because look how sick these graphics
cards look I have never owned an SLI
setup until I did it on camera for you
guys a few months back I have never
owned anything this freaking fantastic
so this is really cool I'm kind of kind
of wigging out over my own system here
but I'm not going to do a whole lot more
tonight I'm tired and I'll I'll keep
going on this tomorrow mmm I might
actually do the the bending tonight but
we'll see it definitely won't be up and
running tonight so she's all wired up
and I'm really having a hissy fit right
now with these extensions I can't wait
till the power supply cables are ready
to go because they just keep like
separating and fanning out because they
want to do what they want to do
regardless of what I tell them to do
new cables that were sent to me don't
have the combs on them so I can't
control the way these cables actually go
as well as I want to I mean okay yeah
this isn't bad but I think I'm being a
little picky on this one but that's just
me I also not a fan of where the USB 3.0
is on this board on the z97 board it was
right there going out the side so I
could have had to come in from the side
that would've been super clean with no
wires coming from the bottom but because
of the way that 3.0 is it's a 90-degree
pointing down I had no choice but to do
that funky bend in the cables which puts
a lot of stress on that joint hope it
doesn't ruin the cables so as when I
brought the i/o button wires from the
bottom anyway otherwise as you can see
there would have been absolutely no
wires on the bottom so I don't like that
but I don't really have a choice do I
I had not tackled the keytar the new
tubing yet mostly because I still don't
want to do that one but that's all I
need to do I just need to get these two
tubes figured out and then it's ready to
be turned on I've already installed the
1600 watt let's go ahead and take a look
at the back I don't put a whole lot of
effort into the back of the cases mostly
because they don't show and also because
I am getting fully sleep set of black
and yellow cables black yellow and gray
cables for the 1600 and so it's all
gonna be coming out again anyway so I
can rewire it up nice and clean all in
all it's not too bad on the back it
could stand to me a little bit cleaner
my hard drives SSDs so yeah well just
get those look at those two the fit and
then we'll be ready to fire her up for
the first time all right well there's a
little little dogged in there a little
dogleg in there I had to do whatever you
want to call that I don't know doesn't
look too bad I kind of like it I mean it
looks like it's like a circuit trace
almost but it kind of sucks that that
block doesn't perfectly line up cuz from
other angles it looks like a weird like
kink I guess but I can't do anything
about that it's just because the block
and the socket do not perfectly line up
with where the fitting is but you know
what I can live with it I I mean I could
end up doing something else too where
light comes up
and then back in would look weird though
I don't know I'll kind of play around
with that while I'm doing the top band
I'll kind of think about that and see
what happens
all right all the tubing is done time to
fill er up
bleed it and then it's time to see with
this eight core CPU is all about and see
how I did in the silicon lottery so fill
it up time and then maybe we'll do
something here we'll do some epic b-roll
once it's ready to go you guys love that
b-roll
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
