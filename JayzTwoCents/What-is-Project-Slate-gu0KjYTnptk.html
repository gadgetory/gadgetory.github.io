what's going on everyone Jase two cents
here and welcome to my continued
coverage of Computex 2017 my first year
covering copy Tex and boy has it been a
culture shock where I talk about some of
that guys but this is my last night here
in the city I'm actually leaving a
little bit early because believe it or
not my birthday's in a couple of days
and I want to spend it with my family as
much as I am enjoying visiting Asia I'd
like to spend my birthday with friends
of family so yeah but I'm still a little
bit jet-lagged and I'm starting to feel
really drowsy so if I slow my words I'm
not drunk kind of wish I was but I'm not
but I'm leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning and I only had today to
kind of see the rest of what I wanted to
see so instead of doing videos on site
we just did like a running gun and shot
a lot of b-roll and I'm going to kind of
show you that as I'm talking about
various things today so let's go ahead
and kick some things off here we look at
in win a couple of things we took a look
at their they've got some wooden cases
which are pretty neat looking now
they're very elegant and when it's
always been one of those brands that are
all about like function and form but
definitely form without sacrificing too
much in terms of function but these new
cases that are I don't even know kind of
wood they are I'm assuming is some kind
of a pine it's definitely a plywood of
some sort those multiplies to this wood
that the green looks very very good I
don't know what kind of stain they're
using but it's a very light stain it
just with the coupled with the white man
it looks really really good they also
had their case bought on hand which is a
computer that you control with both
movement and verbal commands and Nick
actually stood in the dome thing and was
controlling the PC and had to take a
picture by using nothing more than just
hand gestures in his voice so that was
pretty neat to take a look at anyone
always has someone like the craziest
things to show off but we also checked
out what Asus was showing again at the
ROG booth because there was some stuff
that wasn't on display when we were
there yesterday now last night they
actually held their keynote Jensen came
out and spoke about their collaborative
efforts with creating a notebook
featuring the new 1080 max-q GPU which
is not a full-blown GT x 1080 but it's
stronger than like what the mobile
series used to be in the past has a much
smaller footprint much less TDP or much
lower TDP allowing them to have a
very slim form factor notebook but also
to ace or predator also has the 1080 max
Q and their new slim mopitt2 so
obviously slim is like the trend right
now and with that cooling is actually
very very difficult to to maintain so
the zephyrus notebook from asus rog it's
a really interesting name zephyrus
they've got some real like one of their
Greek names or what we got Gladius and
and Claymore and now Zephyrus so
obviously there's a theme there but this
notebook it's got some pretty neat
features now the keyboard is actually
all the way pushed to the edge of the
notebook which is actually very nice
because then when you're typing it's
more like typing on a regular keyboard
your palms are a little bit lower and
it's very ergonomic when you type on a
typical keyboard where your hands are
kind of half on the keyboard tray
sometimes they can push on to your wrist
and cause some numbness I actually
experienced that with some notebooks so
that was nice to see but also too
cooling cooling is a major issue when it
comes to gaming notebooks and when you
open the lid on the Zephyrus the bottom
actually pushes down it's part of the
hinge and then it creates a bigger gap
for more airflow and then when you close
the lid it all seals up so it's a nice
little feature there and very nju
ingenuitive there's a lot of ingenuity
I'm bad at words
now speaking of Kult brands like
republic of gamers let's go and talk
about corsair Corsairs got a couple of
really neat things actually that a lot
of things on display like you might have
already seen on some other channels
they've got their concepts lay a lot of
what they were showing they're calling
concept because they're not available
yet there's going to be some tweaking
involved before they actually come to
market but I'm gonna talk about concepts
late real quick it is a very very large
chest you so far as for the largest
chassis I've seen if not be largest
chassis dwarfing my case labs case
dwarfing my old obsidian 900 d and
possibly even dwarfing the fantasy elite
it is a of course a tempered glass case
but it's like it's kind of like a
double-wide you can actually fit to 480
millimeter radiators in push polls
that's already insane side by side and
you can still fit a 480 on top which is
absolutely crazy they've got these
pullout trays where you can the tray
slides out on a it's very similar to
like a drawer hinge or roller hinge as
you find out a drawer or a cabinet
so they pull out you can attach your
radiators and fans to it and then push
it back in so making working on the case
and building it out a whole lot easier
now it's also a dual system chassis so
you can't fit an ITX system in the
bottom of it except PCI you riser cards
that way you can see the face of your
GPU making it look nice and pretty
same thing with the main system you can
actually rotate and move the PCIe
support brackets to either support like
a riser card where you see the face of
the GPUs or mount them traditionally
they actually have a lot of cable
management in mind with this as well
where the system on the bottom or the
ITX system is still hiding away the
wires where unfortunately one of the
things I didn't like about the van tech
Seeley was the ITX system where the
second system was sort of an
afterthought and a cable management was
really difficult to maintain with the
second system in there now unlike the
fantex elite when this chassis is empty
it weighs about 40 pounds whereas the
chassis for the fantex elite it's around
70 pounds I think it's like 72 pounds
empty absolutely insane on how heavy
some of these jessee's can get the one
we're looking at here that was fully
built out though with these push-pull
giant rads side-by-side tons of liters
of fluid dual systems was actually 125
pounds that guys I'm sorry I don't know
what that is in kilos but the tempered
glass side panel doors swing open
they're on a really nice hinge you can
just lift it off and there's obviously
way more than enough room then anybody
would ever need to build a regular
system so be prepared to pack a lot of
components in there to fill this out and
not have it and feel feel just
completely empty and like an echo
chamber because it just won't look good
unless you're filling this up with
radiators and tubing and reservoirs and
RGB and all kinds of crap now something
else I was really eager to take a look
at at Corsair was their new lineup of
open-loop water cooling parts now
they've actually cleaned up with aqua
computer for their blocks and there's
also a reservoir which initially
concerned me because aqua computer made
in germany is a very premium product
that has a price tag that definitely
represents the level of premium is some
of the most expensive water cooling
parts you can buy but they use nothing
but like tempered glass on there on the
GPU covers their reservoirs or glass so
they definitely
an amazing quality to them but also an
amazing price tag now of course there
assures me their pricing is going to be
competitive but the GPU block is a full
cover it looks good it's kind of a nice
heavy weight to it but that's because
obviously it is a copper nickel plated
block with a glass faceplate on it so no
plexi it's actually glass and it's very
very weighty and then a brushed aluminum
backplate which is mostly aesthetics I
don't see anywhere wood actually touches
the GPU to transfer any sort of heat to
the plate giving you a greater surface
area so it's definitely more of an
aesthetic backplate but it looks really
nice now the fittings and stuff they're
still tweaking part of the problem is
the Corsair sail logo which they have on
the fittings are gold and it kind of
clashes with the black fittings which is
maybe not such a bad thing though
because bits power has been putting gold
logos on their black fittings for years
and people still buy them I still get
them there's no real clash there but
they are telling me there's kind of
tweaking with some of the logo designs
until they get something they really
like an honorable mention product that
Corsair was actually showing off is
their k68 keyboard now it's a it's a
lower-end keyboard in their case series
which is still kind of like their top
tier series of keyboards but the k68 is
actually featuring water resistance now
it is still a mechanical key but it does
not have RGB lighting it's a static
lighting of different lighting modes
obviously but it's not an RGB product
but you obviously have cherry mechanical
switches in there but the water
resistance is kind of nice to have a
display where they were just kind of
showing water being continuously poured
and dripped on top of this keyboard and
it wasn't shorting out or having any
problems whatsoever so now you can kind
of play games or eat at your desk and
not have to worry about tipping a cup
over inside your keyboard and shorting
it out that pretty much wraps up my
coverage here for Computex 2017 guy pipe
a is an amazing City Asia so far what
I've seen of Taiwan is absolutely
phenomenal the culture here that people
are so nice and my god you would think
that they'd be all crashing into each
other with all these scooters and taxis
and stuff but now they've got a system
here and it seems to work for them man
where some of these taxi rides literally
I felt like putting up my hands and just
yelling we as we were going because it
was like a roller coaster ride but
I just got to say you can expect to see
me here in Computex again this was a
phenomenal experience that I definitely
do not want to pass up and I'd like to
extend my stay a little bit more next
time but part of the problem is that my
birthday is always going to fall on the
same week as Computex but I've had an
absolute blast for the last five days
checking out what Taipei has to offer
and guys a huge thank you to your
support watching these videos I know
there's lots of channels putting up
content and it means a lot to me that
you guys keep coming back to see what
it's like from my perspective so I'm
going to go guys again one last shout
out a huge thank you to EB GA my sole
sponsor sponsoring all of my coverage
here and sending us up and getting us
out here in flying Nick and I to Taipei
halfway around the world to bring you
guys this coverage so again thanks to
all of you thanks to EVGA and we will
see you next year
at Computex 2018 that's not but you'll
see me again before that it's just I
will give that Computex till then I'm
tired I'm going to go now guys thanks
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
