of you have seen this video coming from
a mile away
and ever since case lab stopped making
the their cases it became even more
obvious that I was going to be doing
something with skunk works well here it
is we are going to be upgrading this
we're doing a first part of it right now
where we're gonna be upgrading the
motherboard the processor the block when
we changing out one of the reservoir
tubes we'll talk about that why we're
gonna flush the system and we're gonna
be obviously upgrading the CPU to a 79
60 x16 core 32 thread processor from
intel on x-29 t9s currently an X 99 69
50 X no slouch with two Titan X Pascal's
in there not Titan XPS but Titan X
Pascal and yeah so we're gonna be doing
a few things today we're going at the
motherboard in the processor the block
we're gonna flush the system and then
we're gonna prepare it for its final
phase of the upgrade I'm sure you guys
can figure out what that's gonna be
today's video is sponsored by North Vee

the link in the description below so
this is e k zu waterblock for the cpu
this is the e k velocity RGB as you can
see the packaging is even different so
it's it's an improved design and
improved flow it's better for the higher
core count CPUs that's obviously
something that's changed quite a bit
over time is the higher core count which
means they've had to sort of improve
their block designs it's a little bit
bigger as you can see now and of course
has RGB very nice see-through top plate
on there because when we going with new
water blocks of obviously for the
graphics cards which are going to be
clearly 20 atti r-tx cards because
skunkworks has always been
a centerpiece of the channel designed to
be impractical overpriced and really a
lot like me
you know you probably pay too much for
watching my content even free is way
overcharged and I'm kind of loud and I'm
sort of unnecessary so I'm going with
the ex $2.99 for the 1k from EVGA I they
still are my favorite brand of
motherboard because they're simple they
work the BIOS are solid ever since they
kind of revamped their motherboard team
all the way back to z77 they have just
been extremely solid this one actually
has RGB and stuff on it so we can spice
up our build a little bit I didn't go
with the dark because the dark is meant
for extreme high-end overclocking just a
bit I know I said this build was
supposed to be overkill but it's a bit
overkill for this build and to be honest
the gold wouldn't go with our theme very
well so that's why we ended up going
with this I currently have an X 99
classified in here which has been more
than solid for me over the last several
years I've been running this build and
so I figured I'm going to stick with
what has worked for me and that's
exactly what we're using here all this
time that I've been showing you guys how
one of the loops always looks a little
bit darker than the other that was a
true issue obviously with the yellow and
the orange I mean it turned brown
straight-up
fluid color change but all of that fluid
color change over time has slightly
tinted the right tube and the way we
figure that out was the last video that
we did go and watch it if you haven't
where we checked this fluid having been
two years old and we saw that nothing
was clogging anywhere we mixed both yeah
we mix both loops - I was knocked over
it's crackit before we can get in it I
mixed both loops together in the same
jug and then poured them independently
back into their loops and saw that the
right loop was slightly darker again
which was impossible considering it
hadn't even run yet so that got me to
thinking that that tube is tinted ever
so slightly so we're gonna be putting in
a brand new acrylic tube in there and
that should be that so one thing we're
not to deal with here is this
pass-through fitting it's not gonna line
up with my cards anymore because NV link
is wider than SLI this block right here
has to scoot back slightly on the new
cards in fact I even had to shave I
don't think you see it I had actually
shave off a corner of the Nvidia bridge
because it didn't work with the ek water
blocks cuz it hit because it was more
pointy so I actually flattened out those
edges right there so that means have to
figure out something when the cards get
here on how to straighten that up so
when I do when we do that that's gonna
be mostly just putting on the new
graphics cards with water blocks
everything else will already be in there
and then figuring out this Bend I'm
really praying that the CPU location on
this motherboard and the new motherboard
are exactly the same or I will have to
rebound this tube and this one to be
easy it's just a single 90 these double
90s man no those are pain in the butt so
I might have to redo this tube at the
most so what do you say we just go ahead
and do it old-school style where we just
blog it not vlog it but montage it but
there'll be much better montages and the
ones I used to do because of course
we've got freaking Phil here running the
show
all right listen look so bad I mean did
in the first try who would he expect I
am a professional
okay we got the new motherboard in of
course the EVGA X $2.99 for the win k
we've got my new 79 60 x16 core CPU in
there we've got the new velocity RGB
water block that's on there we actually
did come up with a custom RGB solution
for that we'll show you how we did it in
the next video because that's a RGB
block and this motherboard although it
has RGB on its own little covers it
doesn't have a single header on the
motherboard designed for 12 volt or
addressable or any of that so we had to
actually scramble to figure out how we
were gonna light up both of my graphics
card blocks and my CPU block we figured
it out I'm also gonna be putting UV
lighting in here so I'm gonna be
sticking with the green bright UV green
that glows in the dark I love the way UV
green looks remember we did it on my D
frame build so yeah our loop as you can
see is redone we had to do that Bend
again two bends had to be redone I ended
up using this double rotary swivel
footing here I just like the way it
looks more abstract and that's because
of the design and the motherboard I just
felt like I wanted to add up something
in there a little bit less clean a
little bit more against the green but
just enough to be different but not
really trigger OCD doesn't bother me at
all and that's what matters most
obviously with it being my build now
both the loops right now are filled with
distilled water and they're running the
Primeau chill sysprep in there which is
cleaning out any of the stuck gunk that
could be built up in the radiators and
they have a slight green tinge to them
because like I said it's been running
pastel for over two years it's very
unlikely that it's ever gonna turn
completely clear but we're going back
with green so that's that doesn't matter
you know the beginning this video how I
mentioned the right reservoir tube we
think was tinted a little bit that's a
brand new too but as you can see it
still looks slightly darker in the one
on the left so we're thinking it's just
the way the lighting is with the fans
being next to it and the fans being
black we just think it's casting a bit
of a shadow onto it which is why it
always looks darker so I'm just gonna
leave that be I've got this soft tube
here because that's just the way we're
completing this connection so I can
flush out this radiator down here but
what's most important obviously as we
get these radiators nice and clean and
prepare
for their next obviously their next
round of gaming and stuff I might take
this build back home again I miss it I
look at the B frame at home and like
this build is cool but it's not
skunkworks
so anyway so in the next part of this
video we're obviously we recovered the
two GPUs any changes we have to make
with that and lighting and then it will
be pretty much done a pretty easy
upgrade this time around so guys thanks
for watching let me know what you think
and yeah it's one of these older oldie
but goodie zits a very very clean very
minimalistic build but I like it I've
been talking to Phil about maybe taking
all the external panels and painting
them just a slightly darker shade of
gunmetal so there's a bit of a two-tone
going with that and I think it'll look
really good then I say is if I paint
this though I should be able to strip
the paint off not too too difficult
because this is powder coating I could
always get it stripped and repower
coated in another color if I wanted to
do that but again things we can figure
out later on thanks for watching guys
and as always we'll see you in the next
one
well out have to get my stuff
system trips and you're pregnant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
