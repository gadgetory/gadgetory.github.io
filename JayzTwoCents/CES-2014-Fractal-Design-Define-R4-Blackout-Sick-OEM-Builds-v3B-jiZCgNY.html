insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strap in with Jays two cents as he takes
you on a wild ride through CES 2014 hey
guys you're watching Jays two cents and
guess what I happened to find somebody
here who's taller than me I guys I'm
with Josh here from fractal design and
he's gonna be showing us a case here
that is directly derivative of what the
customers have asked for so Josh
obviously this is an r4 I define r4 but
what makes it different this is actually
the r4 blackout so what makes this
different is this is the first case that
we've done where it has all black
internals and it might not seem like
much of a change but it's one of those
things that we've gotten from a lot of
our fans a lot of our customers they've
wanted to see an all-black interior
so we wanted to give that to them it's
gonna be out sometime probably around
April okay so functionality wise it's
all the same it comes with the same fan
block outset fractals known for where if
you have unused fan slots you don't have
dust entry points you can control the
airflow you can control the pressure of
course you have the the same adjustable
hard drive bays but you can turn them
sideways or put water cooling in the
front the top it's everything you come
to expect with fractal design but it's
just all black so if you guys are
looking for like a stealth build you
definitely want to check out the defined
fractal r4 or the fractal define r4
blackout that's what it is it's just all
black so Josh thank you for showing this
to me today hope to show some more
fractal stuff here in the future on the
channel I know we've been kind of
creating a bromance here yeah we're
we're talking a little bit on the side
so yeah guys this is what you see right
here is what you get with fractal and we
are gonna have a glorious relationship
here on Jays two cents and don't go away
because now we're going to show you guys
what some of these other mint
manufacturers have been doing with their
cases for their custom builds I'm still
standing here with fractal jaws cut
hanging out here with fractal Josh you
guys know this guy what are we looking
at here you've got some looks like some
boutique builds from some of your system
integrators
exactly so what we're doing is we wanted
to showcase some of our system builder
partners those are the companies have
chosen to use our products as part of
their builds the first one you're
looking at here is from Puget systems
and it's a workstation effectively as
you can tell by the dual processor now
what's interesting about this setup is
that exactly how quiet this thing is
which is kind of hard to tell it all the
ambient noise around but they picked
this the defined XLR - due to its silent
nature and the fact it's highly
configurable so you know to be able to
have a system that's this quiet I mean
you can tell people what you think about
how quiet it is well I can tell you
right now I almost stuck my fingers in
the fan if they didn't have this grill
on here because I didn't realize it was
running and you guys know I'm a I'm a
noise snob my pcs as quiet as I can get
it and I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of take
the mic and just move it around you guys
you might hear some interference cuz
it's wireless we'll hope not but this is
absolutely inaudible I mean now
obviously right now it's sitting kind of
an idle mode so everything's sort of
ramped down but one of the things that
fractal design obviously is known for is
the sound insulation that you guys
integrate into your cases so even if you
put this thing into workload mode or you
start doing rendering or whatever you're
doing with this dual Xeon build once you
put that insulated side panel on there
you're not going to have any of the
sound issues escaping out of there so
what are we looking at here with this
Green Monster sure over here we have a
system for my exotic PC it's basically
an arc XL that they've customized into
their own system and what's really doing
is highlighting the liquid cooling
flexibility of the case it has a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator in
the top as well as two hundred and forty
millimeter radiator in the front and
it's running an SLI bill that's also
both cards liquid cooled so really kind
of showcases a flexibility I just
recently did the arc XL review that you
sent me and I have to admit it is
clearly one of the most water cooling
friendly cases that I've seen when it
comes to including dual rads 360s and
240s and the amount of thickness it
accommodates in the front you know if
you if you some people want to do
massive rides like we have a quad and a
triple but they give you plenty of room
to incorporate thicker radiators to
maintain surface area and not you know
encroach into the actual living space in
the case I mean look down here in the
bottom we've got a dual
on the front we got the pump the DDC in
the bottom we've got a massive reservoir
right here sitting horizontal
full-length power supply here SLI and
you know this it doesn't look cluttered
Q graphics cards all the water cooling
contained inside the case and yeah so
this is this is the system that you can
get from exotic PC one of the many
companies that have incorporated fractal
design in their OM specs and with their
cases so guys Josh thank you for talking
with me today you guys are gonna see a
lot more of this guy on my channel I'm
sure and if you're not following us on
Twitter you should because that's the
place to be
guys let me get on out of here make sure
you are following us for all of our
exclusive coverage of CES 2014 and as
always I will see you in my next video
if I still have a voice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
