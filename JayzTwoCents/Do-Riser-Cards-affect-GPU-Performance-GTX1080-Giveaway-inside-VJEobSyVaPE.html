face what's up guys Jase two cents here
and we just got back from our long
four-day holiday weekend and before we
went on vacation or mini vacation when
you want to call it we did a video about
PCI Express power cables and whether or
not having one or two plugged into your
graphics card can affect your
performance unfortunately a lot of
people misunderstood the title of that
video even though the thumbnail clearly
shows me plug-in power cables and they
thought I was talking about PCI Express
riser cards and they were pretty
disappointed why don't want to let you
guys down so that very same day I heard
your out cries and I went out and bought
PCI Express riser cards so that we can
talk about whether or not this affects
your performance I think now we'll have
it all covered by the time we're done
here today
bring out the bling in your PC with
Corsairs new Vengeance RGB series ddr4
memory with its hassle-free lighting
controls in superior overclocking
performance click the link in the
description to learn more and before we
move forward stay to the end of the
video where I've got a surprise
announcement you're not going to want to
miss but anyway let's talk about these
guys what are these and why do they
exist
these are PCI Express riser cards
they're basically are designed to extend
the point of which your graphics card or
any PCI Express component for that
matter can connect to your motherboard
this is not new this has been around for
a long time anything that has any sort
of slot in your motherboard has had
extension cables since the beginning of
time like all cavemen we're using these
things but I digress guys we're talking
about this today because it's more
relevant than ever a lot of case
manufacturers I've heard people complain
about the fact that you can't see your
graphics card anyway so who cares what
the RGB looks like or how pretty the
faces or what kind of fans they are you
can't even see it so I started orienting
them now in different places in the case
mostly upright allowing you to see the
beauty of your graphics card after all
you paid for it but in order to achieve
that they have to use some sort of PCI
Express extension like this we'll just
call it an extension so what I did was I
ran out and I got a 9 centimeter and a
25 centimeter because I want to test
both on the motherboard with a short
extension and a long extension to see if
there's any sort of degradation now if
you guys want to get your own riser
cards there is link down in the
description below though shameless plug
here for my Amazon affiliate these are
the EZ di
why they're not that expensive 20 bucks
for the nine centimeter around 30 bucks
for the 25 centimeter and if you guys
are doing any sort of custom like
wall-mounted PC or a desk mounted PC and
you want to move stuff around these are
a must
so anyway link down below if you guys
are interested in the ones that I'm
using today put that out of the way
let's go ahead and see the result so a
little bit different testing methodology
here today so we used the new UniGene I
think it's even spelled like UniGene
this is a superposition benchmark we've
used Valley in the past we've used
heaven in the past and this is their new
one it's free you guys can download it
if you want to check out your own
results but not a sponsor I'm just
letting you guys know that you guys can
get it for free and check it out
yourself we used the 4k optimized preset
so that we could get consistent testing
back to back on our results now how you
guys can see there's no performance loss
whatsoever with these cards and I don't
know why that is because like I said in
my last I'm not electrical master
magician so I'm just going to say that
use them it's not going to affect your
performance whatsoever but there's a
caveat to that these are not all created
equal these the ones that I have right
here are not shielded in any way so they
are subject to crosstalk and some other
influences from other RF components on
your system that if you start running
these next to each other if you're
running SLI configs these can have
crosstalk issues which could create some
problems with stability but even though
we were running this graphics card
overclocked to 2088 we were not seeing
any stability issues whatsoever with
overclocking and gaming performance /
the benchmark performance was extremely
consistent and there was no loss
whatsoever given the PCB or the graphics
card on the PCB or using a riser now we
did have a weird anomaly now we were not
able to recreate but at least want to
mention it when I did my first test with
the graphics card on the motherboard we
saw an average score of 200 points less
than when we installed the riser cards
I've been going back and doing
redundancy and sanity testing the scores
came back up once we put the graphics
card back on the motherboard and we
couldn't get the problem to replicate so
I don't know what was causing it in the
first test
it was fresh reboots there was fresh
drivers all that stuff nothing changed
there was no background processes
running verified all of that and once we
did our testing again then we saw very
consistent results across the board
can't answer what that was but at least
want to put it out there because we did
experience it so if you guys are looking
for relocating your graphics card or
just getting creative and building your
own cases or wall mounts or desk mounts
or whatever then definitely feel free to
use these if you get the ones that are
shielded though they're going to cost
you a lot more but they're going to have
a lot more resistance to any sort of
interference or crosstalk from other
components now the beginning of this
video I said you guys didn't want to
miss an announcement that I was making
well I decided I've got a lot of
graphics cards hanging around here so
I'm going to go ahead and give away
another GT x 1080 this one here is my
Founders card and I've actually had this
sense launched this is one of the ones I
did so my benchmarking with this was one
of the cards that was actually slated to
go into skunk works when I ended up
putting the Titan X's in there so yeah
here it is right here GTX 1080
I'm also going to give you a brand new
unused ek water block and back plate so
if you decide that you want to water
cool it you'll have it if not well then
I don't know stick it on the wall
whatever I don't really care so look in
the description below you will find a
link to the giveaway all the information
you need to know is there how to enter
when the giveaway is going to happen
where it's going to be announced when
it's going to be announced all the
things you have to do to qualify for the
giveaway so please don't come at me and
ask me questions directly on one of when
you're going to notice the winner
because I'm not going to answer those
questions all the information you need
is there also to it is void where
prohibited there are some countries and
regions out there where they don't want
you winning things I don't know why
that's kind of stupid but I can't change
the government yet but for now anyway
all the stuff you need to know is down
there thanks for watching guys as always
if you have anything you feel we should
be testing let me know this video is
directly because of the comments in the
very last video which is why I spent
about 60 bucks with shipping on these
guys right here so that we could do this
video thanks for watching and as always
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
