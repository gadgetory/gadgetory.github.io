2019 and we are at the be quiet suite
we're gonna check out what they've got
to show but first check out our sponsor
Corsair who debuted in the new Corsair
one HP d desktop so go and check them
out in the link below again a huge thank
you to Corsair for sponsoring our trip
this year ok so be quiet is showing us a
new white edition case why it's kind of
making a comeback we've seen white kind
of fade away for a while and now it's
kind of the thing again and this is a
new dark bass 700 limited edition case
so there's 3,000 units being made it's
got this badge which is a medal badges
put it anywhere you want so it's not pre
affixed you can put on the front the
side but this is a very very popular
case so the dark bass 700 is technically
a mid tower but it's a very silent
optimized case as is pretty much the
entire case lineup from be quiet I mean
the name kind of tells you what to
expect there right but we've got a clear
tempered glass side panel not a tinted
panel which is what you would find like
on the 801 the the dark bass 801 we did
the how to build a computer in that's
got a tinted panel but the white case
here with the clear is very bright so if
you put RGB lighting in here or any
lighting it's gonna really illuminate
nicely we've also got two of the 140
millimeter silent wings fan so these are
a premium fan here in a premium case but
it's only gonna cost about $10 more than
the current dark space 700 which you
could find in black so it's a it's a
limited edition case with a very minimal
increase in cost but something that you
could say hey look I got a limited case
and you can pretty much do anything with
it now white it's very subjective it's
interesting we've talked to case
manufacturers before like why do we see
why-- cases and they go away and they
come back and obviously has to do with
adoption rate it costs a lot of money to
make a case in and another color and
fits not move adopted then they sit on
shelves and it's kind of like a Cosmo
becomes absorbed and unfortunately if it
doesn't do well you don't see it but
white like I said it's made a comeback
in fact Kyle even did a build in this
case which we're gonna take a look at
separately and we're gonna see how
Kyle's build skills are and we're gonna
give a little review of a little review
of that little guy but I digress the
dark bass 700 it's got a lot of features
that you'd expect it's got a vertical
mount so you can show off your dual slot
GPUs
the reason why I mentioned dual slides
unfortunately with a lot of the new 20
8020 atti and even some of the 20 60
cards they are triple slot designs so
wouldn't fit in here because it only
supports a dual slot card if you have a
dual slot GPU you can add your own riser
card and of course show off your
graphics card whether it be a water
cooled or air cooled by using the
vertical mount and of course it has all
of the silent optimizations of like the
sound absorption pad on the back panel
it's extra thick you've got a solid
panel on the front that brings an air
through perforations on the side to give
you a pretty decent airflow we were kind
of concerned with the dark bass 801 when
we did the build that maybe we're gonna
have some temperature issues but even
with an AIO on the front no issues
whatsoever in fact that was that was
pretty surprising and really mean to see
so I don't think there would be any
cooling issues necessarily with this guy
but remember it is silent optimized
first and airflow second but depending
on how hard you're pushing your systems
and what your fan profiles are like and
your overclocks are like this usually
isn't gonna be a problem
now speaking of airflow and air cooling
I'm kind of looked at as being like the
water cooling guy but I'll be the first
to admit water cooling can be a complete
pain in the ass sometimes when it comes
to maintenance so let's take a look at
some air coolers if they're showing off
here so that you can see how well you
can actually cool your system virtually
maintenance-free okay so the way you get
more cooling with air coolers is you
just make really big towers or like we
seen from the dark rock Pro for it is a
dual Tower opposite twin tower plate
they call it we've got some push-pull
here we've got an offset fan to give you
clearance for obviously your modules and
one thing that's different about this we
kind of saw this last year at CES and
it's obviously fully retail available
now is it includes a long screw driver
that you can take this top panel off
right here and it goes down through the
middle so that you can actually mount it
a lot easier they listen to the feedback
of end users that said this is way too
difficult to install because it's got
such a big circumference and it takes up
so much footprint in terms of how big
the tower sticks out over the sides a
lot of motherboards had conflicts with
high vrm heat sinks to where once you
put this down you couldn't get a tool in
there to actually mount it to its
mounting mechanism so they thought about
that and so this isn't really too much
change it's got ceramic coating here on
the actual heat pipes so they can make
it black without the drawbacks of just
painting it so you got better thermal
conductivity thermal performance and it
obviously is all nice and black which
looks very aesthetically pleasing now
is actually got a 250 watt TDP and they
also have a TR for version if you're
running thread Ripper so it's optimized
for that but they want to appeal to a
wider market a more affordable market
and still not have to sacrifice on
cooling so they're introducing the dark
rock slim which got all the same
features of the v4 and the pro which is
for copper heat pipes that are again
ceramic coated black so that they look
great they've got the silent wings fan
on here which are giving you good static
pressure and good acoustic performance
and it fits in a lot more cases you can
see right here we've got the indents on
the backside here for this this is kind
of like a noise and thermal optimized
design and the heatsink it's not just a
ton of surface area there's actually a
reason for this but this will fit in a
lot more cases and they're telling me
it's gonna cost around $50 so it's gonna
give you a very affordable very
attainable price point and give you very
good performance on that and then my
personal favorite here this is the TF
the dark ROC TF which is just this
vertical or horizontal mounted behemoth
of a push-pull cooler that gives you a
lot of vertical clearance as you can see
compared to the pro quite a few
millimeters there probably if I'd to
guess at least 15 millimeters of
difference there but it's gonna fit in
more low-profile cases like home theater
PC stuff like that so we're gonna do
some stuff here moving forward in 2019
specifically regarding air cooling
because I wanted to show people how you
can get a lot of performance and even a
lot of overclocking Headroom and you
don't have to deal with the headache and
the maintenance of water cooling so
we're gonna talk about this coming up in
2019 you can expect to see more be quiet
on our channel you guys can expect to
see more videos here from us at CBS 2019
once again a huge thank you to Corsair

they're offering and link in description
