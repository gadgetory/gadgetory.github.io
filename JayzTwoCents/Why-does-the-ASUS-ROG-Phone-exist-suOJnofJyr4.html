sponsored by EVGA EVGA offers a wide
range of products including GPUs cases
power supplies motherboards and more to
learn how to take your rig to the next
level head to EVGA calm all right guys
we're over here to the Asus booth we're
really the only thing I'm interested in
we'll talk about some a i/o coolers and
stuff but this is the ROG phone no doubt
you guys have heard of it by now I am a
little late to the party but that's
because I kind of wanted to soak in all
the information that I could about this
because I am doing this video from the
perspective of someone who does not care
about this kind of stuff I'm a PC gamer
sure but my question is why why do we
need this why do we need a PC built
smartphone I mean the razor phone did it
I feel like this is just trying to kind
of get that piece of the pie that razors
sort of already done okay we'll talk
about specs for a second here this is
the is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 840 it's
2.9 6 gigahertz 512 gigabytes of storage
has an AMOLED HD display and it has a
four thousand milliamp battery and it
says a unique cooling solution now if
you see some vents right here so there's
probably is some active cooling in there
we also have this attachment on this
phone as you can see that goes right up
to those vents I just showed and that
ish is looks like it's giving you some
more active cooling so yeah there we go
focus works so this is the device right
here now what they are doing is they are
targeting people who are on the go
people who spend a lot of time traveling
on planes trains whatever who want to
you basically use a single device to
kind of get all their work done play
games whatever as a docking station
there are some handheld attachments in
fact you can see this gentleman right
over here is using set attachment
there's a handheld attachment there's
external batteries docking stations you
name it it's available for it so I asked
him specifically why what why does this
need to exist because I personally don't
care for this and I mean the answer was
what I just gave you they find that more
people are spending time traveling and
using their devices for either
or productivity or whatever it may be
and they want to this was built off of
sort of the zenfone docking concept back
in like 2013 I think I saw that in CES
2013 where it's basically the same type
of function where you dock this and it
becomes your complete workstation so
here's an example of that docking
station right here it's docked it's
being charged it's hooked up to a
monitor it's hooked up to actual
physical peripherals we've got a mouse
you've got a keyboard so you can see as
I wiggle the mouse we are moving our
screen this is just kind of a generic
cup G type of a game playing right here
I think that's definitely not club G but
it looks very similar to it
so here's an example of the handheld
docking station so it adds another six
thousand milliamps worth of battery for
speakers this is the actual phone up
here it looks like another phone down
here is just an extension screen so you
actually are turning this into kinda
reminds me of like an Nvidia shield type
of a deal you actually have some
physical buttons on the top right here
so you can see you have some trigger
button on the right trigger button on
the left but this is designed to more or
less expand the phone into a more
working handheld device not even just
for games but it doubles your screen
real estate gives you better speakers
better battery life so that's obviously
an option that's available in terms of
expandability so here's the handheld
device I was talking about a second ago
turns it into more like a Nintendo
switch kind of a deal but which you
might be actually noticing here's all of
these accessories are obviously
additional cost and the question is
going to be how much is this going to
cost in the end in the end if the phone
is potentially a thousand dollars and
let's say each one of these particular
peripherals costs a hundred bucks or
more each now you're talking about a
mobile gaming phone that at the end of
the day costs way more than even a
high-end PC would cost you to build so
that's where this particular type of
device just loses me as something that
I'm not really all that interested in I
thought maybe I was coming in here as
kind of a nanny yo naysayer
but I think my particular opinion on
this matter is not changing as I'm
messing with the device now this is one
of those things where they don't have
pricing and stuff established yet
there's rumors of it being about a
thousand dollars the razor phone is
definitely shown that there is a market
for it it was extremely hard to get your
hands on was always sold out and if this
booth isn't any indication there is
definitely a lot of interest in this
sort of thing now this is where I need
you guys to sound off let me know in the
comments if you're interested in this I
might potentially buy one when it comes
out to do sort of a more user long-term
review but guys I'm sure you guys know
by now smartphones and stuff is just not
something I am all that passionate about
but this has definitely been a hot topic
the views on YouTube have definitely
shown that the PC gamer market does
indeed appear to be interested at least
on a surface level maybe they're
interested in seeing what people have to
say more so than being interested in the
device itself so that's where you guys
come in sound off in the comments below
and let me know what you guys think and
I'm curious to see what the overall sent
consensus is regarding this phone thanks
for watching this video guys as always a
huge thank you to EVGA for sponsoring
today's video and as always guys I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
