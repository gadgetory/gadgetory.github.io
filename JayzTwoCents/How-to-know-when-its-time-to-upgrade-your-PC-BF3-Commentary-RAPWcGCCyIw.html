Jays two cents and you guys have really
been requesting of me lately to do some
commentary style computer talk like my
AMD vs Nvidia and my AMD vs. Intel
videos and I've decided to go ahead and
do that maybe this is what it takes to
get me playing some games again and once
again we are playing battlefield 3
simply because I just do not approve of
Call of Duty I hate Call of Duty I can't
do call of duty but you know battlefield
3 is probably a close second of those
games that become extremely annoying but
this is battlefield 3 this is Palace and
it is conquest domination here and it's
an alright gameplay I think I go like 17
and 5 or 17 and 6 something like that
maybe it's worse than that but whatever
we're gonna talk today about how to know
when it's time to upgrade your computers
now when it comes to a laptop it's a
little bit different we're going to be
talking about desktops today a laptop
you know is an all-in-one unit with the
exception of hard drive RAM and well I
guess that's pretty much it hard drive
and RAM is the only thing you can
upgrade in the laptop everything else is
soldered in it's a all-in-one unit that
you're just gonna probably have to
determine on your own whether or not
it's meeting your needs so we're gonna
go ahead and talk about the individual
components in the computer and when it's
time to upgrade how to know when it's
time and we're gonna go ahead and start
with the obvious graphics card why
because most of you guys like me like to
consider yourself gamers the graphics
card is usually one of the single most
expensive components inside of your
computer with the exception of probably
the entire computer itself and it's the
number one most influential factor in a
computer when it comes to gaming
performance now all day long every
single day day in and day out tons and
tons of comments and messages asking
this graphics card or this graphics card
should I upgrade my graphics card is my
graphics card good in the
and here's the bottom line when it comes
to that everybody's computer needs are
different
everybody's gaming standards are
different and the games everybody plays
are different and so the needs are going
to be different case-by-case now there
are some exceptions to games and
graphics cards and I want to throw those
out there now minecraft and Skyrim and
games like that usually simulator type
games require more CPU power than they
do graphics card powers so those are the
exceptions immediately because I know
you Minecraft fanatics and you Skyrim
players are gonna bite my head off if I
say CPU performance isn't that important
when it comes to gaming so those are
some of the exceptions right there
now when it comes to graphics cards if
your graphics card is no longer able to
meet the demands of the game and your
and your desired settings and you find
yourself having to reduce the settings
on games as you install them it might be
time to upgrade your graphics card and
what I mean by that is this game that
you're watching right here this is
battlefield 3 played on a GTX 680 and it
is overclocked right now on water and I
have all the settings maxed everything
is on max ultra everything is on the
highest tessellation setting I have
motion blur turned on everything is
running and this game never once dropped
below 60 frames per second and I do have
adaptive vsync which is an Nvidia
feature turned on so does it mean it's
time for me to upgrade this graphics
card if I'm a battlefield 3 player the
answer is no but if you're a hardware
junky like I am that 780 really starts
to look good because you look at it and
go well you know I like to have the
top-of-the-line stuff and sheesh I just
I really have a hard time telling myself
I don't need it
because you know that's the way I am so
the 680 is more than sufficient for the
game that I'm playing in this in this
commentary right here and including
Crysis 3 the game is just fine and these
are some of the most demanding games
that are out graphically right now still
Crysis 3 and battlefield 3 now I've got
battlefield 4 coming up so I'm gonna
bleep wait until it gosh I'd like to
think that I could wait that long
chances are I won't wait
but battlefield 4 may end up being a
little more demanding in my 680 may
start to dip down below 60
frames-per-second a little bit which
means that I'm gonna to start backing
off my settings now that's where you
determine whether or not it's time to
upgrade are you content with backing off
your settings to keep frames per second
at a decent you know playable frame rate
or are you a graphics whore like me and
you're gonna say well I want to keep
everything at Ultra and this card is no
longer cutting it so do I upgrade my
graphics card or add a second card or
whatever it is that's the question that
you guys all have to determine how
important is maximum ultra graphics
settings for you for me it's very
important so once the 680 no longer is
able to include Ultra settings on the
graphics I'm gonna put in either a
second card or upgrade to a 780 or
something along those lines or maybe an
AMD card if they've come out with
something better than the 780 when I'm
ready to purchase so with that said once
games are no longer able to play Ultra
settings it's time for me to upgrade my
card now for you if you're ok with
medium or you're ok with high then
you'll get more life and loud out of
your card now CPU CPU is not that
important when it comes to gaming 3d
games like this with the exception of
Minecraft and Skyrim or some of those
other games need to put a disclaimer
there so you guys don't actually buy my
head off like you did me other video
saying that minecraft is a demanding
game on your CPU there there's a
disclaimer so if you're a minecraft
player there you go if you're a
minecraft player you're gonna want to
have a more powerful CPU because it's
very CPU dependent game because there's
a lot of algorithms and there's a lot of
coding in there that demand high CPUs so
if you've got yourself a slow quad core
and it's just not cutting it it's
probably time to upgrade your CPU if
your game is no longer to play at a
frame rate that's important to you then
like minecraft or Skyrim
I think Skyrim is very heavy on memory
also then it may be time to consider
upgrading those but for the most part
CPUs are going to be most important to
people like me who are playing games and
rendering these games at the same time
doing live streams Photoshop
any of those types of programs maybe you
do graphics design maybe do web design
Dreamweaver maybe you're a programmer or
maybe you're just running virtual
machines or databases or whatever on
your on your computer then your CPU is
going to become a much more important
item to upgrade and if you're not a
heavy gamer but you definitely use a lot
of CPU heavy tasks like this then you
are gonna want to consider upgrading
your CPU when it's time to upgrade your
CPU is when it's not gonna be as cut and
dry as a GPU where you could say oh I've
got to lower my settings because I can
no longer play at a frame rate that's
enjoyable to me but what you may start
to realize is geez these tests that I do
these sequel scripts and I'm running
this database as I'm operating or this
editing that I'm doing is really
starting to take a long time it's
starting to just you know I'm tired of
waiting 45 minutes to render a video
when I know J's $0.02 is rendering 10
minute videos in under 11 minutes so
that's when it becomes important to you
or you have to determine how important
is your time to use your time worth $300
for a new CPU and in many cases in if
you upgrade the CPU you're gonna
probably have to get a new motherboard
as well unless you're on the AMD side
because AMD is very good at being
backwards compatibility or being
backwards compatible with their newer
CPUs onto older socket sets Intel could
probably take a little lesson from AMD
on that one so CPU and motherboard
pretty much go together a lot of people
have asked me if motherboards are
important to upgrade if they're going to
be putting the same CPU and GPU in there
pretty much no especially when it comes
to the Intel side because motherboards
really they do what they do I mean I
don't know how else to explain unless
you're gonna be looking at doing a lot
of overclocking most of the features on
a motherboard people never touch they
plug in their CPU they plug in their
graphics card and they just turned on
and off they go but if you're going to
be doing multiple graphics cards two-way
SLI 3-way SLI and if you're considering
doing four-way SLI chances are you're
not watching the video because you are
to do some sort of an enthusiast on your
own motherboards are really just you
know unless you got to get three
terabyte drive compatibility or you're
doing some sort of raid then you know
your motherboard is going to be one of
the lower things to consider when it
comes to upgrading you're never gonna
upgrade just your motherboard usually
you'll do it as a package so we'll just
throw that out there when it comes to
ram ram sort of falls into the same
category as cpu you can determine it's
time to upgrade your RAM if your
rendering is starting to become very
laggy and what I mean by that is your
CPU usage is not being maxed out you're
seeing that your CPU is instead of at
100% utilization when rendering a video
or doing some sort of video encoding or
you know you're doing DVD you know
copying or rent converting or whatever
you're doing file conversions and you
see your CPU is sitting at about 65 75 %
and it fluctuates up and down usually
what that means is there's a bottleneck
somewhere and in most cases that
bottleneck is gonna be either one the
memory or two your hard drive sometimes
your hard drive can't copy the data as
fast as it's being sent so it has to
slate says hey hey CPU slow down there
whoa slow your roll I can't I can't
write fast enough sometimes the memory
is saying whoa dude hold on I've got
everything I'm sending all the
information as fast as I can you're just
gonna have to chill a minute so that's
the easiest way to tell whether or not
it's gonna be time to upgrade your RAM
if a lot of these heavy rendering ops
you know tasks that you're doing are
slowing down the CPU in the sense that
the CPU is just like tapping its fingers
going okay any day now let's do this
which now brings us down to hard drives
hard drive is probably one of the most
immediate ways to see performance
increase especially inside windows and
game loading time hard drives versus
solid-state drives are just night and
day
check out my solid-state video if you
haven't seen it already when you put in
a solid-state drive you cut the read
time or you increase the read time
usually four or five times and you at
least at least double the write speed
depending on which SSD you go with and
they're only getting cheaper I
definitely recommend an SSD
you haven't already if you're still
running a hard drive it's time to
upgrade to an SSD regardless of what
drive you've got but guys I hope you've
enjoyed this battlefield 3 commentary I
know 11 minutes is a long video and
there's a lot of information to try and
get out in 11 minutes so put your
questions down in the comments as always
we've got an awesome community here on
Jason's channel a lot of you guys are
helping each other out and I think
that's great I appreciate you guys
watching my videos if you stumbled
across my little corner of YouTube hit
that subscribe button check out my other
videos if you don't like it feel free to
unsubscribe but check it out I've got a
lot of PC stuff up here technology stuff
got a whole variety of things that I do
on this channel reviews and look at this
guy can't be on the corner god they're
bolted to the head that's what he
deserves alright guys as always I really
appreciate you guys checking out my
channel here you guys have made YouTube
and wonderful experience thus far and
let's see just how far we can take this
little rollercoaster ride here on J's 2
cents and until next time I'll see you
in my next video when I see
