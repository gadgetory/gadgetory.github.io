sponsored by EVGA EVGA offers a wide
range of products including GPUs cases
power supplies motherboards and more to
learn how to take your rig to the next
level head to EVGA calm alright
continuing our Computex coverage here
with some private suites up here at the
beautiful Taipei Grand Hyatt nope we're
not staying here I kind of wish we're
hey anyone know where Vidya is can't
seem to find in video anyone all right
now we're not going to Nvidia today we
all know they have nothing new to show
we're gonna be going checking out some
private suites hear something like
fantex Corsair EVGA who else we checking
out EK water blocks we're gonna see what
kind of new stuff they have check it out
nvidia is up the swallow room because
everyone knows that GP p was hard to
swallow okay that's bad so i've been
sitting here for a significant amount of
time trying to figure out if that
security guard thing there was a
mannequin or a real person Brian tells
me it's a it's a mannequin because he's
standing in a little case I'm not
convinced I think he's watching us
alright guys we're here at EVGA and
they're showing off a new BIOS here
that's on when they're extra and I'm
dark boards and it's got a built in bio
stress test so instead of having to go
into Windows and do your prime95 your OC
CT or whatever sort of stress test you
want to use you can do it right here
inside the BIOS so they currently have a
79 80 XC on demonstration using one of
their a io coolers and as you can see
right now it's running a 79 ATX at 4
mega or 4 gigahertz at one point one
volts you can see we're getting 68 C but
it also has another function built in
where you can actually do an OC
overclock Robo overclock basically so
it's going to go in there and start to
incrementally increase the frequency and
the voltage to kind of find where it's
sweet you know happy spot is one thing
to keep in mind though is it definitely
will get warm as you're doing it so
you're gonna want to make sure you have
adequate cooling so there's an example
of that right here the OC robot is going
right now it's currently a four point
one one point two three and if you look
at the temperatures you'll see it's
definitely starting to climb that's very
indicative obviously the 79 80 X II
which is a very very hot
chip so we just hit 80
and 81 and this well we just went
critically to 90 see but this is kind of
nice because it means you can sit here
and dial in your overclocks and I'm go
ahead and stop it right there as it
almost it's 100 see you can definitely
dial in your overclocks here in the bios
and I asked them if this is indicative
of a you know similar experience is what
you'll get I'm 95 I was curious about
stability in the BIOS for stability in
the OS and they're saying that they are
showing very very similar results
alright so here's a new PSU from EVGA
this is what they're calling their super
7 basically it's going to be available
in a gold as well as a platinum rating
but it's sitting this is a thousand watt
PSU and it's sitting right next to one
of their 1600 watt PSU you can see
obviously the dual transformer in here
but they were telling me this
transformer here can actually scale up
to 1600 watts but what's important about
this if you look at the size of it this
is actually quite a bit smaller than
even a standard 1000 watt you're
typically used to seeing in fact here's
a representation of what a standard
thousand watt power supply would look
like currently from EVGA versus this guy
here so you can see that through the
quality improvement of components and
the transformer technology that they're
implementing in here they can get a much
smaller footprint for a thousand watt
PSU so this is good news for those
building small form-factor pcs micro ATX
pcs where a larger thousand watt what
definitely have been maybe a concern in
terms of fitment but PSU technology is
obviously shrinking and giving you the
same efficiency and power rating that
you're accustomed saying and then if
you're looking for the ultra small
form-factor here is an SFX power supply
you can see compared to the size of my
hand this is actually really small this
is a 650 watt standard this effect size
power supply from EVGA so not even an
SFX L which is typically what you would
find in this type of power rating so ya
see obviously some exciting stuff coming
from EVGA which has definitely been
making a splash in the industry over the
last few years in terms of their power
supply quality so that's definitely one
take we're taking a look at once it's
available alright one less thing we're
gonna look at here this is a new
motherboard from EVGA this is the ex 299
micro 2 we actually use this is the same
well the micro was the board we use when
we did the PDX LAN builds we're Jerry
and I did a build off and competed
against each other what makes this one
different is it's got active cool
erm a 14 phase vrm and slightly
redesigned wireless module to make it a
bit smaller but that makes this a much
more friendly for overclocking in a
micro ATX format with the actively
cooled 14 phase vrm and other than that
it's pretty much the same but a very
basic very sleek design EVGA is kind of
known with their their motherboards like
this is the dark x2 99 right here
they're kind of known with their boards
to not go over the top in terms of
flashiness and just give you features
which is you know in terms of stability
and build quality which is what you
really come to expect out to EVGA
motherboards alright guys we are way
over 2 EK water blocks we're showing
quite a few new products but everything
in here is pretty much new so this is
the new wave monoblock just kind of an
example of you know obviously we've got
some hard to be implementation in there
but they've changed the way that they
fluid is actually going to flow through
the block new CPU block right here which
is obviously much larger more surface
area this is on a rise end system right
here but you can see compared to the
original block designs much much larger
this is an example of one of their new a
iOS which is basically a full custom
loop the DDC style pump radiator
everything preassemble here is one of
the new velocity blocks which we're
going to be showing you right here as
you can see there's definitely an RGB
theme but trust me guys this this gets
good and you'll see it in a second so
these are the new thread Ripper blocks
right here we do my best I can to show
you considering the light is currently
glowing the fluid goes down through the
intake of the block but then it
separates and goes to different
directions and then meets back at the
top and the reason why they did that is
they found that there with the die size
of the tr4
and thread ripper that they needed to
split the flow rather than going across
the die that way you can heat both of
the elements inside of the core equally
so they were able to get better thermal
obviously dissipation at that with that
type of design here is what the Intel
and more mainstream block looks like but
this is the new velocity series so if
you've ever held a EK water block in the
past were built with it you remember
they had those flow plates that were
built in this is obviously all
completely redesigned
here's an example of one of the
plates right here the heat plates that
are built into the new philosophies blog
so definitely a whole new kind of a
revamp designed from the ground up one
of the things that was really popular
last year we took a look at was their
fluid gaming series remember the 240 240
G aluminum water cooling kits where
every part was aluminum including the
GPU block CPU block fittings radiator to
combat galvanic corrosion but I also
give you a very cost effective entry
point into water cooling if you've never
experienced it and you want more than an
AIO
but what they're showing here are a lot
of the expansion pieces that we've we're
told where we give me coming so you
could expand your loop add more GPUs
here's your fittings obviously you have
several different block designs as you
can see right here but what they're also
showing is some new covers these are
milled and anodized covers showing you
just how good that this can look but at
a price point that more people can
actually afford so just an example of
some of the custom designs they put on
their fluid gaming so we got sort of a
plexi clear obviously we've got a design
on one of the asset awls and then over
here this is an example when their fluid
gaming pre-built gaming system okay so
maybe RGB is not your thing
well ek special projects would probably
be for you this is just an example of
what happens when the owner of the
company Eddy himself is also very
passionate about woodworking these are
custom covers that have been made for
water blocks GPU blocks and as you can
see this is very very classy they have
three different types of wood here dark
walnut selenium walnut and had a Duke
fan oak I'm not entirely sure how to
pronounce it but as you can see the
grain is very very classy looking why am
I even showing this because this is all
custom made to order you have to order
the pieces and then they will make it so
if you are you know working for a
company that sells water cooling parts
you would have to buy all of these
pieces custom made which is not cheap
but where would I use something like
this well you guys know I'm doing the
post Malone build and you guys have been
wondering where that's at I have the
chassis now in the States it is in my
possession when I get back and we did
the custom wood guitar head like I
wanted to do in that custom or that
video where we talked about options with
that case but my concern was the only
wood in that case is going to be that
guitar head on the back of the
well now you guys can see the gears in
my head returning we just found a way to
incorporate more wood into this build
bringing it to a whole new level in
terms of classy so yeah if you guys like
the I the very sleek and very high-end
premium look of a wood element where
you're gonna definitely see a lot more
of it now in that build so here's an in
1s chassis they have on display here
obviously utilizing all of the RGB RGB
fans RGB blocks RGB reservoir RGB well
Ram you name it RGB is present alright
so here it is guys you've probably heard
by now quite a few times about the new
fan Tex evolve ex so this is basically a
successor to be very popular but a
little bit controversial airflow version
of the evolve last year so I did a build
in it and as you guys saw it did suffer
some temperature issues in terms of
water cooling but this isn't it this is
addressing all of those issues so it's
going to start with a front panel you
can how well picks up on cameras you can
see it's much bigger I can actually get
my hand in here into the side it's got a
bigger gap right here it sits away from
the the fan filter a little bit to allow
a little bit more airflow but on the top
you can see they've also expanded the
grill across the entire well most of the
top of the panel whereas before I had
the small slits now it has a much larger
opening as well as the the grill is not
quite as fine if you look on the side
too you can see we've got some
redesigned hardware cages and a vertical
GPU mount so they've definitely done a
lot in terms of not just fixing the
airflow but also adding some additional
features as well this case also natively
supports nine SSDs and 10 hard drives
all at the same time and then they've
got these doors that sort of fold away
so that cable management's kind of an
afterthought you don't have to worry
about cable management when it comes to
these especially when you have this many
this much storage cable management
definitely becomes something to be
concerned about so the front panel RGB
is actually contact based so when you
take off the front panel aid the lights
shut off as well and then you can access
your your fan filter your obviously your
front fans and you can see the RGB right
here on that front aluminium piece fan
tax has also been working on expanding
their water cooling lines so this is an
example of a water cooling loop it's
pretty much all fantex products so GPU
block CPU
and this really nice different not a
circular reservoir but is a DDC pump and
a reservoir integrated into one but as
you can see this is a rectangular design
so this is actually mounted to the front
fans you can see we've got some sort of
a pearlescent fluid going around in
there but this is also featuring the fan
Tech's fittings so fantex is also
definitely making an impact in the water
cooling scene so here's a prototype
they're showing off this is the fan
Tech's piece 600's it's a very raw
format right now but what's interesting
about this one here is it's got a focus
on silence so you can see we've got some
some foam material here on the front
panel to kind of cut down on some of the
sound and reverb reverb and what's
different about this one though is it is
using a fabric based fan filter so very
different from the typical metal mesh
that you're used to seeing the side here
is a tempered glass side panel but what
I also want you to notice is how there
are these rubber seals on here so when
you close the door this seals off not
only you know airflow but also any kind
of sound leak that could come through
the glass one of the nice things about
tempered glass is that it's shiny and
it's very very clear the sad part is you
can't seal it off very well with the
chassis but as you can see it's on a
hinge as well as the backside is also on
a hinge so you can see a lot of cable
management built in typical SSD trays on
the back a segmented bottom section for
your power supply and then on the top
also a removable panel for top case
airflow if you want it otherwise it's
closed off presumably with the same sort
of a foam sound isolator that way you
can go with a silent build if that's
your choice now you can't come to
Computex to not talk about Corsair so
this is a new chassis they're showing
it's an EM ATX chassis this is the 280 X
which is a part of the crystal series
you've got 3 tempered glass panels on
the top of the front and the side and it
comes in a couple of different variants
so you have the RGB variant which will
include two of the light loop fans on
the front obviously they've got this one
expanded with
the RGB strips on the side of course
we've got some of the RGB memory in
there but showing off an SL I can figure
out there with two founders edition
cards of course their vengeance RGB
memory and one of their a iOS but this
is a very sleek design it's it
definitely carries over from their err
series the dual chambers so the power
supply is actually over here on this
side this is actually ventilation and
then it's you got your power buttons
over here on the right and then you can
see that it pulls in air through these
gaps on the side of the glass and gaps
right here same thing with ventilation
on the top you have a gap right here on
the side gap on this side and as well as
the back and the front for it to exhaust
air if you have top fans and then on the
back you can see you have your typical
exhaust so this is actually the 280x
from Corsair tell me what you guys think
na TX a small form-factor are definitely
making a comeback and this is what
Corsair thinks that should look like
other than that there's as much RGB as
you can one we argue be here more RGB
here big wall to RGB orgy be there more
you'd be there the more you'd be there
oh look or you'll be over there here we
have an RGB control panel known as IQ
some more you be there when it comes to
the RAM yep you guessed it a whole lot
more RGB and you can look into the
peripherals as you can see more RGB so
that was sort of a quick look here at
the RGB view I mean the Corsair booth at
Computex 2018
anyway guys that's a wrap for us here
with our first person perspective
walkthrough of Computex obviously doing
the private suites here at the Grand
Hyatt anyway guys thanks for watching
and a huge thank you to our sponsor EVGA
for making this trip possible we're
gonna get out of here we will see you
guys back in the States and as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
