guess what the owner of red mist finally
got his hands on a couple of GTX 1080 so
that means that we can continue with the
red mist build log here very very soon
as soon as those are in my possession
but what does that mean well to me it
means the sooner I'm done with red mist
the sooner I can get started with the
skunk works update which I am really
excited about but I get a lot of
questions about what I'm planning on
doing moving forward so I thought I
would go ahead and just kind of have a
chat with you guys about my plans with
skunk works and why I'm going to do the
things I'm going to do if you're a
keyboard enthusiast and you will
definitely want to check out the red
scarf too plus currently available at
mass drop this build-it-yourself kit
featuring a unique 78 key layout
consists of a PCB clear acrylic bottom
and CNC aluminum case plate and feet and
even allows for customization of the RGB
under glow lighting if you want a
keyboard that is truly built to your
design in your specs then head to master
up using the link down in the
description now skunkworks has always
been one of those builds as the channel
grows I've always had the system growing
right alongside it it started off as a
pretty modest FX 8120 system when I
first started YouTube with a single GTX
680 in it which I had actually installed
just before I started the channel
paradise at a 580 but yeah it was a
pretty pretty modest system considering
it will even though I had a big water
cooling loop in it it was still pretty
modest but as the channel grew I kind of
wanted to build this big over-the-top
system that just kept growing alongside
it and as you can see it literally
became a massive behemoth of a machine
today that now houses three gtx titan
x's that are fully water-cooled dual
loops dual d5 pumps as you I mean as you
can see it's just like way over the top
and it's more computer than anybody ever
needs but the whole point of the system
was to continue to have it be kind of a
centerpiece and a showpiece that is a
physical representation of the growth of
the channel now the graphics power
evolution of this system like I said
with 580 then a 680 then I had a 780
then I had to 1780s and then it had
three seven 80s and I had three nine 80s
and now three Titan
and what I have noticed obviously over
those years is that the practicality
factor is not there but at the same time
the heat continues to grow and with how
powerful graphics cards are today I
thought that maybe it's time for a
little bit of a change I have three gtx
1080s
nvidia sponsored the graphics cards but
I'm thinking now 310 ATS with all of the
constant changes that they're making to
SLI the fact that they're not going to
be supporting SLI in games any longer
out of the box the enthusiasts key thing
was announced and then dropped and then
they'd just because of the constant
Fiasco with that I sat down with a
couple of my 10 80s over there my
founders boards the ones that were sent
to me for skunk works and I went how
does it really compare how does two GTX
1080s overclocked compared to on air by
the way founders coolers how do those
compare to say three GTX Titan X's on
water and also overclocked these guys
are overclocked to 1400 and 60 megahertz
all three of them all the time they're
at 1400 and 60 megahertz anytime I
opened up the any game that's what they
go to well here's how it looked with
fire strike now I only tested fire
strike because I was curious in that
score and the reason why I only use fire
strike now again I'm not doing this like
to as a review to show you guys should
you do to retighten exes or should you
do to 1080s this is just for my own
curiosity because fire strike was one of
the things I built the system for there
was a while there this system was
actually in the top 25 in the world when
it came to the fire strike 1080 score
amongst any configuration four-way
three-way two-way doesn't matter so it
was in the top 25 for a while that was
fun and that's what's fun to me but the
amount of heat that this system actually
puts out into the room the amount of
power draw this thing actually takes
from the wall even even with the power
reduction of Maxwell over Kepler and the
Kepler 780 s were really really hungry
for power the three tight necks is when
I start benchmarking it even in this
newer house will dim the lighting that's
how much power it draws from the wall so
like I really want
got to get that under control so that's
why I'm thinking to 1080s
is probably going to be a better
solution for me
now obviously you look at the benchmark
I put up and it's one of those things
where you can argue well J the three
tight nexus is still edging out the 210
80s but think about it I might lose a
little bit of fire strike score none of
the games I play even really support
three-way I mean yeah the three graphics
cards will do something but once you had
a third graphics card you can actually
add and introduce more latency be in
your gaming but it's one of those things
where believe it or not in most games I
went into the control panel and disabled
one of the cards anyway or would set it
to physics or something like that
so it got to the point to where I wasn't
even using 380s all the time or three
383 tight nexus what are three 80s oh
yeah that's AMD card so what I gain in
place of what I lose when it comes to
pure raw FPS performance is I actually
gain more power efficiency and it's
gonna be a lot less heat in this room so
what I plan on doing what skunk works
here is I've always loved green so I'm
actually going to be doing a green build
finally I did a blue build with the Nano
s I did the yellow build obviously first
I played around with orange now so now
I'm going to go ahead and do green I've
always been a fan of the way the green
looks now the fluid that's in here a lot
of people obviously you're like what the
heck is going on but you have problems
with pastel fluid this is test fluid
this was this has specifically been
running in the system now since duh
about a month and a half now almost two
months specifically to let it change
color and I'm going to send the fluid in
for testing and let those guys do what
they do in their laboratories I'm I'm no
chemist I'm I don't I don't cook the
myths so I don't I don't know any of
that stuff so I'm gonna let them decide
but I'm going to be going with the green
pastel that they're newer formula
they've come out with because it turns
out that the fluids at least what they
found in their testing too is the fluids
that are based on red like red yellow
orange those are the ones that tend to
change color the worst blue and green
and stuff like that tend to be a little
bit more resilient when it comes to
color change we're going to try that but
I think it's going to look really good
especially with the fact that I have
clear blocks also going on the 1080 just
like these guys here I think it looks me
when you can see the fluid through there
and I still don't install the back plate
on this guy I haven't touched it the
back plates came in but I haven't since
I did the how to install this video I
haven't actually done anything with it
so one of the things I'm also going to
be doing here is changing out the
motherboard the gigabyte SOC champion
and going with the msi god-like carbon
which is a really ridiculously expensive
motherboard but I like some of the
features that are on there and the other
thing that I also like to do with my
system is as a daily user experience
different motherboards and things like
that which as you guys know I've had
some rocky experiences with this
gigabyte motherboard although ironically
the BIOS update preparing for Broadwell
II actually fixed all the problems I was
having with my has welly my 59 60 X none
of the has well BIOS for this
motherboard actually fixed my problem
where I was getting boot loops or failed
BIOS posts and it was even failing to
post at stock speeds and video optimized
defaults but then finally when I updated
the BIOS to prepare for Broadwell II
which I'm not even going to put in here
by the way I all my problems went away
so that's kind of good but by far the
most stable overclocking motherboard I
have used to date is my x99 classified
and that's what's going to be going in
my test bench that way I can get you
know I can continue to use that
motherboard which I absolutely love but
I gained you know obviously the
stability on the test bench as well
which is going to be kind of nice but I
think one of the important reasons why
I'm making this video today is to kind
of answer the GPU question because so
many people have asked me why are you
doing three 1080s when you can't even
use three-way and gaming well I think
obviously the history of this launch has
shown that I feel like I'd be taking
more of a risk going 3-way than I did
initially when I was meeting with them
in Austin I mean I like the idea of the
enthusiast key to unlock 3-way and it's
like okay you've you know what you're
getting yourself into you it's not
really supported it's not optimized have
at it all and that was I was ok with
that but then now that that's been
dropped and it's no longer ok you can
you can you know sign this disclaimer
basically by installing the the
enthusiast key and then take the
experiences for what they've they will
they completely tore out the experience
of three-way gaming and put it in the
hands of the developers and the problem
is I don't see the
developers optimizing for dx12 and 3-way
anytime soon if at all because what
happens is I think as a developer you
look at it and go when the manufacturer
is dropping support why do you want to
support it when you're not going to get
the support of the manufacturer if you
need help so I that's why I made the
decision to finally just go with - now I
also thought about putting the third
card in there and again not having it be
part of SLI because obviously we do the
HP Bridge it's only going to be two-way
SLI what's the point of having a 1080
sitting in their third 1080 doing
nothing but handling physics which is
only supported in certain games and
having it sit there and do pretty much
nothing that's a waste and I can find
other things to do with that card then
just have it sitting in there between
two of them going hey guys can i play
too
one other thing I'm also going to be
doing what skunk works is I'm going to
be putting in some new EK radiators both
560 and 480 and actually wanted to put a
360 on the front the problem the problem
with that is unfortunately with how
thick the radiators are that I'm putting
in I can't fit a 360 in the front
without it interfering the fans and the
radiator on the top because this is a 30
mil red in here right now with hardware
labs and I'm going to be putting in 45
millimeter radiators which is going to
push it down 15 mil and there's going to
be a conflict but that other radiator I
was gonna be putting in the front was
going to be to also help handle some of
the tight Nick's heat which is now going
to be negated by the fact that I'm only
going to be putting in 210 80s so that's
not even going to be a big deal so
having a 5 60 and a 2 80 in the bottom
like I have now is obviously more than
enough cooling 4 to 10 80s like such
overkill it's not even funny but the
tight necks is on water believe it or
not do get all the way up to about 55 C
and depending on the benchmark and how
hard it stresses it I've seen it get
almost 60 C that's way too hot on water
as far as I'm concerned so it's time for
a change it's one of the reasons why I'm
also not a fan of this orange is the red
dye in it seems to react to the white
LEDs which is why you get this sort of a
pinkish reddish look where when the LEDs
are turned off then it looks obviously
very orange it's it's very orange with
the LEDs off but once a system turns on
in the LEDs turn on no matter how much I
adjust the LED inside a hue because this
is the hue plus lighting system and I
try and warm up that lighting it still
looks very pinkish red it's almost like
it's almost like it's UV orange but it's
not and the lights aren't even UV so I
don't know what that's all about but it
it just glows like a really pinky color
and I don't like that at all obviously
to get all the green stuff looking good
though that means I'm going to need more
cables customs leaf cables so that means
Joe with modders Inc is obviously gonna
have his work cut out for him again huge
shout out and thank you to him he's like
really slammed with work constantly has
stuff going on and he always seems to
fit me and get my cables done so right
now he's not taking any new orders but
definitely keep him in mind Joe with
moderate ink he's done all the sleeving
from any custom sleeves you seen on this
channel or any custom sleeves you've
seen in skunk works he's the one who's
done personally so definitely worth
keeping him in mind if you are looking
to get custom cables done when he's
ready to take new orders again but yeah
so he's working out a color theme on
cables where we getting those done he's
also the guy who did the cables for red
mist you'll see those when the build is
done but I think it's going to look good
here's here's kind of what it's going to
look like just using Photoshop to kind
of you know obviously change the hue on
the color to give you an idea of what
it's going to look like I'm pretty
excited I think it's going to look
really cool anyway guys thanks for
watching today's video
let me know if you have any ideas of
what you think would look really good in
skunk works I mean I'm always curious as
to what you guys would do because I do
get a lot of my inspiration from your
builds as well as you guys getting your
inspiration from mine so with that said
sound off in the comments or hit me up
on Twitter let me know what you would do
and we'll go from there so I'll see you
guys in next video and hopefully it's
gonna be about the HP bridge until then
guys have a good weekend and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
