tech addiction it's episode 3 and we got
a lot of to cover today so let's
get started so this week Sampson came
out with a brand new Galaxy S mini he's
got a 4-inch screen on an 800 x 400g on
it so pricing hasn't been released yet
but it's expected to be a bit more
competitive than the iphone this is
trying to directly compete with the
iphone competition and reading the
pricing down a little bit but without 4G
in today's 4G world I don't know who'd
be interested in it I wouldn't I don't
feel like taking 46 hours to download an
app although I already do on my iphone
4s but that's stuck on 3g the fact that
i ordered my iphone 5 2 weeks ago
haven't taken my money yet so I know
anyway this phone was put out to
directly compete with the old 4s now
that's been replaced by the iphone 5 and
the galaxy s3 which is their flagship
model is a little bit too expensive for
some folks so you don't need 4g and you
don't need a super high resolution
screen the probably the phone view so
the courts in Korea put an injunction on
the ruling against Apple that they
infringed on samsung patents and vice
versa but turns out they went ahead and
put a stay on that motion so the iPhone
and the iPad can temporarily be sold in
Korea but that right now is currently in
the appeals court so while that process
is going on it looks like you can still
buy your famous iphone and ipad products
in Korea but if you're in Korea and you
want to get an eye product you might as
well buy it now because I have a feeling
Apple's probably gonna lose this one CS
NBC is reporting that a mysterious
program that counted for four percent of
stock quotes and purchases buying the
stock market over the last week and they
say that this is some sort of a virus or
maybe a computer program that somebody's
testing out but it turns out this
program accounted for four percent of
stock quotes and then immediately
canceled them all so one program
accounted for four percent of total
market share and that was done from one
computers the estimate that over 500
stocks were actually affected by this
but could this be the beginning of
Skynet could this be the beginning of
total hacker domination who knows but a
lot of people believe that a lot of
traders use these types of programs to
give themselves a little bit of time to
make a decision or buy and trade and
they kind of hold up the stock and then
they release it when they want to buy it
based on what the market does so a lot
of people think that it's probably some
shenanigans involved there but in either
way if one program can account for % 500
stocks
he don't agree that's bad so there's
some new real-time mocap and virtual
reality technology out there where the
developers have bring the suit than
their arms their head their legs or
thighs and moving around like a gorilla
and you got this gorilla doing this
whole thing behind you and they say this
is probably the future of gaming I think
this guy looks kind of cool this is
pretty to be pretty neat in fighting
games could you imagine you know hey I
want to kick your ass Oh bring it bro
keep your ass too when I slap on your
virtual reality and let's go let's
see what kind of moves you got so
pre-program moves or anything like that
I see this technology going in beautiful
directions when it comes to fighting
games I don't think it would do very
good in MMOs or you know shooter games
because people aren't gonna be able to
run around their house with a gun and
stuff you know not to mention gonna run
into a wall I think it's kind of cool
though what do you think but the sensors
they wear translate very accurately as
you can see in the video right here and
I think this is probably the future of
gaming performs I went to where I found
this a lot of people seem to be against
it but I find that's because they just
want to sit in their ass in their chair
and they don't want to get up because
they're lazy stand up I'm standing up
right now dudes Metro sides here so
Toyota again every week I seem to have
something with Toyota I got this new car
they call a Toyota insect which
apparently stands for information
networks social electricity City
transporter it's got a top speed of 31
miles per hour it's got one seat in it
and it's got doors that don't even close
all the way to cover your legs are
exposed on the bottom but apparently
it's got a social network hooked up to
it next to your iPhone it connects to
the cloud and those kind of music you
want or connects to any phone really I
guess but the weird thing about this car
is that in the front of it there's a
camera and when you walk up to it
immediately recognizes your face and it
says oh hey you're so-and-so and you're
my car so completely I'm going to flash
the lights at you beep the horn and let
you know hey I recognize the weird part
is if you want to open the door gutta
apparently you go flap your arms
so could you imagine you know you
walking up to your car and I won't open
my door because that is the key your
face and your arms doing that opens the
door really this is where the future is
going tiny little electric cars that
only go 31 miles per hour you know
anything you got Billy Bob's
four-year-old tries to go behind you
know baby get out of the way mother you
know it's like I don't think this isn't
the Duke this isn't the way technology
needs to be going people besides it
looks like yellow rat 7 mouse or
something I don't really get it I don't
like it I'm 6 foot 4 i've never fit my
damn thing unless they're going to come
out with the you know a giant beetle
edition I'm never gonna be able to run
I'm gonna be able to ride one of these
things but I don't know the cool part
about it though is the fact that it
apparently recognizes you and when you
get in it says cool stuff you know hey
how are you where you want to go you're
cool you're awesome we all love you but
apparently even the voice in the car
will change based on your mood I don't
know how it supposed to know your mood
but you know I want when I get in the
car I want to be like hi Jason how are
you but people always tell me I'm angry
inside so if I got in the car if you
probably like but you want huh that asks
for two fabulous target yeah my car does
that it's not an insect high fat and how
are you what the is wrong with you
and your music so some public schools in
san antonio in a couple of other areas
in texas or under a lot of fire right
now because they're apparently our beta
testing the software and they're forcing
their kids to wear rfid or radio
frequency identification chips inside
the students ID cards and they're
expecting these kids to wear these all
times either around their neck or in
their pocket but basically it's got a
transmitter in it that will let staff
know wherever this child is at any time
but one grave girl stood up to the
school and said no you're invading my
right to privacy so I'm not gonna
conform to this so what happened she's
not allowed in the cafeteria they won't
food she's not allowed in the library
she's not allowed to go to homecoming or
to vote for homecoming prom king or
homecoming king and queen or prom king
and queen but the superintendent writes
a letter to the parents of the student
it says that it's not mandatory but that
it will soon become mandatory and that
the repercussions of her not wearing
this ID card are going to adversely
affect her accurate academic curriculum
I hope the parents fight this I hope
they take it all the way to court I hope
the San Antonio school district it's a
hell of a fine out of this because this
is unconstitutional you're not from the
United States this is in the United
States oh but if you're not from the
United States you know this just stomps
all over your right to privacy and I
don't know about you I'm caring I don't
want somebody else having the ability to
track my child so I can't wait to see
how this turns out because I think San
Antonio is about to have serious lawsuit
on their hands and I hope they lose now
this one's just got me all kinds of
pissed if you live in America your
ability to sell and buy used items is in
jeopardy and i don't mean Alex Trebek
jeopardy I mean real jeopardy there's
this law in America that says that you
manufacture something whether it be a
DVD player a CD a movie and Xbox
whatever i buy it from you as the person
who manufactured it or the retailer for
that person I have the right to resell
it to whoever I want that's called the
first sale doctrine however that
doctrine is in some serious trouble
right now in the sense that there's a
case that happened back in 1995 where a
student came over here to upstate New
York and with Cornell University from
Thailand and notice that holy
college books are expensive here if
you've ever gone to college you know
college books up getting expensive
ridiculously expensive so he looked oh
my god these exact same books were
available in Thailand for like a third
of the cost so what does he do mom dad I
up all these books call grandma called
grandpa called r46 cousins call you know
everybody call my friends have everybody
send me money so I can buy these books
so he goes and he buys all these books
here has the by all these books in
Thailand has them shipping man
tons and tons of books so he turns
around he sells on ebay bitch 1.2
million dollars in profit so the
publishers of this book wiley &amp;amp; sons
says that's not fair that's our money
and they took him to court said it was
copyright infringement first of all he
bought me sold it so I don't has
copyright infringement this guy from
Thailand his defense was the first cell
Goethe said hey I bought it it's mine to
do with what I want if I was able to
sell it for more than I bought it for
make money on it that's too bad for you
you are in major money while it turns
out that this doctrine only protects
things that are manufactured in the
United States but once again here from
the United States you know nobody makes
 here too expensive to make things
here everything's made overseas right
it's all made elsewhere so he lost his
case it's back into Appeals now and
basically if this loses the first sale
doctrine only protects things that are
made in the manufacturing United States
what does that mean for buying and
selling used cars what about Craigslist
eBay all the second product and third
product market what's going to happen to
that how many people are going to lose
their jobs because nobody is going to go
through the hassle of giving a cut or
getting permission the main part is you
have to get permission from the
manufacturer or the publisher to sell
those items that's bad because what's
going to happen is the things that are
still being manufactured the United
States are going to be moved over steves
because they're gonna want to get a cut
of all the second third for kids sales
as well and there's no limit to how many
times they get repaid on something that
they've already been paid on it makes no
sense whatsoever and those of you who
buy and sell games at gamestop no more
can't do it re selling a product on
steam sales you can't do it that yard
sale ah can't do it so I think you all
should be watching this because there's
not a single person watching this video
who's never bought or sold something
that's been used and it's going to
affect every single one of us so this
has really got me hot under the collar
you got no respect so cnet is reporting
on a brand new virus that's making its
way around skype apparently what it does
is it hold your computer ransom you get
a random skype from somebody or even
possibly somebody you know and it has an
attachment with it if you click and open
this attachment pick and Crips all the
files on your computer and brings up the
screen and says that your computer has
been observed downloading torrents child
pornography illegal drug activity all of
this illegal stuff and is claiming to be
in the US federal government the cyber
protection act or something like that
and says that they're going to charge
you a two-hundred-dollar fine and odor
because your files back and you only
have 48 hours to apply before they wipe
all your files I do do do what they want
you to do is I want you to go down to
your local walgreens or rite aid or
walmart and get moneypak cards and
scratch off the numbers on the back and
type it in hit OK and then you've got
access to your computer back obviously
this isn't a legit government thing but
it is a pretty interesting scam and some
people have reported that it truly did
lock them out of their computer and they
did lose everything when they didn't
comply so if you get an IM for someone
you don't know and skype definitely
don't click on anything that they send
you and even if you know someone on
skype and they're sending you a file
make sure you ask them what it is first
and make sure they know they're sending
you a file because apparently skype was
sending out I am with attachments while
people were online and they didn't even
know that they were sending them out you
know me on skype and I send you a file
be like hey he said to me I
would I would do that to you it's time
for the way we end this show every
single week technologies dumbass of the
week and this week that is Brandi Rogers
you see Brandi Rogers has a friend on
Facebook but she's very envious that
friend always has lots of nice things
he's going out to eat at nice places has
a nice car Brandi just thinks that stuff
so what does she do sure castrates in at
gunpoint robbery of her friend so one
thing led to another her friend figured
out that it was brandy Roger she
orchestrated the whole thing and
meanwhile their friends on Facebook the
whole time I just like to go ahead and
say if any of you out there are
criminals who watch me media's Facebook
probably shouldn't use paper because
it's a bit of a trend here if you
haven't noticed facebook is probably
your worst enemy as a robber especially
if you're gonna choose people to rob
from your facebook friends list now and
use the phone book
so anyway brand new Rogers decides a
couple of days after the robbery to
tweet where she's gonna go to her nice
fancy dinner about some newfound cash so
police go and the rest are there so as I
said if you're a criminal don't use
facebook because you're already a
dumbass and you even a bigger dumbass
especially when you're caught because of
facebook Randy Rogers you're a dumbass
alright guys that's all I got this week
I gotta get out of here but here are
some other episodes tech addiction if
you haven't checked them out and there's
something you want to talk about next
week's tech addiction put it in the
comments down below I'll just research
about it and i'll talk about as always
follow me on twitter subscribe for more
and i'll see you on next episode of tech
