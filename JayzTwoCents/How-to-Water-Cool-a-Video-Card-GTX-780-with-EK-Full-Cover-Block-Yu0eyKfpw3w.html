time that I've covered a lot of
water-cooling topics however I have
failed to actually provide you guys a
video on how to properly and safely
install your video card waterblock so
that's exactly we're going to do here
today with my GTX 780
now I know I've said it in other videos
but it's very important to just go ahead
and say this again anything worth doing
is worth doing right and to do it right
you have to have the right tools now of
course we have our graphics card right
here my 780 vanilla the GPU block we're
gonna be using is e K FC 780 GTX water
block we are going to be adding an
optional back plate to that but there
are some other things that you're going
to need to make sure that you get the
job done right you of course you're
going to need some sort of thermal paste
this thermal paste came with it this is
their they call it ectotherm I've never
actually used this can't wait to see how
well it performs you're going to need
some isopropyl alcohol to clean off the
old thermal paste from the stock cooler
and you are going to need some basic
tools now in this here I'm just using a
cheap little call to fix it tools it's
just a cheap little tool kit that's got
some of the most basic sizes you could
possibly need for different types of you
know tools I got some little pliers some
cutters I've got my tools for removing
you know cable plugs and things
different size screwdrivers screwdriver
head tips that sort of thing so it's got
everything I could really kind of need
for a job like this you need some sort
of lint-free cloth I'm going to be using
a microfiber in this case I've got a
microfiber I use just for these thermal
paste cleaning sessions now if there's
any sort of specialty tool needed there
usually will include it with the water
block depending on the brand you go with
now remember this is going to be your
application may vary because every
single brand kind of does things their
own way so in this case DK it provides
you with the various tools that you need
the big giant allen key because you have
to plug off the holes that you're not
using the thermal pads for your memory
and your VRMs and your installation
manual very important to read this read
the manual because you want to make sure
that there's nothing that you're missing
here and they show you pretty much
exactly how to take apart your water
block and put it together specific for
your water block at least ek is really
good about those instructions so here's
a water block that we're going to be
using right here the acetal and I don't
know if it's going to make it out before
this video or not but I did
do an unboxing and overview this
graphics card waterblock
so don't know more about it go and check
that out may or may not get before this
video I honestly just don't know so we
want to get our artwork area nice and
prepped you're going to be dealing with
some small screws so I recommend getting
a little Bowl or a jar or something I'm
just going to kind of set mine off to
the side over here off camera I have a
little space there where I have my got
would be worried about anything bump in
it but get everything nice and laid out
so you know where everything is you're
not fumbling around with trying to find
things you just want to have a nice tidy
workspace now in my case I am using this
CM Storm rx power rx mousepad because
it's kind of rubbery and it gives me a
good surface to work on it's anti-static
and so it's not going to scratch my desk
or damage the card now again like I said
read the manual before actually taking
apart the card so I'm gonna do now is
I'm going to read the manual get a
little bit familiar with what to expect
when doing this card and I'm going to
read them again and then we'll go ahead
and get started okay so step one is
going to go ahead and be to remove the
stock cooler now the first thing you
want to do is become familiar with your
cooler identify where all the screws are
the type of screws that you're dealing
with here find those ones that may be
hidden like the two that are on the
front right here on the the actual
exhaust grill and make sure that you get
all of these screws removed and then
once you do that you want to gently
twist it off to remove it you don't want
to pull it or pry it because you could
bend the card you'll gently twist it but
when we get to that point we'll discuss
the best way to take off the actual
stock cooler
and one thing you can do that I
recommend is just to take the old screws
and screw them back into the stock
cooler that way you never lose them you
don't have to worry about work try to
remember where you stuck them they're
always easily accessible all right once
you have your stock water cooler removed
this is where you want to take your
lint-free cloth in your isopropyl
alcohol and just kind of pour it all
over your graphics card no no please
don't do that you want to clean off all
the old thermal paste on here now a lot
of people like to use unused coffee
filters which is really cheap and I
don't happen to have any so I'm not
using any but don't use paper towels or
toilet paper because those are fibrous
clogs that will leave fibers on the
actual die and you don't want to do that
because it can create issues when it
comes to your cooling so just pour a
little bit of isopropyl alcohol here on
your lint-free cloth and then just kind
of gently go to town on there and get
out all of that old thermal paste off
it's very important to have a perfectly
clean surface that way you're not
dealing with any contaminants on there
now the next thing to do here on your
graphics card installation is to figure
out where your thermal pads are going to
go these thermal bed pads are what cool
your vrm as well as the chokes and the
RAM modules on your graphics card so
make sure that you refer to the manual
that comes with your GPU block to make
sure that you're doing it properly all
right we've got all of our thermal pads
here installed on our GTX 780 now one of
the things I really like about ek is
they're sure to give you plenty of
thermal pads in case you happen to make
a mistake so you're not kind of ass out
of luck you can see I've got all of the
RAM chips here with thermal pads we've
got the vrm so we've got the chokes
we've got pretty much everything here
nice and thermal padded up and we've got
plenty of spares so good job there now
one thing to keep in mind with thermal
pads is there are two sides to it you do
have this white backing here which you
take off when you stick it down and then
there is a clear film on top you need to
make sure you take that off if you don't
you're going to have thermal problems
now that we're done with that the next
thing to do is actually put on the
thermal paste and start to apply or
install our block like so now thermal
paste applications one of those things
there's a lot of debate on right way and
wrong way to do it I am going to be
following Ek zone instructions as you
can see right here they kind of
recommend a star pattern you know what
it's their block I'm going to go ahead
and do it their way and then we'll start
to get everything mounted down
all right we're getting to the end now
we've got a thermal paste in store put
on there it's kind of as pretty as I'd
like it to be but then again the opening
that comes on their little tube is a
little bit fat so it lets a lot come out
so make sure you get that installed
properly now what you want to do is you
want to take your block and you want to
line it up with the screw holes and the
actual dye on there it's only going to
line up really one way I mean you can
see that you got this little cutout here
for these capacitors so it pretty much
is a good point at determining where to
line it up feel it making contact with
everything there just kind of push it
down gently and we're going to hold her
together with our thumb and our index
finger we're going to flip it over and
we're going to line up all of the holes
now I'm going to go ahead and put in the
four screws that you can see are marked
out here for the GPU itself and then
what we're going to do is I have to do
things a little bit differently in this
tutorial because remember we are doing a
backplate on this so there's a specific
screw order that we have to deal with so
go ahead and take out your hardware and
then get out the screws that are
specifically labeled for your GPU for
the actual seat or the GPU holder or the
bracket is right here make sure you use
your washers and then we'll come back
and show you what's next I guess it's
kind of how these whole these tutorial
things work only we show you how
something is done and we do it together
there's a big old happy family
okay now you want to do the four as I
mentioned that surround the GPU first
and you want to tighten these down in a
star pattern it's most important when
you're installing these blocks that you
tighten down from the GPU and work your
way out it's most important that you
have proper connection here at the GPU
die because that is the most important
part of the cooling that we're doing
here with this and everything else is
kind of secondary as you can see I'm
sort of moving around in a star pattern
now one of the things I really like
about the ek blocks is their tolerances
are perfect so the screw holes are only
screwed as deep as the screw is meant to
go so one it keeps you from crushing
your die and two it keeps you from
stripping out your threads so this is
how the block looks on the front side as
you can see it is a full cover from
front to back makes it a little bit
heavy but you know that's really not too
much of an issue because it does have a
backplate that's going to help support
the rigidity of the card so I'm going to
do now is I'm going to go ahead and pull
out my backplate instructions and I'm
going to reference those to see which
screws can be installed after we get the
GPU block on because like I mentioned
there is a specific order that this has
to go now it also includes in this with
this backplate here some thermal pads if
we were installing on a Titan which we
are not so I don't need to worry about
that now according to the instructions
here for the backplate it says that I
can go ahead and basically install these
four and I'll make it match the picture
here I know you guys can't really see
the picture but bear with me it says
that I can install these four screws
which I already did these two outer
screws this screw and the corner screw
and then I can do the back place well go
ahead and do that and then we'll pretty
much be done at that point
okay now if you were only installing the
front block or the main block and you
weren't doing a back plate you would do
all of your screws according to your
manual and you'd pretty much be done at
that point
now since we are installing the optional
back plate we're going to just go ahead
and show you how that works so I went
ahead and installed the screws that the
manual said was okay to pre install with
the block this lays right over the
backside just like so and then you take
the included screws and you just
basically screw it down and sandwiches
it together with the card and you're
pretty much done
well there she is guys my brand-new
liquid-cooled GTX 780 here with the ek
full cover water block we have also got
on there the back plate which is
extremely slick literally it looks
awesome this has got to be one of the
nicest video card setups I've had
personally not just because it's the 780
but just everything aesthetically on it
is really really badass so there you go
guys if you follow this tutorial and the
instructions that come with your
equipment you now would have a fully
liquid-cooled graphics card as I do here
I hope this tutorial has helped you guys
out make sure you check out my other
videos I have lots of tutorials on
overclocking how to do water cooling
both basic and advanced overclocks
I'll link those somewhere around here
maybe in the outro but guys as always if
this stuff helped you give that video a
thumbs up if you hated it give it a
thumbs down and comment and tell me what
you guys think about what this setup
looks like can't wait to get it in the
system and do some benchmarking and
overclocking and seeing just how much
power I can pull out of this GTX 780 now
that it is fully veined up it's got
blood right into it
guys I'm gonna get on out of here as
always I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
