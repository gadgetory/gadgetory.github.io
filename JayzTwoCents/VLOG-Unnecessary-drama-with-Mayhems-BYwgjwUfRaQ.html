it's been a while since I had to make a
video like this in fact the last time I
did this was back in February of this
year 2015 who knows when you guys are
watching this could be the future that's
the way the internet works with the
falling outs of frozen CPU and all drama
that took place there what's funny is a
lot of people told me I was wrong
regarding that situation which I ended
up being completely right about but only
because I had inside information and I
wanted you guys to be aware as customers
of possibly not kidding the products
that you were paying for and getting
your buddy tied up in you know banks and
trying to get refunds and stuff of a
company that was completely defunct at
that time now I'm doing this once again
not about a company that you might not
get your products from but just got to
make people aware of customer service
and how important it really is when it
comes to customers now I want to start
off by saying yes this is about the
issue of Mayhem's you know the maker of
the pastel fluid basically you guys have
seen that when I was doing the
skunkworks vlogs over the past six
months or so that I had been dealing
with color shifting when it comes to
only one loop inside of my system where
the yellow was turning a very brownish
orange color over time
no yes Mayhem's did reach out to me back
in October when I first mentioned that
this was happening why I mentioned that
it happened the second time at that
point roundabout way one of the reps for
aqua tuning actually got in touch with
Mayhem's and the Mayhem's contacted main
requested a sample of the fluid be sent
to them all the way in england so that
they could test the ph balance of it
unfortunately because they didn't have
direct communication with me they've
never sponsored me they've never sent me
anything they had no way of directly
communicating with me so by the time
that communication made its way to me
the fluid was already down the drain
which is I didn't I didn't reason to
save the fluid especially when it came
to being several days later the last
thing I would have wanted to do is spill
that stuff on my carpet I mean
technically it's it's not even safe to
put down the drain so you have to
dispose of it a little bit differently
around here where I live so yes
first things first when they say they
reached out to me in the past they did
request a sample I couldn't get that to
them because the fluid was already gone
but let's go ahead and fast forward a
few months here I have done the
skunkworks vlogs now where I
show that I'm updating the system and I
was really disappointed because of the
fact that I've been using Mayhem's
pastel yellow now exclusively for the
last two years a sunset yellow and it
was only recently when I started having
any sort of problems with it and I
tribute it to that to the fact that it
was the pre-mixed bottle now I also want
to address a lot of people were claiming
that I may have mixed it improperly
where the parts you know the 250
milliliter bottle - 750 milliliters of
water I might have gotten that out of
balance which could have affected the pH
neutral of the fluid itself well I'm
holding this bottle to show you that
this was the first time I ordered premix
fluids and I thought that might have
been the issue so then I drained it and
then I put in a mix fluid again or are a
concentrated fluid again mixed it again
and got the same results now before I
talk about the drama that happened on
Twitter because I know that's why you
guys are watching this it's important
that you understand the order of events
now this is only happening in one loop
this is only happening in the GPU loop
not the CPU loop and people have said
well it's because you're using ptg it's
because you're using tygon tubing it's
because of the heat the GPU loop all
those situations and scenarios could be
true it could be one it could be all of
them with the exception of the tubing
anyway I was not using tygon in this up
until now I put tygon in there now that
I'm using the Premio chill fluid however
I was using primo chills Advanced LRT
tubing which I picked up at micro Center
because it was on sale so it wasn't
tygon in the basement so yes guys I'm
aware mayhem says don't use pastel with
tigon unfortunately I wasn't using tygon
know the comments that were made when it
came to me doing this blog yes I said I
am done with pastel if this had been a
one-off scenario where it was only
happening to me that I might have been a
little bit more interested in trying to
figure out why but if you just do a
simple internet search you guys will see
that there has been a lot of people
complaining about color shift on all the
different colors that mayhem is actually
sells when it comes to the pastel nano
fluid now I've been a huge proponent for
nano fluids I have loved the actual
temperature decrease that you get with
the nano particles they seem to really
do their job over just a standard fluid
or even distilled water but I just got
really tired of having to tear this
thing apart and because so many people
were having this problem I looked at
this as being a possible thing that's
going to continue happening to me based
on the components that are in this
system now the different things that are
in the loop
the fluids we have got the acetal
material in the pump we've got the pump
itself they've got the acrylic reservoir
we've got PE TG tubing we had soft
tubing in the basement and we had the
copper radiators from hardware labs now
it really does point to the fact that it
could very well be flux in the radiators
that's causing this however I clean
these radiators now five times this loop
made fifth time of cleaning it I had
cleaned it four times and it was still
changing color on me in only one loop
and that's what doesn't make sense to me
is the fact that the CPU loop which has
the same metals the same radiators and
the same plastics touching it we're not
changing color
now think it might have in the soft
tubing Mayhem's did reach out to me back
in October and say they didn't think it
was the tubing which at that point was
like well that I don't know what it
could possibly be I would have gladly
sent them a sample however it was
already gone so go ahead and
fast-forward to the present where
apparently they saw the last vlog and on
Christmas Day decided to put me on a
public blast where they were saying
things like well J maybe you should just
stick to air cooling and drilling
through main boards or learn how to
water coal before you talk and basically
took a very personal attack on what I
was saying about pastel being sensitive
because let's not fool ourselves here
pastel is sensitive to impurities in the
loop and the pastel nanoparticles pick
up those those impurities and will
actually start circulating through that
through the loop if I turn the loop off
for more than a day a black film was
forming on top of the yellow so I don't
know what the black is but again like I
said it didn't really matter I wanted to
move on to something else and try other
things but somewhere along the lines
they took this as some sort of a
personal attack of me saying that I
personally am NOT going to use pastel
anymore I never once told people it was
a bad product I never once told people
not to use it
in fact plenty of people have come to
their defense and said that they've had
absolutely no problems with their pastel
and their their systems which is always
kind of funny to me
not that I'm calling them out of being
wrong I see the pictures there's no
reason for me to believe that they would
lie about that it's just that it looks
like the components that they're using
are identical to mine with the exception
of the radiator so that's what makes me
think it could possibly be the radiators
but I don't know I mean hardware labs
have have known to be pretty clean
radiators I have acid
cleans them as well as flushing out all
of the acid use vinegar distilled water
everything I possibly could think of to
clean these radiators out and they
continue to change color and only one
loop so my thought here is that the heat
of the GPU loop is accelerating the
process of whatever is happening but the
heat isn't actually the source of that
so there's plenty of people saying
they've had good experiences with this
and there's no reason for me to tell
people not to buy their product but what
I am going to tell you today is you need
to be aware of what it is you're
actually supporting now as I've said
before Mayhem's is not a sponsor they
have never sent me a single product
everything you see here that dyes the
coolants and everything up until the
last skunkworks
update was actually purchased out of
pocket by me because I have supported
Mayhem's shoot I want to say 2011 / 2010
was the first time I started using their
products and I was in love I thought
everything they did was great all the
client builds I did were actually using
Mayhem's like x1 fluids coconut monkeys
fluid a system that I just did an
upgrade on that blue was a Mayhem's
fluid I have been using mayhem fluid
exclusively since I've been doing
YouTube and before so I don't understand
what it is that made them really go off
the rocker but they started to attack me
personally but if they would treat
someone who has the amount of reach that
I do telling people about my experiences
with products and customer service which
is the whole point of this channel what
would they do and how would they treat
someone who doesn't have a following now
there's a lot a lot of customer feedback
out there of Mayhem's just having
complete and utter bad attitudes which
is really unfortunate not I mean you can
see here in some of the screenshots that
this is the way that they reach out to
people when they have some sort of a
problem now admittedly the first time
they did not act this way so the point
of today's video is to understand a
couple of things one I never said pastel
was a bad fluid I never said that I said
I'm done with it I've used it and every
build I've done since I started the
channel once I upgraded from AMD system
which was using distilled water with the
excess PC concentrate in it the red one
I have only used their products because
I thought it was a great product and my
job is to also let people know about my
experiences with various things and my
experience has been without a doubt that
the pastel has been changing colors on
me for whatever reason now I never said
again I know I'm repeating myself
because
very important you understand I never
said don't buy pastel I never said don't
buy Mayhem's fluid Mayhem's dye is
currently in my orange system right here
which you guys have been watching me
build so if I hated the company so much
why would I still be using their product
because I think they make a good product
it's just unfortunate that they don't
know customer service or how to treat
the customers so the bottom line here
based on what you've seen is for you
guys to decide on your own if you're
okay with buying a product and
supporting a company that treats its
customers this way or if you want to
speak with your dollars when it comes to
not supporting a company that would
treat their their customers this way I
really if you guys have had experience
with Mayhem's put your experience down
in the comments let other people read
and try and decide not do me a favor
this is not a lynch mob this is not AJ's
army call to action boycott Mayhem's
this is Jay telling you my experience
and letting you guys decide how you want
to best handle the situation for you I
would never tell a person not to buy
something because I always feel that the
decision and the choice is yours to
determine the only time I said don't buy
anything was from frozen cpu and that
was because your money was going to get
tied up in the banks because there was
no one there to fulfill your order and
you're going to printing claims and that
was going to be a big deal so I want you
guys get your money stuck that was the
only time I've ever done that but I can
tell you right now that moving forward
simply based on their customer service I
can no longer recommend spending your
money on a company that would treats
customers this way which is really
unfortunate because I think they make a
good product they really do I love the
way the pastel looks I've always loved
the way that the clear or the the opaque
very solid appearance of the coolant
looks and I really wish I'd gotten down
to the bottom line of what was happening
in the loop and I didn't even think to
save any of the coolant this time around
fact I think I might actually have a
small sample of it still I notice I'm
still sitting in the blocks but I didn't
think to save it again this time which
is my bad because I wasn't in
communication with Mayhem's like I said
they're not a sponsor of mine they're
not somebody I work with so I didn't
think on the surface like I should send
this off to Mayhem's but I don't know
exactly what they would have come up
with because their answer always seems
to be the same it's acidic or its pH
level or it's your radiators they've
never once come back and said it's the
fluid maybe that's the truth I don't
know like I said I feel that the
: is sensitive never said the coal is
bad I said it's sensitive to impurities
in the loop tiny Tom Logan overdose III
D net has had the same problem and
unfortunately he had the same response
where Michael would put him on blast now
the other thing I want to point out too
is a lot of people have said things like
wow you should fire your PR guy for the
Twitter account you guys need to
understand that all those tweets that
you saw were from the owner himself not
a PR guy so that attitude is coming from
the top is there now I want to address
that real quick too we're very
passionate about what we do I'm
passionate about my channel I'm
passionate about my work we're human
beings so are they we feel attacked
it's knee-jerk reaction to kind of
attack back because you feel like your
values and your morals and your ethics
and your standards have been attacked
and then you take that a very personal
level and by reciprocating the exact
actions that you get I'm guilty of it
I'm guilty of being someone who's been
fairly aggressive in my comments and on
my youtubes because sometimes you're
just having a bad day and you're going
to read a comment and you think well I
do all this hard work I do all I spend a
lot of time and sacrifice a lot of time
to make these videos for you guys yeah
it's my source of income and you guys
have to sacrifice your time to go to
work and stuff but sometimes if you guys
work overtime you know sometimes you
miss out on things because you feel an
obligation and dedication to the
audience at least I do to make sure that
I get you guys content that you guys
want to see if you want to see it great
if you don't take a hike I don't want
you here anyway if you don't want to see
it that's the bottom line so I
understand what it's like to feel tacked
in and get sensitive and overreact to a
situation which clearly Mayhem's did
here because he felt his work was being
attacked which is kind of sad because I
never attacked it I simply said I'm
going to try something else now it's
time to try something else I mean I
wasn't oh if he thought I was only going
to use pastel from now on and I mean
that was kind of a kind of a crazy thing
to think but anyway so I can understand
where he's coming from and I'm not
giving him a bind I'm not giving him a
pass I didn't even want to make this
video but so many people on Twitter want
to know exactly what was happening that
I decided this video needed to be made
and you guys need to decide on your own
whether or not this is a company you
want to support unfortunately I will no
longer be supporting Mayhem's in the
future I will no longer be using their
products in my builds
I'm sure on my side of the line people
are jumping up and down like a Ajaj
that's not what I'm asking for and the
same thing for the people who are
attacking me defending Mayhem's that's
perfectly expected too because a company
they like as being well I wouldn't say
attacked but a company they like is
getting unfavorable response from
somebody who has some pool and I can
understand their their knee-jerk
reaction to to defend a brand that they
really care about right we all do that
with Intel AMD Nvidia right some of the
attacks AMD is an AMD fan you attack the
Nvidia fanboy so it's no different it's
really no different but the difference
here is when you're a company or you're
a public personality like myself or
Jerry or Logan over text in the kit
doesn't matter everything you do gets
scrutinized
so to think oh you know they're human
just let go yeah the difference is when
there's a lot of eyes on you the way you
respond in the way you talk definitely
can reflect on you and I'm certainly not
perfect and I'm guilty of new jerking -
and for that I'm also apologizing to
anyone that I may have offended with any
of my knee-jerk reactions but I can at
least say I understand where they're
coming from on why they reacted the way
they did it's just unfortunate that I
went to bed last night thinking well
maybe I overreacted maybe I should chill
out a little bit woke up thinking okay
maybe I should do a video about fluids
and what to look for and what - if
you're going to use pastel the kind of
maintenance that might be involved prep
for the system as well as what might
happen in that you guys decide because
after all that's been my experience with
it but then last night and this morning
remember they're there in the UK so
there's about a 9 to 10 hour difference
here in time so I went to bed woke up
thinking wow ok how can I make the best
of this situation and keep this from
getting any more line drawn in the sand
and fanboys lining up on both sides
because I don't want that I don't want
my fans attacking Mayhem's and
vice-versa but then I woke up and saw
that they claim they have a new PR guy
and they're being very apologetic on
Twitter and owning up saying I made a
mistake but then to see that they're
only trash-talking on Facebook now on
their personal accounts so there really
is no remorse there so anything you guys
see on the surface from Mayhem's
apologizing it's just it's just damage
control it's not genuine and it's not
true so that's
so for you guys to determine if that's
what you want to support so there it is
as what happened in a nutshell I said I
was done using pay pastel never said I
had a problem with the company in fact I
still use so used a lot of their
products and still endorse a lot of
their stuff PC part picker lists I put
together people ask me what products to
buy what flutes divide always recommend
Mayhem's but now that's no longer going
to be the case I will always recommend
the alternative and it's unfortunate and
it's not like I'm the end of the company
it's not like I'm going to hurt their
bottom line they might notice some
different sales but guys I'm just one
person on the internet with one opinion
and that's what it comes down to and you
guys are a lot of people with lots of
opinions so let's hear them down in the
comments I know this is going to be a
flame fest try and keep it civil
remember vote with your dollars if you
guys are okay with supporting a company
that treats its customers this way it's
your money it's your choice I won't do
it anymore
alright guys sound off see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
