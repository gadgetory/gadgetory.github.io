problem on my own here and in all of the
troubleshooting I've ever done whether
when I worked in IT or not I can't
figure out what's causing this
particular problem to happen fans of the
original half series cases from
Coolermaster can rejoice because the
half is back and better than ever
featuring 200 millimeter RGB front vans
tempered glass side panel and ample
airflow the H 500 P is a worthy
successor to the original high airflow

here's what we're experiencing right now
and you know what I'm gonna I'm just I'm
agnostic when it comes to PC tech I love
all of it and I'm gonna call out the
problems when they exist a lot of people
have looked at Rison and the whole
platform is being the holy grail to PC
gamers and PC enthusiasts because
competition and blah blah blah Intel
sucks Intel corrupt blah blah blah rides
n ain't perfect okay Rison is not like
the golden child it still has its level
of problems that i can't figure out
what's happening here so we've got two
identical Titan X peas on here and we
were doing the video about the
reshooting of the 8700 k versus the
horizon 1700 X when I was fixing those
errors and I noticed that this system
wouldn't boot in fact Nick even put up a
picture talking about you know
troubleshooting its letters that are a
few days ago so here's what we're
experiencing when we take this car this
specific Nvidia Titan X right here we
get a failed post at b2 and the VGA is
lit up now here's why this video is
important and the reason why I'm making
it here not only because I can't figure
out why and you'll see the process of
elimination here trying to figure this
out this could lead to people thinking
their graphics card is bad when in fact
it's not let me show you what I mean so
we've got this card over here that's
working just fine on the Intel system
right now and I have gpu-z up because I
want to check the BIOS oh I want to see
what the BIOS version is on these cards
because they all though I got both of
these from from Nvidia it was well after
launch and I don't know if they came out
of the same batch so I know that there
was a BIOS update or not so if we look
at our gpu-z we got a bios version 8 602
1204 so I'm curious now
this has the same BIOS and here's the
reason why I'm pointing out that it's
this this is important because somebody
who just assembled their new computer
would see a VGA code and freak out and
by the way we do have the latest bios on
this horace bard we did that when we
were doing the risin vs. 8700 k if we
take this card off of the test bench
here set it over here we take the card
that says we need to jump this make sure
it's all out okay so we take the card
that's currently on our 8700 k system I
love how the power is off and everything
get the RGB there we go so here it is
the same card you just saw working um
now I'm gonna take it over here stick it
on this system and we expect it to work
right because if it's a bad GPU that is
what we're dealing with here
I need more length on that why is more
length always seem to be my problem so
this card we know it's working because
it was working over there so I'll let
that turn on that's fine we're already
expecting that no one would be surprised
you'd be like well you switch the card
and it's working what's what's the deal
here what I'm gonna show you now there
we go
well see how it's working over there I
should expect I check this out
if I take this card which was not
working on the rise end system and we
plug it in over here you'll see that it
works fine
so what I want to check right now with
it working on the Intel system is what
the BIOS version is because we've got to
it two identical cards from the
manufacturer one works on one system but
not the other
we've already updated the BIOS over here
so we know it's not a BIOS problem I
have never experienced I don't know how
many years I've been building computers
I spent nearly 10 years in IT and I've
been doing YouTube now for five I have
never experienced a situation where a
card will work perfectly fine in one
system but not another this one's doing
it's new setup with hardware because we
just blend the hardware in cycling now
okay so if we go over here and download
GPZ I think I already did download you
can see all right maybe I did maybe I
didn't
so look at the version it's identical 8
602 1200 for its identical versioning
but I so I cannot for the life of me
figure out why one graphics card will
work in one and not the other and some
might say well J you don't have it
screwed down right it's moving is this
making people scared doesn't make you
scared Nick not really not really you've
seen enough now that you've been here to
see that it doesn't faze me not as
fragile as you see yeah that's not the
problem we'd guaranteed that so what I'm
gonna check here now is I'm just kind of
curious if other graphics cards will do
the same thing so I just grabbed a
random 1080 not a TI it's just a 1080 I
want to see if this will do the same
problem because I actually lost about an
hour of troubleshooting when I when I
did hunt and I thought it was me who
broke it well because he tried to boot
it with no memory and Rison is just like
what it's working you don't touch it
because it's super picky especially with
the memory right you need to receded all
the way there
I'm curious if - and what do you think
I'm grabbing a bit geez this guy I'm
curious to see any other graphics cards
will give us a boot issue because this
particular rig although I've had the
rise in stuff since way march/april you
know I don't need that yeah good I
haven't actually tried to plug in with
this before no you're fine but I just
noticed that once I get a tower it turn
itself on which is interesting whatever
see if that boots up it's still going
through its postcodes right there
so anyway everything worked fine on the
Intel system no problem this one just
stick on 24
we restart it only cuz like I said I
turned on the power switch on the power
supply to turned on which that board
hadn't done yet now look with this
graphics card in there now we're getting
this OC and it's going back and forth
between DRAM and CPU so let me turn this
off make sure that it's all seated
properly okay try that again okay I
think we made it through that time yeah
see that one's good now so that was a
weird but I don't think it would it's
kind of like troubleshooting 101
something doesn't work you change the
graphics card reseated so the 1080 is
working no care for it to redo all that
stuff
go ahead and try a Vega 56 but if the
Vega card didn't work in there then that
would be like the ultimate what the heck
but the whole reason why I'm making this
quick video is because I'm wondering if
any of you guys have suggestions on what
to try the the suggestion that's gonna
probably most common is will reflash the
bios on the graphics card easier said
than done on Pascal cards and
considering the bios versions already
the same I don't know if rewriting over
the BIOS is gonna help I guess it could
but whatever NIC coming in with the
assist so there's no I mean I'm not
gonna go through and test all my GPUs
it's very specifically this one this
graphics card works on the test bench it
works on this Intel system but it
refuses to work on this one so I don't
know if it's necessarily a problem with
the motherboard specifically and this
flashing that you're seeing right here
this is normal when it goes through and
reinstalls drivers especially when you
go from like an Intel to an AMD Intel or
Nvidia to AMD Nvidia AMD it'll stop
eventually but I'm not sure if this is
limited down to the motherboard itself
or if it's specifically a GPU thing I
don't see the reason why I don't think
it's the motherboard it's because why
would then one Titan work in there and
not the other all right it seems
feasible right
you would think all or none if it was a
motherboard problem two different Titans
same BIOS doesn't boot so again the
whole point of this video is I'm
reaching out to you guys what do you
think the problem is what do you think
we should do to troubleshoot this
because I think a new builder if they
experienced this because I'm fortunate
right I've I've accumulated over five
years enough hardware to be able to
troubleshoot this stuff and do all the
methods you would with just swapping out
hardware which like probably 95 percent
or more if you don't have a spare GPU
laying around or a spare C for your
motherboard to try I think a new builder
might have looked at this and thought
this their GPU is bad and freaked out
especially if they had to order it and
wait for it to be shipped and delivered
and deal with RMA and then here's what's
gonna happen right you're gonna send
this back to Nvidia they're gonna RMA it
and go works fine they're gonna send it
back to you you're gonna have the same
problem so anyway what would you guys
check maybe we'll do a follow-up on this
but that's a weird problem that I can't
explain and hoping somebody watching
this video has the knowledge to point me
in the right direction of figuring out
why it's doing that
so although rise in a great system these
are the kinds of quirks and things we've
been dealing with still even six months
later it's just part of I mean this is
tech this is what some of us enjoy this
I enjoyed some days more than others
alright guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching we'll see in the net
