watching Jays two cents and as I
mentioned in my Corsair Vengeance k70
mechanical keyboard video I picked up a
Logitech G 700 s wireless gaming mouse
so stick around cuz that's coming up on
Jays two cents ok guys so here she is
right here I'm not too interested in the
packaging I mean it's a mouse what is
there really to say about it just a
couple of key points there are 13
programmable keys it does have a data
and charge over wire it's probably going
to be a micro USB it has on-the-fly DPS
adjustments it is a full-size mouse so
if you have two small hands you're
probably not gonna like this thing I
mean you can get it get a comparison
between my hand in this mouse it has one
of those micro you know tiny little
wireless trans receivers and
transmitters I have had bad luck with
these in the past so we're gonna see how
this goes but it's got adjustable dpi
all the way up to 8200 dpi it's 200 to
8200 dpi adjustable so we're gonna see
whether or not it's Logitech G 700 s
Wireless Gaming Mouse really lives up to
the non flag gaming standards
that's interesting packaging it's like a
package within a package okay
be smarter than the box okay come on no
martyr than bucks okay so this is gonna
obviously be our charging and data cable
the thing I like about the charging
cable instead of a charging dock like
some of the Logitech mice have is that
if it goes dead on you you don't have to
you know stick it in the dock and then
just wait for it to charge before you
can use it you just have to plug in the
cable and then you're up and running and
not to mention you know if you if you
like a wired mouse or you're afraid that
there's gonna be some sort of well
that's interesting
oh okay so here's what this is right
here this is nothing more than just a
USB extension here where if you need
this to be closer to your desk if you
have the computer way far away it's just
a USB extension cable it just has a neat
little look or I guess you can like
double-sided tape it and put it down the
desk or something like that inside here
I'm assuming is gonna be your manual and
such absolutely this is your Logitech G
700 s important information probably
want you to go and register and stuff
like that setup guide hey plug it in how
hard is that there you go there's your
information that's stuff we typically
toss aside and don't really care about
and just as I suspected it is nothing
more than a micro USB connection that
just has a nifty little contoured plug
to it that way it probably fits flush
inside of the unit in case you're
charging and using it at the same time
and of course you have the mouse and
then inside of this plastic piece right
here you have your wireless transmitter
the mouse has a pretty decent weight to
it you open this up right here there is
your rechargeable double-a battery the
cool thing about this is if you're
traveling and you accidentally this goes
dead you don't have a charge cable with
you which I don't know why anyone
wouldn't have a micro USB that's really
all it it micro USB that's really all it
is helps if you keep the stuff in camera
you can take this out and put a single
double-a in there and you're up and
running now to make this thing turn on
you simply you simply pop the whole damn
thing apart there it's in put this thing
back in there somehow click it in there
there you go you're up and running it's
got an interesting feel to it it I
thought this was rubberized based on the
picture but it's not it's just kind of a
textured plastic it's I'm not sure we'll
see how that holds up under sweat I
guess the feet are very very slick
they're very slick and if you have a
gaming mouse pad like I use I use a my
onyx pro post 380 here it it's gonna
slide there that it's gonna slide we
compared to the desk it doesn't but this
light as much on the desk as it does on
this thing so it's very smooth I like
the way it feels on here so far you've
got four buttons on the thumb here one
two three four that's gonna take some
getting used to for me because I've only
ever had just the two buttons here on my
mx518 as you can see and then the DPI
adjustment on the top a scroll wheel so
now you've got four buttons there on the
top of the mouse right here you've got G
keys you can see G a G 9 g 10 right here
so it looks like the G Keys also as you
can see right here on the side might
control some of the DPI adjustment we've
got a lot of blinking lights and things
on here oh my god this is too too much
for G you can't handle all this the
pressure this is nothing more than a
standard USB that's just contoured to
plug into here and now look like it's a
wired mouse so if you ever find yourself
in the need of plugging in you still
have some style to it and there's
nothing all that crazy about it I just
went ahead and plug the wireless
receiver transmitter right into the back
right here of the keyboard because it's
gonna be near the mouse and it's so
low-profile why not just do it that way
so that way we don't run into any signal
issues right off the bat I'm watching
the cursor move right here in it
there's no lag there's absolutely no lag
it truly feels like this is a wired
mouse and one of the problems wired mice
typically had in the past is if you were
to suddenly move the mouse really
quickly after it's been resting the the
cursor would kind of take a split second
to move because the wireless had to wake
up and send the signal but that's not
the case here whatsoever so as I
suspected these buttons on the top right
here do control the DPI adjustment
they're not really G keys they are I
guess they could be G keys but they are
the DPI adjustment as well you've got
your green here this is your battery
indicator it tells you how full your
battery is that's gonna happen the first
time you push the button when you push
it again you're gonna get your different
dpi settings you've got bottom red LED
is the lowest setting second third
fourth fifth and six positions so the
top red LED is a single is the most
sensitive and then all the way down so
you got up and down that's just
on-the-fly adjustment so right now you
can have total adjustment of it and as
you push that up or down you get you
know on-the-fly gesture so anyway this G
700s Logitech Gaming Mouse definitely
lives up to the standard of being lag
free for wireless operation it's very
cool so far I'm very happy with it
I do wish that they had gone with a
rubberized feel right here this is just
feels like a textured ABS plastic that I
have a feeling skin is gonna like
eventually start to like build up on
here and it's gonna get kind of nasty
you're gonna clean it off the four
buttons are nice these I still haven't
quite figured out with this reset button
is right here it looks like a reset
button because it's got a
that right there is your scroll wheel
adjuster and what I mean by that is if
you push that down and click it these
little teeth right here get engaged and
so it stops spinning but if you unclick
that as you can see the wheel will just
go on stop that's a logitech feature
that's been around for quite a while
it's kind of neat to see them implement
that on a gaming mouse overall I really
like this mouse it is a hundred bucks
it's a little bit steep there are a lot
of other mice in that price category
time is just gonna have to tell whether
or not I think this one cuts the
standard or cuts the cheese or whatever
the saying they say these days are this
has been the G 700 s by Logitech you're
watching Jays two cents as always if
