and today I'm going to bring you a
special video of the brand new be initio
SB earphones these things were just
released at the 2013 consumer
electronics show in las vegas this is
the first official unboxing review of
the munition SVS on youtube so stick
around when it comes to the menisci o
lineup vs vs fall right in between the
billets and the nines the packaging on
this is really sleek it actually it's
thinner than the box that comes through
the billets and it more resembles the
packaging that you would find that comes
on the nine the SV is really appeal to a
more unisex and more minimalistic type
of customer they come in three different
colors they come in silver black and
bronze they are certified for ipod ipad
and iphone and what that means is that
all of the controls that are going to be
on the cord are going to work perfectly
with your iDevice that is a proprietary
apple design so only devices that
actually feature this logo right here
are designed to work with Apple products
on the side of the box here it shows you
that you've got your toggle control for
your volume as well as your paws and
skip button and we've got a gold-plated
90 degree three-and-a-half millimeter
audio adapter I'm personally not a fan
of the 90 degree adapter I find that it
kind of puts a little bit of a bend on
the cord when it's coming out of your
pocket that's just a personal preference
though it does look very sturdy it's got
a nice reinforced I'm going to assume
it's either a rubber or a hard plastic
connector over it here so we'll look at
that when we get into the box on the
back though this is really neat this is
the first for minissha where they
actually put a window into the back of
the box where you can see the product
that you're buying before you even buy
it you know you know it happens to a lot
of us r you buy something may not
exactly share what you're getting until
you open it up on this model here it has
a nine millimeter rare-earth driver and
it does have the patented hollow points
which are the inserts for your ears and
it has the mic control that is
compatible with your Apple devices
all right so enough with the package
let's go ahead and get inside I can't
wait to get in here and see what exactly
we have so this is a true official
unboxing I have not seen held or heard
this model yet what so ever came to me
in the mail and I waited specifically
for this review so that we could all
find out together exactly what you get
in the package and if you can't tell by
the cuts all over my hands here I'm
gonna go ahead and close this knife off
try not to cut off my finger in the
meantime probably would I didn't stick
that to the side okay so here's the
packaging right here as you can see they
are lined up perfectly with the window
and they are stuck in the same type of
foam material that you get with the
billets we'll go ahead and set that
aside we'll get back to this in a minute
it does come with a carrying pouch here
it's a Velcro boom no actually this is a
this is kind of like the you know those
snap bracelets that people give away
it's kind of like that so if you want to
get into the package here there's no
velcro there's no zipper you just spread
it apart and that's where we're gonna
find our hollow points right there look
at that neck still looks like a little
make a silicone package not sure so when
you're done you just you know put your
earphones in there and let go and it
snaps shut every single time so that's
really cool it also appears to have some
sort of a hook here so you could hook
these onto a backpack or maybe a purse
we wouldn't really put it on your key
ring unless you're really really into
audio also included in the box here you
have a new nishio business card with a
MLM logo on the back mobile lifestyle
movement this is a campaign that they're
on or they're really pushing the mobile
lifestyle you also get a manual and
warranty information and for the
warranty you do get a two-year limited
warranty it's got some pretty basic
information do's and don'ts when it
comes to the earphones as well as just a
little sizing chart here when it comes
to the hollow points and how to select
the right hollow-point think a lot of
people don't know how to properly select
the right size hollow point which really
affects the way that these things sound
okay so as mentioned these two come in
three colors these are the bronze they
are also available in black and silver
they do have a very flat cable here this
is a flat cable this is actually thinner
than I thought it was going to be and
the package it looked bigger right here
for the splitter you have an aluminum y
splitter here so this is very durable
this is not going to split or break on
you on accident okay off of the left ear
this is where you have your three button
volume pause skip switch so you got up
and down and then you have a button in
the middle as well for your pausing and
on the back you have two holes here
where you have your noise-cancelling
microphone but you can use with your
mobile device and use the telephone go
ahead and pull these out here Wow weight
wise these are very light I have to
admit they are a lot lighter than I
thought they'd be so the construction of
these are made of aircraft grade billet
aluminum as well as reinforced ABS
plastic so it's kind of a hybrid design
which really helps with durability as
well as being lightweight ABS plastic is
very strong and the aluminum casing on
here is going to allow for a very solid
sound especially when it comes to base
the hollow points here are really tight
which is good for a good seal these are
the exact same hollow points that come
in both the nines and the billets
they're very soft I mean you can't
really tell a camera house off there but
they're very soft if you wear these for
an extended length of time they're not
going to hurt your ears they have a good
seal and they are made of silicone so
they're very very durable so the 90
degree adapter here is a gold plated
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack so to fit in any standard
three-and-a-half millimeter device and
it's branded here with a really stylish
sv logo and as I mentioned this is made
of rubber and this is very very durable
it's very long so what that means is if
you put a lot of tension on this cord
there's not really any danger of you
ripping it out because as you can see
right here they put quite a bit of space
in there to allow a nice even bend of
this cord so if you accidentally tug on
it
yank on it you probably not going to
really tear this out of the cord unless
you get you know really crazy with it
and located right here on the cord is a
little label here and it's a label
talking about the hollow points which as
we already discussed is the insert here
for your ear and it gives you ordering
information so if you accidentally lose
a hollow point you can easily just order
replacement hollow points without having
to get a whole new unit this is really
neat they put it where you know you're
going to see it because if you like me
you take these in you pretty much just
toss them aside one thing it's very
important to point out before we get
into the audio quality is the volume
control and the pause button on this
chord is designed for I products so
that's your ipod iphone ipad it's not
designed to work with android as the
functionality suggests so we tried it on
the galaxy s3 here we didn't have volume
control we also tried this on my human
teleprompters droid x right there and it
wasn't consistent at all at when you
push the volume buttons up or down each
time you got a different function one
time it would skip one time it would
pause one time it might have gone
backwards but there was no consistent
control whatsoever of this switch so if
you don't have an iPhone or an iPod or
any sort of an Apple device keep in mind
that this may become entirely useless
for you so you're going to have to keep
that in there for thought if you use an
android device
alright so I'm honestly listening to
these right now just to prove it the the
base on these honestly don't go I don't
want to say as deep as the billets
because they do these are rated a 20k or
20 Hertz through 20k hurts so it's a
very wide range of base and 20 Hertz on
some earbuds is just phenomenal and the
billets are known for their hard hitting
bass very hard so the best way to
describe this is the base does it hit as
hard but the the range is there the
sound is there and I want to say that
this honestly feels very full range to
me the mids are clear the highs are
clear the vocals are outstanding on this
which is what the point of the SVS were
this is an elegant earphone it's
designed to be full-featured you know
you've got your controls you've got your
nice flat cable here you know everything
honestly in my opinion is here but as
I'm listening to this right now I can
clearly identify the keyboard the guitar
the bass guitar the drums I could hear
each individual hit on the high hat I've
got three sets of earphones here I've
got my skull candy 50 50 s I've got my
munition billets and of course I've got
the initial SVS and one thing that
really annoys the crap out of me when it
comes to earphones is the fact that you
keep them in your pocket or you keep
them in these little pouches are you
keep them in your glove box and you take
them out you go to use them and the damn
things are knotted and tangled to hell
and you I sometimes I've honestly been
so frustrated with the cord I've just
decided not to listen to music because I
was so fed up with trying to untangle my
cord so we're going to go ahead and
start here with these skullcandy 50 50 s
these are a rubberized cord which is
very bad when it comes to tangling I'm
going to go ahead and wrap these around
my fingers as you can see right here i
am not intentionally tangling these up
so now we're just going to go ahead and
simulate that you wrap these up and you
throw in your pocket and now we're just
going to go ahead and pretend like you
gave them to your kid and you're going
to try and untangle them and as you can
see it wasn't that bad but still it look
at this it catches on itself because
it's rubber it it's just naturally it's
got the friction there we're gonna go
ahead and do the same thing here with
the billets we're gonna straighten these
out wrap around your fingers we're just
gonna roll these up we're going to be as
rough as we can with fees and I went
ahead and I touted in my last review
that the initials were known for their
cords and their lack of tangling I don't
know about you but that wasn't not that
was gonna not in it completely unknown
at itself and that was one of the things
I love most about the bullet so how does
that flat cable compare okay so we're
gonna go ahead and roll it up now just
to be fair because the thing about it
being flat is as you roll it it's kind
of twisting so if it's gonna have a
twisting problem this would be it here
they are rolled up
oh that they're a little twisted as you
can see because they're flat but let's
leave that they did not not up and that
is a pretty long cord actually that holy
crap so there you have it the munition
SVS what do I think
alright so my final thoughts on the
initial sv earphones let's go and talk
about the style I like the way they look
I really do in fact when my wife saw
them she said ooh pretty she really
liked him she loved the sound of the
billets but as a woman she didn't want
to stick something that looked like a
bullet in her ear so something like this
is really going to appeal to somebody
who may not have liked the whole
ammunition look of the billets or the
nines the cord I'm very impressed with
this flat cable you put it on it's very
comfortable it's very light I'm really
surprised at how light this is I thought
it was going to be heavier than that the
90-degree connector here as I said
earlier I'm not a fan of 90 degrees that
this one is really not so bad it's
better than the billets because the
billets isn't a true 90 is the bills are
more like a 45-degree so this is very
low profile and very sleek and with the
gold with the gold connection on it
you're guaranteed a very solid
connection so when you want to move it
and swivel it inside the connector you
don't get some of that static that you
get with just some of the steel plated
words sound quality for the SVS I had I
have a cameraman over here and i have a
teleprompter guy over here helping me
keep on track I had all three of us
listen to them and all three of us had
smiles when we were listening to this
because we all came to the same
conclusion that yeah the base doesn't
hit as hard as the billets however the
the idea here of the SV was to get
elegant crystal clear sound but we we
all agreed on one thing this the highs
on this were super super clear anything
above the vocal range high hats high
strumming guitars piano they were very
very crystal and the only way I can
describe that is is if you've ever
listened to a low-end audio device where
the high start to sound muddy they start
to sound tinny or like you're listening
to him through a tin can that did not
exist and you had very clear separation
of vocals and highs as well as the base
it was very easy to distinguish the
different sounds that you were listening
to which made for very very dynamic
listening experience on these headphones
overall I'm very impressed I think
you're going to have a very hard time
finding any other earphone
in the same category as these beats by
dre 50 50 s I've used them all and I'm
just completely once again blown away by
me initio just throwing it out there
again I am not paid to say this guy's
this is completely my opinion that came
to me because I knew that I would be
completely unbiased but the quality of
the SVS is just completely mind-blowing
and it's gonna make my listening
experience with my music just that much
better alright guys that's been James
