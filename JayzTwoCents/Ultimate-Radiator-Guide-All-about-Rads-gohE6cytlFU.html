that I'll let you guys choose on Twitter
as I promised using straw poll so if you
want to get involved in the channel and
you want to be able to have some input
on what videos you want me to make head
on over there hit that follow button and
start watching for the straw polls even
if you do nothing but that I like to
hear from you guys on what it is you
want to see after all this is our
Channel
not necessarily my channel least that's
the way that I personally see it get 10%
off anything from coolermaster at the CM
store see the description for details
okay what we're looking at here a
radiator aka a heat exchanger all it
does is take temperature out of fluid
that's running through this interesting
thing about radiators is even if you
have no fans on here there's a ton of
passive cooling that goes on my nine
hundred D behind me if I turn all the
fans off on the radiator and put the
system under full load it only runs
about ten degrees Celsius hotter than if
I have the fans on and it's still a
shit-ton cooler than if I was doing air
cooling on it so radiators just by
nature are taking heat out of the
coolant and exhausting it to the
atmosphere because of what this core
does so we're gonna talk about four
aspects of the radiator the materials
used to build it
the core and what it does the thickness
of the radiator and why it matters and
how many fans you should use or how big
of a radiator you should use for your
system so the materials you'll see
people talk about brass copper or
aluminum or full copper full copper is
more expensive because copper is kind of
a semi precious metal however it has the
best corrosive properties of radiators
so it means you don't really have to
worry about there being a lot of
corrosion in your system because copper
is very corrosion resistant in fact the
only way you're going to get copper in
your loop is if you introduce aluminum
pretty much so full copper radiators
best because it has best corrosive
properties but does it mean it cools
better than a brass copper absolutely
not
typically brass copper means you have
brass end tanks which are these pieces
on the end of the
where and you have an aluminum fins and
a copper core or something like that but
fit radiators like this one here from
alpha cool have all copper construction
copper rose copper fins which make up
the core and this is what's doing all
the cooling right here in fact you can
even see in the video right there it's
kind of black when I go that way and
copper when I go that way alpha cools
concept here is that any paint applied
to the fin is only decreasing its
efficiency when it comes to cooling so
they just do a quick dusting on the core
but they do a full paint job obviously
on the other parts of it so that's why
as I turn it you guys may see it's like
more of a bare copper you could paint
this if you wanted but for the cooling
capacity and set your fans typically
cover it up it's not a big deal
so full copper radiator if you can
afford it brass coppers just fine too
now let's go ahead and talk about the
fpi of the core these little zigzags
zigzag piece of metals here the zigzag
is a weird word zigzag piece of metal
really what it does is it's increasing
the amount of metal that's absorbing the
temperature so you have a lot of
different FP is fins per inch you know 7
10 16 20 30 so what does it mean and why
should you choose it rule of thumb if
you can't fit a lot of radiator space in
your computer let's say you can only fit
a triple just this triple and you want
to cool a graphics card and a CPU you're
going to want a higher fpi than
something like this because you can
increase the surface area or the overall
cooling capacity of the radiator by
manipulating the core it's not just
about the amount of fans that are on it
this part right here matters the most so
higher fpi if you have to go with a
smaller radiator or you can't fit more
radiator space in there or if you can
fit like this monstrosity behind me here
you could put three of these triples or
soomi four of these triples in there if
you wanted you could get away with low
fpi like this alpha cool which is 10
fins per inch and run slower speed fans
on them
the downside of high fpi fans or
radiators is that they are more noisy
because there's more restriction for the
air to get through it creates turbulence
because the air naturally won't off a
fan let's come
sideways kind of at a 45-degree angle
but the fins force that air back to
straight and it gets very turbulent the
air is bouncing around in there and it
just gets noisy that's why if you take a
fan and hold it in the open atmosphere
it's quiet the moment you put it up to a
fan grill it kind of goes you know does
that's a good fan of pressure not so
high fpi if you have to go with a
smaller radiator low f-b-i if you can
put multiple radiators in now let's go
and talk about the thickness of the
radiator you'll see something like this
here which is a 30 mil rad thickness
which is very common
my radiators are 45 millimeters thick
and alpha cool offers them all the way
up to 80 millimeters thick that's like
this that's like that big compared to
this it's ridiculous I don't like it it
just looks bad and it doesn't fit in
that many cases and you don't gain that
much cooling capacity quite honestly
because there becomes a point when you
are past the point of demission
demission demission diminishing returns
when it comes to the surface area
because the rule of thumb is you really
only need about one 120 millimeter space
of radiator per component that you're
cooling so theoretically a triple is
more than enough to cool a graphics card
and a CPU at stock clocks because it's
all about wattage displacement and how
much wattage and TDP that your cooling
system can dissipate last thing we're
going to talk about as I kind of already
mentioned how many 120 millimeter or 140
s or 200 s that you really need well my
rule of thumb is if I can fit a triple
red and I can fit a 240 millimeter rad
say in the front of the case and one of
these in the top of the case this is a
better option than just this because it
allows me to run more fans more surface
area at slow speeds giving you what
really water cooling is really known as
being beneficial for other than just
amazing water to our coolant temps for
your components it's also the fact that
you can run slower speed fans so that's
why I run in my system 45 mil thick quad
radiator
as well as a triple now I mean I've got
some obviously I've got a lot of
radiators here and you can see when it
comes to the size of these radiators
wrecking this about damaging anything
there is quite the difference here when
it comes to saw his sizes of these
radiators as you can see I mean there's
the bottom they're all lined up there's
a lot of difference there and the amount
of cooling capacity between all of these
is quite massive so why do I have the
stacker sitting behind me guys I'm torn
and I'm kind of turning to you here on
the low on some advice I love the
concept of the stacker not the 945 they
call it worth all of them on there just
the nine three five and the nine fifteen
on the bottom because I want to do I
want to mod it to fit two of the four
hundred and eighty millimeter rads in
the bottom and then do like acrylic
tubing through there it just would look
really nice wouldn't offer me any
benefit over the 900 II whatsoever it
would just be a modding project you guys
keep asking me how I feel about the
stacker and what I could do with it so
I'm kind of turning to you guys to tell
me what do you think should I mod the
stacker to fit what I feel would be the
perfect cooling case so I'm just curious
what you guys think put it down in the
comments so what size radiators are you
using are you water cooling and why what
radiators are you using tell me what's
your setup let everyone else see down in
the comments there because you guys have
been a pretty awesome community here so
far on YouTube helping each other out
and I'd like to continue that trend so
if you've enjoyed this video you know
what to do with it if you hated it you
also know where you can stick it and if
you're new here I sure hope you check
out some of my other videos if you like
what you see stick around
I'd love to have you I'm gonna get out
of here follow me on Twitter look for
the straw polls I want to hear from you
guys what videos you want me to make and
as always guys see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
