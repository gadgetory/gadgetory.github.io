this couple times already we talked
about CES even I'm sure you guys are
getting kind of sick of it but I've
decided I'm going to be using this PC
full-time I love its form factor I'm
kind of redoing my whole home office and
there's gonna be place for this PC
somewhere and I'm thinking this would
make a great guest PC as well friends
come over when I play computer games
with me and I used to have two computers
you remember that never the old office
and I had two computers in there well
since then it turned into a slash guest
room and I had to give up that space but
now that we're moving into a new home
and it's got a dedicated much larger
room to work as my game room I think
it's time that we we do a little extra
work to this guy today's video sponsored
by master up in the Sennheiser HD 6xx
professional-grade reference headphones
but more than 50,000 units sold the HD 6
xx is by far the most popular headphones
ever sold through mass drop the superior
build quality comfort and lightweight
features make the HD 6 xx's among the
best headphones available for only $200
be curious to see how high audio sounds
for only 200 bucks click the link in the
description below so one of the things
we talked about in our overclocking
video was the fact that we couldn't get
the CPU to really sustain a 5 gigahertz
overclock even though we've seen the
9900 K do a ton of overclocking with no
problem we've we've we've been able to
push all of the 8 cores to you know 5
gigs plus a 5.2 even on a iOS and this
one for some reason you saw with OC CT
it kept dropping down to like four five
four four four three
but Cinebench was fine and games for
fines we were like something is holding
this back well a lot of you guys in the
comments were like it's your motherboard
that MSI motherboard is vrm throttling
at least that's what a lot of people
were saying that not just like one guy
and got a bunch of likes so I said that
one of my issues with this was it felt
like they sorted cheaped out on the
motherboard so I'm gonna be putting in a
new motherboard today and I'm still plan
on doing some mods this like possibly
takin the skins off and get him stripped
and polish so it's like a super shiny
think of like The Phantom Menace yes I
know nobody like the Phantom Menace but
a big shiny spaceship that belonged to
Queen Amidala so that one would kind of
look
I'm gonna what wasn't me I'm a dollar
I'm a dollar so I'll probably still do
all that but that's stuff that we can do
after the fact so I've got right here my
ROG Strix Z 370 no it's still not a z3
90 because the 1z 390 mitx board that we
have is still being used in the small
build we did for the CES and with all
the work I went through and all the
headaches I went through on that I
haven't had it hard to tear it down yet
it'll probably get torn down at some
point because it's kind of a loud mess
although film will use it was it loud
when you were editing stuff but whatever
this still has a better overclocking
features than we think this motherboard
does one drawback to this board though
that this board has which is kind of
funny as this has an external mounted
clear CMOS button where this one still
uses an old-style jumper on the surface
of the motherboard itself so if I really
broke the overclocking the net that's
open it up and I have to jump for that
which means I find abuse in this board
full-time and I don't upgrade again
later I'll probably end up wiring like a
button to the top or something EB is
just a standard regular button so what
we're gonna do it now is we're gonna go
and open it up and let's see how hard
this is gonna be I don't league's gonna
be that hard but famous last words
now I've already verified that all the
sides and the plugs line up because I
talked about that in our last video and
I highly recommend you watch our
teardown video if you haven't already
because we kind of talked about where
things are located on this and no
scratches please also - one of my
friends told me that this graphics card
which I said look like a reference
design but it doesn't look like a
reference card they also said that this
is an MSI motherboard so clearly Corsair
has worked out a deal with MSI on this
which is probably why they obviously are
using that particular motherboard so if
we look at this everything's in the same
spot USB 3.0 is on the bottom right we
got SATA right above it and SATA on the
inside which they have some SATA running
right there we've got our 24 pin on the
top right right yes we got our eight pin
on the top left top left and then the
USB same exact spot here and here so
we're really hoping at this point that
we're gonna get better overclocks with
this board
looking at the vrm also oh yeah there's
definitely more phases to this VRM for
some reason MSI keeps leaving off
onboard graphics they're not really
supporting it most of the motherboards
we have around here from inside don't
have any sort of video port on them now
the 1990 900k does have an eye GPU
that's very useful for things like
troubleshooting or even fasting fasting
because of video because of quick sync
if we do any sort of video rendering on
this machine we can utilize the eye GPU
to be a dedicated a choose h.264 encoder
so for whatever reason msi removes that
entirely I think they just assume if
you're running this CPU you're gonna
have a graphics card and we do but we
can leverage the I GPU rather than it
just being something sitting there not
being used at all so there is another
benefit to updating this motherboard
even if performance wise on the
overclocks we don't gain anything if I
remove the cooler then I can remove this
whole piece and I don't want this thing
flopping around so it gets damaged Haley
that's almost like perfect another thing
we're gonna also benefit from there's an
m2 on here and you see how this one has
it mounted on the back so does this
motherboard problem as this motherboard
doesn't have one mounted on the front
and my concern is since there's a solid
wall there and a GPU on the other side
the drive is gonna heat soak and as m2
gets hotter as with any storage it slows
down so we're gonna move it to here
which is going to be underneath this
heatsink which makes contact with it
which means that it's going to be now in
the direct airflow from that convection
assisted cooling which means we should
get some better sustained drive speeds I
don't think it's gonna really make any
sort of a difference but my use case on
this but it helps me sleep at night
yes I'm pretty good thermal priced
applications right there it's just the
physical aspects of the space I have to
work in fail so you undo these little
tabs there's a little snap tabs if you
are not poking see that but these little
guys are here so these are snapped in
like that and it wouldn't clear these so
you could just you know push these up
and out of the way and then so like I
was saying we have all these skins and
stuff right that we can take off we're
showing you why motherboard
manufacturers insist on not having to
stand off of the m-dot to pre-installed
I mean I think the biggest piece of
advice I would have for anyone
attempting like small builds like this
is just take your time and if it doesn't
fit just push a little harder
there's glowing RGB in there like way up
in there you can't really see them but
they're really okay that's good time
people ask me all the time Jay can you
switch a motherboard and have your
everything work well usually since the
introduction of UEFI BIOS you could but
we've recently had some instances where
we get some conflicts and stuff but ever
since like Windows 7 it's kind of not
really been an issue but so far we're
not getting an image all right so we
think we know what's happening here so
we went back and looked at the bios
available for this motherboard on Asus
website and I like to fill and I was
like I bet you this BIOS needs to be
updated because it's not ready for ninth
gin this has launched BIOS on here this
is the one that was shipped with when
the board was new then 99 hundred K
didn't exist yet and sure enough we see
on the website that there is indeed a
BIOS for supporting 9th Gen Intel so
what we are gonna do is I've got my 8700
K right here we're gonna drop this in
see if the boots if it doesn't update
the BIOS at which we should then have a
working computer I'm sure someone in the
comments has already while you were
watching us get to this point we're like
you didn't update your boss you stupid
you didn't update your patents what we
did well we're working on it anyway yeah
clearing CMOS is always the best thing
to do
alright now we know fan hooked up to
this so so through the process of
clearing CMOS and taking out RAM and
then booting it in single channel and
then going back into dual channel we
were able to get it to boot so now I've
got my external or my USB Drive in there
and we can now go into our set up load
our ninth gen BIOS and then do
everything we just did again look at
with no fan going the CPUs at 23 see now
that passive cooling is Walla probably
convection assisted so the start of this
video I talked about the fact that
usually with UEFI BIOS and Windows 7 and
newer you could usually just switch out
your hardware
and windows would automatically detect
it and get devices ready as you can see
right here on this screen the only thing
you might encounter every now and then
assume I have a conflicting driver on
various chipsets like when we did this
with OS right was the on Lord wireless
for one of the other builds that we did
and that was causing an issue so all you
do is go in there disable whatever or
uninstall whatever driver it is install
a fresh one as long as you can get in a
safe mode fun fact if you can't get in
the safe mode you keep getting a blue
screen every time you see the windows
logo just power cycle the computer off
do it twice and on the third attempt it
will automatically go into boot recovery
which you could then go into safe mode
because Windows was stupid or Microsoft
is stupid and decided to take away the
f54 boot options ok new CPU is in
rebooted now we can get the whole point
of this video which was not supposed to
be how to fix this
it's bullet overclocked any better now
I'm a lot more comfortable with the Asus
BIOS I am with the MSI one so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna turn on a couple
of things here we're gonna go to manual
actually it's got XMP so we'll get the
memory to speed up as well we are going
to and you can see the timings tighten
up slightly
we're gonna go to multi core enhancement
and leave that at Auto AVX inspection
whoops
and a DX instruction a negative offset
we're going to leave that at where you
go to zero on that one we don't want to
offset CPU power enhancement leave that
Auto so beautiful ratio sync all cores
and I want to see what just those two
settings do I'm not touching the DRAM
frequency or the ratio I'm not touching
any of that so it's a 20 666 which is
the XMP profile for this memory not the
fastest Ram I'm surprised I mean I feel
like they could have at squeeze some
3,000 dims in here and I probably will
do that myself later voltage control and
all that stuff is set to auto so I'm not
touching any of that stuff I want to see
what it goes up to so by just syncing
all the cores you should potentially see
a four seven I believe you should see a
4.7 across the board I'm curious with
the voltage Dez though sometimes auto
can just freak out and goes give it all
the voltage it's got temperature 65 75
80 to 84 mid 80s I can still handle it
hottest core is sitting at 86 no no it
state of five kicks Oh nope drop two for
one
so it dropped overtime but not due to
thermals once again probably due to
power limit or power draw so we changed
a few things in the BIOS I reduced the
voltage down to 1/3 because I know 1/3
should give us a solid 5 we've already
dealt with that I increase the V group a
little bit increase the power draw or
power limit of the CPU to 140 percent
set some of the vrm settings to extreme
we have a lot of cooling directly on the
vrm this fan so the V RMS are like right
here and the fans right on top of it so
any air being exhausted is going right
across the V R M so it does have active
air flow on it so I'm feeling kind of
confident about that but we just need to
find what is actually causing it to
throttle down and whether or not we can
even overcome it temps are in the 60s
and 70s and we stayed at 5 so far the
whole time yeah oh you mother see what
happens this time same frequency a
little bit of justed voltage a little
bit adjusted B droop but look at that we
almost matched our other score which I
think this was a 5:1 I'm not mistaken no
maybe it was a 5 it was a 5 so this is
sitting in the mid-60s at 5 gigs and it
has not throttled down all right so I'm
gonna stop that let's see now if we can
get 5.1 alright so as long as we don't
get any crashes here is your
verification run of 5.10 when the event
that Phil didn't catch it on camera we
did get a 5.1 run to work just fine so
I'm gonna go ahead and set this thing
back believe it or not from for all of
this work I'm gonna set it to like for 8
for the daily which is still an
improvement over we got with the EMA
side board because no matter what
settings we adjusted there we still
couldn't get it to stay at 4 7 or 4 8 it
always dropped down to like 4 3 4 5 so
we still have an improvement here and I
was pushing the voltage pretty far here
and I don't think any of that's
necessary so I'm gonna go maybe 4 9 will
do 4 9 how's that alright so go back to
1 point 3 5 and then it's kind of
pulling back a lot of these voltages
here and
yeah that should be good yeah this was a
bit of a rollercoaster of a video it was
like yeah just swap the by the board
it'll work fine oh no way to swap the
CPU and then swap the CPU back oh then
the RAM didn't want to work oh now the
RAM works
oh hey five point one now five point
doesn't work so I promise that's the
last course are one video you're gonna
see of an actual video of that can't say
you won't see any ads though I'm gonna
go guys thanks for watching I said on
Twitter and tell you guys to I am in the
process of moving homes so videos are
gonna be kind of like just like wherever
they end up we're doing the best we can
does me shooting Phil that's what that
was you guys couldn't see it feels like
yeah I'm doing the best I can so yeah I
appreciate your guys's patience and all
that we got some giveaways coming up got
some fun content planned oh no actually
I lied you're gonna see one more course
there one video but we're gonna be hook
in the air conditioner up to it like I
promised so there is that alright guys
thanks for watching and as always we'll
see you in the next one but I digress
[Laughter]
the internet is not ready for my vocal
range okay so through so a radio
operator in the Navy had a child and the
child learned Morse code child's first
Morse code words were Dada did it
alright so as long as we don't get any
crashes here is you not you me Oh
[Laughter]
- you can do that on command what the
Kyle what's wrong with you
