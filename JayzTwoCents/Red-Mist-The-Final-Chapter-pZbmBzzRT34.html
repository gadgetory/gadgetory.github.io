that has a beginning must have an end
and this is the conclusion a project red
mist yeah I know guys project red mist
has been around the channel for about
two months now and it starts to feel
like a permanent fixture here in my home
but you know what sing has an owner and
it's time for it to go home to its owner
yeah this has been my very first build
blog here on YouTube and to be honest I
have absolutely no idea how to end it I
mean it's clean it's really awesome
looking it's fairly quiet the water
cooling and it's pretty freaking awesome
PC Magazine has requested photos of this
build and it performs really really well
I mean what else is there to say so with
that said guys I hope to see you in my
next no I'm just kidding I'm just
kidding
of course now project red missed the
goal of this now I want to just start by
saying project red mist has absolutely
nothing practical in it there is
absolutely positively nothing practical
about this build now before you guys
start yelling at your monitors and
typing in the comments-section glycol
eagle that probably spent about three
thousand dollars less according to my
calculations and gotten very comparable
performance if you had gone with it a
little bit I don't really care because
the point of this build was nothing
practical
there's nothing practical about this
build that was never the goal with this
bill this bill could have been called
project in practicality and it would've
been perfectly appropriate the customer
wanted something awesome he's never
owned a computer like this it's rare
that he was able to afford something
like this so he went ahead and did it
now some of the comments I saw in the
past was wow this guy must just have
money to throw away well this guy's got
so much money what does he do does he
sell drugs
he must be selling drugs guys he works a
regular nine-to-five and he picked up a
lot of overtime shifts to pay for this
thing he's a working class man like you
and me so go ahead and throw those
comments out the window if you're just
picking up the
old blog at this point I suggest you go
back to part one and start from there
I'm not going to list out all the parts
again I've already done all that in the
previous parts now the performance of
project red mist was not surprising I
mean it's to 780ti s they do have a
hundred and seventy one hundred and
sixty five megahertz overclock on both
of these so it's pushing up to about
twelve hundred and fifty megahertz on
the actual cores for the GPU it's giving
me two hundred frames per second petal
filled four on a single 1080p monitor
but before you guys start screaming yes
he is doing three monitors and I believe
he was even considering doing three one
hundred and twenty hurt monitors so
there you go the cpu performance of
4770k is well 4770k couldn't get it
really stable at four point five as much
as I wanted so it's at four point four
but because we do have that massive 480
rad cooling just the motherboard in the
CPU we are getting about low-60s on a
hundred percent load in prime95 so when
you're gaming and stuff it's sitting in
the forty degrees Celsius range yeah
pretty freakin awesome now the seven
eighties are no exception with that
massive five hundred and sixty
millimeter rad it is getting both of
them are getting right around 38 to 40
degrees Celsius full load with the 72
millivolt overclock on there or over
voltage for overclock and is performing
really really well I mean battlefield 4
like I said two hundred frames per
second dipping down to about 170 ish
it's pretty freakin overkill for a
single panel hopefully he goes with
triple panels he was talking to me about
panels would I recommend so maybe he'll
go that route now the case obviously in
this build was very expensive the case
labs cases are not cheap and as
configured this case is about $700 yeah
like I said project impractical could
have been a very practical name one of
the things I think was most fun about
this build log was the fact that you
guys got to see that things were not
perfect in this I mean we had some snags
along the way remember we had a bad pump
we had to put the project on hold for
the pump to get that are made and
replaced and that's finally up and in
there and running we did decide to go
with different to being halfway through
the build so that delayed things a
little bit and we also got loot row
customs on board to supply the cables
for this towards the end of the build so
we waited for that which put us back a
couple of weeks which is why it took me
about two months to do this build now
fortunately the guy is really patient
and he wasn't chomping at the bit to get
the computer at least he wasn't bugging
me for it he knew I was working on it
obviously you got to see the videos so
he is beyond excited right now to be
able to pick this up isn't me coming and
picking it up tomorrow
and I can't wait to just see his
in-person reaction to this build it is
pretty freaking awesome I didn't do a
whole lot of game benchmarks on there
because it's his computer so I didn't
load up a bunch of games on this using
my accounts I only did battlefield 4 and
then I pretty much wiped it after that
now it comes to benchmark scores on this
3dmark 11 we did get a 20 1837 score on
3d mark the graphics score on that was a
34,500 97 pretty freakin strong when it
comes to valley benchmark we did get a
5628
what's interesting about that is that is
only 28 points faster or 28 points
higher than my dual 780 s that are not T
is with a 3770k but remember guys my 780
s our voltage hacked BIOS hacked and
they are way over volted this thing is
running at stock bolts my 780 s are way
over volted in a massive 1400 mega her
overclock to get those these achieved
the same score actually a little better
score at twelve hundred and fifty
megahertz on the GPU and no hacking or
BIOS hacking or over over bolting so the
780 s are pretty strong now go ahead and
enjoy some glamour shots here guys as we
bring project red mist to an end I'm
gonna miss it but I'm going to be
excited to start my build too but I
promised I wasn't gonna cry please don't
judge me for that
you know this ice I've got a hundred
hours into this build a hundred hours I
mean the custom acrylic panel all of the
acrylic bending and tubing in there the
sleeping I didn't do the sleeves of the
loot row stuff but I sleeved some of the
other cables like the pumps and some of
the fans and things and I'm gonna miss
it
but project skunk works is right around
the corner the 4790k with the z97 board
is going to be going in my build so go
ahead and look forward to that in the
future but I'm not going to do as
in-depth of a build log with that
don't think I think I'm just gonna give
you guys some highlights of that I'm not
going to document every single process
along the way it really adds a lot of
time to do that and I can't be down
without my main rig that long because
obviously that's oh you guys eat these
videos I don't shoot them on my iPhone
or anything like that so so guys I'm
going to go ahead and just end this
video now with some glamor shots here of
project red mist and as always follow on
Twitter and Instagram if you want to see
some of the behind the scenes photos of
this project in action or in progress
and as always guys I will see you in my
next video
and my next project
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
