$0.02 founder and CEO Jays to sack
g-force gamers welcome welcome
are you ready are you ready it is time
today we are gonna overclock the world's
best graphics card under $300 under $300
ladies and gentlemen before today this
was only a dream a dream of g-force
gamers getting unsurpassed 1080p
performance for under $300 Nvidia set
out on this dream a long time ago
with the development of the touring
architecture and I'm proud to present to
you today the 1660 TI overclocking guide
I like boats that's why I let will the
warship sponsor today's video well the
warships is a free-to-play game that
they call the thinking man's action game
because has the perfect balance of
action and strategy one of my favorite
aspects of world of warships and I've
been playing this game for more hours
and I'd like to admit is the extremely
high detailed weather effects and ship
details with more than 200 ships across
11 nations there are a lot of different
play styles to choose from in fact I've
been using world of warships as my
detail reference from a model
shipbuilding if you followed my
Instagram you know I've got a thing for
model building and I've just recently
built a 350 scale Bismarck and I'm
currently working on a 200 scale USS
Missouri and I've been using world of
warships as my detail reference because
rather than scour the internet for old
black and white photos I can use their
3d scans to recreate the details on my
ships from any angle I want to see it
but the constantly changing the game to
make things more exciting and bringing
new game modes and challenges keeping
things kind of new and exciting in fact
they just revamped the way aircraft
carriers work where instead of sending
out squadrons of planes to perform auto
attacks you now pilot the planes and
control every aspect of that attack
bringing aircraft carriers a whole new
dynamic in fact if you use my exclusive
code down below you get a free premium
aircraft carrier the USS Langley sign up
using play Langley 2019 you received 300
doubloons
1 million credits the USS langley
premium aircraft carrier 3 days of
premium time and more so what you guys
waiting for join me and 30 million other
players out there in the high seas no
know which one's me because I'm the one
putting holes in you alright so
obviously we're just having a little bit
of fun at the start of this intro you
know I got two emails from Nvidia saying
how they weren't too happy with me this
week I figured why not just start at the
top way down the list whatever it's hot
I don't know where this leather jacket
right now how's he doing
alright so I mentioned in our review of
the 1660 Ti that we're going to be doing
overclocking separately because yeah I
mean it's not really that different but
I wanted to wait for the official
drivers to come out because I had some
funkiness happening the other day when
we were doing our testing so we're also
using a retail slash MSRP
so this is the EVGA gtx 1660 TI SC or XC
black edition so it's the single fan
with triple slot but I wanted to see
what the best performance you could get
out of the cheapest price point
available to a sixteen sixty Ti they
also decide to email me and correct me
on like why it's called sixteen sixty TI
and it's I guess it's quite simple the
performance is closer to a twenty sixty
but they don't want to call it a twenty
fifty because they didn't want to
confuse people thinking that I had r-tx
because the twenty series has r-tx but
it's far enough ahead of the ten sixty
they didn't want to call it a ten Series
card although fun facts if you want to
download this driver it's under ten
series but it's slightly better than
halfway so it's closer to a twenty sixty
then a ten series so sixteen is just
over halfway between ten and twenty it's
just that simple that's the official
reason but the reason why I use the EVGA
card at the 279 price point versus the
Phoenix card from Asus is because of
superior build quality now Asus the
Strix card probably overclocks very very
well but I stand by my opinion that it
doesn't make sense to buy three hundred
and $29 sixteen sixty TI when you can
save an extra what fifty bucks 40 bucks
and get yourself a twenty sixty which is
30% faster than this one for not 30%
more money if that makes sense
so it's like fifteen percent more money
for thirty percent more performance
that's a price ratio I can get behind so
there's two pieces of software that you
could use to overclock this card
obviously MSI Afterburner yeah I mean
that's kind of been like these staple
overclocking utility for the longest
time it's free as you can see we are
running the four 19.170 burner for our
overclocking here you can also use EVGA
precision x1 if you have more than one
piece of overclocking software installed
though make sure they're not running
together at the same time especially if
they have two different profiles they're
gonna be struggling for control of the
graphics card now the voltage slider
there's still debate on if this actually
does anything and this is a percentage
we talked about this a million times in
every video we do about overclocking
where all this does is move the
percentage of where the max voltage will
apply in terms of the frequency curve
not actually apply more voltage so we
always recommend starting with this at
zero and then playing with this a little
bit to see if it fixes stability once
you find your max score clock so right
here you got your power limit it's set
to a hundred you've got your temperature
limit set to 83 core clock and then
memory clock so the first things we're
gonna do max out the power limit in this
card it's at a hundred and I reached out
to EVGA to ask them why that is EVGA
explained that the reference max power
draw on this chip is 120 watts and what
they've done is they've gone ahead and
just made 100 130 watts so you're
technically getting 10 extra Watts at
the hundred and then just not letting
the slider go any farther custom models
like the Strix and then other like the
duel and the duel fan stuff from EVGA
those will have additional Headroom went
the power slider but on this card they
just maxed 100 and made that the max TDP
rather than giving you a slider it just
lets it go to it automatically so you
don't hit that as soon don't necessarily
think that you're not actually getting a
benefit here you your cards total TDP
could have increased at that 100 number
temperature limit we're gonna max this
thing to looks like Max is 89 we're
gonna hit apply on that and so what this
is telling us now is don't start
throttling this card unless either we go
over a hundred percent power draw or we
reach eighty nine degrees Celsius which
I don't think this card will ever hit
now I'm gonna use heaven for this a lot
of people is that why do you use heaven
why do you use heaven yes it's a dx11
test yes it's really old but it's DX at
11 nonetheless which most games are
still running and it's still a good loop
to run to test temperatures and at least
one level of stability you're never
gonna find your max stable unless you
run it in all your games or your
favorite game or whatever and can get
through a whole playing session without
any sort of crashes you could find your
stable in nine out of ten games but it's
that one game and that one engine that's
stupid picky when it comes to core clock
that could suddenly start crashing on
you so anyway what I tend to do here
with heaven is I will set it to windowed
mode we're running 1080p because they
talked about this being the ultimate
1080p card anti-aliasing I'm gonna put
that up to 8x because I want to stress
the card as much as possible and to
aliasing to is also gonna stress our
frame buffer so we wanted to make sure
that we r memory stable tessellation is
on normal that's fine and then
everything else we just have it altered
DirectX 11 obviously and then preset
custom because we change these settings
and I guess
at 1080 we're gonna go ahead and start
up the benchmark we're gonna bring our
overclocking window back to the
foreground and we are going to just kind
of see where our temperatures maximized
with the stock fan curve and no sliders
changed with the exception of our power
limit and temperature target but these
two things really aren't going to have
any effect on our Max Weber clocks and
stuff because you know obviously the
temperature curve was what matters most
now what you're gonna find here as
you're doing this test is you're gonna
find that these core clocks where's my
cursor you can go back to it I'm not
this face isn't yeah what you're gonna
find right here is your frequency is
going to slowly drop over time as this
increases don't confuse that with
thermal throttling thermal throttling is
when the core starts to go below its
rated speed whether it be the base clock
or turbo clock to save itself from
overheating that is different from a
dynamically controlled frequency based
on a temperature curve anything over one
thousand seven hundred and seventy
megahertz on a sixteen sixty Ti is
considered a GPU boost 3.0 overclock so
if you are running seventeen hundred and
seventy one megahertz you're technically
overclocking past the reference turbo
clock scale on this card so now that
we've found that we are maxed out at 59
60 C with the fan at 100 I always
recommend maxing out the fan for air
overclocking because obvious reasons if
you care about volume then you shouldn't
care about overclocking because you need
the Headroom so we're gonna go ahead and
now and just start with our core clock
you can do memory and core clock
together the problem is if you do you
don't know exactly what caused your
crash so if you're adjusting both of
those at the same time and you crash
well was it a memory or was it core so
do one or the other very similar to CPU
so we're gonna go ahead just do a plus
50 on that I've never found a card that
couldn't do a plus 50 on an nvidia side
so as you can see by doing plus 50 we
went right to 1965 1950 you're gonna
find two on NVIDIA cards especially the
Turing cards and I think Pascal 2 this
is gonna always change by 15 megahertz
that's the stepping the stepping is
always in 15 megahertz because anyone
watching goes well my AMD yada-yada I
can do it well because it's different
core logic altogether so let's go ahead
and try 65 now put us to 1980 as you can
see because
increase it 15 and what you can find is
sometimes you'll be right on the edge
where +70 would bring you up 15 so even
though we only went +5 you can find that
sometimes that will go up higher than 5
so let's try 75 right I just updated
another 5 it still didn't change that
means we're still within that 15 so
let's go ahead and go 80 no change 90
there it is so that brought us up they
see you went higher than 15 at that
point because we increased it 15 from
our original 75 right there but we got
30 the reason for that is because GP
boost 3.0 there's various factors the
temperature curve the actual voltage
curve the actual power target the power
limit and because that scene may not
have been requiring as much power is
able to go 2 steps rather than 1 so
that's why the number you enter in on
the core is not going to directly relate
to the actual frequency change so that's
why you have to play with it in
increments because if you try and go
plus 50 on everything you'll crash
extremely early and you may not find
where your stock or your stable clock is
so let's just go ahead now and find
where we sort of crash on our course
shall we so let's go and try 120 so that
put us up to 20 25 20 40
I suspect probably gonna start crashing
here pretty soon yeah see I can't get 20
40 to go up from this point so afraid if
I do 150 right now to probably spiked up
and crash on us 20:55 so what worries me
here is I've added 30 to this I've added
30 to this but and we're still sitting
here so what that tells it is I want to
put this back down to 120 if I turned on
the system cold and fired up a game with
the card sitting in the 30s it would go
much higher than what you're actually
seeing right now and then we'd probably
end up eating a crash so what I'm gonna
do now is I'm gonna start playing with
the memory and I bet you we can get a
thousand out of this no problem
whatsoever yep
but look at our course be that dropped
down slightly so right 7,000 plus 2010
we're kind of sitting our temperatures
haven't changed so yeah what I want to
do now because I know this graphics card
was bouncing in the low $18 $18 Hertz
makes it the world's best GPU
your dollars so what I want to do right
now is go ahead and run through all the
benchmarks we did in our review with
this overclock applied to see how much
we gained I want to see how far close it
gets to like the 20 60 and then
obviously compared to the 10 70 again
because I'm sure you guys saw in some of
the tests this lost to or beat a 1070
and if you compare the launch pricing of
a 1070 being 500 bucks and this card
being 279 yeah we've come a long way in
the last couple years in terms of
graphics technology and although the
pricing scale seems to be obviously
sliding up at least you're getting
something for your money so let's see
how it compares
so there's anything you've learned from
today's video it's the fact that this
video contains the most amount of
wardrobe changes in any js2 sense video
ever but more importantly when you
overclock graphics cards they get faster
thanks for watching today's video guys
no seriously when you overclock the card
if you have enough cooling Headroom like
we've shown right here you can
significantly improve improve the
performance for free that's why we
always recommend getting lower model
cards that have decent coolers on them
and overclocking them yourself I mean
with the ACS Q's charging $5 per
increment and having three different
strict SKUs within $15 of each other
just kind of makes no sense when you can
move those sliders on your own but I
digress as long as you have good enough
coolers you can do it so I always
recommend overclocking your graphics
cards if you are comfortable doing it
you can't really hurt it with msi
afterburner you'll software crash long
before you'll ever come anywhere near
the limits of your hardware plus there
are safeguards in place with the power
limits and all that stuff so you're not
gonna hurt anything worst case scenario
if it crashes you just clear the profile
and start over once again if the crash
is bad enough but as you can see though
I looking at the charts we push up
against to like the gtx 1070 which was a
significantly more expensive card at
launch well over 5 or about 500 bucks
and pushes up pretty close to the 20 60
at stock speeds yes you can oh look like
a 20 60 I know but if you can get near
20 60 performance without the stuff you
don't necessarily want to pay for like
the RT cores in the 10th ER course then
the 16 60 TI and overclocked is
definitely a compelling choice so I just
have to wait and see now what happens
with the rumored 16 16 on Ti and the
1650 which would make this an even more
cluttered product stack than it already
is
but hey options are good right all right
guys I'm gonna go thanks for watching
and as always we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
