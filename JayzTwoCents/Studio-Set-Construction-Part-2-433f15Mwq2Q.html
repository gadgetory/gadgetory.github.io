and we are coming and at you now with
part two of our set build series where I
basically decided to undertake this
entire build myself and as you can see
it's a big mess but you know what else
you can build your fleet the today's

more so if you think you have what it
takes to take me on out there and the
high seas we'll just click that link
down below and put your money where your
mouth is I'll be waiting
this is why nothing gets done alright so
obviously this said it's not gonna be
staying brown we're gonna be painting it
in fact we're gonna be moving this wall
too entirely it's over there because I'm
going to be putting a window in it but
this was just we needed a way to hold it
up so thank ER it against this one plus
the ballast in the back let's talk about
the framing of this put a picture of
this up on Twitter one of the most
common things I got was like yeah yeah
optic code you know what it's a
free-standing wall it doesn't have to
meet code
there's nothing attached to it funny how
that works so I guess those contractors
that understand code well they didn't
say anything because they know that
there is no point in saying anything I
digress anyway this walls staying where
it's at
I need to redesign the way I'm gonna be
doing the structure on the rear wall
with the window because the windows
gonna be going in the center this beam
right here is five feet high so we are
not gonna be able to put a window here
because there's a beam so I'm gonna
build the frame of the window first I'm
gonna lay out my exterior put the window
where I want it and then frame it in if
that makes sense hopefully it all goes
according to plan so we've got all those
raw materials over there which if
everything goes according to plan today
we will be sitting with three walls up
that are painted and a window so let's
see if we can do it
I cut this one on the raw like the thick
ends I should have been should have been
like this well we have to paint the
boards first anyway so we couldn't get
it upright get the stilts on the back
rearrange the walls how they need to be
paint these gray and then go so they
could dry while we're gone
all right so as you can see we've got
three walls here and a fake window that
I still have to do the molding around
what you guys saw that I really kind of
screwed it up we got to go buy more
molding anyway you can see I got a fake
what looks like a fake slider you gotta
imagine it can be blinds in front of
this and some like sheer veneer or
whatever they're called like some dangly
things that look pretty I'm very good at
the interior design part but we're gonna
reason why I put the trim on yet so
wanted to go buy another piece of it we
have to paint the inside of this white
all this is gonna be white way to find
the blinds they're gonna fit in here
have them cut to length and then we need
to put the trim on but I'm gonna build a
pillar obviously these two walls have
been connected yet because until we
paint it and get in there and the edges
and get the carpet back here I don't
want to join them together but they're
put together with straps also gonna show
you on the back but I'm gonna put this
like when I make kind of a 1 by 1 brick
pillar sort of a looking thing here
they're gonna paint white so it's a
googly a painted brick oh you know a lot
of people paint brick just to sort of
give it that kind of a industrial loft
sort of feel but it's gonna be simple
enough we just have to do because these
this one's too short these are 8 feet
those are 10 foot walls I'm trying to
decide if I want the pillow to go all
the way up or if I want to put something
decorative on top of the pillar so it
looks like the pillar just doesn't go
away to the ceiling but then that would
mean it was never a functional pillar so
it wouldn't be very believable so I
don't know yeah but either way we have
to build the 8-foot section so let's go
and get to it
so this is just sort of an example of
kind of how it'll be it probably go on
the other side haven't decided yet but
this is a symmetrical wall so it can go
either way still have to fill in the
bottom doesn't go all the way to the top
of a ten-foot roof but fill I mean
you're filming if you come closer it's
good yeah you don't really see the top
so yeah I just wanted to kind of break
up the squareness of this room a little
bit because I mean it then makes it look
like we're in some sort of an old
brownstone or like a like a loft deal
and son I'm looking I'm looking forward
to this this will be nice there's gonna
be some gaps and stuff but once it's all
painted and stuff you won't really
notice not to mention I'm sure anyone
watching this that lives in an old
converted industrial building with
bricks and drywall half the time they
don't made up perfectly anyway so
alright there's that and as you can see
the inside that's all it is it's just a
frame and I have to put a piece of wood
along here steel so that we can mount it
but we're not going to do that until we
paint everything
Oh
I'd take break new food fresh now
alright so I gave in about a paint
sprayer that I then proceeded to flush
the nozzle down the toilet on accident
while cleaning it up oh wow that's
besides the point I'll just be buying a
new spray gun part of it but anyway as
you can see we've got the base coat up
it's kind of looking blotchy because
there are areas that are still wet in
areas that are dry but you can see our
window is gonna be here with the paint
the inside of this white still that's
not gonna happen today I'm done for the
day I've inhaled enough fumes I know
that this looks weird because it's not
butted up against the other wall yeah
that's the way it's turned out it's not
perfect but it's gonna be fines you have
to imagine this is gonna be it's kind of
all kinds of stuff on the wall it's
gonna have probably some shelving it's
gonna have of course a desk that's gonna
be blinds and curtains here and there's
gonna be plant you can see the pillar I
made is standing up over here like I
said I'm probably gonna paint this white
I might just see how the red looks
against the gray wall though because
that might be a good contrast but I
don't think it looks bad considering the
fact that I suck at this and this is my
first time ever building anything like
this so I just reminded myself that I'm
gonna still have to take this wall apart
cuz we put the rug underneath it so it's
gonna be sitting on top of it but there
I mean doesn't that kind of look like
it's some sort of a loft building type
deal this is the first wall we built and
it wasn't very good it's kind of wavy
and stuff so we've if I push this hard
against it you can see this side which
is the last wall we built Luis it's just
freestanding and that's almost perfect
in terms of the gap so what we are gonna
have to do is we will have to nail-gun
this together am I gonna do it right now
because I want to paint this white I
need the carpet and stuff in here first
I'll push this hard against that skin
and then a back side we will and I'll
pop that skin off the stud too I will
then nail it to the frame that I made
for this all the way around I'll have to
loosen the bottom up to you there we go
so that way the skin is attached to this
and hopefully if I put enough nails in
it it won't pop off and I think it'll
look even better when it's white you
think I should paint it white or leave
it that kind of a
look I'm feeling white still are you
yeah because don't forget we're gonna
have the white trim going around the
window right so just a sort of an
example this isn't the piece that goes
here but as an example you can see we
are gonna have our fake window with
white trim around it so I think the
white pillar will go along with it
really really well this is gonna look
way better than I thought I was capable
of making oh no the truth all right so
that's all for today I would have liked
to have gotten more done and I would
have liked to have not flushed the
nozzle of my spray gun down the toilet
anyway thanks for watching guys and as
always we'll see you in the next one if
you want to see more of these set builds
videos make sure you guys like these
videos and share them because if they
get enough views and stuff to make it
worth us taking the extra time to make
the video then of course we'll do it and
I just realized this is upside down oh
wait I did it up I tested it both ways
didn't I yeah I can end the video and I
just kind of keep going
yeah let's test it one more time Tommy
I'm scratching the wall all up here no
it's really rustic alright now we're
gonna go before I damaged things
