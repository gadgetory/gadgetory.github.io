all day to an hour and 12 minutes don't
even bring the other battery crap what's
up guys J is two cents here back in
studio with lots of setup to do
crap I think I brought the other
batteries is going to be interesting
where did I put the battery that's okay
I can plug this into USB while we're not
using it on the little power ship and
let it get some charge there so sorry
moving over some system here here's the
rise end system here is the test bench
joint test bench that's got to 1080 1080
down they're not the tea is I do have to
1080 t eyes whoa ROM but I do have to
1080 P I haven't started testing any of
that yet we got Nick on a ladder
whatever reason he wanted the ladder not
because we're gonna be changing those
light bulbs to the mr16 LED and we have
a lot more stuff to do as you can see
there's just crap everywhere because
we're kind of we're figuring out
guys okay that's the only way to put it
so delivering on the background is
something I've kind of always want to in
fact we'll just take a seat let's take a
seat right here I've always wanted this
kind of a kind of a green room sitting
area hangout area it's not just a
recording studio it's the headquarters
for my business and I always wanted that
kind of a living room backdrop but it's
not the only backdrop I'm going to run
not to mention so many people are just
like your backdrop looks like Austin
heaven your backdrop looks like Jonathan
Morrison's and you guys are telling
Jonathan the same thing because guys
it's pretty obvious we're in the same
building okay we need to make our sets
look kind of unique so I'm going to be
filming in different parts of this
building which was always the plan but I
haven't got that all figured out yet and
if you go back and look at my old videos
you see that there was quite a bit of
change even in the old house before I
move to the new house and then here so
there's there's some evolution stuff
taking place here and this is I kind of
feel like this is the the awkward
puberty period of my channel with NYX
laughing over there on the ladder it's
seriously it's like it's like puberty
for the channel right now I don't know
yet what I'm going to do but that's kind
of the fun of it because I have freedom
now which is something I never had
before
and I don't know what to do with freedom
it's a foreign concept to me so today
we're going to put together some more
furniture I got some desperate stairs
start putting systems up there we're
gonna put together the glass shelves
over
here we brought over some GPUs to put in
there for display and the thing about
filming in this direction hi is
obviously we're going to have to keep
the studio as clean as possible and neat
looking if we're going to be filming
that way which is kind of a good and bad
thing it forces us to be neat and tidy
but then at the same time it forces us
to be neat and tidy
let's hope anyway we're going to try and
bang this out as fast as we can as a day
when I try and bang this out as fast as
we can because the the Jay is keeping it
real cars as Nick says is keeping it a
little bit too real because yesterday
the head gasket decided to be like Oh
guess what it's okay to let coolant make
its way into the cylinders and start
blowing white smoke out your tailpipe
and I was like you know what this this
2005 Durango is not worth the cost and
time and labor of doing head gaskets on
that so I'm just going to try stop leak
and the soft leak works actually it's
not smoking anymore as idle as smooth as
can be the more compression leak in that
cylinder but unfortunately now it looks
like it it clogs the thermostat which
even though it says I don't have to take
thermostat out now it appears that a
clogged the thermostat so this afternoon
we're going to give Nick a lesson on how
to change a thermostat and flush out
your cooling system that should be fun
let's get to work
anything you want to say we have some
fun today check it out LED lights up
there and all the mr16 LED lights right
here in the kitchen and then these are
LEDs also an added right huh one of the
things my company is to work for I'm
being paged sorry about that that was an
important phone call about how we're
going to change the world one one person
at a time Memphis K so anyway like I
said all the LED lights are in there I
started to say that the company I worked
for we did turnkey solutions for
energy-efficient lighting and smart
lighting and stuff like that dimmable
control panels and stuff for
fluorescents so I like lighting lighting
it's fun to me so what we're going to do
now is you can see all this crap on the
floor we're putting together the glass
shelves that are going to go next to
entertainment
we're going with some GPUs and the
shelves some new stuff some old stuffs
kind of mixing it up I don't want to put
any of the really good stuff in there
because I might need it for builds and
things and then the more I'm playing
around glass shelving the more I'm going
to probably break it so and he put
together desks up there you zoom in
seebik see it ah look desks we actually
have some desk which means that the
computers which are over there
where are they they're there some of
those compact wrong way uh yeah so
whatever this lens is dirty I'm going to
clean it on Instagram some people work
bugs it like why are there red cards on
one side and not the other like you
should separate it because my OCD is
going crazy now I want to leave it just
because of that I don't know what I'm
putting the bottom yet but for somebody
down there well yeah it turned out
pretty good if you guys who has a
channel long enough you guys remember
the GPU shelf well this is like the
evolution of the GPU show I think it
turned out pretty damn good I think this
whole set is turning out pretty darn
good my mic so now we're going to go up
there and we're going to put together
another autonomous desk I've got another
this is the 70 inch autonomous desk the
Business Edition which can hold 300
pounds and then I got another Business
Edition 300 pound capable one that's the
50 inch desk that's going to be like my
bench test desk that makes us I like to
stand up a lot when I'm doing my bench
testing and stuff so I wander the desk I
could go really high and then I can make
go down so I could sit if I want so I
thought it was perfect to do that so
let's go upstairs and let's do that and
I want to talk about something I want to
get real with y'all a little bit in in
this video I apologize in advance
baby it's totally making me white hold
on I'm not been halfway alright so
here's the upstairs so far I think we
did some work we got the desk
we got the chair up but anyways yeah
Jason have to work off the rise and
build for a while see how he likes it I
think is II I think I think you might
have problems according to a last time
we got to work with this rig and right
now Jays trying to figure out why the
Wi-Fi is expecting TV but I think you
figure it out did you figure it out
Alvin how about now now the upstairs is
kind of neat that's where the computers
and stuff are let's talk about Rison for
a second here what I started
Nik a second ago was I'm gonna be using
the right end system here for the first
while in this whole new studio thing I
want to see how it does that rendering
out my videos and all that stuff so I
figured I'm going to be building myself
some new systems specifically for the
office here but I want to see how this
one does and yeah now speaking of the
office / studio this is the part I said
I wanted to kind of get real is there is
this concept or misconception or
something with the audience some members
of the audience most people have been
super-supportive I just want to kind of
give some reassurance to the people that
are concerned about the change in growth
of all this this is a good thing this is
something I've always worked towards and
it's you can only make your your bedroom
slash home office work for so much it
was way too crammed and stuff and
there's me a lot of changes happening
here even like like I said earlier
there's been a progression over the time
of my channel even that home office has
changed a lot and now we're here this
that you see was a huge goal of mine to
have this company and have now an
employee and have a dedicated
headquarters space this this is this
makes me feel real we talked in the past
about success and I've said before that
I never feel successful but just makes
me feel a little bit successful this
makes me feel like I've worked towards
something and I've achieved it also it's
a milestone yeah because I was about to
say is I don't know what's next
hopefully bigger better things but I
don't know what's next a lot of what we
do here is literally make it up as we go
and I I don't know what's next but I
want you guys to just not worry about
there being some sort of shift in
personality because the heart and soul
of all of this is still me I'm still
doing the editing on these videos I'm
still doing all of the why say scripting
I don't script anything but I still do
everything here Nick is an assistant at
this point he's not even full-time yet
and we're going to get him up to speed
when he goes full-time next end of next
month ish but yeah I see some people are
concerned that this is going to lose
that down-to-earth feel and that's
furthest from my mind it's kind of funny
though earlier how I mentioned that
there's other youtubers in this building
and that obviously our units to look
alike because the units are very similar
yeah Austin and Jonathan came by
earlier to check out the set and then
they showed me their sets and it's kind
of kind of neat to see how different we
actually set up these spaces I mean the
only thing that's really similar between
our stuff is the windows which we can't
really do anything about but it's
amazing how Jonathan's unit is so
different than my unit and it's so
different than Austin's unit and it's
kind of fun though gives you some ideas
and some things to compare but I'm
trying to come up with three or four
sets to use in this space there's still
a lot of unused space like look over
here you see that that's completely
empty over there
we could do something over there
obviously and as you guys can see the
echo up here and the second story is a
lot better than down there so we've got
a lot of things to figure out now you
can see Nick that's what I hired him for
look at that see what he does I planned
it all out throw it out you flatten it
all out yeah well you know what the
trash can is also too I'm using the LG
you see 87 evolutis 34 you see 87 see
yeah and this is the IPS 60 Hertz more
of a professional grade panel 34 inch
ultra wide q HD 34 40 by 1440 it's only
60 Hertz so for gaming it's not like oh
it's good if you're okay with 30fps or
excuse me 60 FPS I'm just so used to the
hundred Hertz in the in the predator
panel we'll be getting some new panels
in here too I'm actually working with a
Toussaint's and sponsored stuff with
that so but yeah this is one we be doing
editing acts in fact today's video on
the editing on here and putting it up
here live with the freakin amazing
internet I have because I've got 350
megabit upload an exception yeah you
guys are watching the video now that
will be rendered later on where to go on
that and then it will go online this
cables back there through those cables
through the internet around the world
and into your computer and into your
eyeballs and into your brain and then
what happens once it's in your brain is
on you what we're gonna hear if your
connection is good mmm
their connection will determine the
resolution at which I get to talk to
their brain fairly you like that
yes live on the brain but anyway yeah I
think it's all turning out pretty good
I think it's most excellent its
excelsior and if it's a based events
that blow right on you get to that wind
the AC blows right on me on my desk you
like to stay cool you look how that's
placed and then there's this chair this
is the autonomous chair against
name-brand ascent the autonomous desk
and this one is hooked up as you can see
autonomous we're that it goes you go
yeah dad you can move then keeping
Louise yeah anyway time to go guys
thanks for watching today's video again
but the moral of this don't worry this
is a good thing I promise I will be the
same dick hole you guys have come to
love okay I promise I'll make sure he's
David it oh alright guys time to go
thanks for watching I have no idea how
long this video was probably not very
long at all I still got to figure out if
I want to fix the Durango today or
tomorrow that's not something I'm
looking forward to when I have to work
on nizzy that's fun bizzy's fun so again
we're a he'd be real hard it is serious
and it gets didn't you look at like
every penny I'm spinning and I don't
want to spend this money but I could
justify spending money on the Z I don't
want to spend any money on the Durango
alright guys time to go thanks for
watching see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
