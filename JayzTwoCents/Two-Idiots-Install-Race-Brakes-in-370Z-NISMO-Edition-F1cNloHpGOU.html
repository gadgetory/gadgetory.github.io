I'm wearing clothes they're way too big
because I was working on the car this
video is not about computers it is about
mine is Moe 370z that I'm prepping for
the track on October 29th if you're not
into that sort of stuff move along to
the next video if you like car stuff or
you just bored and stick around because
who knows what's gonna happen this is
super old school old style slip on that
those things delight this is bringing it
back way back hey we're at the house and
this isn't tax stuff we're going to talk
about cars this car behind me is my 2010
Nissan 370z Nismo Edition it's not a 350
I have not owned a 350 in like over two
years
fun fact my cousin's name is Zedekiah so
we always called him said yes the hood
is real carbon fiber everything on the
car is real because it's a real Nismo
real coconut monkey
Rihanna's mom it even says so right
there so here's what we're doing today
we are gonna be changing the brakes oh
my well okay those show what's in there
why Teddy we are gonna be installing
some new BB a 2-piece rotors and with
those two-piece rotors some matching DBA
pads because I do actually take my car
to the track it's too high this like
nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit here right
now in the middle of October and I'm not
putting on my coveralls it is too hot
for that I've got some bad metallurgy
going between the rotors I have on there
and the pads have on the right now so
they're two-piece they are not a
floating two-piece so they are mounted
which means I don't get my brakes at
that hot so I'm not worried about them
not being a floating two-piece it's a
little bit about weight reduction
because this is a heavy fat fat heavy
car just like its owner
those don't feel like any weight
reduction have to pull it out of the
truck though
I like I chopped the rear wheel but I
forgot the car so stiff it lifts up
evenly on the front and the rear see
that should I chop the other wheel huh
it's okay it's higher sometimes the
popping is how you know you're raising
it right some fancy packaging right
there
technically my wife bought me a
pneumatic impact wrench which about me a
pneumatic impact wrench and I don't have
an air compressor yet I always hear
these stupid comments do you like jury
just don't some better wheels these are
these are forged raised engineering
wheels the only bit sucks of item is the
offset so you can see we've got a little
bit of a spacer here a 15 mil spacer
which I could totally take off and
wouldn't be a problem but bro these are
raised raised you know supposed to use
an impact wrench on an on impact you
know this is why I will always tell
people if you have an option of getting
like real race breaks or Brembos
whatever something that's got clamping
calipers and not slider calipers beyond
trust me it is worth it because brakes
they just don't get any easier from
telling you them there so don't lose
this this is under pressure
now we're gonna push this pin up that
way that one up that way no this is
under pressure so hold it and now we
contained your pets look at that
what did you look yeah it's amazing chef
compared to doing I mean I want to take
the caliper off or anything so that we
just take this and go like this alright
I'm so used to point calipers on dad
there we go now we got our pets there's
lots of material left on these pads it's
actually three track days on these pads
these are the immunities these are the
MX 72 is the endless pads the reason why
we're changing these there's actually a
known metallurgy problem between the DBA
rotors that I have and the pads I've
always wanted to piece rotors so I just
decide to update upgrade to the DBA
5000-series
and what the DBA zone pad which should
then solve our issue hopefully because I
stopped to bed these in so we fun now I
have to take off my hub center crank
take off my so I grossly miss estimated
how many of my followers are actually in
the cars well huh you have million but
even even back in the day I just assumed
like no one gives a about cars from
my channel wheeze all computer nerds
this is usually the time when the car
followers I do have like to voice their
opinion about my car you know what the
best part about my car is it's your it's
my car
is it your car if you happen to be an F
body guy are you happy to be a Mustang
guy that's fine I really don't care
one of the best part about two people I
mean everyone's got their pain about
wheel spacers right but what I like
about wheel spacers is they at least
hold on the rotor I'm doing pad swaps
and stuff I mean there's that
so the rotors are gonna be all flopping
around sideways because I've got to
retract the Pistons now because I got
fresh pads so their pads are thicker
which means the Pistons have moved out
over time
so how I push those back in but at least
this will hold the rotor flush against
the hub without it being all crooked the
way I push it might because you can't
use a standard caliper retraction tool
on these but you would crank and push
the piston in because the piston doesn't
come apart so what I tend to do is I
take my rubber handles here I push them
in just like that you can see my pissed
I hope you guys can see on camera my
Pistons are pushing in yeah I can't you
see a piston moving in there
how does that one help it you're
adorable
so now I'm just gonna do that on the
other side and then we get to do the fun
part where we have to go bed them in
which is heat him up and cool down a few
times no way to heat up the breaks
you gotta get going real fast best part
about Forge wheels is they're really
light so the coils I'm running on here
actually MCAS and they just one world
Time Attack again that's one other
reason why we're in an Australian breaks
man in Australians I should I have a
very small head yeah ladies it's been a
long time to really done any car content
at all yeah we did we did some stuff
he's gonna slowly
okay well I push the brakes and we
slowly because that's a good yeah let me
fit they working so what's gonna do to
burnish your brakes or bet them in if
get them nice and hot and apply them a
few times and then let them cool off and
do it a few times
faster
maybe burn they do like crap pass you
made yellow that was an amazing bite if
you're doing a burner
abs keep it in that would be here yeah
Turner it's number one down he'll wanna
do it again like it smell good
oh okay now we'll let them cool off
they've been let's go yeah yeah so yeah
I love you nice and hot and now we got
cooled off for 15 minutes
once we do the initial cooldown we need
to cool them off to about 15 minutes
performing park the cars had to stop on
the rotor in any one spot gotcha
so we need to do like what I just did
like four more times okay we're gonna
make making a loop here and then we'll
just be doing everything we can to avoid
touching the breaks deliverable offers
I'm certainly not gonna stop with the
put my foot on the bridge like I would
pull the e brake a little bit remember
that's a drum break that isn't speed to
calif or the back
you forget how much fun rates to me
I feel like you need furnaces at this
point
you're coming out of your seat I know I
mean I can't phrase for it any better
when I'm holding the camera so that's
like just using the air and whatever
strength I have in my core I'm barely
touching them if something so yeah we
just keep doing that is what we're doing
is we're applying a transfer layer to
the rotor and the way you get the best
braking is you get a pad layer transfer
to your rotor and then that is what and
then that's what actually gives you the
braking power we're done yeah so come on
down here I'll take a look you see how
there's like a purple layer on there oh
well you can see that is it picking it
up Nick mmm so it's like a purple layer
on there that's us getting the good
transfer layer the first transfer layer
on the brakes we've got a nice and
smelly nice and hot and then we let them
cool down and that's what it looks like
now the pad material transferred which
gives us a good bedding process a lot of
people will just change their pads in
their rotors and go out and drive normal
and they don't properly bed them all
pads have to be bedded so that actually
looks pretty good and I like the way the
I like the way the two-piece rotors look
now we can park hard yeah this is not
normal content but this is another thing
I'm passionate about so if you like the
car stuff let me know if you want to see
more and we'll bring on I know I have
the second channel but we'll mix it in
with the main channel here too this is
another huge passion of mine and hey it
involves computers we were running
around earlier with a laptop logging
data logging the car
or our tune we're prepping for so all
right guys thanks for watching as always
we'll see in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
