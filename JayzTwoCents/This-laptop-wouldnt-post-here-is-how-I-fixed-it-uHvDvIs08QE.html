gonna make about how to fix a broken
laptop but what broke was my health
because I got one of those than me now
apparently it feels like I'm sick I'm
trying to say I'm sick we're gonna we're
gonna brick this laptop then we're gonna
fix it
hopefully you can fix yours unless I
break it and doesn't come back then
whatever

alright so I'm about to use intel
extreme tuning utility to push this
computer too far to where it won't post
so what happens is especially on laptops
there's no clear CMOS button anywhere on
this some lap I've seen laptops in the
past that kind of had one hidden door
like a little reset button but laptops
tend to not even be overclocking
friendly but the thing with XTU is that
it will often let you push things much
farther than you're allowed to do so
which can then break it so typically you
don't need to worry about resetting a
laptop because clearly are usually the
BIOS is not even tunable to where you
would be able to post anyway he'd post
and then if something wrong with your OS
it wouldn't load or whatever but that's
that's obviously software level not
posting so if you can't get the computer
to even try and load the OS then what do
you do so that's kind of I'm gonna show
you here right now so there's a couple
things you're gonna need to know before
we move forward one I showed XTU in a
video and I got quite a few messages
people going help I went too far how do
I undo so that's the purpose of this
video the other thing is you're going to
want to make sure that you have a
serviceable laptop so if we go ahead and
take a look at this Origin PC unit here
that did a review on recently you can
see we have perimeter screws that are
accessible unfortunately none of these
screws have a little label that says
void if you know removed and it has it
take over a screw hole and yet to poke
it that's a whole different discussion
on whether or not they can legally void
your warranty based on that we're not
talk about that today but that's on you
if you do void that warranty Jay's not
here showing you how to board your
warranty you don't come at me what they
decide to no longer cover your unit the
other thing is not all laptops are
serviceable so there are some MSI
laptops I've used in the past
that do not have perimeter screws well
if they're there but then there's weird
snaps and stuff and the way it goes
together and comes apart is not very
user friendly whereas this unit will
easily come apart by undoing the screws
so that's something I want you to keep
in mind moving forward is you may or may
not have to research how to take your
case or your chassis apart that's a
hundred percent on you it's too many
different laptops out there to try and
say this is gonna work for all of you
now another thing to note with XTU is
that when I showed this on the desktop
it was able to apply a lot of the
changes in real time it would just apply
and then you could play with the
overclocking while you were doing your
thing on this laptop and what prompt me
to want to make this video as well was
that when I made a change like for
instance this is a 8750 so what we've
got six cores 12 threads two at thirty
nine multiplier thirty-nine two at forty
and two at forty one and what I
basically did was like well I want to I
want to overclock this baby so let's
just sync them all to like I don't know
45 what seemed very doable and without
playing with the BIOS or anything when I
hit apply it warns me that applying this
change requires a reboot would you like
to proceed so that's kind of a problem
number one was is that this is now going
to go into the BIOS which by the way if
I went into the BIOS that boot would not
give me any of these options I couldn't
play it multiplayer or any of that sort
of stuff so we are having intel x2 you
basically go in and kind of override the
BIOS with these settings which is what
leads to potentially breaking your
laptop where it won't boot and in this
case not even a splash screen nothing so
we're gonna go ahead and apply these
changes say yes and it's gonna reboot
right now so if I did my job right when
about to show you right now is that we
are going to get either a boot loop or a
solid keyboard that's lit with a black
screen and nothing coming up okay so I
think we did it because when this PC
boots and it first turns on the fans
kind of do a full power cycle like a
full ramp up and then come down this
didn't do it we just lit up and got
nothing so here we go we've now
officially bricked it now what you'll
find online is people will say well
here's what you do you just unplug your
power and you leave it running till it's
dead and then you're good to go
but anyone who knows anything about
computers would never suggest that
because it doesn't matter whether it's a
laptop or a desktop there is a BIOS
battery
the BIOS battery will retain all of
those settings unless a CMOS is cleared
there is no external CMOS on this so you
can't clear that so that's what we're
gonna do next I got my fancy handy dandy
iFixit kit
they've never sponsored a video of mine
of all the people they've sponsored I'm
the buying customer I'm the paying
customer Oh what because for me shut up
Phil no one likes you feel the part
where you have to be very gentle there
we go here is obviously our Evo 16s so
there's two screws here on this
particular battery so we're gonna undo
this one gently unplug it
fortunately this one's in that ribbon
cable it's a regular type cable here's
our battery kind of small given the size
of the computer and it's hardware or it
is a 20 70 max cube flipper over and
then hold the power button this is kind
of like the equivalent of unplugging
your computer from the wall and then
draining the caps by holding the power
button we're gonna try that let's just
put the battery back in but ya see the
harder than you're thinking the orange
light's not on no fan spinning up no
splash screen no nothing
this is the part a lot of people tend to
forget about this whole video really was
just because of this so to take your
battery out but you also have to remove
your CMOS battery which is right here a
lot of people don't see it this could be
tucked under something it could be
underneath it could be somewhere that's
not visible plus because it's wrapped in
black it's not that easy to see but
these are like the exact same batteries
that they use on like mini ITX Chasse
ease crutch exact same thing so here's
the CMOS battery in fact it's the same
exact harness and plug in everything as
you see right here in this laptop so
what you gotta do now is just simply
unplug this guy and then do the same
thing with the battery out push and hold
power for 10 seconds or so this is
clearing your CMOS so you saw that we
basically went from a laptop that would
not boot it wasn't even trying to spin
up the fans or anything just it was so
far gone there was no way to get it back
there's no clear CMOS button xeni we're
here where now if we go ahead and just
plug this guy back in put in our battery
then we will be back up and running
here we go yay so that's what we got in
this one a first boot or NVRAM reset
condition has been detected if you
continue to see this message consult the
user guide go to yada yada one thing I
didn't try was also removing one ram
stick and then moving on with to the
other slot or something so it forces a
hardware change to see if that worked
but I just prefer to do a full CMOS
reset because if you then tried to boot
it again it might have reverted those
settings that didn't work back to the
ones that didn't work so as you can see
that's how I brought back this laptop
from the dead when I use XT you to push
it beyond barriers that are there for a
reason so anyway if you found yourself
in that same situation whether it be
your desktop or your laptop it's the
same thing your desktop just happens to
have a button there for clearing the
CMOS which will bypass the battery
itself so you wouldn't have to
necessarily remove the battery or
anything because there's no battery in a
desktop it's a PSU but usually you have
to unplug it from the wall and all that
sort of stuff so anyway back together
she goes with all the screws and then
our laptop is up and running so if you
guys found this video useful once you go
in and give it a like and if you know
someone that's got a piece of hardware
like a laptop or something that's not
working because it won't boot and just
sits there frozen let's give this a shot
so anyway guys thanks for watching and
as always we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
