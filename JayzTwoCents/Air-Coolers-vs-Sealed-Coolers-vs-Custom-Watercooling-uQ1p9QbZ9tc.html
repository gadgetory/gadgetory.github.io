Intel have really loosened up their
panties when it comes to the subject of
overclocking and they've even gone as
far as to sell overclocking specific
models of their popular CPUs like the K
and X series on Intel and the famous
black edition on AMD but of course the
added power and performance of
overclocking your CPU comes with the
trade off more heat so with the hundreds
of messages sitting in my various
inboxes from viewers asking which cooler
is right for them I decided to go ahead
and take the hint and bring you my
updated version of how to choose the
right cooler for your system EVGA ACX
2.0 cooler with its three phase 6 slot
motor 11 swept fan blades and double
ball bearing design offers reduced power
noise and thermals for the optimum
gaming experience click the link in the
description to learn more and whether
you're overclocking AMD or Intel there's
one thing that will never change the
fanboys are real wait that's the wrong
point still true with more overclocking
means you need more voltage which of
course means you have more heat and you
need more cooling capacity now there are
many kinds of coolers on the market
ranging from the tame to the extreme
you've got your air coolers you've got
your sealed all-in-one water coolers
your custom loops not to mention the
more exotic cooling options hey focus
exotic cooling like phase-change peltor
is liquid nitrogen etc etc but today
we're going to focus on the main three
that actually matter to the average
consumer
now those being air cooling sealed water
loops and custom water cooling loops now
to first understand which is right for
you you're going to have to understand
the pros and cons of each type of cooler
so let's go ahead and start with
something simple let's start with air
cooling now air cooling has quite the
range of cooling intensity itself with
basic coolers like the legendary cooler
master hyper 212 all the way up to
extreme coolers like the Noctua nhd 14
which I might add the nhd 14 is actually
matched and surpassed some all-in-one
coolers when it comes to various
temperature tests now the benefit to air
cooling is that they are simple to
install there
nearly maintenance-free now I say nearly
because you do have to open up your case
and blow out dust and cat hair back hair
whatever else may have worked its way
into these tiny little fins but probably
the most beneficial part to cooling is
the air cooling is the fact that they
have absolutely zero moving parts to
wear out and therefore last for years
and years now in fact the fans are
likely to die before anything else
regarding the cooler and they're usually
relatively inexpensive with like I
mentioned earlier the cooler hyper
master 212 having legendary price to
performance ratio no guys that is not a
paid product placement just go look at
new egg reviews or Amazon and with over
7,000 reviews on new egg alone then
overall five egg rating to boot no other
cooler has achieved that level of
success not to mention it's like 35
bucks on Amazon now really there are
only a couple drawbacks to air cooling
typically to get really good performance
the towers can be pretty massive
well not that massive but sometimes
they're really good air coolers on the
market can interfere with some case
panels I actually ran into this problem
earlier in the year when I was building
my wife system which meant that I had to
actually switch out the cooler for one
that wasn't quite so tall now the other
downside is sometimes in order to get
the higher cooling capacity with higher
overclocks you have to ramp up the fan
speed quite a bit leading to a noisy PC
fortunately the improvement of heat pipe
and vapour technology this is becoming
less of an issue and you can now get
some pretty decent temperatures even
with low rpm fans on air coolers like
the be quiet fans now one of the last
drawbacks to air coolers is that they
can interfere with the height of some
ram on the market making it impossible
to install certain dims on your
motherboard as gaming and high
performance ran continues to push the
limits they can get pretty warm so
manufacturers have started beefing up
the heat sinks on RAM as well which can
definitely get in the way of some air
coolers now moving on to all one coolers
also known as sealed coolers these have
really gained popularity over the past
few years with brands like Corsair and
cooler master and NZXT helping to bring
these options to market now in reality
they are just like custom water cooling
loops and that they share the same basic
properties they both have pumps
CPU water blocks tubing which move a
non-corrosive coolant over the CPU
moving the heat and transferring out of
the case through a radiator but the main
difference between custom loops and
sealed coolers is that they are much
more compact they're no more difficult
to install the air coolers and they are
completely maintenance-free well of
course with the same exception as air
coolers you've got to blow out that
pesky cat or back hair but you don't
have to worry about opening up most of
them and draining the fluid but of
course there are some exceptions to that
rule
typically hybrid all-in-one coolers like
the Swift Tec h2 20x offer expandability
which also introduces the maintenance
schedule but other than that they are
pretty hands-off when it comes to
maintenance now another key benefit is
that they do come in all sorts of sizes
you have single 120 millimeter fans dual
120 dual 140 and now even some of them
come in three hundred and sixty
millimeter variants but that can also
lead to a little confusion about what
size to get the basic rule of thumb in
my book is get the biggest radiator that
will fit in your case period now some of
the drawbacks to sealed coolers is their
additional moving parts specifically the
pump now typically the most common part
to fail is indeed the pump since they
are often much smaller and much less
robust designs then stand-alone pumps
found in custom loops generally you only
get about two to three years of constant
used out of a sealed cooler before the
pump starts making noise or grinding or
dies altogether now something else that
would be considered a drawback to sealed
units is the fear of leaking and
damaging your PC it's actually not that
common to hear about leaking in
all-in-one coolers like this but it has
happened in the past so it's a risk that
you take and it's definitely something
you have to keep in mind now the last
thing to mention is that they are often
a little more expensive than air coolers
but they usually yield a higher
overclock with lower average
temperatures now let's talk about my
personal favorite and that being custom
water cooling loops it's backwards
custom water cooling loops they offer a
ton of options tons of custom abysm
customizability you can cool just your
CPU or maybe add a video card or two or
three to your loop and get a crap ton of
extra gaining performance heck you can
eat
water-cooler RAM and your motherboard in
many instances as well you can choose
how big or how small your loop will be
but of course the Moore's radiator
surface area means overall lower
temperatures allowing the building to
get much closer to mV and temperature
than the aforementioned cooling
scenarios but not only that if you
oversize your radiator it means you can
slow down your fans to aid any more
silent PC configuration a custom fluids
have also mean that you can color match
your fluid to your system for that nice
unique build custom aesthetic while
using clear tubing and over all the
components just look a whole lot better
but unfortunately the list of drawbacks
is just as long as the list of pros
while building your custom loop parts
the list can become very overwhelming
very quickly having to make sure you
have plenty of the right fittings the
right tubing while also ensuring that
they are compatible with each other
measuring proper fit for radiator size
in your case will it fit in your case
will it clear your components will it
hit your motherboard where's the pump
going to go where's the reservoir going
to go how are you going to fill it how
you going to drain it
not to mention each and every part
available has a metric shit-ton of
available sizes and brands to choose
from if you ever thought picking your
first PC parts list was hard wait until
you try to pick your very first custom
loop parts list I've been building
custom loops for over a decade and I
still sometimes forget apart or
accidentally order mismatched parts oops
it actually happened on skunkworks if
you saw the build log now fortunately
some companies like X SPC Alpha cool
phobia and EK water blocks have taken
the guesswork out of the equation by
creating custom loops in a box where
they pretty much take all the necessary
parts throw them in a box and sell it as
a kit this is nice because it means that
you know you didn't forget something all
you have to do is pick the right GPU
block if you want to include your
graphics card to the loop add a couple
of fittings for your block and it's easy
right well you just hold your horses
there it's not quite that simple now
still you have to install the thing and
just because the parts were putting a
box for you doesn't take the extra work
of installing it out of the equation and
on top of that these custom kits in a
box never include any method of draining
your loop for maintenance so I guess
that's a pretty good segue into the
biggest drawback of
loop's you have to maintain the thing
now typically I drain and fill my loops
once a year but with some fluids I drag
a nice nano fluid you can actually leave
it in your system for up to two years
without any issues usually premix fluids
have an anti corrosive property to them
as well as growth inhibitors so you
don't get algae this technology has
really expanded over the past decade
making things a lot easier but of course
you could still use a simple distilled
water mix with a silver coil to keep
costs down and just drain the fluid
every six months but lastly the obvious
drawback is the price custom loops start
at a couple hundred bucks and can easily
exceed $1,000 or more depending on your
level of hardware that you choose this
means there is a definite diminishing
return on your investment when it comes
compared to non custom loops and overall
temperatures and you should never opt to
spend more money on a custom water
cooling loop if it means you take away
from raw performance by cheeping out on
your CPU or GPU just for the sake of
affording a custom loop and that makes
zero sense let alone two cents see what
I did there but trust me when I say that
there is nothing quite like the feeling
of building your own custom water loop
and making that personal touch and
aesthetic feel of your system and making
it your own so now just to recap I
didn't fart that was my chair
so just to recap air coolers they're
cheap maintenance free and the heat sink
never wears out but usually they're a
little more noisy under load conditions
lower overall overclocks and height
requirements make height or high-end air
coolers incompatible with some cases and
memory now sealed units offer better
overclocks usually lower noise and are
maintenance free but usually at the
sacrifice of operational life with a
small risk of linking while being a tad
bit more costly than air cooling and of
course custom water cooling loops offer
a custom look color matching better over
clocks with temps reaching as low as
ambient temperature but part selection
can be a complete bitch much more
expensive than lower perform and a lower
performance return on your investment
but it looks cool so who cares go ahead
and mortgage the house and buy a custom
water cooling loop that's my advice well
there you go guys J is two cents on air
cooling versus sealed coolers versus
custom water cooling loops hopefully
this video wasn't too long and it helps
some of you decide which cooler is best
for you if you're interested in building
a custom loop and check out this
playlist here somewhere on the screen
where I have put some of my water
cooling videos including tutorials on
how to do your first water cooling loop
how to install it and if you feel that
there are more pros and cons that I may
have missed in this video let us know
down in the comments but please keep it
civil I know it's the Internet and I
know it's hard but hey at least try once
again guys thanks for your support your
support means an awful ton to me and as
always guys I'll see you in the next one
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
