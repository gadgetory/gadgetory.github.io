provided by performance pcs for the
largest online selection of PC modding
and water cooling parts head to
performance pcs calm well the system is
done
I think it's never really done
I mean honestly have I ever really been
done with this system
you
so anytime I do any videos or any
Instagram photos or anything about
skunkworks I always get the inevitable
Jew why are you wasting so much money on
this the system as I said it's a labor
of love and it's a symbol of the channel
therefore it's always going to be
evolving so get used to the seen this
thing get upgraded all the time because
that's just the way we do around here
the system is always going to be
evolving with the channel that's the
point of it that was the whole reason I
started building this system was to just
kind of keep it going sort of like the
Winchester mansion up in San Jose only
I'm not being haunted if you guys don't
know what that means then go check out
the Winchester mansion website it's kind
of interesting backstory but anyway we
are way off topic we're going to do a
little rationale real quick when it
comes to the system 59 60 X is
absolutely monstrous but it's actually
becoming the bottleneck now in my system
where depending on where my overclocks
are on the 59 60 X I'm getting some
massive swings on fps when it comes to
the benchmarks of the Titan axis in fact
going from 4.0 gigahertz to 4.5
gigahertz netted me over 25 frames per
second averages when it comes to
synthetic benchmarks which we all know
are not as demanding as actual games so
that was a bit of a mind-blower thinking
my 59 60 X is becoming the freaking
bottleneck what kind of world do we live
in where that happens I don't want to
live on this planet anymore I'm not
putting up any of the 3-way Titan X
benchmarks yet because I still a lot of
tweaking and tuning to do and by
tweaking obviously I mean settings
people I will say this though in this
part I found a little bit interesting
and I'll do a more in depth video of my
findings after this one 980
reference versus one Titan X was a huge
difference between the two however in a
threeway config it's much more narrow in
fact there it's very minimal gains over
my 980 s currently when it comes to
three-way so when we played around that
and seeing exactly what's going on but
card for card huge gap but in three-way
it's not as big as I thought it would be
that's what she said
but she loves me anyway so we'll
definitely be doing a little bit of
research and seeing what the heck is
going on there but when it comes to
another question I'm constantly asked is
am I going to do custom BIOS on these
Titan X's I think the answer is yes
they're just not going as far as I want
on the overclocks yeah I'm getting 1,400
and 80 megahertz out of these in 3-way
SLI but I want more power it's always a
risk in fact I've blown up a 780 if you
guys don't remember I actually killed a
780 by doing a BIOS flash my fault for
putting the wrong BIOS on the card but I
digress
now when it comes to the radiators
plenty of people ask me why I went with
thinner radiators and added a third
radiator in there well first of all when
it comes to and I'll do a video on this
as well when it comes to the length of
the radiator that matters more than the
thickness of the radiator way more you
could take a radiator that is 45
millimeters or 60 millimeters thick and
put it against the same sized radiator
that's only thirty millimeters thick and
you'll see very minimal differences but
you could take a radiator like a 120 in
compared to a 240 and see massive
differences on TDP and watts cooled and
displaced so that is why I did that I
went with a thinner 560 for better
airflow through the red and added a 280
to the GPU loop to keep things as cool
as possible these cards these Titan X's
are higher tbp higher wattage then the
980 s and the 980 s we're getting up
into the mid-50s on temperatures and I
wasn't happy with that yeah fantastic
temperatures but I wasn't happy with
seeing mid 50s on a 3-way SLI
water-cooled graphics cards I mean they
were doing so well on air in the 60s and
70s on air 50s was not very impressive
but I will say this even though I'm not
giving you guys numbers yet on the Titan
X three-way benchmarks I will give you
some preliminary numbers on temperatures
we're at stock speeds I was getting
mid-30s at load mid 20s at idle that's
already way cooler than my nine 80s
we're getting and at load while
overclocked I think the max temp I saw
so far was 44 degrees so that is a 10
degree drop on a
higher wattage card by adding a two
eighty and going with thinner heads I
think you guys will see the point I'm
going to get to with the radiator video
where I talk about that especially with
the summer temps coming up the other
thing I did in this system was I use the
exact same g.skill Ram of the ripped off
for but I went from 16 gigs to 32 gigs
unfortunately when dx12 launches I'm
still going to have more GPU memory than
I do CPU memory thirty six gigs versus
32 gigs but hey you know first world
problems I guess there was a lot of
questions too about why I changed up the
loop why I moved the pumps and all of
that and really it kind of comes down to
a few things one getting less components
out of the basement and up into the main
part of the case one gives me easier
access to pump control and speed and two
improves air flow down in the basement
part of the case the more junk I had
down there radiators and tubes and stuff
the more restriction there was for air
flow to get across the bottom of the
basement the bottom of this case is
completely segregated from the top so
the GPUs have their own air cooling
environment and the CPU has its own air
cooling environment and the two don't
cross contaminate each other
well except with a little bit of heat
that comes off the back plates of the
GPUs but you kind of see where I'm going
with that now putting the pumps up on
the top makes it one it fills in the
space a little bit more and two it just
makes it look better as far as I'm
concerned I love pump reservoir combo I
think it fills up the space nicely and
the reorientation of the tubes fills in
things really well in that case so it
looks less empty but doesn't look
cluttered so that was why I did it I
wanted to see more tubing I like to see
a lot of tubing I like a lot of busy
work going on in the cases when it comes
to water cooling so having that very
minimal barely any tube showing was
actually bothering me that bothered me
most about the system even more than
that stupid kink that showed up in the
tube after I had to move to the
different motherboard and didn't line up
perfectly so hey I like the way it looks
now and really that's what's most
important about this system is how I
feel about it but it is still a
community effort so a lot of the things
that you guys say about the system I do
take into consideration and I think the
overall result looks really really good
I worked on this thing for a solid week
I have worked my fingers absolutely raw
with constantly turning fittings and
screws and stuff even though I have a
power driver for screwdrivers and stuff
all the fitting cranking the fingerprint
reader on my iPhone won't even recognize
any of my fingers anymore so it's going
to take a few weeks for these to recover
but I do have more custom builds coming
I still have to finish the parvum build
finally got in the pieces I was waiting
for from England it took the United
States a month and a half to get it
through customs which was absolutely
stupid but anyway we're going to finish
the part of an build and we are going to
do full benchmarks on this thing in a
future video not too far in the future I
just want to get through some of the
tweaking of stuff I need to do on this
thing if you guys want to interact and
don't want to deal with the comments
that take place down below feel free to
follow on social media Facebook
Instagram and Twitter and as always
thanks for watching and making builds
like this possible in order to say thank
you i teased in a previous video that
i'm going to be doing something
involving one of my 9 80s in the very
near future we will be doing a giveaway
where I give away one of my 9 80s but
here's the thing you guys get to pick
which 980 you want with the exception of
the Hall of Fame card that card is
staying with me but you guys want one of
the water-cooled 980 s and you win you
say hey J I want a water-cooled 980 you
want my classified take it you want the
980 hybrid take it you get to pick as
the winner will be doing more details
about that in the future it as always
guys for now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
