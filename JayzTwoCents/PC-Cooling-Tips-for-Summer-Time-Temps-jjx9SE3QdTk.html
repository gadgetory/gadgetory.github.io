the pool barbecue is hanging out at the
beach and maybe watching your computer
overheat into a big blob of steaming
electronic poo I really hope that's not
happening to some of you guys but I
think it might be which is why we're
going to go ahead and do this series
this summer on how to keep your computer
nice and cool where I show you guys tips
and tricks on things that you can do to
really help improve the temperatures in
your computer some of it will be free
budget based some of it will actually
have some money involved so with that
said let's go ahead and move forward
with things I've done on my 908 try and
keep things cool
now believe it or not the nine hundred D
is actually a crap case when it comes to
airflow the airflow in this case is
horrible I mean you've got cross flow on
the bottom you've got hard drives
blocking all the air from the front and
the exhaust on the top is good got to go
through a thick panel of mesh filter so
it's just it is not airflow optimized on
the front of the case you've got this
little panel here which only gives you
about a half inch gap all the way around
and then a really restrictive filter on
the inside on the side right here
there's usually a magnetic filter which
I've removed which brings me to point
number one fan filters are not something
that have always been around and they're
not something I personally use in my
builds I would much rather trade off the
fact that I have to complete I have to
complain about my computer I could play
Mike about my computer all the time guys
I would much rather trade off the dust
and having to clean more often than
having reduced airflow and higher
temperatures fan filters bottom line
they reduced air flow as they get dirty
they reduce it even more which means
that the filters just stopped working
the dust goes right around the filters
they go right around the fans and they
come in through all the different vents
and things if you really want to control
the dust in your computer you need to go
with either positive or neutral pressure
in your case that's a whole different
video believe it or not you can control
the dust in your system without using
fan filters at all now as you can see
right here with my 900 d I don't have
the magnetic filter in here for the
bottom 480 millimeter radiator so I have
nothing but clean airflow making its way
into that bottom rad that's exactly what
I want but where the real restrictions
on this case came in were the front
panel right here as you can see when I
remove this panel and Bing and bing bang
it into my wall you only get that little
bit of gap you see those standoffs are
you get a little bit of gap around here
which is already very restrictive but as
you can see I have removed the little
snap-in filter altogether because this
restriction + that filter just meant you
couldn't even feel air coming in if you
put your hands right there and I even
have static pressure fans in the front
which are supposed to help overcome that
amount of restriction so I remove the
filters altogether in fact I even remove
the filters from the top of the
handle here by bending the tabs taking
the top piece and splitting it into
taking the filter out putting it back
and that really helped with the exhaust
pressure in fact unless you're using the
top as intake I don't understand why
there's a filter up there anyway so
remove the dust filters from your
machine and you'll be surprised how you
can actually reduce the temperatures in
your system my temperature came down by
nearly 5 degrees Celsius by removing
these filters that's a huge huge jump
now tech tip number two as simple as it
may seem get rid of the side panel I've
had to do this in the past I've had old
beige box machines where they had crappy
little 90 millimeter fan in the front
maybe an 80 millimeter exhaust fan and
just for flow now if that's the
case that you're in literally that's the
case you have if that's in your case get
it you get then remove the side panel
point a fan at your machine get like a
floor-standing fan or something and just
point it at your computer it'll look
ghetto but your computer will keep
running and that's the point what's the
point of having a computer that looks
nice but it's dying and it's killing
itself inside because you live in a
climate that's a hundred plus degrees
and you have no air conditioner
obviously if you have a case that has
fan placement you want to make sure you
have a fan in every single one of those
fan placements that may seem like a
no-brainer but there's a lot of you that
have just bought your cases and you just
kept whatever fans are in it you didn't
add any fans most cases have
expandability with fans that will allow
you to put fans everywhere in fact most
cases that only come with one intake
maybe 1 exhaust maybe one in the top but
you have room for maybe three in the top
maybe two or three in the front maybe
even one on the bottom if you get as
many fans in your cases you can you can
overcome the fact that you have
restrictions inside of your case when it
comes to airflow or you can just take
the side panel off like I said now
you'll notice I have a fan controller on
here and a common question that I get
asked is Jay it's getting hot
should I get a fan controller and if you
asked me that the answer to that is no
you don't want a fan controller if it's
really hot you want no fan controller
you just want to let those things scream
and run as loud and as fast as they can
because fan controllers have one purpose
only to control the speed of your fan
which means less than 100
sent maybe you could use it to allow it
to ramp the fan up and down based on
temperature but that's not the purpose
here we are talking about extreme
conditions that require extreme and
drastic measures in which case all of
your fans should be running at 100% if a
fan controller let them run just let
them be free let them go let them do
their job and move air now if you don't
have a fan controller don't install one
fan controllers for me are keeping
things quiet and silent in the
wintertime summertime not necessary
whatsoever so if you've also got those
little voltage adapters on there that
reduce the voltage to your fans pull
those out during the summer time you'll
be doing yourself a huge favor now those
are just three free things that I
recommend doing immediately when it
comes to keeping your computer nice and
cool another thing I recommend get your
computer up out from under your desk get
it up into a nice ventilated space like
this that will help with the cooling as
well not creating a heating cabinet that
it's sitting in that's another point if
you've got your computer sitting inside
one of those sliding cabinets you've got
to get it out of there that is just
horrible for airflow now the next point
I'm going to talk about is something
that is quite often overlooked your
computer can only get as cool as the
room that it's in so if you're doing a
lot of gaming you're doing a lot of
rendering and you've got the door shut
in a small room and no airflow in the
room the case can only get as cool as
the room will allow so you've got to
ventilate the room that you're in you've
got to allow the hot air that the case
is creating to get out of your room so
open a window put a box fan in the
window open your door get some cross
flow you've got I know I know you guys
want the door shut so you can watch your
pornography and peace and stuff but guys
you have to get the air flow in the room
and proved as well like I mentioned you
guys really overlook that because
otherwise your case is going to be
sitting it's going to be sitting in a
static room that's just going to keep
getting hotter and hotter and hotter
which is going to allow the case to get
hotter and hotter and hotter as it
recycles that air from the environment
and it's just going to eventually get to
the point to where everything is hot
you're sticking to your chair and
nobody's happy in fact you know I've
been trying to do some gaming with
coconut monkey and one of the things he
even said to me the other day was I'm
not going to turn on the computer it's
too hot to play games so you know this
is the type of stuff that I know a lot
of you are dealing with now if you have
a little bit of money you can consider
beefing up your CPU cooler if you are
using the stock heatsink that came with
either AMD or Intel that's not worth the
metal but it was actually constructed
out of those things our garbage go and
get yourself now this is a hi this is a
TPC 612 go get yourself like a hyper 212
for less than 30 bucks and they're
amazing coolers if you've got a little
more money to spend in the forty five
dollar range cooler masters TPC 612 is a
vapor chamber cooler that actually
improves the cooling of the heatsink by
adding two vapor chambers in there on
top of the heat pipes giving you even
better cooling because of the vapor
conductivity of heat and we'll talk
about that in another video now there is
one other thing that you could consider
doing and that would be going with
something like this guy right here it's
actually kind of heavy is a full custom
water cooling kit in a box so well we'll
do a review on this in the future and
this is obviously a bit extreme but
sometimes water cooling is just what you
got to do if you live in a super hot
environment just to get adequate or
reasonable temperatures so it's
something that you may want to save for
and consider I mean kits like this
they take a lot of the guesswork out of
it they've got these are all custom loop
parts they're just already picked and
put in a box for you so you can save a
lot of time and you know you didn't
leave anything out mean it's got the CPU
block the radiator the reservoir the
fluid the fittings the tube the pump and
even the little jumper you need to start
your power supply unit for when you're
doing your bleeding now I'm actually
going to be installing this thing in
coconut monkeys 6 core 12 thread Intel
CPU and so we'll see how well this thing
performs in a future video now of course
this video wouldn't be complete if I
didn't do some sort of selfless
self-promoting so if you guys are
interested in getting an all one cooler
or a heat sink or anything really from
Coolermaster looked at in the
description you will see a link to the
CM store with a 10% off coupon code
using J's 2k14 code and if you guys want
to buy something from aqua tuning to
keep your computer nice and cool they do
pretty much serve the entire globe when
it comes to availability so chances are
if you live in an area where you don't
have stores available that sell these
things you can get it shipped to you
from aqua tuning just about anywhere in
the world in fact I even do have a five
percent off coupon code good for
anything in the store no minimum
purchase that link is also down in the
description head on
there if you're interested and pick it
up some water cooling or any sort of
custom PC gear also down the description
you guys will find a link to my Amazon
affiliate code it really helps the
channel it really helps keep things
running it doesn't cost you guys
anything to use those links but it does
give the channel a little kick back
which allows me to keep bringing you
guys content that you guys hopefully
really enjoy so now that I'm done
selflessly promoting all of my links
down the description follow on some
social media made Facebook Facebook's
not your thing Twitter Twitter's not
your thing well just keep watching the
videos and as always guys I will see you
in the next one if we haven't all melted
into big giant piles of blobby steamy
goo hope if not you see in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
