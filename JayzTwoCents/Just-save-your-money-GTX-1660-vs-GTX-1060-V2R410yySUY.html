launch we've got ourselves one of them
custom fandangled special edition cards
that come with all the bells and
whistles and we've also got ourselves an
MSRP card which is right here on the
actual test bench so in terms of pricing
there's obvious a little bit of a
differential here we'll talk about that
whether or not the extra horsepower
features are worth it and then we're
also going to talk about the extremely
crowded product stack that has kind of
been Nvidia as forte for the last
several years EVGA offers a full range
of components including video cards
motherboards power supplies cases and
peripherals regardless of your needs
EVGA sure to have you covered to see
what EVGA can do for your next build
head to EVGA comm so the last time we
took a look at a whole new family of
graphics cards was obviously the Pascal
and there was a card that was sort of
slid in the mix there because of some
competition that was taking place
between AMD and NVIDIA especially with
the Polaris cards their heights of
popularity of the rx 480 and then the
575 80 and then the 590 which came out
late last year the let's talk about the
Nvidia stack so it basically went 1050
if you don't count the GT 1030 which a
lot of people argue it's a gaming card
you can game on that besides the point
the GTX 1050 we had the 1050 Ti we had
the 1063 gig the 1066 gig and then we
had of course a 1070 1070 TI 1080 1080
Ti and then the Titan X and so we've
kind of those other cards like the 1070
TI that slid in the stack because of the
RX Vega or the Vega 56 and then you had
the 1060 3G slid in there because of
what the rx 560 and 570 were doing at
that price point and so they made like
the stopgap cards we're in the lower end
from entry-level to mid range you kind
of had a card like every 50 dollars
which made it extremely difficult to
choose especially for a newbie who's
looking at specs and going well which
one do I get there's a lot of cards that
occupy this price point now in the past
that existed because Nvidia was sort of
adding cards to the family later on
whereas what's making turning
interesting is they're launching it this
way so for instance we
now got a 1660 and a 1660 TI
so the 1660 is designed to compete
directly with the 1063 3 gig not to be
confused with the 1066 gig because
although they use the same name 1060
there was no TI or anything like that
just 1060 1063 gig 6 gig they were there
was a lot of complaint from people like
myself and the community as a whole
because it was misleading in that it
wasn't a truly a 1060 because I had
shaved sm that had shaved cuda cores and
had less memory making it truly an
entirely different card well at least
this time they've sort of changed the
name up slightly with the TI and non TI
version all right so the 1063 gig is
kind of what we're comparing here to the
1616 on TI so we have 9 s ms found in
the 1060 vs. 22 in the 1660s so that's
obviously a huge jump a lot more cuda
cores as well so 1152 in the 1063 gig
versus the 1408 found in the 1660 so we
have more sm which we have more cuda
cores the base clock is improved as well
so we have 1506 versus a 1530 and 1708
versus a 1785 now if we compare the 1660
to the TI it's only slightly shave so
there's two less SMS at 22 versus 24
there's not that many less cuda cores as
1408 versus 1536 so obviously it's much
closer to the 1660 ati in terms of what
shaved versus the 10 63 gig so you're
gonna see obviously a huge jump there
we're not gonna go through all the specs
but it is obviously a very big jump
versus the 10 63 gig now with that also
is a little bit increased price because
the 1060 3g also came in at under $200
when it launched so you are getting a
lot more for your money but that kind of
leads us into the argument of value
which can be a little bit convoluted
now although Nvidia is comparing this
card to the 1063 gig we're gonna do
things a little bit differently here
we're gonna kind of talk about 2019
pricing and where it stacks up today
with the current price model it's
obvious that this is gonna be an
improvement and an upgrade for anyone
running a 1063 gig or older a 9 series 7
series or whatever the older the card is
obviously the better value this is
be in terms of improvement but the
discussion comes whether or not you
should buy this card or save a little
more or whatever so let's go ahead and
take a look at the benchmarks when we
compared it to the 1660 ti so you can
see how far it trails and we're going to
compare it to the 1066 gig because the
three gigs a card that should have never
existed and no one should have ever
bought in the first place
so as you would expect it obviously
performs extremely well at its price
point and it's I mean we looked at a
couple of benchmarks above the old 3G
testings we didn't go through and retest
a 1060 3G like I said we were more
interested how it compares to a 1066 gig
and it's better than a 1066 gig which
obviously shows you if this is closer to
a 1066 gig then the 1660 Ti was
obviously that much farther ahead so
it's an amazing card given its price
point but if you look at the launch
pricing between like the 1063 G and the
1066 Jeep it's obviously slid up a few
bucks and that's kind of been the trend
lately and that's what's made a lot of
people upset but we have reached a point
where we can get nearly a hundred FPS
and a lot of titles with a card at the
$219 price point now this particular
card the MSI gaming X the 1660 gaming X
comes in at 249 dollars that is $30 less
than the 1660 ti or the EVGA version
which looks absolutely identical in
every single aspect of this card is
identical to the ti version is two
hundred and nineteen dollars and ninety
nine cents versus 249 so it's $30 less
than this one so it's like a jump of 30
and then another jump of 30 so the
problem here now it's when we had cards
that occupied this $50 range in the past
now we've kind of had these cards
squeezing together in the $30 spectrum
with cards in between because EVGA also
has a two hundred and $29 and a $239
model and obviously MSI has its lower
models and stuff but we did this because
we wanted to see kind of how the custom
card well they're all custom actually
there's no Founders edition card with
either of these same with the TI version
this card here gives you obviously a
nice brushed metal backplate there's no
backplate found on the EVGA card this is
a dual slot dual fan where that's a
single fan triple slot similar to the ti
actually identical to that like I said
you have to start asking yourself is it
worth having some of the extra shiny
bits or the couple of FPS faster now I'm
the kind of person that was subscribed
to I would rather have the founders
reference MSRP card and overclock that
because as we found with our
overclocking of the 1660 ti if you guys
haven't seen that go and check it out we
were able to surpass even
six card with just a little bit of an
overclock because the cooler was clearly
able to handle it so this was only a
couple of FPS faster in the test not
$30.00 faster if that makes sense if you
take the performance increase of this
and the price prefer a percentage
difference here obviously it was a poor
value in terms of an MSRP card that's
why you have to ask yourself what is it
you want not a lot of people want a
triple slot card like this so there's a
lot of different options out there you
just have to shop around and see which
are worth it that brings us to the next
question
should we just save the 30 bucks add it
to this card and then buy a 16-6 CTI the
answer with NBS but as we found out the
1660 tea I should we just take another
$40 or $50 save it and by 2060 and the
answer is yes but at that point now
you're almost $100 more than the MSRP
card here but another way you can look
at the financial aspect of this is if
you're building and if you're buying
just a graphics card you want 30 extra
bucks in your pocket then you can do
that but if you're building a system and
you've got to stretch your money as far
as you can go and you've got a hard cap
you've got a hard limit you can't
stretch that ceiling that is what it is
you know I'm an extra dollar to your
name then the 30 bucks you save on going
to the MSRP model could mean the
difference of getting a better component
somewhere else maybe a little bit better
memory maybe a little bit better speed
memory possibly even adding an SSD like
we use the you know the inland SSD which
is the jury's still out on whether or
not that's long-term you know friendly
but it was one of those things where
we've been using it and we did some
testing and everything was great with it
and so it's one of those things where
you can potentially shuffle money around
in the budget and the money you save
here could go somewhere else and give
you a better overall build I can tell
you when it comes to my methodology in
the way I shop in my mentality of that
as I usually just go for the MSRP cards
anyway as long as they they are not
taking away features that I need for
instance if it was a crappy cooler and
the card ran way too hot and was way too
noisy then maybe the extra dollars would
be worth the acoustics and the
temperature difference I can tell you
right now neither of these cards make
any noise whatsoever under testing
typically you could touch a back plate
or the back of the bear pair bare PCB
while a test is running and feel like
you're nearly burning yourself neither
was the case of either of these cards
because their coolers are extremely
robust versus the amount of TDP
heat these cards are generating because
the Turing architecture although smaller
a smaller process is not that hot once
there's only 1500 or so CUDA cores in
there versus the 4,000 some odd found in
the higher cards so cooling and
acoustics are typically not gonna be a
problem on either of these cards even if
you're overclocking them on the factory
fan curve both these cards set in the
low-60s and temperatures
I mean it's there's nothing to really
talk about in terms of comparison the
cooler didn't make a difference on
either of these cards just the BIOS in
them boost the MSI card just a few
megahertz higher which is what get us
one or two fps increase so at the end of
the day yes it is way faster than the 3G
and even still marginally faster than
the sixth gig and meaning you may not
need to upgrade if you're running a 1066
gig this wouldn't necessarily be the
card for you the TI would and they had
to determine whether or not that extra
pricing is worth it for you but in some
titles this base model 1660 was even
matching and beating our 980 classified
when we just kind of looked at our
charts for the heck of it so anyway you
guys sound off in the comments below we
had this discussion in our previous
video with the TI and I'm curious as to
how you guys look at this would you
rather save a few extra bucks and one
extra paycheck or whatever you have to
do to get the next tier up in the same
family what I mean by that is would you
rather get a custom card versus the MSRP
or would you rather save the money and
get the next step up entirely when it
comes to it the next tier graphics card
I think there's a lot of differing
opinions on this and some people make
valid points on both sides of the fence
so I'd love to hear you guys as opinion
on that or you can just head on over to
Twitter and tweet it at me as well and
we'll talk about it there so thanks for
watching guys and as always we will see
you in the next one or the next graphics
card video probably a 10 50 TI or 15 50
TI I don't whatever whatever
I don't want tax Docs today I'm happy
today and there's a note so cover me
looking at my phone would be rolled that
way that way
you know that way I seem smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
