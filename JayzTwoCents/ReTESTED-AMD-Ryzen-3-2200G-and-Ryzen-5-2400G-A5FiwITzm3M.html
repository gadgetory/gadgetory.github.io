promised i would revisit our video about
the risin 2200 g and 2400 g if you
recall in that video which i'll pop out
right here you guys can go and check it
out we had some issues unfortunately
with our review samples that were sent
to us sort of kind of reviewing some of
the concepts that were sent cherry-pick
samples but I digress that's besides the
point we experienced some issues with
that we were not getting optimal results
but we've got new CPUs new motherboards
everything is fresh and we're actually
seeing some really promising results
making me excited for what could
possibly be 2018 the year of the budget
gamer so we're to go ahead and talk
about that maybe some of the growing
pains with it and whether or not this is
a platform you should even consider
today's video is sponsored by
audible.com slash J's two cents and I
just finished listening to the power of
habit giving me better habit choices in
2018 I'm easily distracted so I need
habits habits to keep me on track so

just text J's two cents to 500 500 so
the issue we had in the previous video
was that our MSI motherboard which was
officially supported with the new rise
end 2000 series APU is was the fact that
it was not it wouldn't allow us a game
it just kept going into a black screen
and no matter what we did and BIOS
updates and stuff the problem persisted
so we got a whole new round of hardware
to test out this time we're using a
gigabyte motherboard specifically the be
350 end gaming Wi-Fi which is kind of
neat built in Wi-Fi but yeah the results
were actually really promising so here's
the testing methodology that I used
we will then show you the results and
we'll talk about some of the growing
pains though about this platform that
you definitely need to be aware of when
it comes to being an early adopter so
testing methodology is this I pretty
much used the same basic benchmarks that
have built in a
yes counters that I do when we do our
graphics cards reviews and I use titles
that are still fairly demanding even for
something like an APU because I kind of
want to give you guys what the worst
case scenario is if I show you a number
and you build it and it's better that's
better than me showing you like these
best-case scenarios where you get it
performs lesser than I'm showing you and
then I look like you know I lied to you
guys and that's not what I want
obviously for any of you guys to feel so
I used rise of the Tomb Raider still
fairly demanding metro 33 still highly
demanding a couple synthetics like time
spy and fire strike just so you guys can
install those which are I think they're
still free and you guys can compare your
results at home and then I did a
Cinnabon run only because Cinebench is
still a very good benchmark that you can
download for free and compare it to your
particular CPUs and see a a whole list
of other CPUs to see where it stacks up
I'm gonna tell you right now spoiler
alert the 2400 G is performing
exceptionally well and something like
Cinebench but that said it's going to
show you guys the benchmarks
so as you guys can see compared to the
first results the overclock numbers and
stuff not that far off from what we
experienced with the less optimised BIOS
that we were dealing with my previous
video but was obvious though were the
average FPS on the stock settings were
significantly higher than our previous
tests when we just plugged it all in but
you know it's not surprisingly the 2200
G and the 2400 G in terms of GPU are
very very close both in base and
overclock settings now the reason for
that is there's only a few extra texture
units I mean these are very these are
very shaved down Vega units and I think
where some people's disappointment with
this and this is obviously a very small
group but I'm gonna speak to this group
for a second the the group that heard
Vega and was thinking that you were
gonna get Vega 56 or God willing Vega 64
performance inside the CPU that's
obviously not going to happen what it is
it's the same Vega core architecture
it's obviously not 3d stacked Ram it's
using system Ram and so that Ram
communication is also a bit slower than
something on board like a discrete
discrete graphics card but the fact that
they have pulled out performance like
this inside of a 65 watt chip is nothing
short of amazing I mean Intel could is
not gonna be able to come up with
something like this which is why AMD and
Intel have teamed up for the AP use on
mobile
I mean Intel knew you go to the guys
that are better at this if in team up to
get a better product and that's what
they've done now let's talk about some
of the early adopters things that I
think that you should be concerned with
so when I first put this together we got
no video I was like oh no what are we
doing I don't do this again I want to
deal with all these problems I want this
to work
but then a restart it works just fine
and what I've learned with this
particular motherboard and obviously
this is gonna vary based on manufacturer
every MSI asus gigabyte asrock they all
have different BIOS and different
approaches to the you know the built-in
operating system but anytime you change
anything on this you plug in a graphics
card you plug in a hard drive you unplug
a hard drive the first boot is always a
black screen with no video simply power
cycling the PSU off and back on
suddenly it works so you guys might have
noticed there were only two tests that I
did with each one of these benchmarks
instead of three like the previous video
because the previous video I had stock
just we built it we ran it didn't touch
anything we had the video are two
gigabytes of video RAM technically not
vram it says video allocated Ram from
the system Ram and then we had our
overclock settings now the reason why
you don't see the 2g and this one is
because the first test defaulted to 512
megabytes of video memory obviously not
enough for gaming and pretty much any
title short of minesweeper but this time
around it defaulted to the two gigabytes
automatically with the exception of the
2400 G the first time I booted it it
went to one gigabyte and then when I
restarted it later went to 2 gigabytes
so back to some of that early adopter
stuff I was talking about that this is
things you need to be aware of but I'm
telling you right now it performs very
very well these settings were all 1080p
medium but if you're running 1080p low
or even a game like dirt rally it just
hammers dirt rally dirt rallies FPS is
super smooth super consistent absolutely
playable as with most racing simulators
that don't require a lot of GPU
performance but don't forget the 2200 G
in the 2400 G running almost identical
GPUs but $100 CPU slash GPU combo an APU
obviously was giving you the ability to
play games in this market in 2018 which
is actually the discussion point here
you could throw a GPU into this
obviously when to do that today because
I'm focusing on the APU performance but
you throw a GPU into this you do get
much improved performance now these are
not quite as stout as their full rise
end brethren because they don't have as
many PCIe lanes and there's some other
factors there on the engineering side I
don't want to delve into yet until we do
our GPU testing to see matching Rison
versus our APU do we lose performance
when we go to a GPU versus one or the
other because the idea here is this is a
stepping stone to build your PC you can
build it now you could play your games
add a graphics card later if you find a
good use price or the market comes down
you know hopefully but it's a very good
entry point into gaming but something
else worth mentioning though if you run
out right now and you buy this
APU which is sitting on the shelf at
Fry's at micro center Newegg or whatever
and you just grab any be 350 or even any
a.m. for socketed motherboard it's not
guaranteed to work because you've got to
remember these just came out
but inventory with motherboards have
been on shelves for over a year so if
you grab a motherboard that has not been
updated or has the ready for a and B
Rison APU stickers that's on there
there's a sticker that's gonna be on the
boards that are ready to go with the new
CPU you're not going to be able to boot
your system because the motherboards
have been sitting on shelves prior to
this apu launching are not going to know
how to communicate with it so that's
something to keep in mind and I asked
AMD specifically I said well how are you
guys planning to actually make customers
aware that if you buy a motherboard
that's been at micro Center for two
months and suddenly the by the CPU
paired with it it's not going to boot
when I did my first test I had to use I
had to actually use a different Rison
chip and a GPU to update the BIOS just
to do my test so I was kind of like how
was the customer supposed to do this if
they're building a new system so it will
be denoted at least with a special
sticker on the boxes of the board's that
are being sent that are ready for this
APU so look for that that's important or
ask your salesman hopefully they'll know
but that's something you need to be more
aware of if you're building the system
from scratch at the end of the day guys
it's a hundred dollar CPU and 129 dollar
CPU it's not gonna be groundbreaking as
I'm the earth shattering it's not gonna
be discrete GPU like 1080 performance
but the point is you could build a whole
system play games on for less than the
price of one gtx 1070 today we're
talking memory CPU motherboard hard
drive and power supply everything I'm
sitting right here on this desk - a case
is what you're seeing right here and you
can have all that for under 500 bucks I
don't know how you can complain with
that hey guys I'm gonna go we will
follow up one more video on this I
promise I'm not trying to stretch this
out and get all of you know all of the
views on this but it's a hot topic and
we want to try and cover it as focused
as possible so instead of cramming it
all into one video we're kind of
diversifying this and the next test will
be what happens when we put a discrete
GPU in there and where does the
bottleneck form we want to see what
happens if we start at the bottom like
an Rx or an R 5 r 7 whatever for 60 all
the way up to like a Titan XP and see
what happens I don't think anyone's
gonna put a Titan XP and $100 CPU but we
can test it so we will anyway guys we're
gonna go thanks for watching and as
always we will see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
