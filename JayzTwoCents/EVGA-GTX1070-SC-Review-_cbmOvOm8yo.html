here and today we're going to do another
graphics card review and today we're
going to be looking at the EVGA gtx 1070
Super clock a CX 3.0 and the only reason
why they stopped there with the name is
because they didn't have any more room
on the box to come up with a longer
title but yeah this video should really
be no surprise because you guys know I
love my graphics cards as much as as
white girls love Starbucks
the mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro
from coolermaster combines modularity
with creativity giving you the freedom
to build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description
now this video should be pretty quick
and easy to do considering the
superclocked version of the graphics
card is no different than the 1080
whereas it is a reference slash founders
PCB with their own custom cooling
solution on here the HDX 3.0 in this
case but in the history of EVGA graphics
cards it's pretty much held true with
the SC version is always like the
reference style board so it means you
could do stuff like custom waterblock on
here if you wanted to water cool it in
fact it even uses the same block as a
GTX 1080 because it is the exact same
PCB therefore yeah there's a lot of
parts are going to be interchangeable in
fact the only difference between this
card in terms of aesthetics and the 1080
is this one says 70 on it but the clock
speeds are not the same as founders as
that this one is a base clock of 1594 it
has got a boost clock of 1794
but in my testing here it actually
boosted all the way up to eighteen
hundred and eighty six megahertz so
obviously went farther than that taking
advantage of the additional cooling on
here allowing GPU boost to push the
clock even farther
just like the 1080 it retains the single
eight pin power connector on here and it
is a single BIOS card so it is like I
said a founder is pretty much on the way
that it is constructed it follows that
exact blueprint that sent over by Nvidia
but some of the additional features that
you'll find on here just like I'm gonna
keep referencing the GTX 1080 it's
literally the exact same cooler that
they launched on the SC over there where
it's got these aluminum accents on there
it's got white LED lighting along the
top right here that says EVGA geforce
gtx 1070 it also has leds white leds on
the front of the card that light up kind
of giving a little bit of a glow effect
because when it's in your cases pointed
down like this
it does kind of light up a little bit
underneath it this is all you're really
going to see right here once it's
mounted in your case the backplate on
the back is made out of aluminum it's a
brushed aluminum it's going to pick up
all your fingerprints if you touch it a
lot which is why it kind of looks finger
printing right now all over here one
thing i find kind of kind of interesting
is they've made the etching here for the
logo face the right way when it's in
your case and the EVGA cut out here
faces the right women it's in your case
it's not upside down but unfortunately
the the sticker they place on here for
like serial number and all that stuff is
unfortunately upside down
so if you needed to look at that for
some reason you can happen to be
contorting your neck a little bit or
take the card out in terms of cooling it
does a fantastic job now the founders
edition cards with the founders cooler
on there the 1070 did a lot better than
the 1080 staying very very low and by
low I mean upper 70s for a founders card
that's actually really good with a
blower style cooler because the 1070
just with it without having less cuda
cores that are actually activated it
generates a little bit less heat in
there same thing holds true for the 1070
here with the AC X 3.0 it's got two ball
bearing fans on here that are very very
quiet and they're a sweat blade which is
something they started with a CX 2.0
where it actually spins the blade kind
of backwards so that it's more or less
swooping the air and pushing it down
rather than scooping the air and pushing
it down which makes their be a little
bit less choppiness to the sound of the
cooler and we'll do a little clip of
that so you guys can hear it it's why
one of the reasons why I got the new mic
so we can test the way the cooler sounds
listen to the fans as well as coil
whines we'll be covering that in this
video right here but it's a fairly low
decibel quiet cooler that keeps the GPU
very very cool and that's also because
it has a whole bunch of fins and heat
pipes which is obviously kind of the
norm now when it comes to coolers same
basic output layout DVID HDMI 2.0 and
then three DisplayPort one point force
so you guys are going to have plenty of
connectivity to things like HD TVs UHD
TVs 4k TVs 4k monitors plenty of this
blade ports you can run plenty of
monitors off this guy and it's actually
got enough power to be able to do even a
basic like 1080 surround setup if you
guys were interested in doing that but
with all that said let's go ahead and
jump right into the benchmark so you
guys can see how it performs and then
we'll go ahead and do our sound tests
and come back with some final thoughts
on this guy right here
so this is the idol test you can see I
have my microphone placed right here
above the card and yeah it makes zero
noise obviously because the fans aren't
running so that's a good idea of ambient
so you can see how ambient sound is okay
so now we are starting up the heaven
benchmark on 14:40 we're going to let it
loop and we're going to listen for fan
noise and for coil wine so the heaven
benchmark is running right now at 1440p
and the temperature is currently at 69 c
and the fans are running about 25% fan
speed and this is the noise level
so the EVGA GTX 1070 superclocked a CX
3.0 I'm always going to say the whole
name just because it cracks me up how
long the names of some of these cards
are you saw the benchmarks and as you
can see at stock clocks and the way it
boosts out of the box the founder's 1070
was like right there with the 980 TI and
you know in between 980 TI and titan x
this guy well behind 980 TI and right
there with tight necks in the moment you
overclock it and i was able to achieve
20 169 megahertz stable on this card at
stock voltage yeah it pushed itself well
beyond the tight necks at obviously a
much lower price point thinking that
maybe I got a golden lottery sample
which made kind of rare lately with this
actually have a second 1070 right here
SC and this one was able to achieve 20
139 megahertz so still achieved magic
2100 mark on both of these cards with no
problem whatsoever the reason why I have
two is I also want to do some SLI
benchmarks and we'll talk about that as
well in another video but overclocking
on both of these cards was a lot better
than I actually thought it was going to
be especially since my founders card
really didn't push all that far I mean I
went far but not as far as these guys
and these are still founders boards so
that's that's actually a really good
thing just see how far that these went
because the cooling could keep these in
check to the frequencies didn't
fluctuate nearly as much as I they do on
the 1080 so that's a good thing
but what we're going to do right now is
I'm going to go ahead and put on my
subjective pants if I actually wore
pants I'm not wearing pants right now
but that's why I only do from here up I
can be completely butt-naked from the
bottom down the mental image I just put
in all of your guys's eyes I'm sorry
at least you want to see it I do but I
want to talk about pricing real quick
because pricing right now is jacked up
and what I mean by that Nvidia really
kind of screwed things up by doing a
dual tiered pricing plan where they want
to charge a certain amount of money for
their card and they do an MSRP for
everyone else and the problem is no one
is doing MSRP pricing on any of their
cards that has any sort of custom touch
to it what I mean by that is a
ix 3.0 and to better cooler than
founders it does a better job it's
quieter and it gives you better
overclocking Headroom and even better
GPU boost Headroom because it can keep
the card cool the problem with that is
it's four hundred and thirty nine
dollars and ninety nine cents right now
not three hundred and seventy nine
dollars or anywhere near that which is
what people were really hoping to see
the ten seventy come out for because
that's a lot more affordable to many
many people obviously if you think you
have a better product you don't want to
charge less for the product that you
think it's better than if that makes
sense it's better therefore you charge
more now obviously when it comes to
business 101 and supply and demand if a
company can charge something and people
will pay it therefore the pricing makes
sense but so it's up to you to determine
whether or not four hundred and thirty
nine dollars first card is too much for
you I can't answer that for you
everyone's budget is different
everyone's everyone's needs are
different
everyone's willingness to pay a certain
amount is different so you have to
determine that for yourself but I would
like to see a gtx 1070 that exists
around three hundred and seventy nine
dollars and that's the card i would
really like to get my hands on but right
now that doesn't exist anyway guys hope
you've enjoyed today's video hope you
guys enjoyed the benchmarks not a whole
lot to talk about with this one it's
very very similar to the 1080 it's a
founders card custom a CX 3.0 LED
lighting for the wind models and up have
RGB lighting in there that you can play
with but overclocks like a beast both of
them do and i'll be doing some sli
videos coming up here in the future just
kind of see how it does why not
and yeah anyway with that say guys i'm
linking on out of here thanks for
watching i'm gonna go buy a vibe right
now micro center near me has them in
stock I'm actually gonna go get one I'm
it's time I did buy because every time I
do it I have fun and I don't get sick
and I'm VR sensitive and I don't get
sick with it so I don't know in project
cars with vibe sounds like a whole lot
of fun alright guys time to go thanks
for watching get this video like if you
like to give it dislike if you just
don't like me or the content or the
graphics card or you have hemorrhoids I
don't know hey this like if you find a
reason to and if you happen some across
this channel to subscribe button is
sitting there waiting for you to click
it if you click it money and balloons
will fall from the ceiling
not really but maybe who knows alright
guys I'm gonna get out of here that was
a stupid joke as always I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
