got a little helper here today we are
gonna be kind of overhauling my VR slash
home theater system that we built last

here I recently went through a series of
failed corrupted updates that I actually
got fixed yesterday but I didn't make a
video about it took me a while it took

description below
ok safety is important so we have to
thats wrong way lefty-loosey
righty-tighty that's what looks like
inside there that's actually more than I
thought I was like where's my RAM it's a
77 40 X which is where they took a 77 or
77 40 X is a 7700 K that they squeezed
into the X $2.99 platform it only has
dual channel memory so that's why I said
I might actually upgrade this cooler
today or the system today by dropping in
the 7800 X or whatever it is up there
that was an insult machine but yeah I
forgot I made this system just out of
spite what I mean add a spite that means
will you do something because someone
said not to like you do for me all the
time yeah so I thought we got to blow
out the dust
you have the poofy hissed hair first put
yourself together kid I think I forgot
how good of a job I did on this man all
right pat my back here because thank you
glad somebody appreciates me around here
so we are going to take these fans off
the only thing I'm not a huge fan of
haha is the fact that what I have the
dad jokes have to be real today though
they I'm not fan of again but this case
is the fact that the filters are not
removable Oh I wired it in there are
times where how crazy I am
regarding wire management comes back to
bite me this would be one of those times
so this spot right here was never
actually intended to hold a radiator as
it was supposed to just be for an
exhaust fan so a fan fits in there just
fine the problem is you have the extra
thickness of the rad you know the end
tanks on here and you can kind of see
what was hidden right there was some
damage right there on the radiator when
we first tried to install it so this
actually gave us the spacing we needed
to move it past this hinge because the
hindereth there is where it was actually
hitting I got you still snorting and
sniffling over there it's like someone
blew a whole bunch of air in your face
huh I didn't do it the blower did it
most home theater pcs are considered to
be silent optimized right so it doesn't
interfere with your with your music or
your movies and stuff to be honest this
never plays movies it this all this does
is play VR and stuff and I was debating
right now actually putting in one of my
micro my EVGA microbes because the Micro
X 299 or micro ATX I think gives me
clearance to be able to actually run my
slot drive and I do have a blu-ray slot
drive leave it or not the Xbox blu-ray
player is actually better than the one
built in this is that the white xbox a
you
you're not supposed to stay that on the
internet everyone knows I'm a PC gamer
guy I'm the boss here I hate this cooler
is anyone elses under boobs sweating in
here because mine is no higher no higher
no I carried that I'm holding it got it
do you think it's how open-heart surgery
goes so here's the 16 gigabytes of
g.skill tridents the memory that was
already in there here's the other half
of the kit that we stole it from so not
only are we getting a CPU upgrade to a
78 I think it's a 7800 or 780 20 so I
came here with the actual number it's
the 8 core but we also are gonna be
having to remove the motherboard because
I forgot there's no way you can actually
screw it back down with the cooler in
the way so you are gonna unscrew these
so undo that motherboard screw right
there that one I think I worked the way
around and get all of them so I could
take the motherboard out there we go
so the asrock killer motherboards are I
think better for the X 299 series and
they were on the previous because
previously had all the red and all the
ugly theme on there if you know if
fatality is it was actually one of the
first professionally paid gamers back in
like the 90s and his name is what's on
this series but yeah I like the way this
looks with the gunmetal and stuff I bet
you can't see it so I'm doing this
because not that I don't have faith that
my daughter could do this I just it
could be potentially very expensive
mistake if she bends pins on me so I'm
gonna go ahead and do this one myself
doesn't mean I'm any less likely to do
it but at least I would be ok with me
doing it then her being upset that she
did it so hopefully that make sense and
now we had just that easily doubled the
amount of cores and threads and we have
a 77 40 X that was the most useless CPU
that ever made that's now gonna probably
sit in the box forever
hey that's a lot sharp I'm gonna hold my
hand I do pittypat me alright we're
ready to put this back in now okay
you're gonna set this motherboard in for
me okay so don't just flop it in there
you can actually hold it by the cooler
then your hand will fit yeah you can
grab it by the cooler there you go use
it like a handle there you go yeah
that's easy isn't it where'd you put the
screws okay I took those screws tonight
so yeah those ones those ones is not
proper grammar well you are ready for
YouTube comments then one of the reasons
why I'm doing all this to be honest is
the temperatures on the CPU were getting
a little warmer that warmer than I
wanted them to and a lot of that is just
simply because we're dealing with a
confined space we've got not a lot of
space between the top of the fan and the
top of the case those pipes are not bent
perfectly straight oh well and so what's
happening here is it's just this is all
getting pushed down and we only have
this one 120 exhaust so I have to up the
CFM by upping the RPM this system mostly
is just used for my simulator rig where
I have an H M D on my head anyway in
headphones who cares how loud it is to
be honest
got it so this is why these little tabs
are here see put these in and then you
bend them back the problem is if you
bend them too many times they break off
and that's why you were sitting there
bending it back and forth unlike
sturdiness keep dating myself I couldn't
member why we did that until I realized
it impacts on the eight pin plug on the
a pin EPS because I keep then I can't
get the fan all the way all the way down
so I had chopped it so that it would
then just slide in there and not impact
what I'm thinking about doing right now
is just cutting off these tabs on the
eight pin so if you can see how much
clearance I'll get if I snap those off
knowing my luck I probably snap them
often and we'll still here
now we're modified okay moment of truth
did this fit now alright
GQ time there we go easy
it's RGB that makes it colorful do you
want RGB flashing lights all over your
computer so if you are the kind of
person that built an RGB themed build
and you have the same mindset of as a
nine year old girl
nothing wrong with that can I have the
color-changing
you mean the very expensive RGB g.skill
ddr4 ram we already have a 1080i I don't
see why not
so one of the things that this thing was
doing during its update that borked was
as soon as it would go to the login
screen it was just black screen video
was dead
you guys probably saw a video go up
recently where we talked about how to
deal with blue screens of death and boot
loops and stuff and so yeah we're good
to go so we're done here basically this
video of me having to get something done
and decide to make a video about it and
took Little J to work with me because
she goes back to school next week
Mondays yes although I'm not home when
you're gone so was it matter I'll come
home to a happy your mommy though
because you drive her insane all right
guys we're gonna go thanks for hanging
out with us while I upgraded this
extremely ridiculous home theater VR
machine now with eight cores and sixteen
threads and 32 gigs of ram and a
water-cooled
1080i baby hands alright guys we're
gonna go thanks for watching
what's the in the next one audio check
how's the nose down
alright I'm serious we could have fun
which you need to calm down
funny story we don't put this against
our mouth anymore because I actually
farted into this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
