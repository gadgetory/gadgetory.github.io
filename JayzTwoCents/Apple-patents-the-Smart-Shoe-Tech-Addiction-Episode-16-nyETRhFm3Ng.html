cents and this is tech addiction the
weekly show that brings you some of the
crazy news happening in the world of
technology Apple has just filed for an
entire portfolio pattinson is apparently
going to cover what they are hoping to
bring twist in the near future called
the smart shoot the whole point of the
smart shoe is that it's going to tell
you when it is time to replace your
shoes it's gonna have sensors processors
and apparently it's going to hook up to
your smart device and give you all sorts
of information about your body how many
steps you've taken how many calories
you've burned what you look for in the
opposite sex what kind of movies you
like how bad your feet stink but I think
the craziest thing is in the future now
we're gonna have to start saying oh my
god I gotta find an outlet because I
have to charge my shoes of course this
is nothing more than a patent so who
knows that this will ever actually come
to fruition Apple is definitely the
leading innovator of writing down
something on paper and rushing to patent
it that way if it ever comes to reality
they can go ahead and Bank on us
speaking of Apple you guys know I like
to dog apple a little bit and their
stocks fell over fourteen percent this
week so could this be the beginning of
the end of apples raining global
dominance in the world stock market a
lot of analysts feel but this might have
something to do with the dmca is ruling
than it is legal to unlock your
smartphone devices including apples to
use on other networks is expiring this
actually expired back in October but
they decided to go ahead and give the
public three months leeway to go ahead
and continue to legally unlock their
devices could you imagine what that
prison conversation would be like what
hey uh so what are you in for oh I got
my wife cheating on me so I killed her I
killed her dead and I put her in the
lake but I didn't know that dead bodies
float so no Here I am how much time you
lookin at I said I'm gonna be in here
for about four years palau you oh I i
unlocked my cell phone from verizon and
i made it work on sprint wow i'm facing
ten years
so the creator of Legos has been accused
of racism for modeling Jabba the Hutt's
palace after one of istanbul's most
revered mosques is that right fat camp
that can't be right the Turkish cultural
community in Austria has called for Lego
to make a public apology for frenching
religious and cultural feelings
apparently to create Legos you not
allowed to have any sort of feelings
whatsoever but Legos come out and said
that this is nothing more than a
coincidence they are mad because of the
way that the Hutt's are portrayed in the
movie and they feel that it gives a
negative connotation with the Turkish
people come on people this is a little
bit ridiculous just because a building
may look a little bit similar to yours
does it mean that you guys are all
walking around fat slugs who are
gambling all the time this is honestly
got to be one of the stupidest things
I've ever heard could it be because of
the fact that star wars the old republic
is releasing an expansion that is all
about the huts or could it be because of
the fact that Disney has already
announced that they are making a seventh
star wars movie to be directed by JJ
Abrams there are some people that are
not very happy about this some people
are not happy about this at all if
you're like me you love mechanical
keyboards and if you're like everyone
else you really hate the sound of
mechanical keyboards because of all the
clickety clickety clickety clack that
they tend to make mechanical keyboards
made their first debut back in the 1980s
with IBM models that featured fully
metal constructions and very very
responsive tactile keys because of the
mechanical switches but overtime
keyboards have been made to be more
quiet they're made out of thin membranes
with plastic construction plastic keys
on top of rubber membrane so that you
don't drive your co-workers insane so if
you're like me and you're like a very
very tactile clicky keyboard check out
Martius wireless Bluetooth keyboard
which has all the functionality and feel
of a tactile feedback of a fully
mechanical keyboard but at the same
sound level as your standard office
issue this keyboard could be a little
bit pricey though at one hundred and
seventy dollars there are some other
options on the market you could check
out corsair razor thermaltake a lot of
these companies make great mechanical
keyboards designed for both gaming as
well as just comfortable typing the last
thing you would want to do is have a
very loud keyboard that annoy people
hearing live streams or maybe co-workers
that would be very
irritated very loud keyboard hey you
want to keep it down over there i'm
trying to do tech addiction my bad have
you ever gone to a dating site have you
ever heard of match.com match com has
all sorts of commercials all over TV and
the internet describing how using match
com can help you find your soulmate your
lover your companion and how it's a
fully safe website to use however one
woman found that that's not entirely
true and that you cannot throw good
judgement out the window simply because
a website says it is safe take for
instance a las vegas woman by the name
of mary kay beckham mary used match com
to go on a date and that date ended up
stabbing her
Wow I got right to the point on that one
didn't I I'm sorry guys I like to do
comedy on the edge but Beckham is suing
match com for ten million dollars from
misrepresenting the website in saying
that it was entirely safe however right
at the bottom of every single page on
the website there is a huge disclaimer
saying that match com is not responsible
for any sort of harm or damage or injury
that may come to somebody out of using
match com it says that there is
absolutely no replacement for good
judgment and the person using the
website is one hundred percent
responsible for their own safety these
are the kinds of people that require us
to have some of the most ridiculous
warning labels in the world I swear to
God at work we have a shredder that
shows no paper clips no cardboard
no fingers and no babies I can't you
can't make this up it says no babies
right on our shredder these are also the
same people that says it is not safe to
operate motor vehicles while using a
blindfold guys just use your good
judgment this woman wants 10 million
dollars because she was stupid all right
guys I got one last announcement that I
want to make if you were in the orlando
area do me a favor check out the news on
Monday night on Fox 35 yours truly Jays
two cents is going to be featured on the
