bit of an update vlog to my most recent
video where I talked about the SD
station - with the GTX 1080
hooked up to an msi gs70 3 VR stealth
pro because I had some pretty degraded
results you guys had some questions and
some suggestions someone be utilizing
those in today's video to do a bit of a
follow up to that to make sure that the
information is as accurate as it could
possibly be with the - nique freeform
modular system the new master casemaker
5 from cooler master allows unparalleled
flexibility with its adjustable internal
layout and exterior customization
options learn more about how you can
start customizing your own case by
following the link down in the
description so here's the msi unit here
is the XG station - that still has the
1080 in there as you can see but check
this out external monitor because this
was the most common question you guys
had was what were you using it really
feeding back to the laptop or the
internal display or were you using an
external monitor and yeah I guess I'm
kind of stupid because part of me just
thought a lot of people would be using
it like this in this setup I guess it
makes perfect sense if you have access
to all the ports back there why not have
this display or even a multi panel
display the monitor I'm using though is
the NIC CS 144 Hertz freesync 1080p
piano obviously with a 1080 in here
we're not going to be doing any free
sync that's where obviously we don't
want any sync on honestly we don't want
to limit our max FPS at all I am using
DisplayPort cable should have no impact
whatsoever on performance but I just
want to let you guys know the complete
setup so anyway I'm going to redo the
heav'n benchmark where we do the rise of
the Tomb Raider benchmark and redo the
metro 33 R should be the Metro last
light benchmark I'm interested to see
what happens with rise of the Tomb
Raider because it is a DX 12 title which
should help with some of the CPU
overhead that don't go to sleep on me
which should help with some of the CPU
overhead that's happening here because
as I said in the last video and some of
this didn't get processed by some of the
viewers where the CPU having to handle
the i/o devices well on here because
this is treated as an i/o device it
doesn't add load to the CPU so much as
it just adds time we're going to redo
these tests and we're going to compare
them
to what they were with the internal
display and then what the 1080 was built
into the laptop those same results and
we'll just slide these in there and kind
of see where they fit now if you want to
follow along at home you can download
heaven benchmark it's free it's by
Unigine I use it all the time
and you guys can just kind of compare
your results to this if you want for fun
here are the settings ultra quality the
x11 of course tessellation normal
anti-aliasing at 8 X that's the one that
really stresses your GPU that 8 times
anti-aliasing and then of course full
screen and system is a 1080p resolution
now I can tell you right here at the
start that we are already about 4 or 5
fps higher than we were when we had it
feeding back through to the laptop the
theory is that this cable having to
handle the data transfer back to the PC
or the laptop and then to handle the
internal GPU is adding additional either
saturation of the cable and or latency
but obviously we're seeing a little bit
of an improvement already the score will
tell the big numbers though ok so we've
got a 24 11 right here which is
obviously better than the 2182 we had
when we ran the internal display it's a
nine point five percent improvement
unfortunately that's still 24 percent
slower than the 30 178 we got when we
ran the internal 1080 in that we also
have really good utilization of the GPU
sitting in the 98 to 99 percent these
dips that you see these are between
scenes when the scene is switching on
the benchmark so anyway yeah GPU is
definitely running full tilt and then
here is the CPU usage and as you can see
only every other core is actually doing
anything but that's kind of a nature of
synthetics where Core one obviously is
taking the majority of the load right
here which can actually increase the
amount of processing time the CPU has it
takes to handle all of this and that's
one of the things that Asus actually
told me so this is at least directly in
line with what we're expecting now this
is just a synthetic so let's go ahead
and use an actual game engine to see
what happens now Metro last light was
kind of an anomaly because we saw very
very little improvement between the 1060
and the 1080 in the XG now looking at my
notes we only had an 8
FPS improvement from the 1062 the 1080
so it went from 90 fps to 98 fps the
question is where we're going to get
here at an average now so far the
numbers are kind of all over the place
they turn really fast so it's kind of
hard to see but it does appear to be an
improvement I'm definitely hoping to see
a bigger gap between a 1060 and a 1080
because 8 fps was just strange but I had
run my test multiple times actually took
several hours to do those tests and they
were consistent so I'm hoping for an
improvement here and we went from 98 up
to 112 point 5 2 which is actually quite
a decent improvement 12 and a half
percent improvement from running on the
internal display have you come back
through the cable unfortunately with the
VR Titan and the 1080 built into that
laptop
that's 28.6% slower than 157 fps we had
in the 1080 native laptop a GPU usage is
pretty much peg which is what we want
with that if we saw any major dips that
would tell us it was waiting on the CPU
to do some stuff but now it's it's peg
which is where we want it to be but this
is also why it's important to use game
engines in your testing because as you
can see all of the cores are actually
doing something and none of them are
reaching a hundred percent they're all
seen to be sitting right around the 65
percent usage mark so again this is not
bottlenecking this is just the nature of
running a graphics card through a cable
this is actually all looking pretty good
just to compare this was the hebben
benchmark you can see core hyper thread
I delight read idle and you can see that
trend but here again everything the
workload which is a very which is what
you want you definitely want that now
rise of the Tomb Raider it's a DX 12
title which should help alleviate some
of the overhead happening on the CPU
here which should give us hopefully a
better increase in performance I saved
this one for last because I was really
interested in what DX 12 was going to
hold for all of this I think we had kind
of a trend here we can expect it to be
better than it was with this but nowhere
near what it was with that that guy
right there so sixty one point six six
that's really interesting because that's
only 4.3 percent faster than the
internal which was at 59 fps now we had
94 fps
when we ran the VR Titan so that's still
34.4% slower than when we ran a native
1080 something worth pointing out to
here is the GPU is not sitting up at 98
99 percent like before it's sitting
between like 88 and 91% and the CPU at
one point during the test actually went
up into the 90s on CPU utilization and
then it came down into about the 75
percent usage across the course that's
interesting because dx12 is supposed to
be alleviating some of this so I'm
really curious about that result now
just to answer a couple other questions
that were in the comments there yes this
MSI is using the latest USB 3.1 type C
with Thunderbolt 3 in there of course so
it's getting the full 40 gigabit per
second transfer rate all of the drivers
for the X station are updated and we are
using a third-party Thunderbolt driver
for that and not be built in driver
inside of the operating system which
which was one of the first questions ACS
asked me we confirmed I am using the
right drivers for this setup so as you
can see it's really kind of across the
board on the way it's going to react to
having an external GPU with an external
monitor versus internal I mean I
expected I really honestly thought Tomb
Raider was going to be a big improvement
but it wasn't so there you go this video
is a direct response to the amount of
people asking me J please do a follow-up
video where you use an external monitor
instead of feeding the information back
through the cable to the internal
display and obviously there was an
improvement there except for Tomb Raider
which again I still can't figure that
one out if you if you guys have any
information about that let me know I
would have I could have sworn dx12 was
going to be a bit of an improvement on
that but it really didn't seem to help
at all and they reportedly improve their
dx12 implementation which was really bad
when it first rolled out but it's
supposed to be a lot better now I don't
know anyway thanks for the suggestions
guys if you have any other good
suggestions on video topics or follow-up
let me know hit me up on twitter at jst
cents or in the comments below and if
you guys have some really good ones make
sure you upload them so I can see them
and anyway time to go thanks for
watching I will see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
