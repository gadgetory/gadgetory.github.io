Jays two cents and it's that time of the
week again we're going to bring you tech
edition that show where I bring you some
of the more uncommon news happening in
the world of technology and we've got a
lot going on right now we've got
computex we've got III coming up and
we've got comic-con coming up next month
so tech addiction is about to get very
hot and very heavy this wouldn't be tech
addiction if I didn't start stuff off
with just a little bit of Apple news if
you're a tech addict like I am just look
behind me if you have no idea how
addicted I am to technology you may go
to a lot of different forums you may go
to ebay you may go some place where
you're going to buy something online and
you want to send money so what do you do
you use paypal or you use google
payments or you use some sort of an
online trading website so apples really
interested in getting in on the whole
online currency thing as well and they
realized nobody's filed a patent for any
of this technology regarding sending and
receiving money electronically so what
does Apple do they go and filed patent
on the technology that they have not
developed themselves paypal is the first
pioneer when it comes to online currency
trading followed by google payments and
of course once google gets involved you
know Apple is going to do the same thing
and what do you get here you now get
Apple which is the largest technology
company in the world and they're now on
the radar for being the world's largest
patent troll it makes me really a shame
to even own an iPhone oh my god I think
it's wrong I've said it in so many tech
editions we need a major overhaul of the
united states patent system because it
is allowing and empowering these trolls
to do this sort of thing an apple you
are the world's biggest troll of course
with e3 happening right around the
corner we've got all sorts of game
trailers being released we've got new
games being talked about we've got
consoles we've got so much happening in
the world of electronics entertainment
and what would be a three without
talking about a little bit of Call of
Duty or modern warfare or in this case
game lost
during combat or modern combat 5
gameloft is really known for just
bringing a blatant rip offs of other
games and modern combat for the iPhone
or the iPad or iOS device is basically a
play on call of duty and in the past
it's been okay that's never been
incredible but however modern combat 5
for iOS actually looks really really
good if you've got an iPad or an iPhone
this may be something you want to
consider picking up just watch this
trailer it looks really well put
together and it's amazing the amount of
graphics technologies that we're getting
on tablets and smartphones and if you're
not happy with the way the future of
gaming is going on consoles or pc mobile
platforms are definitely looking like
they're going to be the future of gaming
you
I still don't think this gain holds a
candle compared to call of modern
battlefield warfighter 9000 coming out
next year by trade ice God that was hard
to say call of modern call of modern
battlefield warfighter 9000 another game
trailer that's been released for e3 2013
is Wolfenstein the new order one of the
first shooter games that i ever played
as a child was Castle Wolfenstein 3d the
graphics were horrible I think there was
like 14 pixels on the screen you can
only control which way you turn right
left straight forward or back and you
had to shoot and fight Hitler and other
Nazis and some abominations that they
made it was a really fun game the
Wolfenstein the new order takes it all
the way to modern era and it recreates
what happens if Germany actually won
World War 2 just check out the trailer
so much has changed I've been gone for
too long
digg beat us to the bar no one knows how
the world was forced into submission
they took our freedom
tore down what took centuries to build
they terrorized the world with their
power
enslaved millions
uh prizes
with the audience resistance
crushed beneath an iron boot
they're stealing our future
flogged in there Mike
wars over
I cannot wait to check out this game
this is definitely going to be a JS x so
it's been exactly one week since I
converted to the Intel 3770k and I've
been getting a lot of flack about why i
went with an older platform so i want to
give you guys just a little bit of an
update about how i feel about the system
one week later I do not regret my
purchase whatsoever I was able to recoup
a lot of the costs from selling my AMD
system the performance jump while live
streaming has been insane you guys
yourself have been watching my
livestreams over on twitch and you said
right away that everything was smoother
there was less lag there was less delay
on when things happen to vs. when you
saw them overall the streaming
experience has just been so much better
rendering times improved a little bit
not by much I would say maybe fifteen
percent better improvement times
temperatures are good and I've been able
to overclock mine to 4.8 gigahertz table
I backed it off to 4.7 just to bring the
temperatures down just a little bit so
that's a 1.2 gigahertz overclock over
the base clock on the 3770 now when it
comes to reports on the 4770k on has
well things haven't been as consistent
as they were with ivybridge the
overclocking has been up there's been a
huge range of overclock success some
people can only get four point two some
people can go all the way to five gigs
some people are crashing at four point
oh temperatures are all over the place
in fact one of the things I was really
holding out for to find out what has
well was whether or not they fix the
heat spreader thermal paste issues that
they were having with ivy bridge
apparently they didn't address them
intel felt there was no reason to it fix
the thermal temperature issues and they
did not go back to the standard
soldering procedures for the internal
heat spreader so i looked at it as
overclocking instability temperature
control and the internal GPU
improvements which I don't need and
don't use did not make sense for me to
go has well for my desktop now a lot of
people said yeah but now you've limited
your upgrade path because 11 50 is the
new socket and because you're on an
older motherboard now you probably won't
be able to upgrade and this and that
well guess what people the situation was
the same when it came to z77 if
wanted to get the most out of your ivy
bridge processor you had to go with a
z77 board in most cases in tell when
they bring in a new chip they bring out
a new architecture in a new platform
that's going to require you to buy a new
motherboard anyway whether it be because
of a socket change or a chipset change
to get the most out of your system
you're going to buy a new motherboard
but you know what I'm perfectly happy
with my system it's been a week I have
absolutely no regrets and I'm just going
to keep on trucking along but AMD is not
a bad processor I do not talk bad about
AMD whatsoever I've roamed AMD for three
years it served me very very well but
I'm just going back to my roots which is
that of Intel an Intel meets all of my
power user needs and trust me when I say
I'm using every single inch of power
that this 3770k has in fact the only
upgrade path I see me going in the
future is that of ivy bridge-e if the
extreme series turned out to be worth it
yes i understand it could have gone with
a 2011 board but it would have cost me
as much on just a 2011 processor that i
spent on this entire board and processor
combo so i'm happy with my choice you
may disagree with it that's your
prerogative build what you want but in
my computer i am perfectly happy so a
lot of you guys have been asking about
my opinion when it comes to Google glass
I didn't know a whole lot about it I
haven't really been following much going
on with google but i can tell you that i
found an article that I found to be very
very ironic when it came to Google glass
Google glass is being banned in a lot of
areas it's being banned in gyms it's
being banned in movies it's being banned
in sensitive areas courts police
stations there's a lot of places we are
not allowed to bring your google glass
and if you're not we're at Google
Glasses it's basically some glasses that
you put on and they've got a little
camera in there and it's designed to
give you a really unique first person
view of your life I mean you could you
could wear it and use it to vlog and use
it as a point of view vlog it's really
kind of neat the problem is it's
considered a huge privacy risk it's
considered a huge invasion of privacy
because people can be walking around
recording you and you don't even know it
now that kind of starts to trample upon
a little bit of the privacy laws where
once you're in public your free reign to
be recorded but what I find truly ironic
about this story is that Google is very
very defensive over its google glass and
the fact
it doesn't really violate privacy
because of what I just said however
Google executives have banned Google
glass in their own boardrooms you're not
allowed to bring Google glass anywhere
in the executive boardrooms anywhere in
the Google headquarters now it just
seems like a little bit of bitter sweet
irony it may seem like Google has
something to hide the bottom line is if
you have google glass I think it's kind
of neat tell me what you think about it
I personally wouldn't use it uh it's
kind of seems a little bit of creepy to
me actually just to walk around
recording what it is your eye sees but
maybe you feel a little bit different
how do you guys feel about google glass
put it down in the comments and let me
know okay guys it's time for everyone's
favorite part of the show and that's
technologies damaris from the week so
this week's technologies dumbass of the
Week comes to you all the way from Great
Britain and our tech dumbass goes by the
name of Lord Turnbull Lord Turnbull is a
British judge he also believes a 13 year
old boy who murdered his 14-year old
friend over a dispute on an online video
game probably call of duty was fueled by
his rage and his exposure to violent
video games and he flat-out told this
kid during court that he feels that his
exposure to violent video games is what
empowered him to live out his fantasy to
murder somebody and that violent video
games are the direct route cause of the
murder that this kid performed
had nothing to do with the fact that he
was 13 and drunk it has to do with the
fact that he was playing violent video
game and because of that kids now we're
going to start slashing necks everywhere
first briton next America next North
Korea maybe I don't think they're
allowed to own video games but bottom
line is Lord Turnbull of Great Britain
you are technologies highest dumbass of
the Week alright guys that's it for this
week next weeks and we really excited
we've got a lot going on over at e3
computex is going to bring us a lot of
stuff this week and I'll be kind of
summing some of it up on some tweets
maybe some videos I'm kind of waiting
for all the information to come in from
China I understand it be the show is
just kind of wrapping up so there are
some things people have been asked me
regarding some of the new graphics cards
that are coming out and some of the new
stuff happening with Haswell we're going
to get all on that I promise and because
I now own an Intel I'm going to bring
you guys the much awaited promised Intel
overclocking guide since I've got mine
stable at 4.8 we're gonna see what we
can do and I'm going to empower you guys
to overclock your processors and I'm
going to see you guys next week on tech
addiction because I'm getting very tired
of hitting my microphone and doing this
with the arms and being very annoying
because this is just how we do it ow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
