bet you didn't know I'm actually a
pretty big fan of Star Wars so when I
first heard about battlefront coming out
I absolutely could not wait to get my
hands on this game and I figured I would
go ahead and do the trendy thing that
everyone else is doing is talk about
Star Wars Battlefront and basically show
you some pretty awesome gameplay here
I've kind of gotten the hang a
Battlefront and we're having a lot of
fun with it so I figured we'd do some
gameplay here and just kind of give you
my thoughts about the game as well as
show you some of my pro MLG skills
don't hate bro the mastercase 5 and
mastercase 5 pro from Coolermaster
combines modularity with creativity
giving you the freedom to build it your
way make it yours by clicking the link
down in the description okay so this
gameplay is going to be taking place in
drop zone we'll do a separate video for
Walker assault they're two completely
different types of gameplay Walker
assault is actually quite unbalanced
right now and I'm not happy with it
because the rebels are always getting
screwed in my opinion and it's not just
one or two games that I force it opinion
on or form that opinion on force the
opinion I might have forced it too but
you know if you look at the forums and
you look at tweets and you just play the
game enough you will realize that the
rebels have a very slim chance of ever
winning it's kind of like arena and
Warcraft where you know or battlegrounds
in Warcraft where there's just like oh
my god they the Alliance always win now
track valleys sort of thing it's really
happening anyway I like to use the e11
blaster it's my favorite blaster it's
got a really good amount of damage to
fire rate and I'm really happy with it
now this this match right here you're
going to notice I go kind of ham I mean
it starts off here with me capturing
this pod which is what drop zone is
these pods fall and you have to capture
them and defend them and if somebody
else captures it you have to capture it
back before the timer runs out and it
goes back and forth but I do a pretty
good job here at defending this one a
lot of players you just kind of ignore
the objective which is frustrating so
it's very important to defend it which
some people know that's camping this
champion really is doing things by a
champion
yeah well you know that's called the
objective here in this guy thought he
was gonna get it and I killed him and
that's the way the cookie crumbles I
want to kind of point something out
right there on that that grenade I saw
that the player was coming towards me
and will actually back that up and show
it again I saw that player coming
towards me and I knew that my grenade
was going to go past him and you can't
cook a grenade so what I did was I
bounced it off that little crater in
front of me so it bounced back at him
and if he noticed the grenade is
actually what killed him not my blaster
so it was a you know it little things
like that I've been playing shooters now
for about twelve or twenty years and I
I'm good at it I'm not like MLG pro but
I'm good at it and I have a lot of fun
doing a lot of grenade bouncing and
thermal detonators and stuff speaking of
thermal detonators I don't know if it's
really overpowered but the game is
controlled your hand your offhand items
are controlled by these cards as you can
see the cards have a cool-down after you
use them and they reload so you kind of
have unlimited thermals thermal
detonators which are very powerful I
mean one thermal detonator will kill you
it's not like battlefield where a direct
grenade hit won't necessarily kill you
but in this one here you can have full
health and a thermal detonator will
destroy you don't even get me started on
an imp loader that's insane I'll take
out an entire group of people anywhere
near it but it's pretty fun and it's
actually a drop or a token on the ground
that you pick up and you get a one time
use but man it's powerful now the
gameplay style I like to use here on
drop zone is if we are controlling a pod
I would like to control the perimeter of
that pod what happens is that people
will just sit on that pod where's the
first place people are going to throw
grenades and employers and things
they're going to throw them at a pod
because they're expecting people to be
camping it so you'll notice here I kind
of work the perimeter of these pods and
it works out pretty well you'll see me
throwing of what seems to be a lot of
random grenades they're not really
random I've got kind of two thought
processes going on as I throw these
thermals and you can see that you know I
kill people sometimes because I'm
throwing them where I know the action is
happening I'm not necessarily filling
them out a player I'm throwing them
where I'm watching my teammates shoot
and I'm also looking at the map so I'm
throw them where red dots are and you
can throw these things stupid far I
don't know if that's a little
overpowered I don't know if they're
going to change it later in the game but
you can throw these grim these backy :
grenades you can throw these thermal
detonators really stupidly far but
because they are on a timer they will
blow up in midair if you try and throw
them too far but it's insane how far you
can throw them but the other thing I'm
doing is I'm not just throwing it where
the action is if I'm if I'm trying to
control one side of a pod and I've got
these rocks and I'm kind of hiding
around I can control which way the enemy
players are moving with my grenades
let's say they're starting to come down
one of these little alleyways and a
grenade explodes in front of them
typically they're going to stop or
they're going to back up or they're
going to kind of wait and see what's
going on before they move forward that
gives me time to throw a grenade and
kind of backtrack and go around the
other direction where I can hopefully
flank or come around behind them so a
lot of times that's what I'm doing with
these thermals is I'm not so much trying
to kill someone with them I do get lucky
kills with them but I'm trying to
control the enemy player movement so
that I have control over where my rifles
pointed and hopefully it's pointed at
them if things go according to plan now
I really like this play style it's on a
timer it can't last any longer than 10
minutes or it's the first team to
capture five pods at least that's why it
seems to be working out if you it's
first to five or whoever gets the most
the amount of time I had a really epic
match before this one that unfortunately
the sound didn't capture I didn't set up
the sound right in my dxtory capture
software so it it was commit was so epic
it was it was three two three and the
timer had run out and we had one pod
that we went back and forth at least
five minutes on capturing and
recapturing and capturing and
recapturing we ended up losing but man
it was epic I think I had four
recaptures on that pod myself and it was
I was playing this game going man this
is going to be such awesome gameplay
this is gonna be worth watching and then
I played it back and there was no audio
I'm like ah anyway but you'll see some
good examples coming up here pretty
shortly on this last pod that we capture
at least on the fifth pod where I'm
doing what I what i just explained which
is the controlling enemy move
with the grenades now Walker assault
like I said we'll do a separate video
about Walker assault it's so unbalanced
it's not fun it's it's one of those
things where if you if you draw the
rebels you don't get to pick the team
you you're assigned the team once you
join the game and you can't really at
least in the beta you can't switch it
it's one of those things where you like
ah fuck I'm a rebel and people are
literally backing out when they see that
they've drawn rebel and rejoining a
lobby to try and see if they can pick
Imperials because they know that the
Imperials 9 out of 10 times are going to
win now I've played I think probably
five or six matches as or in the Walker
assault and every single time I was
rebel we lost and the other times that I
was Imperials we won except for one time
out of five or six matches that's a
crazy
that's a terrible ratio and it I thought
it was just me but then I was
live-streaming the game and other people
were confirming that nope rebel suck and
assault there you're constantly exposed
where you spawn in the open you have
terrible trenches the enemy always has
the high ground so the trenches do you
no good the walkers are incredibly
overpowered you just are screwed there's
nothing else to say about it so I'm
hoping that because this is a beta they
might find some way to really fix the
balance on that maybe the game will
become a little bit more balanced as it
progresses with the you know fully
unlocked modes and levels and stuff this
is a beta guys keep that in mind but
right now I'm looking forward to this
game I'm going to buy it there's no
doubt about it and I'll probably be this
will be my battlefield replacement I
love Star Wars I love battlefield this
is built on the same engine plays a
little bit more like Call of Duty but
it's fast paced and it's just fun the
sounds are rich
janna the feeling of the location of
another pot
the gameplay is pretty fun and I haven't
found myself raging well yet anyway
alright guys have been Jays two senses
bringing a little bit of Battlefield
drop zone I called it battlefield
Battlefront drop zone gameplay let me
know if you guys want to see some more
gameplay on this stuff and otherwise
we'll see you in the next one
take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
