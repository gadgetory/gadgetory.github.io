how many of you have ever found yourself
in a situation where you build your
brand-new computer and you've got that
nice high speed ram 2600 megahertz
2800 megahertz or even something like a
20 133 megahertz ram and you boot it up
and you go into BIOS so you go into
Windows and you take a look at your ram
speed and you see that disappointing
1333 megahertz well today we're going to
find out how to make your ram actually
run and it's advertised speeds that's
right guys today we're going to talk
about memory speed and how to get that
advertised speed out of your DIMM sticks
whether you're in an Intel or an AMD
system now first things first you have
to understand how the memory controllers
actually work to understand what we're
about to do today now first of all the
memory speeds that you see advertised on
most modules are actually called an
egg's MP profile which in itself is an
overclock of the internal memory
controller or the IMC inside of your CPU
that is why your system actually boots
at a default 1333 because that is the
default speed so in essence you're
pretty much doing an overclock of your
memory controller to get the speeds that
you're being advertised on your dims the
dim just says that it's actually been
tested up to that speed and has been
stable in annexin-v profile at those
timings in those speeds but there's no
guarantee that you're actually going to
get that kind of speed so going into
this there's two things you have to
understand one those speeds are an
overclock of the IMC doesn't mean your
CPU is going to technically be able to
run those speeds chances are it'll work
but there's no guarantees and number two
being the more you overclock your cpu
the less likely you are to be able to
achieve those superfast memory speeds
and 2 adds a lot of strain on the IMC
when you start overclocking both at the
same time so with that said let's go
ahead and dive right into my MSI in
power we'll take a look here at exactly
how to change those memory speeds for
you now keep in mind every motherboard
is different every UEFI is different
every BIOS is different so you're going
to have to consult your manual to find
the settings that I'm looking at here
today on my MSI
and power now in most systems to get
into BIOS all you have to do is just
kind of mash the Delete key as you're
going through your boot process here and
set about there press Delete to run bios
and here we are now we're running all of
the default settings right here as you
can see we've actually got 3.5 gigahertz
on my 4770k and if we go here into the
OC and that's where you're going to find
your memory speeds because as I
mentioned it's actually an overclock to
get faster ram speed even the advertised
XMP you're going to go down to the OC
tab or wherever the memory controller
settings are located on your bios
remember please look up your manuals and
you're going to head on over here to the
right and you're going to find wherever
your DRAM settings own so here we are
here's our DRAM settings DRAM reference
clock is auto DRAM frequency is auto
adjusted ram frequency 1333 there it is
right there an extreme memory profile
XMP is disabled now if i want to get the
advertised 1600 megahertz that's
actually the default ram speed of the a
data ram i have in here i could simply
go enabled as you can see we switch to
1600 megahertz right there so now we'll
do oh and here's the voltage and the
timing so it's a nine nine 9 2014 1
point 5 volts which is the default and
then you've pretty much got everything
right there now you've got mem try it
which is kind of a built-in memory
overclocking profile for MSI we're going
to kind of ignore that and we're going
to do right now is we're just going to
go ahead and reboot into our rear reboot
the BIOS system we're going to go back
in and make sure those systems actually
took effect okay so we've rebooted our
system and as you can see now we do
actually have the 1600 megahertz ram
showing now in the system which means it
would also show in Windows we are
running our XMP profile which means the
optimal timings and the optimum
frequency of your ram but you don't have
to stop there you could technically
overclock this farther we're going to go
a dram frequency as you can see we've
got this motherboard supports up to 3200
megahertz of ddr3 but we can just kind
of go up in increments at a time run
some stress tests and find our maximum I
found that ddr3 on this a data sticks
these 1600 megahertz sticks actually run
stable at 2100 and 33 so I could set
that reboot it
we'll see if we even get into BIOS and
if we do then you can do a
mm test and then test your memory
stability from there you're good to go
so as you can see we just tell booted
into 20 133 megahertz ram at stock stock
voltage right now in fact it would
probably fail the mem test we've got to
bump up the voltage on my ram a little
bit too but that kind of goes into a
much more in-depth memory overclocking
tutorial which hopefully we'll do at a
later time but one thing you need to
keep in mind though as you start bumping
up the memory or the CPU overclock for
instance this CPU only likes to run at
4.4 we are then able to we would want to
actually adjust our memory speeds
independent find your stable CPU speed
then find your stable memory speed and
then go from there so overclock your cpu
first leave it at default 1333 and then
overclock your ram independently once
you find your stable overclock on your
cpu once your ram becomes unstable or
you start getting blue screens then
you're going to want to back off the RAM
slightly probably one setting on your
speed setting or your speed list there
and then there you go so guys have been
chased you sense I hope this has helped
you understand why your memory is
booting at a much slower speed than the
memory that you bought so don't get mad
don't think that your memory sticks are
bad just go ahead and go into your BIOS
and start tinkering you really can't do
much damage unless you start cranking
the voltages up way too high and as long
as we leave the voltages alone play
around with it all you want it doesn't
work clear your CMOS and start over
guys Ben J's two cents take the time to
go in there and mess with your settings
because there's a lot of free power in
there that you guys may be missing out
on for the sake of just being afraid to
click some buttons don't be afraid to
get in there and tinker guys that's the
moral of this video that's that's what
we're talking about today get in there
and mess with your junk play with your
BIOS as well guys when we get on out of
here it's been Jase dissents following
Twitter and I hope to see in this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
