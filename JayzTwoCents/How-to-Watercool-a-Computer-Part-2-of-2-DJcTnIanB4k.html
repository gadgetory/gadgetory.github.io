everything is in all the clamps are on
the loop is all put together and
unmounted the reservoir for two reasons
I don't like to leave a full time fill
port going on here or a tube to the top
of the case but what I like to do is I
like to remove this from the bracket and
bring it outside of the case so it's
easier to work with it's one reason why
I have it routed the way I do is because
look at all this slack that I've got
right here but I also take off the fill
plug on the top which is this guy right
here and I take a spare half inch barb
and just hand tight against the o-ring
and then I'll take some spare tube I'll
put it on the barb here zip tie it so we
don't get any leaks and what this does
is this then allows me to get a fill
port that's at the highest point of the
loop because the easiest way you're
going to bleed is to have the opening to
the atmosphere or the opening to the
outside of the loop being above the
highest point of the loop so this is
what I'm doing now we're getting ready
to do our fill and leak test
alright so when you fill this you're
going to want to fill slowly because
unfortunately my reservoir here only has
one fill port on the top instead of two
which would have kind of helped as you
replace air in this system with coolant
the air has to escape and the only way
it has to escape is through the same
port that you're filling so what's going
to happen here is you're going to see a
really neat spiral effect you're going
to see only a trickle of coolant coming
out of here as it's replacing liquid
with air so it's an exchange process
that's happening here Swift tech I doubt
you're watching but if you ever are
watching at a second port to this that
we can loosen up kind of like a bleed
port on a car because then the air has a
place to go and the coolant can exchange
a lot faster and make life a whole lot
easier or indeed get a little guy here
on YouTube telling you how to do your
Jeff looks like I want looks like
something wipe your butt with it thanks
for that all right moment of truth
little bits of time just a little bit
because you also don't want to get
coolant trapped in this tube because you
overfilled because guess what you have
to detach the tube that's another mess
that you have to deal with
so what I'm going to do now is I'm only
going to fill it enough to get the very
bottom plug completely filled that way I
can make sure that the very first
Junction I have right here is not
leaking and so far we're gonna let the
colors they're waiting for it to start
leaking oh and there it is where I'm
skinny because I don't want to waste any
this I've barely got enough to fill this
loop so if you see a leak seriously tell
me alright okay so now that we've gone
ahead and filled this up you'll notice
here that the level pretty much stopped
even with this bar because what's
happening now is we have air trapped in
here and this is the Barb and the tube
that leads to the lower radiator so this
is not going to be able to rise anymore
until two things happen we've got to get
the air out of the system and we've got
to start filling up this lower radiator
so what I'm doing here is I'm just
taking one of my 650 watt power supplies
and I did this guys with a 300 watt like
$15 unit that came in a free one that
comes with a case you can do it with
that one to plug it into power but you
have to make sure that it has a switch
one of the see on the toggle switches on
the back that allow you to turn it on
and off and you take a paperclip this is
the old junction trick here you take a
paperclip cut it bend it in half and you
jump her together on the 24 pin
connector the green wire there's only
one green wire of all 24 pins is only
one green wire and a black wire there's
one on either side doesn't matter which
one so you're going to take it you're
going to you're going to put it right in
the end right there so what happens when
you jumper these two is you're actually
jump ring what's considered the power
switch on the front of your PC to a
ground which then will enable the switch
on the back of the power supply here let
me show you that this one has a switch
right here and on/off and allows you to
be able to turn the power supply unit on
and off with the rear switch okay so now
we're going to do to get some of this
air out
and get some of that replacement fluid
is we're just going to slowly flip on
and off the power supply and fortunately
because I have a variable speed pump
when we get this more full one of the
ways that we can help move air out of
the radiators because the upper radiator
is where all the water or the air is
going to want to go I can turn the speed
up and down so and that will help slosh
some of the fluid to help get the air
moving tipping and tilting the case is
another way to do that so we're going to
do now is we're just going to flip it on
and you can see the water level dropped
and came back up but you notice now it's
a little bit lower than where it was now
I want you guys to hear the sound that
this makes as it starts to pull an air
with the fluid that sound is bad so once
you hear that you want to make sure that
you stop using your pump but you saw a
lot of bubbles come out of there right
now
so this is the process that we're just
going to keep repeating we're going to
fill it up till it gets to this upper
bar right here in the reservoir because
that's where the air is gonna make its
way out and we repeat the process this
is very tedious it will take a while
must have patience if you use your water
cooling loop with air in it you will
overheat something
we now have cool trapped in here to see
that yep one of the things too that
would really help is if you guys
understand how hydraulics work because
there's pressure here and this tube was
filled you'll notice on that last blip
of the power supply as this level went
down water was then drop a fluid was
then drawn in because it finally made
room for the air to get out as air goes
out the equal amount of fluid goes in
it's all about volumetric pressure and
the actual volume of the system itself
so that's why you have to be very
patient and be careful you don't
overfill this like I mentioned earlier
because you will have as FPSRussia says
very bad bait one way to make bleeding a
little bit faster and a little bit
easier is while the pump is running just
slowly tilt your case in each direction
you can see some bubbles just came out
right there because as you create an
uneven surface and you force the air to
move the pump will take over and it will
push any bubbles that are in the system
out you don't need to do any extreme
tilting you know gravity and is a bitch
when it comes to air and it looks like
we're doing pretty good I mean the water
level dropped it good I'd say half inch
just from those couple of tilts so just
keep that process going keep adding
fluid as necessary and after a while the
bubbles will work themselves out this is
the part where you have to be patient
and you can't rush things well there is
that's a fully built custom loop we're
bled we're letting it run right now
checking for any leaks that we may have
you want to let this run
I personally am very gutsy I've never
let this thing run for more than a half
hour before giving it power letting
budda some people recommend a 24 hour
leak test if you're using the right
materials using the right kind of clamps
and you've got a good seal it's very
unlikely that a sip a leak will develop
in 24 hours it's my personal opinion you
know I'm not saying anybody else is
wrong but here it is it's all put
together it's very simple honestly in my
opinion the most complicated part is
bleeding it and that's where a lot of
people make their mistakes so we have
any questions about this water cooling
bill and there's more you want to know
just put it down in the comments I'll be
great - I'll be sure to answer that and
I'm sure there's a lot of people who
know about water cooling
willing to come in and give advice too
so that's been Jays two cents custom
water-cooling built now we're going to
throw this thing back together and get
to gaming because I am just dying to see
how this water cooling does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
