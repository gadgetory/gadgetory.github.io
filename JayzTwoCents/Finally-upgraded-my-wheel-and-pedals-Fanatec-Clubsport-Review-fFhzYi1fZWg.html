than five minutes you know I have two
passions computers and cars and what's
the best way to put them together while
you build a nice kick-ass racing
simulator now you guys have seen that
I'm sitting in the GT Omega art cockpit
here I've had it for here's a guy
December of 2014 actually yeah long time
ago anyway that's besides the point here
I have the logitech g27 on here before
and it just wasn't good enough so the
folks over at fnatic I reached out to
them they were willing to sponsor this
video to say yeah go ahead and check out
some of our stuff what do you want I got
to pick it and now we're going to talk
about it we're going to take the racing
simulator here to the next level now the
base right here the most expensive part
of this entire kit this thing runs about
600 bucks just for the base no wheel on
it or anything but this is responsible
for making the wheel feel real a lot of
lower end steering wheels we'll just
rely on motor resistance to make you
feel like you're driving a car and the
problem with that is it just doesn't
feel realistic because when you drive a
car you're driving a power assisted
hydraulic steering rack which has a very
interesting feel about it when the
wheels start to lose grip they start to
starts to turn a little bit easier on
you because as wheels lose traction they
become easier to turn that has to be
somehow translated to the steering wheel
in your hand to make you feel like that
just happened in real life and if you're
driving a front-wheel drive car it's
even more important to have a base I can
actually translate all of that sort of
feedback into the steering wheel which
is why it's called a force feedback so
that kind of leads you to the problem
with the lower-end steering wheels is
they just rely on a cheap brushed motor
to give you that sort of feedback but
the clubsport v2 base right here has a
direct sensor that's mounted on the
steering axis so it avoids a lot of
issues are usually found on belt driven
wheels with motor mounted sensors it's
also completely metal construction belt
drive system with ball bearings and it's
very precise and it's very very accurate
feedback which is what I was mentioning
here because it's the hardest part about
doing these kinds of videos is you can't
feel what it is I'm trying to explain
but the best way to explain it is it
feels incredibly realistic probably as
realistic as you can get without it
being a direct drive system here but
fnatic actually sent out or they
actually set out to really build a
belt-driven system here that is going to
feel as close to a direct drive system
as you possibly can
but obviously this is a lot cheaper to
do it this way than with the direct
drive but the nice thing about the way
they constructed this here also too with
the way the sensor is mounted and the
type of brushless motor they're using is
there's absolutely no dead zone which
has kind of been one of my biggest
complaints is a lot of times with the
lower end steering wheels you have a
little bit of a dead zone in there so as
you get out of that dead zone it'll
bounce back real hard and you get this
where it's bouncing back and forth if
you guys have ever taken a g27 and just
kind of you know let go the wheel like
that it starts to bounce back and forth
all crazy because of the dead zone that
doesn't happen with the steering wheel
at all but then again considering the
thing is about 600 bucks for just the
base it better do a pretty damn good job
of it now we're going to move on here to
the hub because the hub is very very
important as you guys saw it as a quick
release it's got this big giant
spring-loaded actuator here so that you
can mount it to the base right there or
the servo base and have no problem
switching out your wheel because you can
actually set up and load out different
wheels the actual software and the USB
controller is built into the hub not
necessarily the base although the base
is kind of the main brain of everything
the hub is controlling it so you can
change out the hubs for different types
of wheels you can get yourself like an
f1 wheel where all the controls are
mounted on to the steering wheel or in
my case here I've got a gt3 Cup car
wheel with the Xbox one compatible hub
we'll talk about that a second or you
can even go with something super basic
and it's just like an oval wheel hub
like like old-school NASCAR not the
newer NASCAR's which actually have
buttons on the wheels but you can load
this out depending on your game and just
buy different hubs and different wheels
and switch them out now obviously that
can get pretty damn expensive
considering each one of these hub and
wheel assembly is about four hundred
dollars in itself but obviously since
we're dealing with a GT Cup car here
I've got paddle shifters which are all
metal construction by the way you can
you can really
ranked on that and not feel like you're
going to break the damn thing
because everything we're talking about
today is full metal construction which
is huge because that's going to really
play a big part on long life now I said
a second ago that this is the Xbox one
hub and some of you might have been like
what when I said that but yeah this is
xbox one compatible so all the buttons
you're going to see on here instead of
just kind of being blacked-out buttons
like the non Xbox compatible one they're
labeled left trigger left bumper X Y a B
start select all that sort of stuff and
there on the top right here as well
which means that obviously they're
mapped to Xbox when you turn it on but
every single one of these buttons are
also customizable in any of the programs
that you play and assetto corsa iRacing
whatever so they can all be different
things start windshield wipers
headlights whatever so that's kind of
neat you've got all these extra buttons
here that you can map the other fan is
kind of neat is all of these are on
metal arms and they come pre-configured
so that the steering wheel like I've got
right here can just mount on to it and
not interfere with anything you can
actually rearrange these and move these
around to be a little bit more
customizable to however you want them to
be I just left it point honestly I sent
no reason to move it around but the
reason why they also call this a
universal hub is it's got six bolt
pattern here that's very common to momo
Sparco NRG wheels and stuff like that so
that you can actually change the
steering wheel or don't even have to buy
one of theirs if you don't want to or if
you already have one to be any type of
steering wheel on here that you want and
because these arms are customizable and
you can move them around chances are
it's going to fit with any style wheel
you want to put on there so that's I
think really really cool is the fact
that they are giving real-world support
to real-world steering wheels I just
opted to get the leather for the
Motorsports version on here not really a
fan of the way the white Forza
Motorsport shows that on there I could
black that out too if I want so the size
and weight though the wheel that this
sent me is actually accurate and true to
form to a true GT Cup car so that's
pretty neat as I'm sitting here it's
about the same size and feel as it would
be if I were in a true GT car so it's
also got a flat bottom which is kind of
nice so it's not going to be hitting my
knees but anyway let's move over to the
shifter here because this is where
when I unboxed the thing I actually said
out loud to myself holy crap this thing
just reeks of quality my wife went it's
that bad huh I was confused as well what
do you mean she goes oh I thought you're
being sarcastic no this thing is
actually pretty badass
I wasn't expecting it to be as big and
heavy as it is but it also comes with
two different shift knobs in fact it
comes with this ball style shift knob if
I can get it off right here which I
happen to really like and it also has a
more elongated handle style shift knob
so that depending on whichever style
style that you like most
you can outfit it and off you go but
what I thought was really interesting
here is the fact that this is a 7-speed
manual shift knob with the lockout for
Reverse which is kind of neat you get a
push it down left it up for reverse I
guess it's very similar to a Volkswagen
and other European style cars but it's
got a 1 through 7 on manual and then
it's also got this little button right
here this little slider that you can
push and convert this to an H pattern
gated shifter to a sequential shifter so
if you're doing like rallycross games or
any sort of race car or GT car that's
got a sequential gearbox you can switch
this on the fly you don't need two
different types of gearboxes it just
becomes a sequential automatically and
then it springs back when you upshift
and downshift and you can map the two GS
or the sequential to gear shift to the
paddles so that they both are the same
so if you have a pedal car or a sponge
of car they both use the exact same
thing or if you leave this an H pattern
you can use the shifters as a sequential
so if kind of thought of everything
there you can really really row through
the gears on this thing and not worry
about breaking it that's one of the
problems I have my g27 was friends would
get on there and try and power shift and
shifting and gear really hard the
problem was I was terrified that they
were going to break my shifter a couple
times I think they actually came close
so that's going to move us on now to the
pedals the pedals can literally make or
break the driving experience get it
brake
the driving it come on I tried I would
rather have no pedals at all that have
poor pedals that was my biggest problem
of the g27 was that all the pedals felt
the same to gas the brake and the clutch
all felt identical they were just
spring-loaded they were linear they felt
the same no matter where you push no
matter what the condition of the drive
was they just always felt the same and
in a real car it doesn't feel that way
the gas pedals got a unique feel the
brake has a unique feel and the clutch
has a unique feel so starting with the
gas pedal here I kind of now these are
fully adjustable and the first thing I
did was I actually switched out the
regular red spring that comes with them
for the included black spring which is
actually stiffer so they actually give
you two sets of Springs that you can
change in there to kind of already
customize the feel now I chose to make
these feel like nizzy my 370z Nismo if
you guys didn't know that's the car that
I Drive kind of hard when I want to go
have some fun so I wanted my sim rig to
feel a lot like
nizzy does so I was able to actually
adjust this pedal spring for the gas
pedal to feel a lot like nizzy because
it's an electronic throttle there's no
cable on there was just a real linear
feel and I was ok with that now the
brake on the other hand this is a 90
kilogram load cell brake so it already
it takes some real force to push and it
is adjustable on the preload so you can
make it feel stiffer or softer at the
top of the pedal however you want to
make it feel now as you guys know brake
pedals in real life are hydraulic they
are not linear so a spring pedal for
brake is terrible it's a terrible way to
try and make a racing simulator feel it
doesn't feel accurate whatsoever this
guy on the other hand when I'm braking
it feels very very realistic
now they also sent over their damper
which can be put on either the brake
pedal or the gas pedal which allows you
to have a hydraulic feel so if you guys
had a cable driven a gas pedal then you
could put it on the gas pedal and
control the stiffness of the pedal and
how hard it is to push giving a much
more realistic feel in my case here I
went ahead and put it on the brake pedal
because I wanted to make it feel more
like a true hydraulic brake and boy does
it ever because you've got eight damper
settings on here from no damper - holy
 you got to stand on this thing with
both feet to make it go now lastly the
clutch pedal feels very very real
because of this cantilever design they
have in there so it's not just a linear
press it's actually got this kind of a
flip function
in there which makes it feel a lot like
you actuated the clutch and then
released it rather than just having a
real linear feel so you know exactly
where the clutch engages and disengages
make things like double clutching a lot
easier and it just makes it feel a whole
lot more realistic one other thing worth
noting that you might have actually seen
in some of the b-roll there is both the
gas pedal and the brake pedal actually
have these little motors on there that
are designed to give you force feedback
in the pedal of things like loss of
traction through / throttling which is
the throttle vibrator if for lack of a
better term is going to start going off
if you're losing traction due to too
much gas same with the brake if you
start locking up the wheels the brake
pedal is going to start to vibrate so if
you want to run a true set up with no
brake assist no stability control or any
of that stuff and just do pure racecar
you can get some actual feedback with
the pedal what's happening rather than
waiting to see how the car is responding
going oh I've got no traction or oh I've
locked up the brakes you kind of know it
because you can feel it in your foot
before the car even starts to respond so
that's a nice little touch in there also
but you might have noticed a reoccurring
theme here of realism and that is what
fnatic has really set out to do with
this set now this one piece I really
want to review but I don't have because
they're actually backordered on and that
is the handbrake because I could set it
here like an e-brake to my right I don't
think that makes sense
personally because I would like to play
around with some of the drifting and
assetto corsa and stuff which means I'm
going to want it to be up here more on
the - set up like a hydro brake but
again that's another 100-dollar part
unfortunately I can't do a review of
that right now it was backordered when
they sent this stuff and it's not
available until the end of the month but
I will be picking one up so that I can
set that up and it plugs right into the
pedals and allows me to be able to do a
lot more controlled drifting by pulling
an hydro brake rather than having to try
and do it all with a throttle which is
kind of neat now this setup right here
is not cheap it's not cheap whatsoever
it's about 1500 bucks as you see it
outfitted right now so you've got to
kind of be serious about sim racing to
spend that kind of money on this but boy
do I think it's worth every single penny
now is it the the best system out there
no absolutely not is it the cheapest
heck no not by a longshot but I think it
gives you a pretty good bang for the
buck and I know people who are gonna
want to shoot me for saying 1,500 bucks
bang for the buck
there are petal sets out there that cost
fifteen hundred dollars by themself
there are direct drive units that cost
two thousand dollars by themself for the
steering wheel you can easily spend
seventy thousand dollars on a racing
setup so ya bang for buck at fifteen
hundred bucks I think is a realistic
term now it's not perfect for instance
using the Xbox hub right here whenever I
turn it on it defaults to the Xbox mode
which is really frustrating because I am
going to be spending ninety five percent
of my time playing it on PC I haven't
even tried for Z I'm going to try that
in another video so every time I turn it
on it goes into the Xbox mode which you
can tell because it's got the green ring
and then I've got to push these two
buttons here to put it into PC mode
which is really annoying I've got to do
it every single time
now the documentation that comes with
everything is actually very very basic
both the bass and the pedals have a
QuickStart guide which simply is nothing
more than showing you where to plug
stuff in it's only a couple pages
because it's in several languages and
you also get drilled pattern templates
here in case you're building your own
rig out of wood or whatever else so that
you know where to drill so that you can
mount either the twenty degree angled
base right here which it goes on to the
bottom of the base so you get the wheel
kind of more upright like a real column
or you can mount it flat if you want it
but that's a little less realistic in my
opinion it's because they don't want you
to have an outdated manual you have to
go online download the lays latest PDFs
so you always have the most up-to-date
mantle which actually I think is a good
thing I was trying to figure out why my
wheel wouldn't show up but that's
because like I said it was booting in
xbox mode and then I had to delete the
driver and reinstall it because once I
installed the driver before having this
in PC mode it didn't want to recognize
it after that so once I deleted the
driver put it in PC mode then reinstall
the driver it pretty much saw it and had
no problems from there other than that
it really wasn't that hard to set up
they actually have this exact setup
already loaded into it so that it knows
all the configs and then all you've got
to do is calibrate the wheel and the
pedals and you're up and running but
all-in-all guys I couldn't be happier
this is a this is a very immersive prod
and that was the whole point of me
wanting this is because now that I'm
using VR for my racing setup I wanted
something that was going to feel is real
as what I was seeing the problem I had
with the g27 which I'm comparing it to
because that's where I came from was I
had VR on and I saw racing stuff all
around me but I had this little bitty
wheel in this little plastic shifter in
these terrible pedals which really
didn't make it feel very really guys
like that it just didn't make it feel
very realistic but now I've got much
more my senses or being much more
satisfied by what I'm experiencing here
with the fanatic club sport stuff versus
what I had in the past but again 1500
bucks guys it's not cheap anyway if you
guys want to find some more information
about this check the description down
below you guys will see a link to
phonetics website again no kickbacks or
affiliates it's just that's the source
of where I got it from but I do actually
have an affiliate code for GT Omega down
there if you guys want to you know you
guys can help support the channel if you
guys buy any new racing seats or
cockpits or desk chairs or whatever you
can see the link to that down the
description actually save 5% it's good
in Europe as well as the United States
so I'm gonna get out of here guys I know
the video was longer than I normally
make there's a lot to talk about
it actually was like three products I
was doing a review on but with that said
I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna do
some more racing and yeah Jerry I you
always gave me a hard time about my my
setup well I think this is I think it's
time to show once and for all who is the
better sim racer so if you guys want to
see a showdown between Jerry and I and I
racing make sure you hit him up on
Twitter so hey Jay says he's better than
you I'm gonna put my money where my
mouth is I've even put money on it
alright guys time to get out of here as
always I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
