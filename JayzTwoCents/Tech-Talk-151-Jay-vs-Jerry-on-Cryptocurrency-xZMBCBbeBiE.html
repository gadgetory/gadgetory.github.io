button right there take it away says
we're streaming for the record though I
don't have the intro setup on this
machine so we don't have an intro we can
just fake it
welcome to chitchat where your old on Oh
welcome no chair junk your one-stop shop
for whatever whenever we want to do it
also - Nick is somewhere upstairs sorry
you guys have had to mute the stream I
still do that every single morning well
I had another window open over there
there's another there's another monitor
over here off screen as you guys can't
see so anyway we're back yes hiatus and
all that crap is over we were on hiatus
for two months we like we came back we
did like two shows and really gopala
days and time we're going how do you
just but this is the week most podcast
are back and this is no exception so
we're at episode 151 that's a lot of
episodes Jay I just want to call it go
ahead and call out the click Beatty
title that was on purpose Jerry and I
are actually not planning on sword
fighting on this although I think we'll
probably have very contrasting point of
views we are not planning on fighting to
the death although it was on the table
no no and I forgot to get right here oh
oh you're gonna come in with your little
husky bet oh it were all where's
bad night oh oh come on bro what do you
do scratch me to death dude I'll give
you like tetanus gonna scratch
me to dance it's all rather more rust
than metal visible so yeah you started
to ask me a question before the stream
with life she had I don't remember what
it was man stream would live by reset oh
is that that's works mmm Oh reset all
right guys we got the normal hash tag
going hashtag ask a Tech Talk if you
have a question or you can ask it in
stream the string gets a little crazy
though so yeah I think chat is pretty
much unmanageable on YouTube do you have
any moderators on YouTube I'd like to
welcome one of them is Nick and he's up
there and he he does wield that ban
hammer it just just randomly banned
people just to set an example and you
can unbanned him right afterwards but
just set an example so it's set up like
a bot in the chat such as
random it's just like a longer than
fodder for a moderator banhammer it's
just like and then you're banned for
five minutes exactly
anyway you sorta asked how things were
going in Vegas driving limos and stuff
that's fun the event to tour is pretty
quick but I'll be honest didn't it
wasn't as fast as I expected it to be it
was surprised by day it's it's a pretty
hefty car too isn't it isn't it isn't it
upwards like 3,800 3,800 pounds or
something like that I don't know but
it's also Ã©toile v12 torque and 700
horsepower oh I didn't realize had
700 horsepower that's pretty insane I
think it's just because it's so damn
stable did you did you ever get to go
for a ride in the in the Tesla the luda
no the 900 horsepower dude I still
haven't been in anything that
accelerates like that thing does and I
still don't understand about the tires
can even stick to the pavement like it
makes no sense at all it's voodoo magic
yeah doesn't have the top speed of the
crazy cars though like that Lamborghini
what is that a 218 mile an hour beast or
some like that
yeah so anyway I don't you guys think
about the set we are actually testing a
couple of things here so I'm streaming
on the FS 5 right there obviously I'm on
my normal workbench
I've got a very squeaky stool I'm
sitting on it stop speaking now the we
are using the test rig to do all this
and we're testing a new capture card
that we bought this is the elgato hd60
pro so it's the pci express capture card
and so far it doesn't seem like it's
laggy at all that was that's the best
part
so the original hd60 had some rather
serious issues some people were hitting
on older USB bus and stuff are sorry not
older PCI boards chipsets okay but the
pro I guess mitigated all that like
everybody I've heard said the pro works
just fine yeah it's really good I mean
it to get the video and audio desync :
to offset by 20 milliseconds or 25
milliseconds but we when we were trying
to do the HD 60 through USB I mean that
was like a second and a half of lag you
know what's a joke so you know they're
their cheapest capture card the USB one
called the cam link it just looks like a
USB thumb drive okay
I've got two of them zero st. correction
at all I run it on morning coffee sync
to this microphone through the mixer
board I don't have to add any offset
it's almost flawlessly real time doing
1080 60 off of
DMI off of my my sony gown oh wow but
yet yet the $400 a vio capture which it
can do 4k granted but if I do 1080 60 on
that one I have to delay it by almost a
full quarter second yeah so I'm actually
pretty surprised that they're getting
 so small and so quick now I saw a
comment go by this as J's is bigger
referring to my camera well honestly
that's because I'm having to capture his
video through skype which is ultra
compressed so the only way to make it
not look terrible is I had to shrink
Jerry down a little bit smaller than me
plus you know is my channel so I gotta
so I can't recall you're just gonna come
over to my sass pool of a twitch channel
because I don't stream on YouTube people
are poor people J that's unfortunate
dude last time we streamed on YouTube I
got like 2500 live viewers and the chat
was just spamming other people's
channels emoji just dumping
characters and there I was like what
were these people coming from some I
prefer being over on Twitch cuz they
read is mostly auto rater control
they're coming from reddit mostly just
read it and 4chan probably alright well
let's just get to it because when I put
that video out on Monday was it Monday
no Tuesday it was never intended to
create this like crazy response that
that happened so that was just more or
less let me get this out real quick that
was more or less a mental purge if you
will because that day I wanted to do
another budget build and I realized the
budget bills are not not really that all
that possible today at least not easily
you can still find graphics cards that
are not and bloated but it was it was
difficult so from the buyers perspective
I was purging and I felt better making
that video and Here I am getting tweeted
and our text message now about just
watched your mining videos it has been
non-stop coming at me and and that was
it was never intended to create this
divide in the community because the
divide is already there I didn't create
that divide yeah I probably did a poor
job at stating my perspective on that
which is the the flavor of that video
that I expected to come out that didn't
come out very well was the giant
warehouses full of data my are
cryptocurrency mining
is what's causing the problem not you
not the guy that's got 4gp you sitting
there doing this thing at home making
money on something he's already owned or
even went out and bought a handful of
graphics cards it's the guys that are
that are buying direct from Nvidia and
buying direct from AMD that are causing
this that's where my frustration lies
not what not with the you know John Doe
out there doing his thing
and I think I did a bad job at
explaining that part but man man oh man
just cryptocurrency now up there with
politics topic oh yeah oh man I was and
then and then Logan yesterday doing his
thing which he and which he had he
admitted he embellished quite a bit in
the whole like Jay standing on he know
his self-righteousness blah blah blah he
he admits that like he had we had a long
conversation behind the scenes on that
and he warned me that he was doing a
response video but he didn't warn me
that he was literally gonna try and like
drag me behind a bus I haven't seen it I
haven't seen it yet I'm gonna I'm gonna
watch it after this well that's not a
fight that we need to have we don't need
to have content creators fighting each
other no and that's what I told him I
said I'm not gonna participate in this
for views or not so that's my stance on
that and that's all I'll say on that but
so anyway to the clickbait title in the
topic we have very different
perspectives Jerry that was what I tried
to get out from that video go you you
just everybody should know you by now
especially your audience should know
that when you get enraged like you step
it up a level it's just what you do it
doesn't matter if you're talking about a
graphics card like in your test build
that like showed up and it didn't work
it was just dead on arrival I mean when
you get mad you get mad I mean people
she wasn't happy used to that I wasn't
mad though I was frustrated well
frustrated and mad are kind of
interchangeable on the internet you look
you look like you're irritated and
you're like all you goddamn minors I'm
gonna kill you for stealing all
my graphics cards like a certain point I
actually agree with you on that that
there is there is a serious problem with
supply and demand and the demand is at a
level that gaming could never provide on
its own I will admit to that I will
admit that even if every gamer on the
planet had a 1080 Ti it's probably not
gonna equate to the thirst of the crypto
miners in China okay but the thing where
we differ I think is where the problem
needs to be solved your solution to the
problem clearly from that video
cryptocurrency literally they need like
raid those buildings and kill all the
employees and burn them to the ground
that's what that's the nuke the country
it's definitely what you heard from your
perspective no I'm just okay oh and by
the way thanks for throwing me under the
bus all night you're like I'm out for
the day Barnaby I'd like that but but I
think the thing that we agree on
definitely is there is a supply and
demand issue it is artificially
increasing the cost and a lot of people
that a lot of people don't realize that
this actually screws the crypto miners
to like the crypto miners want more
cards to everybody wants more cards out
of this deal and the price is going up
like the crypto miners don't to pay
$1,200 for like a 1080 TI eventually
they'll never recoup that so they're
never there they need a cheap solution
to the problem is the new crypto
currencies that exist were created to be
mined with the GPU now therein might lie
the problem let's just say the problem
was created in the beginning weather
weather don't don't let's let's not
blame anybody for it but let's just say
when they were like you know what we
don't watch it because the whole reason
that they created like aetherium and
everything the way they did so that it
can't be mined using these cheap little
ASIC things like Bitcoin could the
reason that they did that was because of
course China is just gonna create a
million billion Asics and sell
them to everybody else for absorbent
costs and then keep the cheap ones
themselves control the entire
cryptocurrency market and it's basically
not decentralized so still owned at all
so is is the market saturation and GPUs
that were feelings specifically theory
and based yes yes not nothing to do with
this because I thought that I thought
the GPU Bitcoin mining like had kind of
fallen off a while ago into the early
years like like just to give you an idea
a a $50 ASIC like a little box with some
cheap-ass you know non ul certified
electronics will probably burn your
house down will mine faster than the
fastest graphics card today by a factor
of about a hundred when mining Bitcoin
so there's absolutely no reason to use a
GPU to Bitcoin mine so what they wanted
to do this time around is they're like
you know what let's create a
cryptocurrency the everybody can mine so
they specifically built a cryptocurrency
that is nested in memory speed in amount
of memory and since graphics cards have
the fastest memory on the plan at the
gddr5 and now we're going to the GDD r6
stuff with Samsung
they have the fastest memory and they're
cheap for the amount of memory that they
have on them comparative to them
building their own little mining units
and stuff over in China right now now as
soon as that changes and it's cheaper
for them to go and build just your boxes
with memory and an FPGA you or an ASIC
or something inside of it yeah you bet
the same things gonna happen they're
probably gonna start building out those
things are gonna start sell them you're
gonna see pressure come off the GPU
market or you may never actually see
that happen because you have so many
people that are mining on just what they
have like for instance my my computer's
here you know I've got a rendering farm
with 810 60's in it I've got my two
Titans in this system I've got nine ATS
and listen don't laugh at me I got nine
TVs in my old system but all of them
mine during their idle time I have them
all set up that when I'm not physically
here using the computer it's mining in
between all make about thirty seven
dollars a day how much load is are those
under when their money on the GPU
absolutely 100% yeah so you have to make
sure that you have the cooling like you
wouldn't it but the thing is that the
graphics cards themselves are
responsible to thermally throttle
themselves like if you stick them in a
tiny little HTPC case and you Jam a
located downstairs and jam them in the
back corner of a components you know a
component center they do throttle down
to below what their potential isn't the
same thing applies for crypto mining
except for the guys that are taking the
cards and hacking the out of them
to get them to run way above spec
because they don't need them to survive
for two or three or four years and
that's where the gamers get pissed in
the second-hand market is you have these
people that are literally breaking the
cards breaking the firmware it's
with the drivers and everything to get
the card to do more than it's supposed
to yeah well I mean I know you try to
get me to play around with mining in the
past but the electricity costs here
really cut into that profit margin yeah
it would kind of make sense but it
wouldn't really in the long term so yeah
I mean I like I like that that video
brought a lot of views it wasn't
necessarily the intention it's I mean I
guess the title was a little bit
embellished right it's cryptocurrency
killing the game killing PC gaming to a
degree it kind of kind of is it's it's
killing the amount of people that can
get into it I think as first-timers it's
killing off the people that can upgrade
it's just creating that supply and
demand issue that's think it's too many
people want the cards not enough cards
to go around economic 101 very simple
and why
so many people can't understand that but
let's talk about the let's talk about
the solution because so many people I
see on Twitter like well I should just
build more cards and that's like saying
the graphics card company is
intentionally limiting their profit by
intentionally not making more of them
when they could they can't right now
they are at capacity they are at Full
Tilt that you can only you can only make
the silicon wafer so fast you can only
cute make make the product soak fast and
stay within QC margins so then they hear
people say well they should just go out
there and build more factories but if
you if your Foxconn or your Nvidia or
your AMD or Global Foundries
let's are you gonna run out and suddenly
invest hundreds of billions of our
millions of dollars in creating a new
factory on something that says volatile
that's cryptocurrency let's save you
that if you did you might be dumbest
 yeah so that so that's not a
solution no we have no there we are in a
spot right now we are we're in an
unprecedented never explored never
experienced tech junction in our future
and I don't I don't know what's gonna
happen
I mean it's worrisome maybe if this
sticks around then production does ramp
up and then we get we get cost to come
back down to normal which only makes
cryptocurrency more profitable because
there's less adoption cost to get the
graphics cards and then there's still
plenty to go around for the mainstream
market but but what about all of the
news against governments trying to ban
it and this and that I mean
so obviously the some of the major
dropped this week was because of Korea's
ruling to ban cryptocurrency
yeah what a response to that well it
scares a lot of people that's why you
see the market crash whenever this
happen the same thing happened in China
not but a couple of months ago they
caused another similar crash it wasn't
nearly on the same scale though for some
reason I couldn't tell you why that was
but the crash was because people get
afraid and they're like oh governments
are banning this currency we can't use
anymore let's get the out of it
before you lose our money how does the
government ban it first of all they
can't exactly just it the only thing
that they can do is they can prevent it
from being accepted for buying goods and
services they can basically say that
it's illegal in our country for you to
spend a Bitcoin or spend aetherium or
whatever to buy something something it's
not like they can track those
transactions they can't track the
transactions number one and number two
you can always train
act it back into real money which will
then be wired from an exchange back into
whatever account you want wherever you
want on the planet and it's cold hard
cash at that point how does it have a
taxes play and then here's where it gets
a little bit dicey okay because you've
got capital gains to worry about you do
yeah you either you either do it one of
two ways either you run your own crypto
qualit crypto wallet and use offshore
exchanges which conceals your money and
there's no way the government ever knows
what you did like they can dig as deep
as they want unless you make
egregious errors they're never gonna be
able to find out or you can be like me
that just doesn't want to go to federal
pound-me-in-the-ass prison and use
something like coin base which is a
domestic exchange that actually reports
to the IRS and issues me in actual was
it the ten night not 1099 what's the one
that they issue for your dividends I
know I know anytime oh yeah yeah yeah
yeah they basically they send me that at
the end of the year and say this is how
much your gains was under the proceeds
on your sales and then I have to report
that the IRS is short term capital gains
or long term depending on how long I had
the bitcoins so this has nothing to do
with cryptocurrency but there's a
potentially a lot of people who cashed
in because because you're you're having
there's two sides to this you have the
miners the guys that are going out there
and and farming these coins and and
discovering them and solving the math
equations or whatever right and then you
have the market where people are not
mining this they're just playing the
stock market they're buying low selling
high buying low selling high so you've
got two sides to this but I'm wondering
how many people out there that are
inexperienced with the tax sides of
capital gains who just cashed in
millions on you know when the when the
Bitcoin was almost twenty thousand
dollars he said at the end of the year
are gonna get reamed with the taxes that
they're not expecting because they
cashed out into regular cash through
standard you know transactions so I'm
kind of wondering what that figure looks
like but I mean that's totally off topic
that's me from what I've seen honestly
I'm gonna say it in ninety five percent
of the people out there they're
around a crypto currency like just now
if they're watching the stream found out
for the first time they have to give
some of it to the IRS everybody thinks
it's imaginary monopoly money and then
it's no different than trading or no
money man yeah cuz like you pay taxes
when you go sell your gun skins
from counter-strike go like you don't do
pay taxes and all those those one-off
crate craigslist buy and sell exactly
exactly you don't you don't you don't
nobody does so everybody treats
cryptocurrency in the same way and if
you trade it in short volume I you
don't really have to worry about it too
much but yeah the government's gonna
notice if all of a sudden your bank
account goes up by like 92 million
dollars and it was transferred to you
from a company that isn't exchanging
cryptocurrency like the IRS is gonna be
able to draw that parallel and come
after thing is the thing is if the
company is on the up-and-up they're
gonna report they're gonna report the
money transfer to you to the IRS because
they're gonna they're gonna report that
as a as a as a loss or distribution or
whatever however it's it's actually
coded and then the government is gonna
be trans they're gonna check the
transcripts and see if you report it
that money and what you don't
audit so it's gonna be it's gonna be
interesting to see where that goes yeah
I kind of hate this discussion to be
honest because I truly am a devil's
advocate here I can see both sides of it
I just I just choose I just choose to be
upset about the pricing of the market
anyone can blame you for that it's
amazing how many people are just like
really I underestimate the amount people
that are super invested into this and
then unfortunately there's a lot of
people commenting who truly don't have
any idea what's going on guys
talking about I got a lot of that yeah
your video they're like oh we were
unaware that this was creating a problem
then what happens is then other people
are like they weren't on you know team
gaming or team crypto mining until they
figured out that it existed and other
vocal friends come out and then they're
like I'm just gonna go join their camp
you know it's the whole whole Democrats
versus Republicans argument right are
you a gamer you're miner but people
don't realize that most of the people
that are mining today and I'm talking
about individuals not about the
corporations in China they're building
the big mines and stuff but most of us
are individuals I mean in this room
right now I have eight GPUs and that to
it and one I mean how many people have
like you know 211 GPUs in there in one
bedroom of their house that's not
counting the other ones and I mean those
are not primarily mining they're just
they're just during idle cycles mining
I've got a lot I got a lot over here but
I don't I don't pretend that I bought
those it may it's pretty obvious as
those were sent you know sponsored
content and stuff but brings up that
point where people are talking about you
know the supply and demand all crypto
miners are buying up all the GPS and we
can't get well they're really just
buying them through the same avenue that
you could in the price is getting hyped
because they know they can get it yeah
right I mean that that's that's what
it's the demand of both the gamers and
the cryptocurrency guys basically duking
it out to the highest bidder they were
just uncontested before and the other
thing that I want to point out that a
lot of people aren't taking into effect
years they're like
those cards gaming cards they weren't
designed for anything else you take
those away from gamers doom for
kryptonite okay guys a lot of people
render Jay has rendering machines that
don't game or don't game a lot that are
designed for video render you use CUDA
right well octo uses CUDA uses the
floating-point unit and CUDA and the API
so to say that you're not allowed to run
this program but I've talked about that
in my video I said that GPUs are being
used for all sorts of things that aren't
gaming for instance professional
workloads and stuff yeah I specifically
mentioned that my graphics cards spend
more time making videos for me and doing
my color correction and all that stuff
than actually playing games which is
very very true I guess that's a devil's
advocate conversation though because it
is that's not creating a strain on the
supply and demand either you know it's
really not a revenue stream right you
make videos using the card to make money
right people are just skipping the
middleman they're literally using the
cards to make money all Jeep's in that
system were paid for in four months it
is a it is a small puzzle piece to the
entire to the entire operation we have
going here that makes me money that's
not the thing that makes me money like
it does recouped of currency yeah that's
what I'm saying you cut out the
middleman right it's you're quite
literally using the thing you bought to
pay for itself and that's work but like
I just said though that's where I
disagree with you because that's a very
small portion of how I make my money
doing this business it's not the thing
that makes me money you out it though
you you have to have those graphics
cards like even if they're a small part
of your business without them you have
no ability to make videos no that's not
true I could I could use I could use an
iris internal Intel and take you know
forever with you would you Jay would you
I got a lot of mine point on my
razor phone here but he's gonna get me
very far actually I mean I did that
video showing that the the render
difference in premiere versus having any
kuda card it did matter if I ran a told
660 or new Titan XP the render time was
the same with any graphics card in there
versus without and the one without was
about a hundred percent slower so yeah
we kind of blame Adobe for that one we
can if somebody would resolve was having
this conversation to be a whole
different a whole different story
god damnit Joel telling if you're
watching right now would you please
Hardware accelerate everything in Adobe
Premiere
were not all forced to switch to DaVinci
Resolve cuz I really hate the
timeline in DaVinci Resolve it does
hardware-accelerated just does it to a
very slow you know very like it uses
like five percent of the GPUs what is it
what you you use the noise plug-in right
and premier what noise noise plug-in to
use for like reducing the noise in your
video meet video yeah see that's why
everybody uses neat even even Joel
recommended that to me and the funny
thing is every time I use a neat video
it slows the render speed down by a
massive magnitude on my system yet you
go to DaVinci Resolve and it like slows
it down by like an extra like ten
minutes
yeah correction the whole thing I don't
I don't use it very often because we
don't shoot with the Atmos all that
often we actually spend more so more
time now with the fs7 or even the a7 but
yeah the the noise the plug-in
definitely is slow but again the best
premiere yeah we're addicted we have to
use it but but but I guess I guess it
just comes down to if you're as long as
you're utilizing the graphics card for
something that's within the scope of the
graphics card capability like for
instance CUDA you definitely don't have
to use CUDA the game they can take CUDA
away from the card and you can still
game without it because not a lot of
games utilize the CUDA API they actually
just use the DirectX API so so you want
to solve your problem hey we just did
Nvidia and ATI take CUDA off all your
gaming cards only put them on your quad
roots out of the reach of the miners you
just solved the entire problem for
everybody and then Jay and I just have
to spend $5,000 to get a card
that renders the same as the one that
was like any hundred bucks and then and
then I guess I'm a hypocrite because
I'll spend $5,000 on them because I need
them to do my work my video production
schedule does it look like an four to
five thousand dollar I do it though I'd
have to we'd have to know actually you
know what I'll do I'll just offload the
work to a contractor he doesn't make
anything and let them worry about it but
then the contract to China where all the
boy where all the mines are that were
bitching about I just get back an
animated anime video of my review that
is very that is insensitive sir I I do
particularly like you tweet though where
you were like well I hope you only use
gaming peripherals on your computer and
only use them for gaming and not typing
emails and you know if you if you really
want to be super anal about that you
could also say that mechanical keyboards
who never intended to be gaming
keyboards this conversation could go a
million different ways it could but
nothing pisses me off more Jay
when somebody is fighting a battle
doesn't matter what the context doesn't
matter if it's political doesn't matter
if it's like we're talking about
graphics cards when they're fighting a
battle and they don't realize that
they're completely on the other side of
their argument for something that is
exactly the same in another category or
another space but that's because we're
all invested in a certain perspective
and of course we have our own our own
unique you know circumstances that yeah
that apply to us and trotty net
neutrality right that's that's that's a
big thing you know the hell we should
even talk about you got all these
companies like Comcast they're like you
know what we're gonna charge you an
extra 40 bucks to watch porn the second
that Ajit PI says that we can buy tickle
your net neutrality like no internet
freedom we should be able to use the
internet for whatever you want if we pay
for it and then they're fine like you
should not mine on your graphics cards
it's like all I'm doing is getting net
neutrality for my graphics card I just
bought I wanna be able to use it for
another I want
do we have 5,000 viewers in here that's
our biggest show yet that's gotta be by
a pretty good magnitude usually we're
sitting right around 3,000 or so yeah
that's a big I guess people care about
this topic you know you want about the
irony of all of this is is my my I don't
wanna say I guess loyalty is the right
word I'm I'm pretty loyal to the gaming
community I really am but I hardly play
games anymore you know but I said but I
I still treat a lot of what I do from
the perspective of the buyer we're in
that same boat too by the way even
though I cryptocurrency mine if I had to
pick between one or the other I would
pick gaming over mining so I would say
the same as you even though I don't game
a whole lot that's the camp that my
heart my heart is in I had I had a few
people reach out to me after that video
and say that their entire business and
their ability to pay their employees and
stuff is because of mining so I that's
why I made the first parts just the
system builders right no I'm talking no
no I'm talk about people who've actually
created a business on mining that that
allows that allows their that allows
their them to employ people so they've
created it like like me or I've got
people that rely on this business to
succeed now like stockbrokers they built
a drill mark market yep right but at the
same time what frustrates me is the
amount of people that just want to pick
and choose little things I said of that
video and only listen to this but not
listen to this and then you know they
tune out here so because I specifically
said in there that
well what I said was Gummer gamers would
love for cryptocurrency to just pop and
disappear and go away but then I
specifically said what about those
people that haven't that have created
livelihoods and jobs and careers based
on this what we figure I missed that too
so they sure you should go back and
listen because else but because what
else is sitting there is what's the what
is the what is the commercial and
economic impact going to be if they fall
out of people who have invested massive
amounts of money in this and when that
fails what's the domino effect there see
I said all that but nobody wanted to
hear that nobody wanted to listen to
that and that's what's frustrating yeah
the whole selective hearing they they
all they wanted to hear is what they
came to watch on the video and that is
either to be in one camp or the other
not to straddle the line so I do that
we've had donations kind of rolling in
and in typical fashion guys we don't
stop and read them in real time like we
used to because we want to keep the flow
of the show going but this one I had to
David couch says I paid $50 to tell you
to suck my balls you know what I know a
lot of prostitute male prostitutes who
don't get paid 50 bucks to suck on balls
so I'd say you're after he's ridden a
bike for 50 miles wearing long johns in
the summer flavors flavortown Oh
labor country oh my god people losing
their livelihood like every crash you
know I did say that I did say that on
Twitter though I said it's no different
though than the guy that plays the stock
market and puts his entire livelihood on
volatile stocks and losses you know it's
day trading it's literally day trading I
know a lot of crypto miners out there
I'll be triggered that I said that but
but I know day traders that are
millionaire as a matter of fact one of
my friends names Tom hooli then I worked
with a Microsoft he was just a vendor he
was like a vendor there he was like
low-level vendor and he was just working
there just to make ends meet he was day
trading during the day and the margin
which is really dangerous guys don't
understand that basically he was
borrowing money to invest if he loses it
he's screwed so he was basically losing
his ass the entire time I was at
Microsoft he left just just talk to him
again after like three years for the
first time his portfolio is worth over
two million dollars he lives in the
Ukraine just from day trading well you
know that's the thing though is you have
to invest wisely and not not put it all
in one basket and then what should it's
a fan you got it you got to endure but
it's all odds everything's a risk you
don't have a guarantee to weigh it like
Jay honestly as successful as you
are doing what you're doing if you wake
up tomorrow and YouTube's like we
decided we're only gonna do Jimmy Fallon
I'm just going with that whole
stereotype we're only doing Jimmy Fallon
get the off our platform and they
just closed your channel and you get an
email that's like we closed your channel
because you don't look like Jimmy Fallon
um let's say that happens you would
still recover because you diversify
enough to do that but it would be a
pretty heavy blow now let's say that
everything else shifts did Amazon comes
back says it we're closing down our
affiliate program which I know that's
gonna happen at some point but we're
doing that all this stuff like a house
of cards we're not guaranteed anything
all we can do is go with our best bet
and diversify as much seemingly possible
but let's be honest everybody can be out
of business in a second you know it's
just a crypto currency guys tend to be
putting a little bit too many eggs in
one basket yeah I mean that's fair
enough I mean any youtuber that's it
doesn't matter if you're pewdiepie or
you're the the Logan we're you know
whoever the hell they are now yeah
they're brothers right some crazy yeah
Jake Jake and Logan they are absolutely
brothers and their channels are equally
cancer okay so you got those guys and
then you've got you've got the most the
much smaller guys like myself yeah we've
all built our business on the on the on
the foundation of someone else's
business yeah and and my goal the moment
I saw that this was turning into a
career was to create a business of my
own that if that day comes like you're
talking about as probably when that day
comes let's be real yeah that I can that
I can be agile enough to just move on to
something else and take an audience with
me exactly and a lot of people don't do
that oh the problem is we have a lot of
we have we have more self-made
millionaires young millionaires than
ever yeah and most of them do not have
the maturity to know how to properly
invest their money that's the reality of
it I mean you've got you've got
youtubers you've got youtubers out there
driving Lamborghinis and GTRs that are
all you know custom one-off that are
like $200,000 because they're getting
this taste of success but the thing is
they live they live so stretched beyond
their means that they rely on the tens
of thousands of dollars that come in a
month as they're mapped a month which is
ridiculous yeah and I grew up dirt poor
is most you know if you've if you've
watched any of my over the years I
grew up dirt poor so I kind of have this
built-in trigger mechanism in the back
of my head
they I lived so far below my means like
every time I go get a loan for like a
house when we bought this house they're
like oh you're spending power you could
get two times this house at the time
when I was working at Microsoft well
glad I didn't because Microsoft laid me
off and I got thrown into this and had I
not had a buffer I wouldn't have been
able to make that transition like I and
even today like if if it wasn't for me
living below my means I would not be
doing this I'd be back at a job I'd be
forced to yeah I mean at least you had
that buffer yeah well doesn't matter if
you know and another thing too is it you
probably still get people to tell you
that like your job isn't real or I'll
get a real job or blah blah blah even
your level I imagine line and see if it
gets that but the thing people
don't realize is everybody works for
somebody else there there really is
nobody at the top of the food chain it's
just secular right yeah it's like
there's always somebody reporting to
somebody else it's like when I get an
affiliate sale through Amazon that's
Amazon feeding you and when the ads
served on YouTube that's YouTube's
feeding me when I'm on Twitch and
somebody is watching the show is
gracious enough to give me a tip or
something like that that's them directly
supporting me but they're my boss there
my boss there my boss there my boss
there is no I am the CEO even though
technically you are the CEO of your
company you even bow it to the IRS right
you have this company with their
handouts and give us money or we will
end you don't I know so we all work for
somebody it doesn't if you go to your
job and you sit behind a desk and you
program you get a paycheck from the
company you are absolutely no different
than Jay and I we both get checks - as a
matter of fact Jay you are the commander
of your company and you know as a
business owner you have to pay yourself
how silly does that sound like oh yeah
money you do YouTube you they send you
money you got money okay no you have to
actually pay yourself it's crazily
progress I have to pay myself an amount
that is that is considered in alignment
with my position in the company yep so
for instance I couldn't be the the CEO
and president of this corporation and
pay myself $100 a week and then take
distributions on everything that way I
can have a lesson you know Social
Security impacted all that stuff those
closure I did I did try to get that past
my bookkeeper know is a work that I just
pay myself $15 an hour so I can get the
insurance and they're like well because
because when it was specially when
you're an escort but it passes back
through you
it's scrutinize you're scrutinized as an
individual and they're gonna be like you
know you know there's a there's a
Thursday
there's a ratio that has to be
maintained there and the problem is that
guys the business makes more and stuff
you have to pay yourself more and as you
do that you pump up your tax brackets
and everything so the government gets
more from you so there's a lot of
creative shuffling that happens with you
when you're in this business but this is
a good transition into our next topic
which we want to talk about which is
YouTube's new policies regarding the
thousand subscribers or more plus here
I'm gonna pull up my Google Doc I'm
doing it a video on it it's is it 4,000
hours watched or five that's six pages
of bullet points it's four thousand
hours per calendar year and I even did
the math a lot of people are freaking
out going oh my god four thousand hours
that's unobtainium just to give you guys
an idea that's only 11 hours four that's
across your entire channel so if you
have 50 videos total viewership for an
entire 24 hour period 11 hours or 660
minutes and then for the people who
can't do the math it only means you need
66 people a day to watch a single
10-minute video okay I love I love that
you have six points or six pages of
bullet points on that cuz I look at they
have nothing but my raw reaction to that
and I don't think people are gonna like
my reaction here let it let us have it
I'm here I'm curious to see how you're
thinking the lines of mine when I
started this channel and ever did it to
make money yeah here comes soap right
just Jay again Logan hope you're
watching same here I I never did I
didn't even know you can make money when
when I made a thought when I had a
thousand subscribers I think I had just
passed something like 20,000 views
somewhere that I don't remember I'd
remember that far back it was straight
up a hobby and I can guarantee you that
those that are under that threshold are
not living off this income anyway okay
okay so just under a hundred dollars per
calendar year that's that's they said
95% of the people were under a hundred
dollars per calendar year divided by
that many months you're talking what
less than ten dollars a month like it's
something dollars yeah that is not
affecting anyone's bottom line of
survival when you start making enough
money to actually live off this you're
so far beyond that particular threshold
yeah that it didn't impact you I mean
okay you might be able to buy two less
coffees a month but you are not you
YouTube is not killing content creators
they're not killing people's livelihoods
with big I honestly feel like it's still
too low I feel like it should be much
higher if they truly want to stop the
people that are out there spam
accounting and stuff because that's
their idea what this is they're trying
to stop the bots accounts and the spam
accounts that will automatically steal
videos rip them and reupload them and
take you know pennies per video but when
they do thousands at a time they
actually make money that way yeah
actually in my video I'm gonna talk
about the whole reason why they picked
specifically hours of viewership over
actual views because there's actually a
rhyme and reason to it and it has to do
a tour and bot networks like now you
literally cannot mobilize a hundred
thousand views on a video when every
single bot has to literally sit there
and download the video the bandwidth
requirements and everything are huge
whereas before I just had to view the
video for a millisecond and stop and
that counted as a view so here's the
thing let's talk about this real quick
Midnight Madness 4x4 in chess as I was
making 200 a month if he was making 200
a month because he was getting that many
views per month
he obviously exceeds the hours watched
but he's but he doesn't if he doesn't
have a thousand subscribers something's
wrong there yeah how can you get that
many that many views a $200 a month
probably equates to I want to I want to
say it's gonna be something like a
hundred maybe 80 to $100,000 dollars
views a month to make that kind of money
based on the adblock rate that people
are using it the CPM cut and all that so
if your team like you're factoring that
on your CPM to when you're a new channel
and a small channel your CPM is only
like two three bucks no I remember what
mine was when I said it's that's what
I'm going off of yep if you if you're
able to bring in enough views so you
bring in $200 a month but you don't have
a thousand subscribers based on the meta
views you're getting per month my
question is what is your content and why
aren't people subscribing to you yeah
there's a gap there that doesn't make
sense I mean as a content creator myself
that's exactly what I think of so
YouTube is not out to destroy the new
content creator they're not out there
trying to stop new channels from growing
it only behaves them to get more
channels bringing in more unique
viewership bringing them more more
revenue generation I'm really glad that
you have this point of view on it
because everybody else doesn't seem to
have this point of view like even buggy
I mean we love buggy but boogies view is
definitely for the for the content
creators now watch this video last night
and I was like actually really liked his
video he touched on a really really good
points and kept people motivated
everything but you know he'd prefer that
everybody get the same opportunity and
everything but hold
just a second I took it one step further
and guys I've done my research on this
I'm not need York reaction I've got six
pages of bullet points that I've
painstakingly put together from hours of
research which if you ask Jade that's
uncharacteristic of me big time
I usually just turn on the camera I just
 blow out my mouth but
anyways they blow out my mouth anyway
well let's get right over that little
Jay chuckles um after looking at this
I'm gonna tell you guys I mean we don't
have to go into all the detail on the
bullet points but after looking at this
I can tell you right now the YouTube has
actually done all those serious small
channels a huge favor cuz this is a huge
opportunity so okay now think about this
currently YouTube has a problem where
there's about a couple hundred thousand
new channels pop coming up every single
day from these BOTS that literally
create the channel they download a bunch
of content they basically do a search
grab the top search results for that
content upload it to their channel and
then they pollute SEO and then they
might only get like 14 hits per video or
whatever before that channel ultimately
gets shut down and then they get so the
Amana channels saturating the SEO is
gonna go down
correct correct so so now here's what's
gonna happen is every person that
contacted me said oh my god I've been
working years trying to grow my channel
and I can't get more than a couple of
views per video and nobody's finding my
content it's all the big guy's fault
it's all the big no that's terrible SEO
yeah it's actually the terrible SEO
caused by the cancer and that's why so
think of it like a garden you guys are
the flowers the serious people creating
content but the weeds are starving you
out and you can never get your head
above the weeds because the weeds are
just eating your lunch they're eating
your new treats they're taking
everything away so I was looking at this
and I was like hold on a second okay so
4,000 hours that's hard for the bot
Network to do and still remain
profitable by the time they spend all
the bandwidth or they they use the
botnet for that long it in the end it
doesn't become profitable to them and
that's why YouTube picked those specific
numbers is to kind of coordinate with
how things are happening right now I'm
not saying that the system can't be
gamed and defeated but it's much much
harder and it's much less profitable
which means there's more advertisements
to put on legitimate channels because
right now it's a lottery there's not
enough ads to go around for the number
of videos even Jay because there's not
up one percent bucket yet I don't think
you are anyways at 1.3 million now the
problem is in Linus I talked about this
a while back is we're we're still
growing but the problem is so is
everyone up top so the continues to grow
and I think I know I'm in top I know I'm
Way above top 5% I've been the top
percent for a long time but I are you in
preferred because once you're in
preferred where you basically get the
preferred ads and YouTube clears you to
like just get like the best the best
highest CPM ads uh I believe I'm
preferred but I'm also managed so oh
you're a managed channel then yeah you
probably your size would probably be
preferred okay I don't know to be honest
I don't even look at the Adsense have
you had any of your videos just randomly
D monetized or do they all just stay
monetized
I have not had a single video get be
monetized there and you're probably in
that program because basically they're
trusting you they basically put you in a
thing saying that we trust this guy we
don't have I said I don't even know I
got people that do that for me so I know
you're smart no I don't look at it I
don't I don't look at it so let me let
me let me continue on why this is this
is a huge thing for small creators
because now that all this cancer is
gonna die and it's gonna die fast guys
it's not like oh my god these these
channels are gonna stick around they're
not because what's gonna happen is
they're not gonna get the relevance
people aren't gonna watch the content
because they're not making any money and
they're not uploading any videos and
overtime they're just gonna die out
they're gonna get pushed to the bottom
of the pile and then YouTube will sweep
them away just like they do every couple
of months when you see a downturn and
subscribers that's them deleting these
channels it's usually at 1 a.m. and then
I like every Thursday at 1 a.m. it's
like it's exactly when they don't think
anybody's sitting there just spamming
socialblade but then you wake up in the
morning you're like what happened
subscribers ok so so think about it this
way guys so let's say you have a new
channel you've been working on new
channel you've been working on it for 3
years and you don't meet the
requirements well I can tell you with
reasonable certainty unless your content
absolutely is garbage which I'm afraid
there are some of you out there and he
was literally trying to drive you off
the platform at this point 5,500 viewers
now what the heck man 5,500 that's crazy
we've never save yours so think about it
this way so those guys are all gonna all
gonna quit the ones that are like
this I'm not getting my $10 a month I'm
out I've already gotten like a dozen
people say this I'm going to
Facebook which oh my god that's the
dumbest thing I've ever heard because
Facebook just steals all your content
never gives you money and if you thought
clickbait was better on YouTube exactly
exactly and Facebook actually like
supports it and puts their legal team
behind letting these like Soflo
just like pulling the entropy so so
let's say that all these guys leave the
boat you get rid of these hundreds of
thousands of channels a day and the bots
just stop creating the channels because
it's it's it's literally costing them
more money than if they're not making
any money at it right so that means
there's more ads
go around now so now if you are in the
partner program that means that you're
making a higher CPM you're getting more
ads on your videos you're making more
money for the same amount of views they
knew what if it wasn't there now you're
probably thinking but I'm I can't
ever get there I can't ever hit that bar
it's it's unobtainium for me based on
your current trajectory well keep in
mind current trajectory is only the way
it is because of the ecosystem YouTube
literally changed the ecosystem so that
the weeds will die and the people that
are passionate about creating content
will stick around and that you're gonna
start seeing a curve if you watch your
analytics over time and you upload on
the schedule and delight your tags you
do your description everything you're
gonna start seeing yourself rapidly
rising where you didn't before because
so many of these scam channels and in
fake channels and they're not have to
deal with a billion DMCA things
from these channels and content matching
system YouTube's actually gonna be able
to focus on more content creators sell
ads for more money and get more ads on
videos and the partner program which
means you're gonna get to the partner
program or faster and then once you're
there you're gonna be making way more
money than you ever would sitting
stagnant because these guys just kept
standing on your head
yeah no I agree because it's gonna it's
gonna take time for it to fix itself but
but also to blame for this because they
remember about two years ago you and I
were driving down a PDX Lam and the news
broke and I was reading it from my phone
about how they were changing the mana
the the mana channel how all videos were
gonna have to be vetted before they
would be automatically monetized I
remember that they never followed
through with that they didn't they never
followed through with that where they
what they wanted to do was push all of
it onto the MCMC MTN's didn't want to
take responsibility for it so YouTube
just left the current system in place
which led to where we are today I just
wanna I want talk about clickbait titles
were quick because everyone looks
everyone loves to call things clickbait
right if it got your click suddenly its
clickbait suddenly but what I've noticed
is even mainstream media is having such
a hard time competing with new media
which is honestly where we reside yeah
it's it's sad when even like major news
outlets use clickbait for instance this
is the CNN title today things are so bad
that you can't even get one daughter a
dollar out of a bank here okay that's
the title the next one Bill Gates made
these 15 predictions
1999 and it's scary how accurate he was
that's Business Insider oh my god this
one is this one is a site called eat
this we ranked America's most popular
chain restaurants number four will shock
you is the icon for that that thing
boobs no it's a it's a it's like a
shitty looking burger here's one Michael
Douglas accused of sexual harassment
katy perry was a ripe late to the idol
set it's like okay that's not really
clickbait as much it's like this wait I
need a retard right now
grab his drawers at that point yeah
Taylor Swift's alleged stalker made
these chilling threats yeah that was
from Wonderwall it's it's almost like
old media is trying to be trendy again
by copying the worst trait of new media
right like absolutely that is the worst
trait today that YouTube is trying to
kill yep why you should switch to LED
light bulbs right now The Washington
Post I know they make it sound like it's
dangerous or something if you don't like
yeah oh my god what's gonna happen I
don't wanna talk about all the abusive
parent stuff going on in Paris
California which is like only 20 minutes
from here by the way
let's see flu death prompts warnings
from victims families as outbreak
continues that's Fox that's not really a
click gate article but you see don't say
no when you've got major major news
outlets using clickbait like that I I
don't think the things like okay this
the title of this stream was click bait
and purpose I think even you laughed
when you read it it's ironic click bait
as what it is I mean we weren't trying
to be serious and like get you in here
just to view it
there was actually a tag I put in here
because there's a lot of people that use
add-ons and browser plugins like we do
to see the tags on videos you can always
tell who's trying to tag things you know
dishonestly but I actually had a tag in
there that said doctors hate me for
revealing this simple life hack that
will make you lose weight and get all
the hot chicks but it told me the tag
was too long you remember back when I
used to tweet I went through like a
whole like month where all I did was
just like tweet all the words as
hashtags yeah and then I eventually just
got yelled at by yelled at by people and
they just start everything was
unsub unsub unsub and sometimes like
okay as price time doing that yeah I was
I was I was basically trying to
with their system because all the hat if
you put a hashtag before a word on any
platform you're basically creating an
entry in one of their tables and their
base you're eating up their storage and
you're eating up their bandwidth every
time you create a new hashtag hasn't
been used before so if you literally
created a bot that just tweeted hashtag
garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage
garbage garbage garbage just ran that on
thousands of thousands of account you'd
literally cost a millions of dollars
Caleb says Donald Trump has heart
disease saw that today yesterday when I
was actually having this clickbait
conversation with Nick and my wife the
article read something along the lines
of like Doctor discovers like doctor
discover serious heart problem with
Donald Trump and my response was yeah
they found out he doesn't have one after
his doctor the White House doctor
cleared him and said that he's exactly
one pound under being obese because they
added Jonah Oh to make him taller they
did you say they're like wait a second
twelve months ago he was made shorter
right where do you get an extra inch it
was just to put him one pound under
being obese cuz he didn't want the
public like thinking he was obese so we
have spent the first half of the show
talking about the cryptocurrency stuff
which I don't know people necessarily
put a cap on that other than their the
future is cryptocurrency is more than
likely not going anywhere
you've got the amount of people that
love the the fact that is it is a
currency outside of the realm of big
bank and government control at least as
far as we know that the government can
control it I want to talk about one more
thing with that but quick I saw a lot of
people saying crypto currencies not a
currency into that I would call
there's anything that you can spend is a
currency yeah some can even argue that
it's actually more of a currency than
standard fiat paper currency because
sencence decentralized the value is
global you cannot only that they're like
we're not gonna take your dollar not
only that there are more Federal Reserve
notes aka the US dollar in circulation
that there actually is gold backing it
and that's been that since like the 90s
or 80s or something no way since like
the 50s I understand yeah there
there is there is more there's more
paper currency in circulation so if
everyone straight-up called in their
debt right yeah they're like hey you owe
me this much in gold there's not enough
there's not enough
precious metals or whatever is backing
it anymore that's the crater um Vsauce
was a Vsauce who is either Vsauce or
vice I think was Vsauce I she did a
really good video about how much
currency is in circulation in the world
versus all the banks backing the
currency and how it's something like 40
times over what's actually in existence
in terms of cold hard currency not just
the notes so it's scary but I can see
that aspect of the cryptocurrency and I
just want to call to everyone's
saying that cryptocurrencies not a real
currency because if you can spend it and
get something for it trade it or barter
it it's a currency that's true and
cryptocurrency has a direct path the
converting to any other denomination
social difference they're confusing the
term denomination and currency correct
crystal it's just it's a global
denomination it's literally accepted by
anybody that is in cryptocurrency J not
knowing we've been off the gold standard
since the Nixon administration I just
said I just say no he said that I was
the one that said that I thought it was
like 80s 90s he was the one that was
like back in the 50 60 so anyway
people not listening again and then yeah
the YouTube thing so what I want to do
now is the one I want to lift this up a
little bit I see a lot of people going
what the hell better this was talking
about cryptocurrency you're late guys
you're about 50 minutes late to this
conversation so yeah we can talk about
whatever we want now you want talk about
well actually before before we tie that
up I just want to be crystal clear that
we do agree on a couple of things just
so that we don't have people coming at
us thinking that we don't what what do
we agree on I think I think from from
what I've what I've vetted during this
conversation I think we both agree that
cryptocurrency though of no blame to the
people that just want to get into it and
just use the graphic cards it is causing
a supply and demand issue it is that's
without there's no debating that it's
right and that and that isn't going away
that is gonna be a constant and ongoing
problem so literally the only way that
we can see to solve this right now if
graphics cards are still used for mining
let's just assume that that has to
happen it doesn't look like that's gonna
change would be for Nvidia AMD and
anybody else creating GPUs that combine
the to disable the features of
their card that allow for the mining
okay which screws us which screws is the
less than two it's only screws everybody
you know this one pissed me off is
everything oh my god AMD and
for the gamer they're trying to stop
this cryptocurrency blow brick of a
thousand cards like directly from Nvidia
that's what I was just gonna say is I
had I had some people on the inside
feeding me information through email
like they always do which I never bother
repeating and even saying us a source
not a source close to the subject not
authorized to comment on the matter says
I'm not gonna pull that mainstream his
name is his name is Jim and he works in
but let's just say I was fed a lot of
information about how these about how
these manufacturers are welcoming the
the removal of the middleman like the
board partners and then even that
retailers selling direct because they
they take more of that profit that way
and they have been and they had been
doing that since the beginning and the
whole time and and the to face that goes
on between we're for the gamer we're for
the gamer we're for the gamer and the
whole time they're over here like
shuffling over to these guys we're
propaganda for the gamers you're exposed
that what video was that that you
exposed that in where basically they
were being I think was like in videos
I'm one of those faces it was a indeed
it was it's much exposed because they
talked about themselves but AMD was like
we we understand mining is putting a
strain on the on the community and we
were for the gamers and then they came
out with a mining BIOS yeah yeah they
literally like modify the BIOS to make a
more effective mining card but as they
knew that some writers change remaining
optimize drivers for Vegas specifically
yeah and to be in to be fair i if you
think about it just yep sometimes have
to put your business hat on i have to
play devil's advocate to myself all
times i want to be a certain way i
want fat people to be healthy all the
time and just be able to fly and drive
expensive cars and but i don't fit
in them but anyway it's like that grass
I'm just saying that if a company can
sell their product and it's a guaranteed
sell and they can get that money and not
having to risk lose it later that's the
Avenue they're gonna take no matter what
I mean short of selling the cards to
 terrorists that are like
throwing them innocent families and
killing them because those heats are
heavy can do damage al Qaeda al Qaeda is
gonna start farming bitcoins instead of
opiate exactly and actually that's know
what's funny is there actually is truth
there and I had somebody the other day
say we need to ban crypto Kurt you were
on that thread we're here we need to ban
cryptocurrency because being used for
terrorism and drugs and all this smells
like how is that any different than any
other paper currency that's ever been
made are they I saw that but if there
were so many tweets that came out me the
last
I probably read like a twentieth of them
like one out of every 20 I actually read
so cryptocurrency not going anywhere
okay that the only way that we're gonna
solve the GPU supply demand issue and
the cost issue is if the the board
partners that are building these cards
somehow draw a delineation which they're
not gonna do because they're making so
much money right now and they're
guaranteed to sell their product
somebody was like hey you know what
micro Center should do like they do with
the Intel chips not only do like one per
customer okay let me tell you the
problem with that is let's say the ten
80s right they have they get a load
of 10 80s in and the cryptocurrency guy
comes up and he's gonna buy them all at
one go for that price that day he's like
I want all 12,000 your cards to give you
a million billion dollars they're not
gonna just sell him one because then
what happens when the gamers come in and
they're buying I mean in cryptocurrency
crashes the next day nobody's buying the
1080s anymore or whatever for whatever
reason maybe there's a better graphics
card so they're not buying them for
crypto all the gamers wanted but they're
still too expensive for the gamers then
they have to discount them until the
cavers can afford them the crypto guys
are buying them they've shot themselves
in the foot of course any reasonable
business is gonna buy low and sell high
doesn't matter what you're gonna do so
yeah and then as soon as the cost of the
cards reduced people weren't going to be
that afraid for the initial investment
cost to try out mining again eggs so
it's just gonna keep doing this
self-fulfilling prophecy so in other
words stop bickering and
fighting and trying to place blame on
gaming or actually the Bitcoin miners
aren't saying the gamers are causing any
kind of a problem although I'm sure
there's one miner out there it's like oh
I couldn't get my hundred thousand
graphics cards from my basement cuz that
goddamn pub G needs so much power
they're buying up all the 1080 I
would love to hear their rant about the
gamer from the cryptocurrency
perspective if you're that guy in the
audience please go make that video and
tag me in a tweet and then Jerry Jerry
can vet them and send me the good ones
yeah there you go there you send a ball
to me i'll vet everything cuz i ain't
got nothin better to do which is the sad
truth it's sad and depressing and I
didn't even rip on you this show yet oh
man I actually yeah just rip the
band-aid off and rip the band-aid off
and do it myself cuz you're taking too
long I got one I got one ready to go I
saw one guy say why is JC
window bigger than Jerry's I decided I'm
gonna keep it a factor of my channel
versus your channel and the windows will
continue to change size based on that
factor I'm more I'm more invested in in
live streaming than YouTube videos now
but I do
to change that I actually just got that
true different today different
completely monsters a massive creative
style yeah like everybody's tell me like
oh my god youtube you know you make a
living on YouTube I could not make
a living on YouTube if I didn't
diversify the money that I make them
from YouTube right now wouldn't even pay
for my house I'm not even making enough
money to pay my mortgage on my house not
a little let alone bills taxes nothing I
can if I didn't have to pay taxes I
still couldn't pay for my house is what
I'm making from YouTube right now and
that's 700 videos 2.2 billion hours of
view time over the last year are you
gonna make me go look it up now I
haven't looked at these figures yeah go
look at that if you hover if you go into
the dashboard you hover over total
minutes watched it'll give you the hours
it'll break it down to hours and the
little hover that pops are a little all
total total Oh actually we did Nick and
I did figure this out the other day it
was something like the amount of years
yeah cuz I get a bit of through 2017 I
averaged between 1 million and 3 million
views a month I've seen you spike up to
over 10 no never got any higher than
like 7.9 could swear that I haven't
monitored your ship for a while but I
thought that you did you over ten on one
month the thing with Terry no it's like
7.9 villas if I remember correctly I
think Nick and I determined that we have
over a millennia of watch towers it's
got to be uh let me see where do we go
again
that's how often I don't look at these
numbers so okay so so inside your
dashboard open up analytics for a while
watch time then set it for lifetime
lifetime well do do you like the network
building Oh a year yeah so just go up
there and just say like last year or
last 365 days so like if I open up if I
open up my analytics I'm gonna say last
365 days and then if I hover over watch
time I have a hundred and thirty six
billion 361 million six hundred and
forty five minutes watched in 2017 I
don't think that's why you carrying the
decimal point right wailed on hundred
thousand bucks at work no no 136 million
sorry hundred thirty-six million three
hundred sixty one thousand six hundred
fifty bar yes we're just over a half
million so five hundred and thirty seven
million eight hundred seventy five six
hundred eighteen
so if you hover the mouse for that
number now it should pop up and tell you
how many years in days oh yeah just in
the last year we have over 1000 years
so one thousand twenty two years two
hundred forty seven days I don't like
just I'd literally head around those
numbers it's just insane are you ready
for the lifetime yeah what's the
lifetime hold on it's still thinking
it's like air man I didn't know you
could do this that's I swear to God I
never look in this so to add to give you
tech support for like an hour before you
do the show you don't you don't know
anything about software anymore
I don't anything by OBS here's a big
goddamn sellout CES guy that drives
Lamborghinis and bitches about Bitcoin
pretty much okay so the lifetime has two
thousand four hundred fifty two years
watched okay for me it's thirty one
thousand three hundred and sixty three
years that's crazy I mean if you imagine
the amount of people that have spent
their time just staring at our face that
it doesn't seem like time well-spent no
no no when you look at it on that scale
and you're like yeah that literally
every one of those minutes was somebody
either sitting in front of it or they
left to play list going or something
like that factor that in but still make
a difference to me millennia of a
viewership it's just it's crazy to even
fathom that Wow
so so if you guys are thinking 4000
hours is a hard goal to hit just just
think about that like it's people just
gets caught up on that number they're
like holy that's way too much
that's way too much but if you have a
single ten minute video that's only 60
people a day watching that you might
think that that's a crazy number but it
really isn't if you're serious about it
and you get your out there and you
get it tagged properly so it could be
found organically can I do a can I do a
custom range and see how many minutes
watched worm I was in my first month
yeah yeah I do that dude do the
drop-down on lifetime ago to customer
mean maybe this isn't the right time to
be doing this during the live stream but
I honestly no I'm serious I'm not going
ragging it's a perspective it's a
perspective because nobody's losing
their livelihood nobody no not on 4,000
hours make a livable wage you cannot
even make a kid what only lawns on the
river can't wait don't forget it's it's
the additional 1,000 subscribers but I
have find hard to believe if you're if
you're like that guy earlier that say
they bring in $200 a month that he's
gonna lose now but he doesn't have a
thousand subscribers because enough
views to pull in $200 a month something
is seriously wrong
and I'm not and I'm not calling him a
liar by any stretch I want people to
know that we're not we're not calling
him a liar we're not invalidating usual
situation like that is a real unusual
situation I don't understand why because
if somebody liked his content enough to
watch it that much now here I'll tell
you what probably happened because this
has happened to me - Jay tell me if you
think this is what happened he has one
or two videos on his entire channel out
of like a hundred that went viral for
some reason like maybe he talked about a
trending topic or he made a video about
iPhone X when it dropped because
everybody got a million like instant
views on that and in that one video got
shitloads of you which skyrocketed him
up past the limit but nobody subscribed
because it was just the one-hit wonders
and it wasn't what you wanted and
someone who has spent a lot of time
studying viral videos trying to figure
out how to get one in himself because I
still have never had a viral video right
I can tell you right now a viral video
spike and fall quickly they they don't
they don't sustain $200 a month and if
he and if he was then that first month
he had to have made thousands of dollars
for it to sustain 200 a month in
residuals the problem is it doesn't stay
relevant long enough it doesn't it
doesn't
and the fall-off is usually really
dramatic as soon as whatever's being
talked about goes out of scope and then
you get like I've had viral videos now
when I say viral I'm saying like you
know 3 3 million views right for me
would be considered viral in my scope
but that's still not even close to my
role with some of these videos people
create my very my very first month I had
fifteen thousand seven hundred and
eighty four watch minutes and that was a
that was over the course of four
thousand two hundred ninety-eight views
as my first month on YouTube that was
zero subscribers from a zero subscribers
start that first month I made my first
thousand subscribers by December that's
three months so it's not like it can't
be done and and I don't know how much
different it is now versus then but I
see a lot of up and comers who've come
up out of nowhere and just been like
holy you're killing it so I mean
that's my perspective on it i I got it I
got a text message from my friend this
morning on the way into the office
freaking out because he's got plenty of
watch towers but he doesn't have the
thousand subscribers yet and so he's got
to get like 240 more subscribers by
whatever the date was and I told him I
was like dude you know I know how much
he was making because he was telling me
right
like dude this doesn't kill you this
isn't hurting you you know if you're not
taking an extra three dollars a month
right now and to get thousands I can be
sensitive to them wanting to hit that
mark though I honestly can be sensitive
to even though it's not ruining the bank
just the motivation behind keeping that
partnership especially against the
adversity of everybody else losing it I
understand why he wants to do that and
I'm not saying he shouldn't but honestly
that's not hard to do if you do the
right things
he just needs literally one video that
gets that it's about some trending topic
he can hop for something unique on with
a good nail and please subscribe at the
beginning the video be like if you enjoy
my video on this please hit that
subscribe button even if like you know a
fraction of the people hit it he made
there's nothing wrong with asking people
to subscribe in fact it's even in the
YouTube playbook yep but the thing is I
also know for a fact that he's very
inconsistent he'll make he'll make a
video every few days and then suddenly
he will make a video for two months so
he's like me basically hey my friend
you're talking about Jayden I talk about
you know it's not you there would be a
much bigger bitching conversation that
was it but but you know as well as I do
what inconsistency does to the algorithm
yes it would favor are you putting up a
bunch of shitty videos one after another
that performed very poorly then to put
up a really good one every other month
yeah my channel has the most
inconsistent like if you go look at my
line even for views and for subscribers
it is just jagged is and J yours
yours it's actually really good
mine looks like the Rocky Mountains do
what are you talking about mine I don't
want it like mine mine looks like
something you could saw an arm off or
cut a shark a nap with it looks like a
shattered pain because it literally
drops down to almost zero at one point
like form up fur for growth and vias do
you know don't make content people don't
watch it and YouTube is all about
putting the content in front that people
are most likely to watch and not only
that the most likely to watch for the
longest period of time this is the thing
a lot of people don't get is is
retention you've heard the word thrown
around right yeah a lot of people don't
really understand what retention means
and it's it's it's more than just watch
time retention is basically how they
weight your video when somebody is
searching for it they want to find the
video that has the most views the most
aggregated likes and dislikes that
that is a step that I'm proud of though
there's a lot of things I'm not proud of
about my channel but my retention is
really high in there is because you do
taht you do topics that are very start
to finish like you can't really bail out
in the middle because you need to hang
in there for the final verdict or that
to see what the benchmark results are or
what the final build looks like you
basically are creating content that's
exactly what you should be and never
give it all up first yeah
don't start a video with a picture of
your build like complete it and be like
this is the computer we're gonna be
building today and this is exactly
what's gonna look like so my audience
retention for the first year of my
channel was 37 percent average that's
insanely high no that's actually fairly
low if we look at the last 30 days
yeah retention is 69 percent 69 69
percent that is really high which which
helps the algorithm a lot too but I want
to I want to comment us something here a
lot of people responding to Caitlyn
who's in the chat and she said she
thinks it's more of a pride thing about
being able to say that they are making I
know maybe I think what she meant was
that because they're able to make
something at YouTube yeah I'm the kind
of guy that would be like oh you need to
put this barrier in my way then I'm
gonna busted that barrier okay if you're
gonna tell me I can't do this because I
don't have this and I'm gonna go get
that I'm gonna go get that anymore
that's the kind of drive that I have as
a person so I feel like if a lot of
people took this whole doomsday policy
for the small channels and use that as
driving motivation there's nothing
there's no better motivation given to
you than that and that's exactly what I
was saying before is I think if you look
at it in the right light YouTube is
giving you a huge opportunity here but
they're intentionally expecting a bunch
of people to bow out and the people that
bow out are doing it for exactly the
reason they want them to do it and
that's because they were not creating
content to be passionate unique or to
draw and build an audience they're
building content to either get money or
to make a number bigger
I didn't maybe I maybe new media and
youtubers have become so mainstream now
in terms of like how much money people
can make up here that a lot of people
use that money making as a drive I never
did and that's why this is all so
strange to me
my first my first maybe my first month
on their said it was also like $4 I made
like $4 the first like $20 check I got
like when money started coming in I had
to be with an MCN because I could didn't
qualify to be and like you can Harvard
yeah so so back then I got like 20 bucks
or whatever and I got my first 20 bucks
I get it okay I get I'm like wow I've
made money doing something that I love
to do and I'm not saying anybody should
not be mad that they fell out of the
partner program but what I'm saying is
instead of getting really angry at
YouTube and being defeatist about it
realize that if you're the person that
doesn't do what the other 90% are doing
and leave the platform in which what
YouTube wants and you stick around more
if you're gonna have huge advantage this
is literally handing an advantage to
every single person both in and out of
the partner program all the way up from
the lowest reg series like all the big
youtubers are killing it for everybody
because they get all the money and they
get all the ads no no no that's not how
YouTube works YouTube knows that
established youtubers like Jay are gonna
eventually fizzle out they're gonna burn
out the audience it may be 10 years it
might be 20 years but they will burn out
their audience they always need new
creators so they want the little guys to
succeed they just don't want every
single little guy doing everything to
succeed they want to raise the bar so
that the quality comes up so the
advertisers will spend more money I was
trying to see what my audience retention
was on the cryptocurrency video but it's
not showing me like an actual retention
percentage just show me an average view
duration what you say your percentage
view your percentage view was for
lifetime your your average percentage
view lifetime I didn't lifetime they go
back to that because I looked up what
the first like year was average and I
look at the last 30 day average was so
lifetime for me with 6 minutes and 28
seconds and the 33 percent average
audience retention that's for life there
oh my audience retention on that video
was 67 percent so that's still right on
that average yep what's funny though is
like there's a huge spike right at the
end where people clicked to that
particular number and I'm trying figure
out why what if somebody links something
in the comments saying hey he said this
here and they clicked there okay hold on
and then we'll get off the stats page I
humble brag all right you want she's
like yeah this this this is less about
bragging more about showing people that
honestly that 4,000
isn't unobtainium it really is you break
it down and you look at it and the other
thing too is for the same amount of
views we're getting today we're not
getting paid the same amount of money
that always changes yeah you know you
you're not guaranteed anything you might
join the partner program after getting
to 4,000 hours in the CPM might be $1
per thousand and everybody's running ad
blocker or thousand monetizable nobody
thinks yeah nobody think about ad
blocker and all yeah okay so average
view duration for you is what for the
lifetime I was six minutes and 28
seconds I'd see I'm six minutes 34
seconds so that's the number to apply to
everybody yeah it's amazing nobody's got
more than six minutes of retention
ability everyone it's - that's the other
thing - I know I know you got your
analytics guy but for me it's like I
like to go in and look at the analytics
because it tells it tells some
interesting information that leads you
know you guys know I 2017 was a bad year
for me my channel was pretty stagnant I
was right on the cusp of getting a
million and I basically just like
checked out we'll get into details on
that but anyways 2018 I'm coming back
with a vengeance but the analytics tell
that exact tale they as soon as I
stopped engaging in uploading videos on
a regular schedule in more videos
YouTube started devaluing me really fast
CPM we were making you were making the
money so they pushed me to the bottom
cut you know I had 700 videos and I was
still getting you know a million two
million three million views a month
which is great they were still putting
me way below people that were only
getting a hundred thousand views a month
because those people were more
consistent and their numbers were coming
up yeah its algorithms like this
person's going up this dude's washed up
and coming down and so they start
pushing you to the bottom of the pile
and you start to notice that my
retention went down my CPM went down
viewership then followed right after
that subscribership starts going down
because less organic people are finding
you through the search it's it's
interesting when you look at that data
because it can tell you a story and it
can also tell you when you're headed in
the right direction you know if you
start playing around with your
thumbnails for instance I did this not
too long ago Jr remember back now it's
messing with all my thumbnails first I
ended up going back to random as
thumbnails but there's - let people hate
his thumbnails but it there is a there
is a direct correlation between his view
spikes and the thumbnails yep all that
matters is if you can look at a
thumbnail without looking any text or
anything even on a cell phone screen and
you can identify that you know exactly
whose video that is you are more likely
to click it if you follow that person
yeah that's true and I would and I could
probably the sad part is I would
probably get more more clicks on videos
if I was the clickbait guy that everyone
wants to say that I am if I put my ugly
face in the thumbnail every time but I
don't I just I just do a glamour shot of
the product we're talking about it's
just the way I've always liked doing it
so in that and that's true but if you
but if you did it would give you a boost
I'm just throwing Logan all the
righteous ammunition aren't I but look
at any super viral channel if you go
look at any super bro like even buggy
like if you even go look at boogies
channel he's in every thumbnail yeah
what was nails every thumbnail is a
screen cat but so are mine I just screen
capped the product but but but you know
it's him you immediately you could be 50
feet away looking at somebody's cell
phone like over their shoulder on a
train and you would know that that's
boogies video and brand identification
is everything thumbnails are the hardest
part of the video not for me for me it's
the title for me it's making the video
fair enough oh my god for me it's
actually turning on the camera like
literally getting in front of it these
days stop taking all my ammunition man I
fling him at you dude it's just it's
just like great school all over again
you know kids come over get ready kick
my ass night like I know I'm fat eat too
much and just I got don't hit me I
might throw up I just please oh my god
my penis is small leave me alone I don't
know let's go ahead and just liven this
up a little bit let's get let's get some
good fun funny topics anything on a
stick talk allow me to go and check that
good sir once I get my mouse back from
my crypto mining machine that's running
at 100% and just stole it I see me
except there on his laptop and on his
phone a multitasking dude I'm using a
mouse and keyboard sharing software do
you ever do that do you have multiple
computers where you want to move the
mouse and keyboard between them yeah
that's it I have seen ologies synergy
dude you should use an input director go
look it up it's a free open-source
software I've never found a software
that even comes close to as configurable
as you can literally drag and drop
entire files between the computers as if
they're the same computer you can do
that with synergy oh you can't but a
synergy is not free open-source though
it's like the synergy is like nine
dollars a year or something that well
that's right cuz they move to that whole
cloud thing right or where all the
computers just joining the little cloud
thing and they all negotiate and figure
it out well they do it local I think
they might be able to do through the
cloud but I've only done it I've only
used it locally
yeah this input director is just amazing
like it's got so many
little features and like even you can
put do a hotkey to basically block in so
the mouse won't freely travel between
the screens if you're playing a video
game or something like that okay you can
screen cap 1 or 2 and then paste it to
either machine just with the keyboard
here's one talk about someone just asked
like in all caps when is the post Malone
build coming ok so if you guys remember
the initial video we did with the
interview he wants the build to be based
around his album his album hasn't
dropped yet guys so an idea for the case
though it's already it's already been
handled the content be you gotta hear my
idea at least for build two okay I don't
do is have a bottle a bottle of
painkillers just duct tape to the top of
the case and I bought in a rock can of
Rockstar I said it's pop and Pili's and
feeling like a rockstar I guess but
that's like how about a yard hoe take a
yard hoe and stick it on the top tune
like hot glue it so it's like a yard hoe
so it's like a pop and little pill you
feel like a rock star and then the hoes
don't do it at the north but the problem
is rock star is not on the album it's
it's not it's not the the beer bongs and
Bentley's album right well that
ain't gonna work then see this this is
why I don't work with post Malone and J
does don't worry I could tell you that
the chassis has already been okay so
that's he's coming back in in a couple
of weeks we'll be doing another video
here where I'm gonna be revealing to him
the chassis and the renders and all that
Forex nobody wanted to kind of be
involved in that in the early level
stuff so I'm gonna get people another
chance to bitch and moan that if the
build is done because he's gonna come
back in and and kind of give me his take
on the initial renderings
it's very all over again with no crews
there's only two videos technically this
is probably gonna be three but I need
his album to drop though but anyway he's
gonna be coming in a couple weeks I'm
gonna be showing him the case in person
the the way the case is normally and
then I'm gonna showing him renders of
the custom one-off case that's gonna be
built specifically for him where it's
the only one in the world that is going
to be built this way and it is going to
be badass trust me it is going to make
anything I have done in the past look
like such garbage even the D frame 2.0
case I'm working on right now it's not
going to even come close to comparing to
this and I'm constantly building these
levels of computers for other people
than myself but J aren't you aren't you
a little concerned that it wants Terry
sees that he's gonna come back and be
like why did you cry on my case and give
me Bob's
every gave me so much over that but
uh how do these people find you by the
way like I bet you that's a question a
lot of people want to ask like how the
 do you got that contrast you got
post Malone on one side you got Terry
Crews on I mean so or opposites whoa
okay so after we did that interview we
all drove to Pasadena and we went to
Woo's fish tacos and because he was the
whole time he was sitting here too
I don't know if he was high or what but
the whole time he was sitting here he's
just like he was he was just like I want
wahoos I just really want wahoos it
would be sitting here like filming at
the end he's like I'm hungry you want
the water he's kept saying it then he
looks up on Twitter and he was like man
that closes wahoos years in Pasadena so
I was like well let's go to Wahoo's so
we all just met up down there right
that's awesome he orders one hundred and
thirty dollars worth of wahoo fish tacos
and steak the steak so anyway that's all
yeah I asked him when we were there I
said so let me ask ya I said how did you
find my channel cuz I told my site you
just thought it was jay-z in the
beginning cuz you're a rapper yeah and
be pop artists whatever and he was like
yeah he goes I have a friend that
watches you goes but he said I watch you
for like three months he goes I just one
day was like I want the guys to cool the
 I want to do something with him so
he does when he tweeted me I was the one
that asked him if he wanted a computer
he didn't ask for one I was like you
wanna maybe build your computer as I
sure so just like just like the Terry
Crews build everyone's gonna get tested
him being like why are all the rich guys
get all the free stuff I'm sponsoring it
I'm handling it not him
so it's a weird discover the kinds of
people that somehow are watching your
stuff like I remember I would have Red
Bull GRC three years ago okay I also get
to see who's lurking because member the
verified tab I can see who's followed me
oh yeah I can tell you I have three pro
athletes one in the NFL one in the NBA
one in the MLB and a Harlem Globetrotter
following me so it's like wait wait wait
I'm tryna they just followed me like a
week ago
what are they maybe you found me through
you I don't know but I've got I've got a
three major league major athletes
following and lurking that's cool I
still remember when so the GRC thing
three years ago I would bat back when I
used to make videos I went to Red Bull
GRC and Connor Martel was there one of
the GRC drivers and he just won he just
the whole thing for lights for GRC
lights and I was walking over to him cuz
I was shooting the video for the YouTube
channel and I wanted to like do an
interview with him and he starts walking
at me yeah it just starts picking up
speed and I watch all your iRacing
videos cuz that was back when I had the
simulator and I was doing like the stuff
with I HUD right and everything and it
turns out that the he trains on that
like he trains on I racing on the
offseason to keep all of his skills
sharp and he's like yeah do I watched
all your videos and you set up I got a
set up just like you got the
Thrustmaster this and everything like
that I was just like no me like I'm a
fat dude the reviews technology and he
drives race cars like how did this
connect yeah it's cool to see the people
that you can reach so I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and I'm gonna might break
cuz everybody's been calling you fat you
know lately so I hope it breaks breaks I
can't even go out what I'd be stupid not
to get involved with the celebrity
builds right but they had fun the fun
part is they want to get involved with
me so it's kind of a two-way Road it's
not like I'm hounding them to I was
gonna say something important and now I
forgot well the first point was pretty
powerful so you know there was a point I
was gonna make oh yeah
the Terry Crews build I think broke a
stigma I think the Terry Crews build
broke this whole like it's not cool to
be a PC gamer or it's not cool to be
into want to be a nerd there's always
been that saying that world that nerds
will rule the world right yep and I
think I think people seeing a guy like
Terry Crews who is just like a fitness
fanatic yeah not just a celebrity like
the opposite ends of the spectrum of
rush you'd you'd visualize a game around
so I think that that made a lot a lot of
people a little bit more comfortable
with coming for with me like I'm a gamer
I mean yeah people have mentioned like
Vin Diesel plays games and and there's
other names that people have told me to
hit up but I just think he helped break
the break that that stigma and so more
people are now looking into PC gaming
channels and stuff and there's not a lot
of us in the PC gaming room I'd say
there's probably a good 25 or 30 main
channels in this genre which is not a
lot in the space of YouTube right so the
likelihood of them following or finding
someone like me is high and then of
course it's up to them to just kind of
poke around in the different channels
and see who it is they want to wear
with maybe my salty real attitude makes
it a little bit more comfortable
approaching me I don't know maybe they
approach the other guys and they said no
that I was last pick who knows
so whatever no I think it's cool I think
that that's really cool because not only
the diversity of people that are
approaching you basically have somebody
who's like if they at the head of the
like like what category music would you
call it's like rap kind of but it's not
really he's not really a rapper oh it's
definitely more of a pop artist ah yeah
I kind of like the R&amp;amp;B pop but just a
little little bit of little tiny bit of
almost rap it's not rap those but it
feels like it a little bit it's kind of
extra that whole culture I think it's
cool that you got that on one of the
spectrum he's like he's a gamer you got
Terry who could flip dump trucks and
 like that he's a comedian
and now he's a gamer and it's like now
gamers are cool I mean all of a sudden
like overnight I mean you can't say that
the game average gate well you can still
say the average gamer right now but
anyways you know the air curtains
 in a bucket playing Warcraft
mine and direwolves or whatever which J
is I hate by the way J is closer to that
person than I am
oh yeah old the Warcraft Jay loves world
over happened thinks is the best game on
earth and I guarantee you he'd play it
more than pub G I never I never said
it's the best game in the world but I do
play it and I do raid and I do have like
an it's not a super high level havin an
eye level 947 feral druid that I do
heroic throne I mean he tells by anyway
15s the 16s are pretty easy now compare
that they used to be but you know it all
has to do with completing your
emissaries and getting a little bit
better chances for loot drop although
the new patch did just make now getting
withering essences and the fact that you
can actually now farm your own
Legendary's is actually pretty cool
aspect I think it takes a lot of the
farming aspect of the guys like me who
really works for that stuff now they're
just kind of handing it out to everybody
but you got to let the people catch up I
do play a lot of Warcraft I'm sorry I
was gonna ask you to name all the armor
on your character but that you just went
off on like ten times worse it's like I
can't even tell you a pub G like how to
equip a weapon that's a little thing
right now
someone said Jay is doing pet battles
all day I have never done even one pet
battle the fuck's a pet battle basically
Warcraft one or Blizzard wanted to kind
of cash in on the whole like pokemons go
thing
okay so they came up with pet battles
where you could actually battle your
pets in like a battle arena so he
literally just ripped off pokemons
pretty much but then Peter got mad oh
you're joking on creatures what the meta
people like you could tell who plays Wow
in the chat Oh God there he goes yeah
you got everybody going on that one
I like wow what can I say yeah I just
like I just like sitting in my chair
relaxing I'm gonna tweet out the stream
one more time because apparently the
first time I tweeted out I didn't I
didn't put a URL in there you know
people actually did actually click on it
it ends in 8 minutes okay oh you're oh
we all got a minutes left it's 62 okay
only only 8 minutes left better hurry
any server first nope I've never been a
part of a server first I'm not a
hardcore Raider I've only cleared all of
throne through normal the problem is the
raid nights that they're doing heroics
and mythix raids I'm busy doing stuff
with the family he's showing we get to
play late at night and the guild I
belong to you likes to raid on Tuesday
mornings after server reset I am so
 sorry that I brought that topic
up 3d printing by the way really Wow is
still 2002 hey stupid
it started in 2004 I'll admit though I
have to admit though that when wow first
came out for the first probably 5 or 6
years I did off-and-on play it and I did
get one of my characters maxed out
before an expansion sort of an
exponential reduction in frames per
second now in raids every since act
seven point three point five I've
noticed so any of that see I go
this since the new patch on Tuesday
although the lovely revamp is nice now
at the level you know the zone you're in
levels with you to a max level of the
stakes team you know I'd be really stay
on track now in the lobby it's very cool
but I noticed that in terms of like just
overall game performance it's actually
degraded quite a bit oh my god the see
see the difference between you and me is
like I just sit there and push the
buttons and look at the pretties and
you've actually figured all the out
why you're a clicker oh my god
dude not not only that the last two no
three MMOs let up late events beers just
set that warframe better than Wow
 warframe no I disagree with that
I don't even play it good work for him
stupid
we're friends dumbest game ever made
doesn't work for him that pay to win
game looks like I'm PlayStation and PC
and everything I think it is hey it is
well I brought that on you guys I
apologize for that
I pushed J's button and saying he went
off on a tangent about World of Warcraft
I knew that was gonna happen I didn't
think was gonna be that severe you know
yes are you alive oh he's unwary just
walking around the studio which is
actually a pretty hungry food what you
might be eating right before bed but
people can't see is the fact that I have
a boom mic here that's picking up the
mic for the stream but I have a wireless
mic attached to me so Jerry can hear me
that's awesome hey Jay what I was gonna
say is the last three memos I played
which would be world of warcraft EVE
Online and I can't run the name of
the third but I played a what was
it called anyways all three of them I
literally got so bored playing them and
grinding that I just went and got the
macro tools and just macaron it instead
I had more fun building the macros just
to play the game for me than actually
playing the game ADHD boro ADHD that
that's where that comes right you know
what that's what makes a good developer
is when you're so ADHD that you
just code everything you automate
everything cuz you just can't be
bothered playing it so then you become
really good at automating things and it
turns out the automation is a skill that
every business wants these days if you
want to get into the computer business
and you want to go work at a company
learn how to write automation tools or
how to use pre-existing automation tools
in YouTube will be assured a job
replacing other people with automation
true story chipmunk J confirmed
I didn't shove it in my cheek ladies I
mean guys highly anticipated fake news
words such a dumb president oh my god
sorry I just people say stay away from
politics nope I'm not not even political
I'm just saying the guy's dumb if I ran
into him on the street
it's toupees on Justin's so he didn't
kill himself it's two-faced too tight
that's all yep
anyway in all seriousness I do I do love
I do love my war crafts you do I also do
love I I'm gonna say it are you ready
yeah do it I also like battlefront to
what I wasn't thinking that I thought
you were gonna say battlefield 4 no I
haven't picked out put forward in like a
year and a half I'm level 4 in
battlefield 1 that's how much that bomb
that's my opinion I love Star Wars and I
love the storyline I have played like 5
online matches and battlefront but I've
played through the entire campaign in
battlefront 2 and I'm waiting for the
3rd chapter to LA or the third campaign
chapter to go or to drop but yeah I've
been I've actually enjoyed it it's okay
because it so it takes place parallel
along the movies so it starts off it
starts off with you playing parallel to
the the endured fight in Return of the
Jedi okay and then it goes forward to
you basically going all the way through
to the battle of jakku which takes place
between Episode six and Episode seven
right because member when you see
Episode seven there's already the crash
starter stores stuff in the dirt in the
sand and remember ray is like scavenging
through the Stardust for su we actually
played the campaign of that battle which
is really neat and then and then it
jumps forward in the future is taking
place during episode eight and then now
the next one's probably gonna come in
it's probably gonna line up with
whatever is gonna be coming next to them
so it kind of fills in some of the
blanks and stuff like adds to the story
you're not just playing as the story or
does it add it doesn't really answer any
questions of what takes place in the
movies you do play as Luke at one point
after Return of the Jedi where he goes
on this sort of like it's sort of a
Vision Quest where you know that compass
that he had yeah so you play him finding
that compass well that's kind of cool
yes so there's some conviction there's
some tie-ins but it's it's it's parallel
entirely parallel so it doesn't one does
it rely on the other to make sense
during the loading screen do you play a
minigame reaches mukha milk a giant sea
walrus for blue milk and spray it in
your face man that was such a disgusting
scene dude when I saw that like and you
know me I love I love just up
 like that's my thing but I I lost
it like but I and it wasn't because I
couldn't handle that it's just so
unexpected that
the last thing I expected like they
could have literally just like like just
had like I don't know like porn playing
right there and it would have been no
more out of place well I think it was
intended to be this cringe factor of
showing just how off the grid he's
become
that's pretty off the grid man I mean
the fact that he called the lightsaber a
laser sword shows that he truly was just
like walked away from everything right
yeah and I still laughed at the
beginning of the movie but he just grabs
and they made it such a big deal at the
end of episode episode just grabs it
just walks it over the hill like not to
bring that to you uh spoiler alert if
you guys haven't seen it two months ago
whatever yeah right now it's not a
spoiler I'm sorry spoilers spoilers have
a statute of limitations okay mm-hmm and
it ain't coming to DVD because if you're
waiting for it to come to DVD you didn't
want to watch it and get watch it hard
enough J AMD or Intel in 2018 I could
tell you both have you both have new
platforms coming out already and let's
just say by springtime really confused
by the whole intel AMD thing they're
both processors no no but I'm just
saying it's still we still can't wrap my
mind around till the whole like its its
Intel and AMD right that are like
working together it's like an AMD ya
know it's a it's an intel intel cpu with
an AMD like a shape down to Vega a GPU
like who got drunk in a meeting and me I
still don't understand like how that
happened like Intel's easy it's easy an
enemy of my enemy is my friend
it's exactly what it is
apparently like
Intel wanted to Intel from all the
rumors that are credible that I have
heard back in like 2010 2011 yeah until
tried to acquire Nvidia to become a
graphics division for Intel I heard
about that
Jensen wing was basically like you
gave the double deuces and Intel
basically at that point was like we vow
to destroy you and of course they don't
have the ability to well not only that
but they worked like side by side with
them for years when I worked at
Microsoft Nvidia and Intel team were
like in each other's like lapdance in
each other over remember we're
talking about the leaders the
the guys at the helm that were having
this discussion not that not the grunts
right don't run have to work together
but anyway Intel and AMD have basically
teamed up to do everything they can to
cut the market share that Nvidia
currently has and that's they're trying
to do it based on APU because it's just
everyone knows Intel's
mobile CPUs were significantly better
than AMD anything AMD had to offer
leading up to Raisa
and I and I would still say that applies
today and before you guys get mad at me
and be like what about the rise in
mobile it's literally a desktop chip put
in there I have one sitting over there
so it's still not a mobile chip right
yeah so if you want to make an
ultra-thin form factor you use Intel but
Intel doesn't know how to make graphics
to save their life their life
iris graphics come on give me a break so
what are you do you like your surface
book right I love my surface book but I
know I can't do anything on it but some
some light office work and browse the
Internet like dude mspaint stresses that
remember when you tried the stream from
yours when you were here yeah yeah it's
weird I never but I didn't buy it
intending to do that so but anyway my
point is what if you could have a
Microsoft Surface that has the power of
like a gtx 1070 in it
that'd be pretty badass yeah so it's
gonna have a graphics an APU ultra-thin
fat a thin form factor ultra light power
needs
that's designing - that's intended to
try and cut into the NVIDIA mobile
market because Nvidia dominates the
mobile market right yeah I'm not looking
forward to having to wear oven mitts
though to operate it yeah I have no idea
what to expect on temperatures Oh
actually that's that's my biggest
complaint with this little razor phone
right here and it gets so hot
yeah oh my god it's all metal right the
whole thing is just a giant heatsink
house
last night I was playing a game that
actually the graphics on it you're even
better than intend to switch on some of
the games I'm said they're playing 120
Hertz whatever like this is awesome and
it made my hand actually uncomfortably
warm so but but it's it's actually a
pretty pretty neat little phone but you
could tell they were just going to like
set some records and they really dropped
the ball and some other but I will
be reviewing that shortly
well it's time to go so any final
thoughts I'm surprised with so many
viewers in here and the light to dislike
ratio is actually quite high for a live
stream I'm proud
guys thank you for that yeah I'm uh I
didn't expect any of this honestly
that's for coming back after such a long
time and everything I didn't think they
were gonna have that many people just
jump it in here yeah so anyway a lot of
people a lot of people were asking like
where are the held check talk go but it
was this bad timing when we brought it
back cuz of the holidays but we're back
it's 2018 and everybody every time we
stop doing I still get the same messages
from everybody in the same comments on
the videos everything is like oh man Jay
dumped you off Tech Talk he's not doing
dick tuck anywhere dick no I'm back I'm
back he's gonna be seen on the internet
so the other friends lost I lost a bunch
of weight so he needs a fab friend he's
got to be seen somewhere on the internet
guys that's right
already shirts say 99 little bugs in the
code 9 a little bugs take one down pass
it around a hundred and seventeen little
bugs in the code you know this to be
true work in a nightie my friend you
know that to be true God if only people
could actually get regression testing
down all right we're gonna go guys I got
no outro sorry Jerry you wanna right
here I'll do that Carol hold on
thanks for watching get Thursday 5 p.m.
if Jay doesn't cancel it because you
have post Malanda like I don't know get
honest lease or something I don't know
post malone's my new friend replacing
