have just had a fantastic dress
rehearsal for this video because I just
did this entire video and forgot to turn
on the mic that guy right there so take
just just feel pity for me the new EVGA
silent series power supplies offer
excellent silence and efficiency through
their new EVGA Eco mode technology and
also features a seven year warranty for
worryfree gaming click the link in the
description to learn more alright so
today's video is not going to be any
fancy b-roll or any product reviews or
anything like that we are just going to
have a discussion right now about how
much graphics power do you really need
and the reason why we're doing this
video is I get asked this this
particular question day after day after
day all day every day till the end of
time so I figured instead of trying to
write out responses over and over and
over again I was going to make a video
and basically answer everybody at the
same time so if you guys don't want to
look at my ugly face go ahead and feel
free to minimize the video and do
something else at the same time I'll be
showing some graphics cards who have
this video but I'm not gonna be doing
any crazy editing or anything like that
normally this is the kind of thing I
would do a gameplay commentary to but I
don't have any recorded gameplays right
now that I can use nor do I have any
time right now to record any gameplay so
so like six months ago or something like
that I did a video about how to buy a
graphics card and what we did in that
video was we educated the viewers about
the different parts of the graphics card
what the specs meant and how to
understand what you were reading when
you were looking at a spec sheet of a
graphics card but I quickly realized
that didn't help anyone understand how
much power they need when it comes to
graphics cards so there's really three
things we're going to talk about here
today the first thing we need to talk
about and we need to get our minds kind
of warped it's not gonna be easy it's
not easy to change your perspective it's
not easy to change your way of thinking
but for the sake of the next 10 or 15
minutes just try
promised it might be worth it might
there are only two categories that any
of us will fall into not three I can do
my fingers not three not one two that is
the category of need in the category of
want there is no other category need and
want that's it there is no do not need
if there was a do not need you wouldn't
be watching this video I have a feeling
there's nobody watching this video right
now who has no need of learning about
this topic because that's why you
clicked on it as I said think so I hold
in my hand right here visual
representations of need versus want this
is a gtx titan x most people would want
this this is an r9 270 most people don't
need more than this so this is need
versus want does this really do anything
that this doesn't you know the the
answer to that obviously is a very big
depends and we're not talking about but
diapers although i think the babies
getting changed right now because i do
smell i do smell a bit of a brown
surprise if any of you out there dad's
or mom's you know exactly what i'm
talking about it's just like get sucked
into the ventilation system and gets
kind of recirculated anyway so does this
card really do anything this one doesn't
well short answer is no they both render
an image they both play games and that's
ultimately what they're designed to do
they're designed to display an image for
gaming or desktop productivity whatever
the differences are where the threshold
of performance starts to diminish now
that kind of moves us into category
number two you can't determine where
that diminishing return is until you
understand what it is you needed what
your expectations are for your gaming
experience now oftentimes people will
think about CPUs and RAM and
overclocking of their CPU and their
motherboards and water cooling but they
stopped to think about one of the most
important pieces to any gaming side
up that holds probably more influence
over your gaming experience than any
piece of hardware you could buy can
anyone tell me what that one piece of
hardware is that everyone seems to
forget about when it comes to buying
hardware the display if you're buying a
graphics card that can overpower your
display you are not doing yourself any
favors
you are wasting money you have popped
out of the need category went well into
the top of the want category and all the
money you had left once you got there
where you're just kind of shoveling off
to the side
that's kind of what skunk works is skunk
works has just turned into a want and
then to an unnecessary need and then to
an impractical bucket and then hopped
out of the unpractical bucket into the
gist phenomenally stupid bucket but
that's what I like about that system and
damn it that it is what I like it's it's
kind of like sir mix-a-lot in his big
butt he just can't lie neither can i I
can't lie I like it to understand how
much graphics power you need you need to
answer yourself two questions one what
panel are you going to be using what
resolution are you going to be using
what refresh rate is it what response
time is it you could take this GTX Titan
X right here and if you hooked it up to
a 1600 by 900 display that's got 59
Hertz refresh rate and it's got a 48
millisecond response I don't anything
else real but it's got a 48 millisecond
response time you have just really like
it's like crossing the streams for
ghostbusters it makes absolutely no
sense in fact the entire world space and
time is we know it would continue
discontinued to exist because what you
just did made no sense whatsoever
so what panel are you planning on using
maybe you're going to buy a panel at the
same time is it a 60 Hertz panel that
means it can only draw 60 frames per
second and keep the image in sync and
we're not talking about the artists in
sync by the way so if you have a 60
Hertz panel then you're not going to
need a GPU that's able to push more than
60 frames per second buy a lot at the
quality settings that you're going to
set them at usually the trade-off though
is if you get a powerful GPU that's able
to render way more than 60 frames per
second and is going to be able to max
out
sliders and stay above 60fps well you
have what we start moving into what I
call future compatibility I'm not going
to say future proofing future proofing
is a term that is tossed around so much
on forums people going to understand and
they just like to say I am future proof
future proof means you are free of being
influenced by the future and guess what
you're not future compatibility with the
power of your graphics card simply means
your graphics card is going to stay
relevant and performing in your desired
performance zone longer than a card that
doesn't that is future compatibility as
far as I'm concerned now I have here the
rog swift 144 hertz 1440p monitor
surrounded by three VG 248 qyz which are
also 144 Hertz panels but at 1080 P
clearly to run a game on the VG 248 QE
is going to require less power graphics
power than the Swift because there is a
lot less pixels in 1080p than 1440 now
if you're going to be running at a panel
of something like even a 720p you could
get away with even less and still have a
fantastic gaming experience in fact
coconut monkey believe it or not a
little fun fact is still using a 720p I
don't over to Twitter at coconut monkey
it's down here somewhere and actually
tease him a little bit you're like haha
you're still on at 720p because I do you
know cuz that because monitor snob but
you know he was actually able to use the
GTX 580 for a long time from 2011 all
the way to the end of 2014 and still
didn't have to upgrade the only reason
he did was because I sold him a 780
extremely cheap and now he's able to
just play any game he wants completely
maxed out frame rates are through the
roof in fact when he turns out vsync his
monitor or his graphics card runs at
like 40% used something silly like that
while he's gaming so that's a huge
factor that comes into play when it
comes to choosing your graphics card now
the other thing I mentioned on there is
how long do you want to keep your
graphics card if you can't afford afford
annual upgrades then you're going to
want to get a more powerful graphics
card today I know that some people don't
understand that concept you buy the most
powerful graphics card that you can
afford today and it will last you longer
if you bought a lesser inexpensive
graphics card today you're going to have
to buy a new graphics card usually every
year to year and a half to stay on top
of current technologies and game
requirements depending on which graphics
card you got we have here like I said
the r9 270 this graphics card two years
ago when I did the review on this was
absolutely phenomenal this thing could
handle 1080p graphics on any game I
threw at it at either minimum of medium
settings many of which hi and stay right
around that 60 FPS range of and the
reason why I say 60 FPS is because most
people according to Steam survey is
running 1080p or lesser panel at 60
Hertz so 60 frames per second is all
your panel can draw before it starts
tearing the screen across horizontally
and getting misaligned images that's
what refresh rate is on a monitor but
the unfortunate reality is that as nice
as this card is it is starting to show
its age today and it's only it's not
even 2 years later actually since I did
this I believe November of this year
will make 2 years this is only a year
and a half old on this card and the
reason for that is the limitation of
VRAM this thing only has 2 gigabytes of
vram and as we progress in gaming
technologies and people start utilizing
more textures and other facets of
performance manufacturers or of graphics
cards are starting to increase the
amount of VRAM on the cards because
developers are starting to really tap
into and utilize vram we have seen quite
an exponential rate of increase on vram
usually double every generation usually
has double the amount of VRAM it says 2
gigs and then the like the r9 290 and
290x had four gigs and when it comes to
nvidia they had 1.5 gigs on the 580 and
then 3 gigs on the 780 and then the 980
had 4 gigs really one up one but then I
went to the tight necks which went to 12
gigs so you're going to start running
into vram limitations which means to
keep this card relevant you're gonna
have to start turning down textures and
other things to low
sometimes off to keep your game from
stuttering and just having incredibly
low frame rates so the recommendation
there obviously is by the most powerful
graphics card that you can afford within
budget today and it will last longer I
can't tell you what your budget is I
can't tell you if it's worth it worth it
to spend $50 more to get this card over
that card because I didn't know what you
have to do to get that 50 bucks I don't
know if you have to turn a trick I'm not
going to judge I mean Who am I to judge
this he cast the first stone who is free
of sin or something like that I don't
know I'm definitely not free of sin so
I'm not even going to throw that rock
but that kind of brings us to the last
point here which is budget now as I said
I can't tell you how much to spend but I
can tell you that when you're building a
gaming rig or rig specifically built for
gaming the most expensive component in
your system is and should be the
graphics card now advancements in API
technology or the technology that
communicates between the hardware and
software especially GPU and CPU as well
and those threads and draw calls per
second is going to improve in fact it
means a lot of people and older graphics
cards are actually going to get a
synthetic bump in performance as we move
into dx12 and mantle and things like
that because it's going to utilize less
hardware especially CPU bound system
systems that have lower end CPUs and
higher end GPUs so you're not going to
want to spend a ton of money on your CPU
and motherboard you're going to want to
put the bulk of your budget into your
graphics card now as I said I can't tell
you how much that number needs to be but
I can't tell you that typically it's
right around 40% of your budget ends up
being spent on your graphics card and
the rest of the stuff being CPU
motherboard memory case power supply and
cooler so or hard drives and all that
stuff but anyway guys I hope this video
has helped you understand a little bit
more on what to think about when you're
buying a new graphics card trust me I
would love nothing more than to be like
hey Robert I bro you should go get
yourself a GTX 970 clearly that's the
graphics card
you owe and rich AMD r9 280x that's the
card based on your that's it that's what
don't even look anywhere else I love to
be able to do that for you but I can't
all I can do is arm you with some of the
things to think about and then you guys
have to take it and do the legwork
yourself I kind of like doing these
videos where I just talk about topics
where we're just chatting and giving you
guys some knowledge especially since I
have a lot of useless knowledge up in
there
but every now and then I can actually
say something meaningful and I'd like to
share that with you guys when I can so
do me a favor head on over to Twitter
I'm at Jay's two cents and tell me guys
or tell me what top and gals or gal
there's at least one gal watching I
think it's my mom probably hi mom tell
me what topics you guys would like me to
cover in this kind of a you know one on
one or one on 333,000 or whatever we are
right now so that I can do more of these
types of discussion videos where I try
to arm you with knowledge and make you
guys and everybody watching better for
having a more open way of thinking when
it comes to this hardware so please head
on over to social media tell me what
topics you guys would like to see me
talk about and maybe we'll do it once or
twice a month or even just a segment on
Tech Talk or something so as always guys
won't be able to do these videos without
your support thank you for watching and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
