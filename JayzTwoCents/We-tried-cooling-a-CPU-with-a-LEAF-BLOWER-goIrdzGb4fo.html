gonna continue our series of bad ideas
concocted from the bathroom honestly
after I come up with most of these ideas
and also just a warning for the next
probably few months there's me a lot of
construction noise going on behind us
because they're building a new thing
across the street and there's big
construction equipment so I apologize
for that and I'm gonna go ahead and move
forward and make the best of this this
is a stock a and B cooler this is not
even a Wraith cooler it's just the plain
old chunk of aluminum that they put a
copper disc in and this is what ships
with like most of the rise and stuff
below in 1800 x you guys remember we did
be 4x4 they 480 by 480 red that we built
with the box fan and then we took an AC
and hooked it up to it now we're gonna
kind of do sort of the air cooling
version of that we're gonna take this
we're gonna take the fan off we're gonna
hook a shop back up to it
today's video is sponsored by
Squarespace whether you're looking for a
domain an online website or an
e-commerce site get started today with
Squarespace Squarespace is templates
make it easy for you to set up your
website and get that look and feel that
you want and doesn't require any
updating or patching because it all
happens automatically in fact I even
launched an e-commerce site when I was
selling my custom cycling jerseys
because I didn't know the first thing
about creating an online cart by myself
so I utilize Squarespace and that got me
up and running the very same day but if
you need a domain you can handle that
too through their easy and hassle-free
domain registration transfer and
management
Squarespace empowers millions of
websites across thousands of industries
for people just like you and me so head
on over to Squarespace calm for your
free trial and when you're ready to
launch head to Squarespace calm /jc
sense and save 10% off your website or
domain so it looks like it just has this
little ring
well Kevin oh it broke this is our
sacrificial fan we need to we need to
cut the core out so there's that so this
is now our stroud that we are going to
use that mounts to this that we can use
our coupler to our tube see if it works
let's go make like the Mario
okay so here's we got here we got a
three inch by two inch coupler this is
our well it looks like a throttle body
to me so this goes on cooler this goes
on this once we loosen up this little
fit on there this two inch is pretty
much like the standard size for most
shopback so that's how it's gonna look
on top of the cooler so now we go get
our shot back alright so we were looking
at the shop backs we realize they all
kind of suck in terms of their diameter
and their length um school jokes aside
so the shop vacs just not seem to have
the power we were looking for the volume
we were looking for so we kind of
pivoted and changed our concept mid
video we're gonna go with this guy it's
not actually on I thought the length was
gonna be more shut up alright so one
hundred and forty six dollars later
we're on our way back to the studio
that's pretty much the price of a good
area or a good knock to or something and
it's something nobody should do what
we're still gonna prove why you
shouldn't do it but I wanna I want to
talk about something cuz I know whenever
at this point people are going - already
did that here any blue hair into a case
like that yeah he actually blew air into
the case we are blowing air directly
into the cooler to see what happens so
consider this inspired by while I was
taking a dump okay so first thing we
have to do is I took another fan I
realized I didn't do a baseline we have
to see what this can do on its own and
don't even remember which cooler I got
this out of to be honest but I can tell
you it's twice as thick as summit ladies
twice as thick as some of the other
coolers that come with Rison as you can
see it also has the copper core with a
single heat pipe in there so we're gonna
go ahead and get this set up on the test
set the test bench
well test box and we're gonna see what
our baseline temperatures are so we can
at least see how much it's improved I
don't think it really matters because no
one's gonna do this practical
practically practically practically
optimize defaults and restart it
thermally shut down because I forgot the
previous settings I had in this 2700 X
where when it was overclocked on water
and it was set to 1.5 volts and it was
idling at 7 DC so I just did a bunch of
baseline testing with the stock cooler
on here I'm using the echo therm I love
this stuff it comes with all the
graphics cards from ek so I've been
using that for this temperatures are
pretty hot though because the 2700 X
comes with the prism cooler as you guys
know which has four heat pipes and a lot
of fins and this this cooler doesn't
come with that CPU so I'm asking a lot
of this cooler I did one two three four
back-to-back Cinebench runs and you can
see the increased curve right here all
the way up to 93 Celsius which is only
to see below throttling so if I'd done
another test right there I'm sure we
would have throttled I've done OC CT
letting that run on loop and I actually
run one time I got so hot it shut off
the computer because of thermal
throttling so the reason why I'm using
this cooler to be honest says something
like the prism or the Wraith is because
it's round and that makes it easier for
me to mount a round coupler to it but if
we can actually get this cooler now to
not throttle then we'll know that it
worked I mean consider gonna be shoving
like 155 mile-per-hour air and 480 CFM
at it I think it'll work
hello to my little friend the tape
caught it I really wanted to use a
coupler on this rather than tapings I
don't want it to be such a turbulent
step so we need heat and I left my heat
guns at home but we have a stove come on
there we go
low heat like that can't feel hot yeah
well that is warm I can feel that did it
it's amazing how well this whoa how well
all of this actually fit together all
right so obviously we're setup you can
hear it as you can see this is the
lowest I can get the motor to turn where
air is still coming through if obviously
it's blowing through here and down we
are currently idling at 36 see that's 10
see cheap lower than it was before
and we are going to go ahead and let OCC
t go doing large data sets and we will
ramp up the speed as it goes we're
already thinking we need to adapt this
for a future video where we blow it into
a graphics card 5767 you know what
I want to let it get hot and see how
quick it cools down a bee 990
okay I'm gonna stop torturing my
neighbors here here's the bottom line
this is stupid
it's actually not even the coolest area
could be giving it because the turbine
motor or the motor is heating up the air
actually there's warmth there's warmer
air coming out than ambient when you put
that high-speed when it's on low-speed
it was actually much cooler air but as
the motor the air goes through the
turbine it's getting warmed up by the
motor in fact I believe the motor is
actually being cooled by the air coming
in so we're actually blowing warmer than
ambient air on that does that seem
practical for 20 to 23 C improvement no
but we're gonna do it and spend 150
bucks on this video to try it of course
I mean why else would we do I want to
point out to the reason why I was
pointing at the GPU is because the air
was going through here going down
hitting and then just going out in the
360 degree degree direction around it
and it was actually cooling off the GPU
because enough of that air was coming
around to the front the GPU was picking
it up and off it goes so that's why it
was idling down in the 20s that's
exactly why I feel like we need to for
our next video will we do something like
this we rigged up this directly into a
GPU and I hear the piano guy next door
do you know what how's it feel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
