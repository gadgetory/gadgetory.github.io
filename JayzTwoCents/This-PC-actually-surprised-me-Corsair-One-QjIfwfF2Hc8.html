today we're gonna review what's probably
one of if not the smallest pre-built
system that you can actually buy and
here it is today's video is sponsored by
master up in the Sennheiser PC 37 X
professional-grade gaming headset
Sennheiser is known for its legendary
sound quality and now you can have the
best of both worlds without compromising
mic quality making it the perfect choice
for gamers and professionals alike the
detachable ten-foot cable and 3.5
millimeter plugs that share maximum
compatibility while running your own
amplifiers without taking up an
additional USB slot to learn more about
the sennheiser pc 37 X's for mass drop
click the link in the description below
so I don't know if the Pelican is a part
of the actual retail shipping experience
but obviously they want the review unit
to arrive in text that's because what's
in here I think it's truly epic
so anyway inside of here what you're
gonna find is a box in a box I mean
we're always appreciative to have extra
Pelican cases hey that actually really
is pretty small box in a box isn't it so
obviously this is the Corsair one we
talked about this at CES and
we got a heads up that one was on the
way for us to take a look at now this is
technically the second version of likes
like a v2 if you all like a revision of
the original Corsair one which came out
in 2018 in fact of course they reached
out to me last year and was like do you
want to take a look at one and I was
kind of like man that really I mean I
did some ads for at night that was a
cool PC and all but I just I guess I
underestimated how small it truly is
because when I saw this see yes I was
like wait a minute
you got all that in there yeah I'd love
to take a look at it so this is what
they're dubbing they're convection
assisted cooling what we talked about at
CES is the fact that this basically has
a single fan at the top that pulls in
air to see how it just keeps getting
smaller it's like one of those little
Russian dolls like now I don't think I
might do a full teardown because we took
a look at this already at CES with one
that was opened up and I don't want to
mess with anything prior to us getting
kind of our testing numbers and stuff
because what I really want today's video
to sort of focus on is the thermals
because that's the challenge with
anything small form-factor is the
thermal capabilities of it so what's
happening here is you have two radiators
on the side one for the CPU one for the
GPU and there's no fans on them at all
the only fan in here is actually on the
top which I don't even think so 140
millimeter I think it's kind of a
proprietary size but I could be wrong on
that that is pulling air up which is
getting convection assisted so you have
the transfer of heat moving through the
rad and then being assisted by both the
natural convection of heat and heat
rises and all of that plus the fan
pulling heat through or note the heat
out of the case so I'm really curious as
to how one fan is going to perform with
the limitation of both volume and just
how crowded it is in there is not a lot
of open space I feel a mod incoming
some Hawaii do in terms of specs on this
one this is the corsair i 160 this is
the 9900 k with a 28 ECI the i-140 has a
9700 k with a r-tx 2080 and then there's
the pro which is coming out a little bit
later this year which has a silver case
and that's going to have an X 299 micro
ITX board or mini ITX board built by
asrock that actually uses quad channels
so dim memory what I want to test today
is the thermals on this because they
gave some pretty aggressive figures in
terms of what to expect temperature-wise
I think we're expecting to see somewhere
around 55 C on the GPU and I think we're
looking at somewhere in the 70s or low
80s on the CPU I have to double check
that figure these are pre-configured
systems though these are not bare-bones
you can't buy them and put your own
stuff in there because there's so much
proprietary happening in here and when
it comes to the assembly they figured
like look these are these are three SKUs
we offer here are the specs of them and
that's the way that they are so you
can't pre-configure it you can upgrade
the CPU if you want it like I do there's
nothing upgrade to with this at 900k but
if you bought the 9700 version you could
upgrade it to a 9900 K because it is
just a drop-in cpu nothing special there
so let's do this let's fire it up let's
get our software installed it's good
some games in here and then let's see
what the temperatures are really like
the computer and we don't normally have
the problem of computers being too small
around here well I don't think people
realize just how small this computer is
I mean okay that's the box for a 20 80
TI to put it in perspective that's in
there somewhere right so we'll just
leave that right there as a constant
reminder does that put it in perspective
just how small this chassis is okay so
we found out has 32 gigabytes of course
their memory in there but that's their
low profile ddr4 and of course power
profile is all set to default I was just
checking that it's set to balanced right
now it's not on you know high
performance or anything this is
completely one
percent out of the box settings I've
also got hardware monitor open here
because I can check all things fans are
at zero rpm that's the first thing we
noticed because if you look at the IQ
software this is how you control the
Corsair one there's two pumps obviously
there's two separate loops in here is
the GPU a i/o and a CPU a i/o and you
can see what the RPMs are there can't
adjust the speed as far as I could tell
our coolant temperatures which is
actually great to see because now we'll
know exactly when our loops are
saturated those temps stop going up then
we'll know okay
it's fully saturated no more having to
guess based on the actual temperature of
the diet so the other thing you're gonna
notice here is the fan by default it's
set to zero rpm because what we found
we've already done some testing on this
we're going to demonstrate it when the
CPU coolant reaches about 42 C that is
when the fan starts to ramp up it's a
1500 rpm fan and it hits max 1500 at
approximately 46 C on the coolant temp
and doesn't start to come on until 42 so
that four degrees range that 4 C range
is from zero to max now you might think
that's gonna be really jarring right the
fans just gonna kick on and just in an
amount of time and how long it takes the
coolant to increase is actually not that
long it can take minutes to go from 42
to 46 C I like OCC T for a couple
reasons one it's free you can go and
download it right now so if you want to
see how your temperatures and your loops
are your air colors or whatever compared
to this download it right now and follow
along with your 9900 Kay please don't
use like an 80 700 K or a 2 X 299
platform or a rise in CPU to compare
your temperatures they're not directly
comparable so let's go and run this for
10 minutes and see how it does
immediately the temperatures shot up to
71 72 60s and 70s on the core it's gonna
go all over the place based on the
testing but if you look at the CPU
coolant you can see the rate at which it
climbs is really not that fast it's at
35.9 see on the coolant okay so we've
been going for 11 minutes and 37 seconds
we know the loop has met has hit its max
because well it's actually starting to
come down slightly but forty six point
eight forty six point nine we've been
sitting there now for several minutes
with
the coolant temperature is increasing so
if we look at our maxes over here we're
currently sitting in the 70s with only a
few C Delta 81 was the hot or 83 was the
highest and then down into the 70s and
high seventies low 80s TJ max on this is
105 C on the course so if that tells us
we've got anywhere between 20 to 25 C
Headroom on this which is pretty amazing
and if you look at the current temps
with the test still running these are
these are much more indicative of what
the real temps are not those spikes but
again the coolant temperature has
equalized
it's really kind of stopped going up if
anything it started coming down slightly
because that fan curve is now kind of
waving like this because it's speeding
up and slowing down a couple hundred rpm
at the most and these temperatures are
100% in my opinion within check now the
other thing to talk about though is the
fact that we're only hitting 4.4 4.3 in
all core and it bounces around four or
five four six on some the 5 gigahertz
that's single core every now and then so
you can ignore the 5 gigs this is this
is not indicative of what's happy with
the CPU this is so if we look at this
right here let's go and just take a
random core let's look at oh and the GPU
loop yeah you can see it came down in
temperatures because the GPU loop is
actually on a separate loop but it's
controlled by the same fan so as that
fan ramped up the cool attempts came
down so this is when the temps first
came up when the fan was off once the
fan turned on you can see it came down
and then equalized and all the cores
pretty much paint the same picture this
very small independent loop for the 1900
K and here is doing its job and
maintaining the boost clocks that we
were expecting to see because 4 3 4 4
all course boosts clock or turbo clock
is what we expect to see now let's do
the exact same thing with the GPU and
we're going to do that we're using
superposition and 1080p extreme a lot of
people don't realize this 1080p extreme
is harder to run than 4k optimized so
we're gonna run this one until the
temperature on the GPU stops going up I
can't run on windowed mode on this for
some reason and I don't want to keep
going back and forth because when you
tap out it acts weird then you get a
weird overlay with Windows so we're
gonna just let it go until the GPM
you're stopped climbing and then fine
with that number is so it looks like we
maxed out about 64 see now this is gonna
be just like the CPU where the it takes
time for that fan to react it takes so
long for this fan to speed up that 64
seems to be about where it stopped it
look we're starting to go that back down
to 63 okay so it's Baddeley 60 and 61 or
having a fight to the death right now it
can't seem to go any lower but it won't
go any higher than 61 and we've been
looping now for a while so we're pretty
sure we've hit that equilibrium here's
what's weird about that when we ran it
earlier it was 58 see the ambient
temperature in the room right now is 20
see balancing between 20 and 21
it hasn't changed so we're gonna do
right now is we're gonna go ahead and
download another game and we are gonna
see what happens in terms of fps of that
FFF so of course we're gonna check out
Resident Evil 2 which is a very new
title now all the settings too are
pretty much set to pretty damn close to
max if you go to graphics we're in a
windowed 1440 mode rendering modes and
normal a lot of weird settings of this
game but our refresh rate is set to 60
because that's what the monitor is but
vsync is off and frame rates variable so
we're not locking it as you can see we
were getting 178 FPS in the game right
now
56 seems to be kind of where we're sort
of balancing out if we go in here and we
actually set fps to limit with vsync
then you'll see we get a ridiculous
amount of temperature drop but as you
can see the GPU usage went from 99 all
the way down to what 50 s and because of
that the temp starts dropping and it
actually rests approximately in the mid
40s when it comes to the game we saw 40
C actually at one point and there's a
little lesson for you there and how
vsync if you turn it on you can get a
pretty significant reduction in
temperatures and power usage he's
pointing and there is at the cop was at
a worker when someone just points into a
dark room as scary noises would you just
go
Wow okay well temperatures are still
about 54 so I would call that pretty
freakin reasonable if you ask me but I'm
gonna go ahead and save this game for
later because I want to enjoy it so our
CPU clock though during the game as you
can see was pretty much locked at 4.7
that was on all core verified over here
by hardware monitor clearly the CPU is
not having any problems with
temperatures in terms of gaming not that
I would have expected it to okay so the
corsair 1i 160 it definitely performs as
you would expect it's a 9900 k that
gives you all the full functionality of
it it's not like some desktop version
it's got a full sized in video reference
20 80 TI with a custom built water block
and custom built water cooling loops
i've got a single 500 gigabyte nvme
drive i think it's actually a 480 480
gig nvme drive and a 2 terabyte hard
drive as well as you know 600 watt sfx
power supply you've got your LP x ram in
there Aldi it's all off-the-shelf stuff
what's really kind of custom about this
quite honestly is the enclosure the
chassis that was built specifically for
this temperatures really not bad
considering the form factor we really
fought hard to control the temperatures
in our 9900 K and that small ghost s1
build that we did fill will tell you man
we pulled our hair out trying to get
that all just dialed in and this one is
doing it perfectly fine out of the box
with a single fan it comes at a premium
though obviously $3,600 $3,600 for this
it is definitely more expensive than the
sum of its parts a lot of people at this
point would say that's stupid just build
your own to wear that I would say in
Corsair would actually agree build your
own
there's nothing against build your own
this obviously has its intended market
and if that price carries you away and
you don't care about the form factor
then that's definitely not you so that's
where you guys basically sound off if
you think it's too expensive it doesn't
really change anything they've got a
more expensive one coming out at about
five thousand dollars which is the I 180
pro which we talked about at CES which
features a X 299 Mini ITX board that
uses sodimm quad channel another family
little disappointed about is the fact
that they went with a Z 370 chipset
rather than a Z 390 there are some
improvements to Wireless with Z 390 and
a couple of other key features with like
Bluetooth and stuff like that what
you're actually missing out on
whether you use it or not the fact that
you're paying this type of price I feel
like it's a feature that should have
been included not sure why they went
into the Z 370 instead of a 90 X is e
390 I'm probably gonna also tear this
apart and I might do another part you
guys tell me if you want to see that
where I upgrade the fan to go with more
Cooling's and I think I want to change
out that hard drive for a 2 terabyte SSD
I feel like for the price they could
have done that and still made money on
the deal so those are kind of my two or
three complaints about the thing but
other than that it seems to live up to
all the expectations they gave us at CES
in terms of temperatures and performance
and I'm really ecstatic Stu 9999 20x
fares in this form factor all right guys
sound off in the comments below thanks
for hanging out with us while we took a
look at this corsair 1i 160 link in
description below if you guys want to go
and check it out and as always I will
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
