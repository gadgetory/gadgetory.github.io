I hope not because we got lots to talk
about
do you want to be cooler do you want to
be more desirable well you're in luck
because right now you can own your very
own Jace to send swag and immediately be
the cool kid on the block max out your
sex appeal by following the link down
below
okay now SLI is something that has been
really kind of a point of well I guess
non relevancy over the last couple of
years because with Pascal they kind of
did away with three-way and four-way SLI
I used to run 3-way SLI with my nine 80s
and my seven 80s and it was kind of a
thing where people were like SLI sort of
dead Nvidia doesn't care anymore
so obviously by them using NV link on
these cards which is extremely higher
bandwidth than any even HP bridge that
were used to in the past we are going to
be testing some SLI to see if this is
scaling well because with the massive
amount of bandwidth now that NV link can
carry we're gonna test it but here's the
problem I have OCD to a degree and I I
just can't do mixed cards I could have
taken my 20 TI founders and then taking
my triple slot EVGA card and put it on
the second slot and it wouldn't have
been feared but that's okay because
we've got two MSI gaming x-tree is that
we're gonna use today custom PCB custom
power delivery and a massive amount of
cooling so this is the MSI 2080 ti
gaming X trio can you tell why they call
it trio it's got three fans it is a
custom PCB it's got triple power plugs
on here so it's got two eight pins and a
6 pin obviously because a beefed-up
power delivery massive heatsink as you
can see right here it's got a smaller
fan in the front a lot of people were
like why the smaller fan well this piece
is actually removable as you can see on
this card I removed it to put in our
Envy link bridge there's actually two
screws you have to remove to take this
piece off I'm not a fan of that because
easy to lose easy to lose those screws
in that piece or whatever it would have
been nice if they had made it so it was
just like a slot that could pull in and
out just like the cover for the envy
link on the founders card but this right
here should
hopefully give us a good advantage when
it comes to the other guys who are gonna
be doing SLI videos right now aka Steve
gamers Nexus I've come for you with
these bad boys and I've got a trick up
my sleeve
hope you're watching but by the time you
watch it's already happened so I also
put my X 299 dark from EVGA back on here
which has my 18 core 36 thread Intel 79
80 XC there's two reasons why I did that
one
I mean graphics core is what we truly
care about when it comes to the GPU so
the CPU gives us a nice combined score
for that world record spot which were
we're gonna which we're gonna get today
but it's more or less I changed this
from my 8700 K Maximus board because of
these slot spacing the Maximus board has
a 4x slot up top and the first 16 X is
actually slot 2 which pushed the card
down 1 which made it completely sandwich
to where the two cards were touching and
you could not use it and that config so
that's something you need to keep in
mind with the beefy size of the cards
these days if you are going to be going
with an SLI setup definitely not cost
effective but the elitist and the
enthusiasts out there will probably do
it if you if you're pushing these cards
up against each other which is very easy
with these being two and a half to three
slot cards you need to keep that in mind
so you need at least a three or four
slot spacing we're using 4 slot right
here as you can see with the triple card
leaves one slot in between now I did do
temperature testing with that sandwiched
the top card hits 8485 immediately with
the fans on 100% bottom card sits in the
high 50s low 60s as soon as we space
this out with one space the temperature
stayed within about 8 C of each other
and totally under our thermal limits
which we set so as long as you have one
space in between them you should be okay
so with that let's going to fire this up
and let's see how well this is actually
scaling we're gonna compare it to our
original benchmark numbers of the
founders card so with that let's power
it up
oh look rainbows I put a picture up on
Twitter showing the cards and most
people were like oh my god the RGB puke
blue is so sick of RGB blah you know at
this price point if it didn't have RGB I
bet you'd complain too so in preparation
for these behemoths though I've got my
1600 watt to gold rated PSU but we're
not gonna using
whole 1600 watts I've got Headroom I've
also got a 6-pin PCI Express plugged
into the motherboard for supplemental
power so that it's not pulling all those
watts just through the traces in the 24
pin so it's being directly supplemented
to the PCIe which can help with
overclocking stability but again I've
got a total of 6 PCI Express cables
hooked up to this we're also gonna be
using precision x1 for our overclocking
it's not only we're gonna sli these are
overclocking cards if we don't overclock
them what is the point of having them
custom PC because some cooling plates
big-ass heat sinks three fans if we
don't actually overclock these cards I
mean we're just leaving performance on
the table so if you guys want know more
about how to use px ones I'm not gonna
go into it in this video we did a video
about how to overclock our TX cards now
you guys can just go and check that one
out we go into in-depth on all these
different settings what they mean in
what they do so I'm gonna go ahead and
overclock these cards I mean why the
heck not this is an overclocking card so
we're going to you can see SLI is
enabled and yes it's still called SLI
although it is an NV link interface it's
still called SLI so that's enabled and
of course we wanna make sure our g-sync
is off which it is so we're using 4k
though because 1080p is usually just
straight up a bottleneck
even with one card we're seeing some
titles pretty much bottlenecking so
we're using all the same settings we did
in our launch video the only thing we're
changing though is temporal AAA because
this it even says right on here not
optimized for multi card it's not
recommended to be used so I'm using SMAW
and fatah on this one to give us a
baseline just so we know my EVGA r-tx 28
eti XC ultra which is another custom
cooler option gave me 65 fps and 4k our
founders card gave us 66 so within 1 FPS
which is kind of expected so let's see
how much we actually gain an SLI is it
scaling if it is how much is it scaling
by 100 and 4.96 fps we scaled 60 1.9
percent improvement with 2 cards that's
actually pretty good some games don't
even scale 50% so in shadow of the Tomb
Raider we're set to highest settings
right now I have a feeling this one's
gonna actually be pretty good average
FPS 124 so that's more than
our baseline tests yes we are
overclocked and that's probably why so
if we overclock the other card which is
about an extra 100 megahertz we might
have seen the baseline test go to over
60 FPS which would still be 50 percent
of this number so look at 124 fps and 4k
highest settings so latest titles that
are built around our TX within videos
internal promise of making SLI a more
relevant thing again appears to be well
future facing what if we go back to an
older title like rise of the Tomb Raider
that's one that was always kind of a
 show right so our test with the old
driver non overclocked on the
twenty-eighth ETI ultra was 80
we got one forty four point eight one
here so again good for 144 Hertz 4k
panel not perfect scaling but definitely
scaling nonetheless temperature-wise our
card reached 62 C but you know what I
think we can get the temperatures even
lower
nowhere yet Steve huh I bet you didn't
see this coming
okay so Jays chiller 2.0 is now ready to
fire up but at stock speeds right now
you can see our CPUs at 20 Â°c PWM or
powers at 18 see this motherboard itself
is at 16 but we're gonna go straight to
3d mark with our overclocks and our GPUs
and we're gonna see exactly how we do
all right so 13,000 789 in time spy
extreme a graphics core 14,000 532 that
is massive and times by extreme and if
we go ahead and compare these results
online times by extreme for two cards
scenario number one Oh yet Steve hmm I
should probably show Doug he's probably
gonna smash my score best way 13700 89
combined score gets us number 1 in time
spy extreme we are gonna go ahead and
just run through the gambit we're gonna
go through all the time spies and all of
the fire strikes and see where we land
obviously we're gonna be in the top very
high percentile because not many people
are running this config so as long as
people are taking time to get their
setups going I'm gonna take the
leaderboard while I can
so I spent the last couple of hours now
benchmarking and tweaking and tweaking
the cards that is SLI often you get a
lower clock speed in SLI than an
individual card so one thing to keep in
mind so here is what we ended up with if
we go over to 3d mark time spy extreme
and we go to two times or two cards look
at that world record holder for the next
day or two until the overclockers get
their sli bridges 14,000 zero for three
is my score our graphic scores a
fourteen thousand eight eighty four with
a cpu score of ten thousand six thirty
eight times by extreme two card another
record holder for me right there by
quite a bit actually two thousand six
hundred and seventy points ish higher
than number two right there again if you
look at our combined our total score so
you can compare your graphic scores we
have this test we got a graphic score of
fourteen thousand eight eight four and a
CPU score of ten three six eight so
moving on to fire strike ultra once
again world first by about eight hundred
points right there seventeen thousand
633 graphics thirty four thousand nine
hundred and sixty six visit score now
this is where the anomalies start
because I know there are settings if the
tweak and stuff and I've kind of
followed the guides on what to do with
your hyper threading and when to enable
it when to disable it which course is
disabled when you're running the 79 80
XC cuz it's it's kind of a buggy test
once you go to the high frame rate test
like fire strike extreme and fire strike
I'm straight up bottlenecked and fire
strike and I don't know how some of
these guys are doing it so let me show
you fire strike if we go over here to
two cards you can see my same setup even
though these are the same processor and
these are running to 1080 T eyes I drop
all the way down to number 24 and when I
compare the results my graphics core and
my physics score is significantly lower
than all of these guys right here so I'm
not insure exactly what's happening I
don't really care to be honest the
extreme stuff being a GPU more of a GPU
centric test that's all I care about
it'd be nice to get higher on there but
most people don't run fire strike
anymore it's a 1080p test but if we like
a fire strike extreme I'm number
slinky I'm coming for you man I'm less
than 200 points behind you I've been
trying to get this score for the last
hour or so and I've kind of given up for
now I'll come back and join this later
but our graphics cards never got hotter
than 40 see under load and our core
clocks during these tests were sitting
it shows max 300 now because it's gone
off the chart but our our max core clock
was sitting at 20 115 that's what we
were able to get 2115 megahertz and then
of course it drops down so sli with 28
ET i that's a ryan i didn't even know it
now I'm a poet that's okay I'm gonna
head and keep going
hey so 28 et is Li is definitely scaling
and stuff like 3d mark we're just having
to see if game developers actually take
advantage of it but in the meantime
having some of these top 10 and top one
whatever scores is actually kind of fun
at least until someone comes and knocks
me off and it's probably gonna be Steve
definitely gonna be kingpin and all
these other guys thanks for watching
guys and as always we'll see you in the
next one
they're the the TIE fighter is very high
pick mine you reading
it's like a mind-reading hat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
