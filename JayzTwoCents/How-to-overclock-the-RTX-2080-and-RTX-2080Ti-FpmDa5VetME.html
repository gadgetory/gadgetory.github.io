of our TX about the fact that it's a
terrible value whether you compare the
2080 to a TI or the TI obviously to a
1080 TI we are going to go ahead and
nonetheless do our review coverage as we
normally do by moving on to overclocking
I mean regardless of the value people
have bought these cards all the r-tx
cards sold out all the custom cards and
AIB cards have sold out on pre-orders so
clearly there's people out there we're
going to see how much extra power we can
squeeze out of these when it comes time
to start moving them sliders build from
NZXT let's buyers customize their gaming
experience based on their desired FPS
goals in today's most popular game
titles choose a game you want to play
set a budget and build will recommend
the best parts for your build want to
get gaming faster then choose blitz mode
and order before 11 a.m. Pacific time in
your order will be built tested and
shipped same day to learn more about
NZXT is build follow the link in the
description below so we're gonna cover
two cards here obviously the founders
Edition cards for the very purpose that
if you guys paid attention to the
keynote they actually showed a slightly
higher clock speed with the founders
Edition card than what the reference PCB
is which is kind of interesting because
the founders is a reference PCB it's
just apparently they're allowing it to
kind of boost farther than the reference
design which is what the AI bees have to
kind of follow so we're gonna be doing
the founders card and then also the EVGA
20 atti this is the XC ultra it is a
reference PCB but of course they're
cooling their custom cooling options we
got different backplate on here and
we've got this almost three slots a 2.75
slot with a massive heatsink on there so
this should hopefully handle any sort of
thermal overhead issues and I already
talked about how the thermal design on
the reference car or I'm gonna call it
reference it's not referenced
technically the founders card was a
little disappointing because of the fact
that they kind of chose aesthetics over
functionality in terms of air flow and
so I think that comparing that same
board to a custom cooler is going to be
something that's important now when we
do overclocking here we're gonna use
precision x1 this is actually what
NVIDIA sent with the review kit for
media because precision x1 was developed
in conjunction with NVIDIA and
so this is this is designed to work
specifically with the reference card or
the founder's card whatever you want to
call it as well as the EVGA card so as
you can see right here we've got our
GeForce r-tx 2080 Ti
let's go and get familiar with the
sliders here real quick this is your
memory clock now this is the clock that
it's currently running at so these
numbers that you see up top are real
time figures so you can actually see
what these are in real time without
having to go to the hardware monitor
which is the little heartbeat if you're
gonna change LEDs and LED colors and
stuff you do it here we're not changing
in the LEDs we don't care what led stay
to care about overclocking so this is
where we can monitor our GPU temperature
our max temps power limit this is gonna
be an important one today a little
spoiler as to what is gonna be coming
you can add more to it if you want by
just left clicking that and you can turn
on and off various things voltage limit
and maybe that's worth taking a look at
we'll see so we added a voltage limit
there so the first thing we want to do
now with all of our stuff factory so if
you're not sure if your factory just
click default it will reset everything
fan curves temperature target power
target clock speed and memory speed and
we are going to go ahead and start with
the heaven benchmark now this benchmark
is a good place to start because one
it's free so you need something to test
and two it allows us to just sort of
start our baseline testing now to get
true overclock stability numbers you
need to find a frequency that works in
all of your titles you might find
yourself being a hundred percent stable
in one benchmark and then crash
immediately in another benchmark or
another game so what you're gonna see us
do today you want to do for every single
one of your games in your titles this is
why benchmarking can take hours days or
even weeks to find a stable number so
we're sitting at 74 C which is there's
the 75 we saw 75 as our max in our
review through all of our testing it's
gonna sit right around 1725 1740 which
is still a small overclock that's
because we're getting we're hitting
power limits yeah we're sitting between
98 to 100 soon as that sits a hunt it
hits 100 it drops because it's not
allowed to go over 100 so we can make
the clock go higher without touching
even the clock slider by simply allowing
more power to be drawn
if we moved it all the way to the right
and we have a hit apply yet we're
allowing it to pool one hundred and
twenty three percent or twenty three
additional percent or twenty three
percent additional powers allowed to be
pulled so you can see by raising the
power limit to one twenty three which is
kind of funny because that's actually
farther than the reference spec calls
for apparel I think 112 is what the
reference spec sheet calls for but in
videos shipping them at one twenty three
so it's almost like in videos not
playing fair with their own AI bees and
competing with them which kind of sucks
why send the spec sheet and then ship
these cards oh that's right factory
overclocked right anyway but I digress
whatever stupid launches time our clock
speed is still at zero so you can see
our temps climbed because we're allowing
it to pull more power and the fan curve
still is kind of capping out at 59 this
is the factory fan curve so we need to
change the fan curve we need to change
the voltage and all that stuff let's
talk about the voltage real quick this
is the part a lot of people don't
understand so keep an eye on the number
right here see how it says 1000
millivolts or one volt
nine eight one or nine point eight one
millivolts or 0.98 one millivolts
whatever if we move that all the way to
the right it says 100 but watch when I
hit apply it's not applying 100
millivolts see how that stayed the same
that stayed the same because what that
slider represents is a percentage of
available Headroom so the voltage curve
actually allows for extra voltage to be
called for when needed at factory that's
just saying zero zero percent over volt
allowance so it's not allowing it to
pull more voltage until you move that
slider so if we set it to 20 that may
allow it to over volt by 20 percent when
needed by sending to a hundred percent
you're allowing it to take all of the
available extra voltage that it sees so
that curve doesn't usually change too
much and sometimes moving that all the
way to the right can mean a non stable
overclock or an unstable overclock
because it's now seeing more voltage and
at once and that's where ASIC quality
comes in that's a whole nother video
I've talked about it in the past but in
the in testing right now with r-tx it
hasn't made much of a difference in my
testing now if you look over here you'll
see we have even touched the core clock
yet but because we allowed more power
limit we see a higher temperature which
is expected because the fan curb hasn't
changed NVIDIA doesn't allow it to go
past 61% fan speed and our core voltage
or our core clock has not changed so the
first thing we're going to do here is
we're just gonna crank the fans be
because when you're asking it to
overclock you better be concerned with
you know temperatures over noise and
obviously with this being a not the most
optimized air cooler we're seeing hotter
temps and I would like I'd love to see
this much lower but you notice how our
core speeds started to come up just ever
so slightly because as this comes down
that's gonna go up right GPU boost it's
the the algorithm of temperature versus
power versus overhead now let's go ahead
and overclock our GPU just +100 that's
an actual number we're applying so we're
adding one hundred megahertz to that but
again you're gonna see this fluctuate
around even though it was at 1845 and I
said plus 100 it only gave us like
eighty of it or maybe seventy-five of it
because we're still hitting power limit
so you can see how the power draw on
this card is significantly affecting our
overclocking experience so I'm gonna go
ahead and make this plus one fifty and
so if we're adding an extra 50 we should
see that go to at least nineteen fifty
and we're getting the full 50 which is
kind of nice but again it depends on the
scene so as the scene starts to ask for
more you know calculations of the GPU
each scene on heaviness testing a
different thing as this hits 123 that
will drop back down when this goes below
that that will come back up so these are
directly related to each other and in
fact you can even see it here in the
hardware monitor because we have power
limits set right here look at all the
time we spent at 1:1 means we're
currently power limited so there we are
sitting at one right now and these dips
right here are usually seen changes
where it goes in between you can also
see we have hid voltage limit a couple
of times and that's because we move that
slider so our temp limit we never hit
temp limit because again we never hit
the number that represented right here
which is 8888 see is where we're
allowing it to go max
temperature we're sitting at 68 now with
a 150 overclock so in all my testing I
think plus 200 about as far as we'll be
able to get here this gets us just over
2000 megahertz 2025 which is a pretty
decent overclock temperatures are
definitely within check or within you
know they're within check yeah that's
the right turn my thing
yeah so now we know what the founders
card is capable of let's go ahead and
throw a reference PCB with a custom
cooler design on there and see what kind
of results we get
so the EVGA card is now installed
pitstop style there it is right there on
our test bench with its pretty green
lights of course the RGB and stuff is
controllable but that's besides the
point here as you can see our core clock
is actually bouncing around quite a bit
but once again we're still hitting that
same power limit voltage look at the
temperatures though 65 see and that's
about as hot as it's gonna get when
everything is set to defaults but let's
see what happens here when I move the
slider so they've got a one hundred and
thirty percent available to this
Republic we're calling thirty percent
extra power to be delivered to the core
and all the other components look how
far that went by just moving that slider
so that's already farther than the
founder's card went but of course the
temperature is going to go up too so now
we want to go ahead and come in here and
crank these fans so we're gonna go head
and move this voltage slider up just
like before that way we can allow it to
pull all the voltage it needs slew this
we're sitting in the 1900s 1920
megahertz
over 4000 CUDA cores I keep saying over
4,000 cuz I can over the exact number
I'm a terrible reviewer I know between
these temperatures though overclock
sitting at 63 64 C so let's go ahead and
do a plus 100 on there and see it we get
just shy of 2,000 we can actually move
our memory too
let's go 750 on that we're currently
getting in 1440p 260 FPS in heaven so
this is definitely doing well with the
over clocks and the temps continue to
come down one thing to keep in mind and
why water-cooled cards will typically
give you a little bit extra Headroom
with the same BIOS and stuff is because
the fans are using voltage - this is a
TDP or total as is the total package
this is the entire card as a whole not
just the GPU so when fans go to 100% it
uses a little bit of that as well
because they're using more amps to turn
the fan it's a very miniscule amount but
it's still enough to affect our Max
Headroom if we are hitting power limit
everything pulling power on this card is
now affecting the total core clock that
were able to get so let's try pulling
down the voltage limit and see what
I'm go all way back to zero see if we
crash we didn't crash power lemon and
course beat is still bouncing around
just the same so there's your definite
proof that we're hitting power limit
watch what happens when I changed the
core clock this will spike and come
right back again because of that and if
we look at our see there's our words
just still sitting at power limit so
power is what's limiting our max clock
not the core speed so you hit 2100 for
just a second and then the voltage drops
the core clock starts to drop and that's
again specifically because of the fact
that we're hitting power limit my try
200 and see if this crashes nope we're
sitting at 20 85 now you know we got to
do now okay just crashed so we're gonna
pull the clock back just a little bit
and we need to now run some fire strike
and see if we can't get on the
leaderboard so when I did the original
benchmark you guys saw in the review
where I put the XC up there as well our
score was a 13,000 956 that was the
graphics score and that was running on
the driver for 11.5 won which was the
media driver we're currently running for
11.6 3 and like I said our score is a 13
9 5 6 we just got a graphic score 15,000
350 14 8 to 8 was our combined score so
if we see where that gets us in Hall of
Fame oh there we are out there number 15
Danny I was hoping to get up there with
the Titan V guys but anyway you know
look someone else is out there
benchmarking their 2080 ti as we speak
haha I beat you so here's kington score
right there with his 20 atti
that's ok though because if we go ahead
and move over to time spy extreme and
then we do the 2 card option spoiler
alert in our next video
who's number 1 baby so that's for our
next video but as you guys can see the
2080 ti does overclock it doesn't have a
huge amount of headroom because power is
definitely what's limiting and hopefully
once those tensor cores are sitting
there doing nothing besides scratching
their ass we can actually see what's
gonna happen in the future 3d mark is
gonna be updating for a rate racing
benchmark apparently so there is that
alright guys thanks for watching tell me
what you thought of the overclocking
ability of these cards and as always we
will see you in the next one
[Laughter]
okay all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
