new and improved 2014 version of how to
build a computer basic version this is
for the beginner the guy who has no idea
where to start and hopefully I can
answer all of your questions today with
this build
now before you guys start asking me no
this is not my computer this is actually
my cameraman dracs ons computer go ahead
and say hi believe it or not we're not
brothers ok so in this video I'm going
to be showing you pretty much from A to
Z how to build your first computer now
as always if you want to do a good job
you have to have the right tools now
when I'm doing a basic build I like to
use a very basic tool set the main tool
that I use is my 5 in one combo
screwdriver here actually think it's a
foreign one whatever it is got two
different size screw heads on each side
both Phillips and flathead on each end
it's got a nut driver built into each
side an eight millimeter an eight
millimeter and a ten millimeter and then
of course it works as a screwdriver so
this is all the tools I need in one and
then I like to use a set of wire cutters
this is for cutting zip ties and things
when I'm doing my cable management and
then of course we have those zip ties
now these are the only tools I use when
I'm doing a custom build
clearly things like red mists have a
much wider tool set so when you're
building your first computer you want to
make sure you have those tools readily
available if you start the job without
the tools you're not going to get very
far in the bill okay parts what are we
using for parts here well for a case
here we are using the fractal design arc
mini not the mini the mini mi ni and
this is a micro ATX case here now for a
motherboard we are actually using the
MSI z87 eye it's a mini ITX none of
micro ATX it is a mini ITX board we
actually took this out of an existing
mini-itx built that he had so normally I
would use an ATX board or a micro ATX
board but there's going to be a lot of
excess room in this case with this tiny
little board now for the CPU it's
already installed but don't worry we
will go over this this is an Intel i5 46
70 K which we will be doing a little
overclock on for RAM we have an 8
gigabyte kit of Patriot VIPRE extreme
this is 2133 mega her tramp it's pretty
damn fast in fact it's good ram for an
APU build as well our graphics card is a
GTX 770 this is a EVGA model I believe I
could be wrong I don't know might be an
Asus anyway its reference it doesn't
really matter it's a blower design and
it's nice it is an EVGA it says it right
on there it's quite read but it's nice a
sturdy build and it is a blower style
exhaust we're not going to exhausting
the heat inside of the case for the
cooler we are using the cooler master
side in 120 cooler here it is a 120
millimeter radiator here with a green
LED fan on on here kind of sticking with
the green theme for NVIDIA all-in-one
cooling unit it's actually a very solid
unit for the power supply this is
actually the only brand-new part we're
using in this build and this is the v6
50 semi modular power supply from
Coolermaster now when it comes to power
supplies this is a very important
component you don't want to cheap out on
the power supply you may notice this
since an 80 plus gold and the reason why
you want your power supply to be a nice
top quality model the best that you can
really afford when it comes to rating in
my opinion is because this is what's
sending all of the electricity through
your system this is also what can
single-handedly kill every component in
your system the voltage regulators in
this take a crap so we are using the B
650 from Coolermaster because of its
solid Japanese capacitor design and this
has one of the best if not the best
warranty on the market right now with
very aggressive five-year gold guarantee
they're pretty much cover all
replacement costs all of the labor all
the warranty all the parts and even the
shipping to and from Coolermaster to get
your unit repaired if something goes
wrong in that five year period so five
years all costs covered
is very very aggressive so that is why
we're going to the brand new unit in
this rather than reusing our older 80
plus bronze power supply so definitely
give that a look if you're building a
computer and you need to have a nice
quality unit now when it comes to parts
that's pretty much it oh you know it
actually helped if I told you guys what
we were using for our hard drive we are
using the Intel 520 series 240 gigabyte
SSD we're going to probably have to put
a mechanical drive in here later
I'll get it pre-wired for that so that
jacks on can stick his mechanical drive
in here without any you know having to
do any of the wiring because 240 gig SSD
is just not going to cut it especially
when you're dealing with games like
titanfall which are over 50 gigabytes
now with the expansion so yeah we are
going with an SSD in this build alright
so without further ado those are the
parts let's go ahead and start the basic
how to build your first computer here
with JSU says okay so the first thing I
like to do when I'm doing my basic
builds as I like to get the CPU
installed so that we have nice protected
CPU socket your CPU is going to have a
cover on it if it's brand new since we
are reusing this motherboard there is no
cover so it's important that we get
these pins protected now AMD and Intel
are a little bit different on the way
these work because we are dealing with
in Intel CPU there are a couple notches
on here you need to make sure to line up
with your motherboard if you're using
AMD there's a triangle you need to make
sure it lines up with the socket either
way you need to refer to your manuals
for your equipment to make sure that you
are installing it properly now with
Intel we're going to take the little arm
we're going to force it down push it
underneath the little tab and now your
Intel CPU is installed AMD is a little
easier because the pins are located on
the chip rather than inside the
motherboard so you need to be more
delicate with the chip on AMD site
because the pins are exposed either way
we're installed down we're going to go
ahead and move on to the next step now
step number two for me I like to install
the RAM on the motherboard just so I
don't have to do it when it's already in
the case now because we are dealing with
a Mini ITX board we only have two slots
for RAM most motherboards are going to
have four some even have aides if you're
dealing with like an extreme platform
for Intel on the x-series now we have
two six of ram here for
Channel so we're going to go ahead and
just install them in both slots but if
you had four slots and you're only using
two sticks of RAM you're going to have
to refer to your motherboard manual or
go online if you don't have it and find
out which slots you need to use for dual
channel configuration if you're using
all four slots don't worry about it just
stick them all four in there if you put
them in the wrong slots you may
accidentally activate single channel
instead of dual channel which will
affect your computer's performance so
make sure you check your motherboard
manual secondly you need to refer to
this little slot right here on the on
the actual memory itself you'll notice
that there's more pins on one side than
the other there is a corresponding slot
in your motherboard right here that
you're going to want to make sure lines
up with the slot on your memory if you
force it in there backwards you're going
to damage motherboard RAM or both so
make sure those are lined up make sure
your little retaining tabs on your
motherboard or open some may have tabs
on both sides this board only has it on
one side so make sure that you're
referring again to your board to make
sure you're doing it properly so go
ahead and line it up in there with that
groove slide it down there you go once
it clicks in move on to the next stick
and you have just installed your very
first as wellness presumably your very
first CPU and RAM in your motherboard
okay so the very next thing I like to do
once I've got my motherboard set up at
the CPU and RAM and safely out of the
way on a surface it's not going to
damage it I like to get the case ready
for installation now what that usually
means for me is I'm going to remove the
front filters that they're equipped I'm
going to remove the top filter of so
equipped in this case the fractal case
does have a removable top with filter
built in so that we can expose the top
of the case and we are going to remove
both the front and the back panels now
once we've done that we're going to go
ahead and we're going to move on to the
hard drive cages and we're going to move
move the box of hardware we're going to
meet this for our standoffs and whatnot
and I like to remove any hard drive
cages that are not going to be used now
the front of this case has 120
millimeter intake fan it has room for
another fan if you
want to install one I don't believe it's
really going to be necessary in this
case because the fractal cases already
have such good airflow removing that
excess drive that we don't need it's
going to allow us to have perfect open
air flow right here for this fan giving
us unrestricted air flow for the rest of
the case now on this one too you can
also install your SSDs on the back so
you need to decide if you have multiple
drives or you're going to install them
both back here you can install them on
the drive cages so in this case directs
on where would you like your SSDs melted
on the back hidden or in the hard drive
tray there alright so we're going to put
the SSDs on the back here which
technically means we could remove the
all of the hard drive cages for even
maximum airflow if we wanted but since
I'm pretty sure he's going to want to
put some mechanical drives in here if he
doesn't go with another SSD which is
probably not likely because gaming on a
standard drive is fine for most games
we're going to leave this front cage in
here take the top cage out for maximum
airflow now that we've got the case
ready to go the next thing we want to do
is get our motherboard ready to go
inside the case now the first thing
you're going to want to do when getting
your motherboard ready for installation
is install your motherboard standoffs
that's these guys right here these are
what your motherboard are going to mount
to you'll notice most cases they are not
pre mounted because every motherboard is
a little different you have ATX micro
ATX mini ITX EA TX they all have a
little bit different arrangement when it
comes to standoffs so since we are going
to be using a mini ITX we're going to go
ahead and use the screw holes that are
marked mini ITX now these aren't
actually marked mini ITX I just happen
to know which ones they are because
they're going to be these four right
here these this really kind of look kind
of funny in this case but hey you're
gonna have lots of extra airflow now the
cool thing about the fractal cases is
they actually come with this little
piece right here that slides over the
top of the mini or the stand off which
allows us to have a little bit easier
way of screwing it in it's got a Philips
screw on there so it's a lot easier to
get them started without tearing all the
skin off of your fingers which I really
hate I really hate tearing skin
my fingers it's not a really a good time
and that's that's what you're going for
if that's what you're going for then by
all means tear all the skin off your
fingers that you want well the mistake
that I was about to make because I
didn't have it ready to go was we need
to make sure that we have our i/o shield
this guy right here inside before we put
the motherboard in now how do you know
which way it goes this way or this way
well you got to look at your motherboard
and determine where it's going to line
up so now if we take a look at our
motherboard we can see it's going to go
in this way which means that we want to
have it line up like so so doing it like
this we can just go ahead and take our
i/o shield and pop it in there now if
you have a lower end motherboard these
i/o shields tend to be very very sharp
it's probably the most common place
people get cut when doing their builds
installing their IO shields so I would
highly recommend you just be careful
putting in the edges can be very very
very sharp and they can slice the crap
out of your finger so you don't want
that to be you now that we've got the
i/o shield in there we're just going to
go ahead and gently slide our
motherboard in line up the holes on the
i/o shield make sure that the holes line
up here for the motherboard then you're
going to take the included screws with
your motherboard stand off and your
screwdriver and then you're going to I
like to start on the bottom most screw
it's easiest to get to it's going to
hold the rest of the motherboard in
place and you don't want to force it
really hard if you can't get the screw
hole to line up something may be in the
way you're blocking so check roll the
film with computer hardware is if you
have to force something really really
hard chances are something is off so you
want to double check that you don't want
to force as you're going to break
something so there we go we've got that
screw in and we're just going to work
our way around if you have ATX
motherboard you're gonna have a lot more
shoes to deal with
fortunately the ITX stuff is very very
simple only four screws
all right so our motherboard is
installed and typically the next thing I
do from here depends on the build that
I'm doing if it's a standard size
computer case I tend to not do the
cooler yet I tend to do the power supply
but because we are going to be using the
all-in-one cooler in this build I'm
going to go ahead and install the fan
for the 120 millimeter radiator back
here in the top but not the rearward
most fan position normally if you would
put it right here where the rear fan is
or even the rear exhaust fan or the top
rear or exhaust fan but in this one I'm
going to go ahead and stick it a little
bit forward that way we have easier way
of routing the tubes because the tubes
for these tend to be really rigid on
some of these all-in-one coolers now one
other thing that I want to keep in mind
because the next step here is also
planning is you need to take a look at
where all of your plugs are and if you
take a look at this you can see
typically your power supply 24 pin and
other connectors are going to come in
off the side this way but for this build
it's on the top so we're going to have
some interesting routing to do here with
cables but either way it's it'll work
out well I'll show you how to do some
cable management while we're at it
alright so as I mentioned in the
previous segment I was going to do the
cooler first but upon realizing like I
said that all of the plugs for this case
are going to be moving in through the
top it means that our cooler is going to
block some of our work here that we need
to do first so what we're going to do
next we are going to go ahead and
install the brand new power supply here
from Coolermaster we are also going to
handle all of the front plugs so we're
gonna go ahead and start doing our
wiring first now what I did on the back
here was you can see that they've
already done a little bit of wire
management here by zip tying these in if
I leave those as they are they're not
going to reach so this is why I actually
have my wire cutters that I use to cut
these off so we're going to do next is
we're going to cut off these zip ties
we're going to get the cable plugs
through the top kind of arranged where
we want them to go and then we are going
to get our power supply
plugs ready to go so wiring is the next
thing I'm going to do in this build now
this was actually a perfect example of
what I was talking about earlier where
you're going to have to check your
manual if things aren't mounted or you
know labeled on your motherboard most
motherboards are labeled and even color
coordinate comes to the front panel
connectors this one was not so I had to
refer to the internet and I have the
manual up in front of me and now I could
plug in the front panel connectors based
on the manual so again you need to refer
to your manuals when it comes to this
sort of stuff
you
you
okay so as you can see from little video
there I was finagling this a little bit
and it was a little bit tougher than I
would have liked you guys know me I am a
clean wiring fanatic my cable management
is a lot of superior to most people's
I'm not trying to flow my own boat I am
just a clutter I hate clutter inside the
case especially so you can see here I've
got the cables coming up nicely here the
zip tied together and what I was
fighting with was running the audio
cable underneath this heatsink so that
it's nice and clean there at the antenna
coming across there the USB 3.0 here
you'll notice the USB 2.0 plug is not
used because we actually have a warning
sticker right on here from fractal it
says only use the USB 2.0 plugs if the
3.0 is not available on your motherboard
this one is available so here it is
right there now we will be able to push
that out of the way get our upper
radiator fan in there when we're ready
but the next step for us now is going to
be to go ahead and get the power supply
in here because I still have to run our
24-pin power as well as our a pin VPS
power here on the motherboard and then
after that I'm going to get two SATA
cables coming off of here because again
they're up on the top or they're a
little bit difficult to access then
we'll move on to installing our cooler
now in the back of the case here when it
comes to the front panel connector as
you can see I've got them routed
together together here nice and neat the
USB 3.0 I put a pretty strong bend in
there so it stays flat and then we've
got our rear fans and our front fan here
we'll deal with all that later so we'll
be mounting our SSDs there and when it
comes to the next step we are going to
be installing our power supply as I
mentioned it's still going to be tight
fit up top so I'm going to put the
cooler in yet and create any smaller
workspace then we already have to work
with so power supply installation here
we come okay when it comes to power
supply installation there are two
different ways that you can mount these
power supplies and this is going to
depend entirely on your case now if
you're going to be installing your case
on carpet it means it's going onto your
desk or something I'm going to recommend
that you install the power supply with
the fan pulling air in from the case if
you're going to be installing it on desk
or your mother or your
case has adequate spacing for your power
supply which means it gets it up off of
the bottom floor through some stilts or
some feet then you can install it either
way that you want now this case has
pretty decent about an inch worth of
height on here but depending on how
thick your carpet is you could still
potentially plug the bottom intake which
means that your power supply is getting
starved of air which means it's going to
get hot it's going to lose efficiency
and it's also going to ultimately reduce
the lifespan depending on how hot this
power supply gets so I like to mount the
power supplies pulling in air from
inside the case regardless of where
they're going as you can see my cases
are on the desk but I like to have fresh
air coming in from the front of the case
that then gets exhausted out the back so
that's the way that I'm going to be
installing it here using the screws that
are supplied with my case for installing
the power supply so keep that in mind
we're gonna be putting the fan face down
and you're going to be putting your case
on carpet there's a good likelihood that
you could be choking your power supply
for air if the case itself does not
mount it up a little bit higher than the
case floor so please please keep that in
mind okay so unfortunately I'm gonna
have to flip this power supply over so
that the fan is on the bottom and that
these cables are closer to the back of
the motherboard
wall or motherboard tray because
unfortunately a lot of these lower end
or lower price range power supplies
I wish the cables were longer I mean
this is a micro ATX case and it doesn't
really reach so I can get it about five
to six inches more length of these
cables by flipping it over and getting
this portion closer to the back wall so
that's what we're going to go ahead and
do
now as I mentioned earlier guys we are
using the Sidon 120 cooler here looks
like we actually have some bent fins and
should actually do a video on this on
how to straighten fins back out they're
actually very very thin pieces of
aluminum or copper depending on the
radiator that you have you can
straighten these all back out by just
using a little obviously isn't a zip tie
that I cut the end off of here and as
you can see these straighten out very
very easily
maybe I figured while I was here and I
noticed some of these are bent probably
at the time of installation the first
time might as well take care of that now
because bent Flint fins if you have a
lot of them will affect your air flow
now at this point some of you guys are
probably saying but JD didn't show the
installation of the mounting plate er
you didn't show the installation of the
retaining screws or any of that well the
reason why I didn't do that is because
all coolers are different even this 120
cooler is different from their Neptune
120 which is different from their
glacier 240 which is different from the
Corsair 100 I the a JDI they're all
different so you need to refer to your
manual make sure that you're doing it
right that is your responsibility this
one's ready to go so we're going to go
ahead and mount this down now the first
thing we want to do is I like to mount
the radiator first so it's not flopping
around and then we will do our thermal
paste on the CPU and then we will go
ahead and do the mounting of the block
down and we'll discuss how to do your
thermal paste installation at that point
as well now this pump does use a four
pin pwm header so this is intended to be
plugged into your CPU cooler header so
make sure that you guys locate that on
your motherboard and plug this into the
CPU cooler so without further ado is get
this installer or this cooler installed
all right so crisis averted which I
couldn't figure out how is gonna get
this all to
now I could have just easily taken out
the five and a quarter base here which
is how you would allow it triple rat up
on the top and mounted it up here and
had no problem but then I started
thinking if I had a 120 rear exhaust a
140 exhaust and then a 120 radiator
exhaust with only one intake we'd start
having some pretty massive negative
pressure issues so as it sits right now
I'm going to have this one 120
millimeter intake here we move we move
the green LED fan off of the radiator
put it up top as the exhaust fan
check out the 140 entirely and we put
the 120 fractal design fan as the
exhaust or pull fan on the radiator so
we no longer have a lit fan on the
radiator it's now our exhaust fan on the
top which will be nice it'll give us
some accent lighting here inside this
case so that's how we went ahead and did
it there might still be a slight amount
of negative pressure but because of the
amount of resistance the radiator is
going to be adding to this it's not
going to be really adding too much in
terms of negative pressure to the case
so we have balanced 120 intake 120
exhaust plus the radiator so I think
we're going to be okay on pressure in
fact we might be pretty neutral on
pressure here which is good for dust so
now we're going to do is we're going to
go ahead and install the cooler show you
how I like to install my thermal paste
and then we'll start wrapping this bad
boy up okay so when it comes to thermal
compound we are using the enttec formula
seven I've never used this my the owner
of this PC bought it and so we're going
to go ahead and use it now when it comes
to applying thermal paste there's two
different methods you need to consider
and it depends on what kind of CPU
you're using if you are using an Intel
CPU the processor core is actually
running up and down in a rectangle right
in the middle of the heat spreader now
if you're using AMD they are in core
clusters that are on the peripheral of
the actual heat spreader so they're on
the outside so if you're using AMD I
tend to like to use an X pattern where
you draw a line from corner to corner
and then you go to the opposite corner
to corner that's how I do
AMD installation on Intel I tend to
either just do the P method or do the
line
in this case I'm going to go ahead and
do the line method it's how I like to do
it here with Intel and we are going to
be using as I mentioned the antic antic
formula 7 it is a diamond compound
alright so there's our line right there
right down the center of the CPU as we
tighten down our cooler that is going to
spread out and give us a nice uniform
cooling when it comes to tightening down
your cooler as I mentioned before you
need to consult your coolers manual for
the proper way of tightening it down
every cooler is different now for me I
like to do things in a cross pattern so
that's the way I'm going to do it now
because we're dealing with water cooling
this tends to have a spring-loaded screw
on there which will not allow the screw
to go down tighter than what is
specified from our manufacturer
recommendations so I'll just kind of get
each screw started and then I will
tighten down each screw until it won't
go down any farther till hits the end of
the threads but please the love of God
check your coolers manufacturer specs
that way you don't destroy your CPU
because it over tightened most coolers
these days won't allow that to happen
but of course I don't want you guys
sending me hate mail saying you crushed
your brand-new CPU because Jay said
tighten it all the way down because
that's not what I said I said check your
manufacturer retail manual yes you must
read manuals and I'm not above reading a
manual I already had to do it earlier to
figure out where the headers go on this
mother work so if you think you to
manually manly for a manual I bet you're
also too manly to ask for directions
aren't you alright so now we're
installed just kind of give it a little
push on there everything seems to be
nice and tight that's not going anywhere
go ahead and take your plug whether it
be for fan or pump and then plug that
into your CPU header in our case here we
are going to plug that into CPU one all
right so now start look like an easy
little computer in a bit loose okay so
the next thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna take up what looks like a
massively huge graphics card
for need a big new motor board and we're
going to go ahead and get this bad boy
installed now what you're going to want
to do when it comes to removing the rear
panels here are the rear little plate
covers is you pretty much are going to
remove the one that is perfectly
adjacent to the PCI Express port and
then the one below it if it's a dual
slot card if you have a triple slot card
you'll remove three and if you have
anything more than that well I've never
seen a quadruple slot card so you're
probably on crack cocaine now let's go
ahead and make sure that the tab here
for the PCI Express port is not in
position you want make sure it's in the
down position one thing you also need to
make sure is that the little nipple tab
things here on the back of the input
shield for the graphics card goes into
the little slot there's actually little
grooves in most of these cases that
those will slide into and then make sure
that your socket here is perfectly lined
up with the graphics card and then when
this tab is down and you push it in
it'll click into place and then you go
ahead and put in your retaining screws
and there we go
world's easiest installation of any
computer part in my opinion is plugging
in your graphics card now just take your
thumb screws and what I like to do to
make sure we're not getting any sag is I
like to take the rear of the card and
support it with my hand as high as it
will go as I tighten down the first
thumb screw that way we get a little
less sag in there as we're installing it
once you install both these screws and
your graphics card he's done now we've
got the card installed we need to give
this thing some power so you're going to
go ahead and pull through your plugs
here in this graphics cards case we have
a four pen and eight pin PCI Express
power need so we are going to take our
this is what we call a six pin an eight
pin dovetail type of plug you can see
here it's a six pin but it also has a
another little piece that you can
install or just kind of slap on there
that turns it into an eight pin in this
case we're only going to be using one of
them and so we'll just get that in place
plug it into the eight pin grab the back
of the graphics card like this when you
go to plug it in that way you're not
putting any undue strain on the socket
on the motherboard so that way you're
not pushing and giving leverage against
your socket so support the back of the
card with your hand and push it till it
clicks you're going to repeat the same
thing on the other plug
we'll kind of push this out of the way a
little bit push it down otherwise it
might actually hit against the window
and there you go your graphics card is
now installed baby let it go buddy all
right so really all we have left to do
now is install the hard drive which this
guy wants to put in the back and we will
then be pretty much ready to fire her up
oh we also have to plug in the fans
that'll be important too okay so since
Jack's on would like to put the SSDs on
the rear here we're going to do is
really is this one over here actually
the way all these cables aren't in the
way on the fractal case you have to
unscrew the little plate but to make it
a lot easier to install the SSD on it
and then you install the plate back on
after you put the screws in but again
this is a part in your build where you
are going to have to refer to how things
are installed in your case because
everything is a little bit different the
SSD is now mounted on the back of the
motherboard tray so all it's left to do
now is run our SATA power from our power
supply back here
our SATA plug to the motherboard and
then like I mentioned I want to make it
easy for him to be able to install
another motherboard or another hard
drive in the future so I'm going to run
power and SATA port to the hard drive
cage over here as well I'm also going to
tidy things up a little bit back here we
for instance I'm going to put a little
zip tie right here to keep these cables
together because you guys know I'm a
wiring freak
I cannot stand untidy wires so the gift
and a curse if you will because it's a
gift when it comes to my pcs and it's a
curse may have to look at those that
just don't care all right so since we
are dealing with the semi modular power
supply here at the Vee 650 I'm only
going to take one of these SATA ports
because I think it will work well enough
to where one of these will be able to
supply power to both the hard drive over
here as well as coming off of the power
supply which will allow us to be able to
use as little wiring as possible so you
just simply plug that in
and this is the part where you guys have
to use a little common sense when it
comes to wire management obviously the
least amount of wires showing is going
to be the cleanest look so pull it all
the way through to the back and once you
get to the back here like I mentioned
one cable is going to be more than
enough because as you can see power
supplies from Coolermaster tend to have
just a while this one here is actually a
4-game so we've got for power or SATA
power on here and you can see it's
plenty long to reach this hard drive as
well as one over here so it's going to
allow us to be even neater on the amount
of cabling that we need which is going
to be very very nice in terms of cable
management now when it comes to plug in
your SATA power here kind of get a
close-up on this you can see that
there's a little notch that comes off
make sure you line up those notches and
another pro tip for you is you don't
want to make sure that you don't
actually force it in there or put too
much lateral pressure on it the plastic
tabs that hold on these power plugs are
going to break off really really easy so
there's our SATA power we'll just kind
of tuck this in the bottom right here I
like to kind of take these and sort of
bend that one like that and that like
that see it's a little flatter that and
then we can just force it right down
here into the bottom and now he's got a
plug right here ready to go for his hard
drive when he's ready to add a storage
drive into this which I highly recommend
when possible because 240 gigs is just
not gonna cut ok we have got our SATA
power ran from the power supply here all
the way to both well the SSD and
hypothetically where the HDD is going to
go you know with plenty is there's
actually three more modular plugs on
this and aren't going to be needed
because actually I think I might have to
digress a little bit yep we do need to
install one more of them because as you
can see fractals still using standard
for pin molex for their little
and fan controller here because they
haven't moved this one up to the 21st
century no there's nobody is using those
anymore so what I'm going to do next is
I'm going to go ahead and run the SATA
cable from the SSD on the rear to the
motherboard and then we're going to go
ahead and run the other ones so that he
has that for the future so without
further ado let's go ahead and get these
cables ready to go I'd say without
further ado a lot no one ever says
without further adult is you're never
gonna be like let's don't do that unless
you're just really bad in English then
you might use a double negatives like
never not denna stuff like that
perfectly acceptable English as far as
I'm concerned well unfortunately
standard length SATA cables not going to
reach a motherboard or the other hard
drive hypothetically so we have power
ran for him unfortunately you're going
to have to get a longer cable if you
want to do another hard drive but at
least it's not too hard to get you as
you saw it's because of the non that's
because of the really weird placement of
the the cables here on this motherboard
shame on you MSI well then again it's a
mini ITX a very limited room to work
with I don't think it it's too bad never
run into these problems problems on Mini
ITX
cases because they are super small cases
so standard link cable sometimes are too
long but anyway yeah you're just gonna
have to get yourself a longer cable dude
but at least you have power ran down
there alright so the next thing we're
going to go ahead and do now we have the
SSD plugged in as you can see right here
power and SATA so next thing to do is
clean up these wires a little bit get
our fans plugged in and then this bad
boy is ready to game all right so
because the power cable that they used
on their built-in fan controller is a
4-pin molex I have added our 4-pin molex
here to our power supply of course it's
modular so I just grabbed it and plugged
it in and all we got to do now is plug
those two together now we have power for
this cable now we've got two
fan headers that are exposed in the back
and one is too short to make it out it's
actually up here in the drive bay so
what I'm going to do to keep it nice and
clean up front is I'm actually going to
take this three pin header and I'm going
to kind of shove it through that hole
right there pull it up through like that
that way it doesn't get seen there's no
reason to run it across the back here
because that header won't make it out of
the five and a quarter bay anyway so if
I turn that around see now I'm just got
the header right there and take the fan
make it as easy to see you guys can
because it literally does not make it
out of there the length is not the same
all around just line up the grooves and
there we now have our front fan is
getting power I just kind of shove that
out of the way but you can see you don't
see any of those wires right here so a
little bit of cable management tip there
for you you got holes and things you can
shove things through and you're not
planning on bringing any
five-and-a-quarter Bay's in there do it
shove things in the hole all right so
now we'll just take the two on the back
we've got our two rear fans on the back
here we're just going to plug those in
same and there we go
now we've got a little bit of a wiring
mess here we've got to deal with because
I mean as you can see here we've got a
little excess slack to deal with and
because all these links are a little bit
different what we're going to go ahead
and do here is I like to grab them like
this fold them over on themselves and
grab a what a zip tie zip ties are like
ring men it's the next best thing to
slice bread and I don't even like brick
I really like zip ties so zip tie it up
and you can kind of shove it up under
the little like a gap in some cases
anyway this one does really have that
gap on the bottom is a gap you can see I
use that for the bottom cables so we'll
do the same thing here
we'll just kind of actually because this
is a flat cable I'm just going to kind
of shove it underneath the power cables
I have right there
it'll be out of the way saves me a zip
tie they won't get seen and with that
there you go the entire computer is now
wired up all the mess is contained
behind the motherboard tray I push that
up you won't see that through the little
opening on the front there you can see
that one but again that can't really be
helped me I guess if I cut that zip tie
and brought it across but that's not
going to really bother anybody if you
turn around look in the front as you can
see our computer is complete everything
is wired up we've got nice unobstructed
airflow from the front fan feeding in
the back of the graphics card and into
the motherboard area nice unrestricted
airflow for the radiator pulling air out
and unobstructed airflow for the top
exhaust fan to exhaust heat out of the
top so there we go all it's left to do
now is put the panels back on fire it up
hope it turns on now all of the
techniques that I've shown you today are
just my techniques you're going to find
people are going to say I like to do
this differently or you should be doing
that by all means come up with your own
way that works for you this is how I
build computers a computer like this if
I wasn't building a video would take me
about an hour to build at from the time
I start by the time I'm done and you
know when you guys are first starting it
may take you five hours it may take you
seven hours but as you keep building and
you keep tinkering things will get more
streamlined and more efficient for you
and this is just a lot of fun I love
building computers I'm sure you will too
there you go guys the how to build a
computer for beginners video I tried to
cover as much as I could but yet keep it
as short as possible while not really
leaving out any information that was
really important to putting this
computer together now I didn't cut
anything out the computer is built
entirely running behind me as you can
see by doing the exact steps at which we
recorded there was nothing that I did in
between that was in fact I even left in
some of the problems that we encountered
because if all the builds went perfectly
then you guys would never know what to
do if you encountered some sort of a
hiccup along the way so I shared those
with you as well if you have any
questions about how to build a computer
definitely come and get
a message on Twitter or check out some
of the other awesome tech channels out
there like Austin Evans or Linus tech
tips text into kit I mean these guys do
great videos as well on how to build pcs
and how to do you know what it is that
we do here when it comes to being a PC
geek and if this is your first time
building a PC I want to firstly welcome
you to the master race and I hope that
you'll throw your consoles in the trash
and remember the Titan Z is nothing but
one big fat ass ripoff in the part of
Nvidia so this whole point of this video
was Titan Z sucks alright guys I'm gonna
get on out of here hopefully this video
has helped you share it with someone you
think it will help and as always I will
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
