if you've been following me for any
length of time more than just even a
couple of days you've probably learned
by now that I have just as much of a
love and passion for automotive racing
as I do for custom pcs and technology
yeah
Oh
so how do you put the two together well
you build yourself a kick-ass racing
cockpit like this to play on your
kick-ass gaming PC it's pretty obvious
now what I'm sitting in right here is
the Oh butter revolution offered by main
performance PC their base right here in
the u.s. they're made in the US so that
already is a plus as far as I'm
concerned but they're built by racing
enthusiasts themselves the guys who make
this literally breathe and live this
life so who else would you want a racing
cockpit from then one that's built by
racing enthusiasts themself that also
build crazy computers now if you want to
know more about the wheel pedal and
shifter setup and I have added the hydro
brake since the video about to reference
go and check out my video about the fana
tech stuff the focus of today's videos
can be more so about the frame that I'm
sitting in itself as already mentioned
this is the O but o revolution this is
not the first racing cockpit I've taken
a look at on this channel but I can tell
you this definitely steps it up a notch
over the GT Omega arc cockpit that I was
using a couple years ago now also want
to lead in with the fact that it does
come with an independent triple monitor
stand that I'm not using and not showing
in this video but you can see it on the
website because I actually do my racing
in virtual reality so I don't need the
screens in front of me I use the HTC
vive hmd so it allows me to have a
virtual reality experience with all of
this which makes it feel like I'm really
there especially when I'm sitting in a
racing seat like this so keep that in
mind
there is a monitor stand that I'm not
showing here but what you guys see right
here is all built and made in the US
that is a huge thing because most
manufacturing doesn't take place in the
US anymore they're using tubular steel
construction the welds on here are
gorgeous and it's got a massive weight
capacity no idea what the weight
capacity is guys I'm about 260 pounds
yeah I'm a fatty I know but this thing
holds me with no problem whatsoever and
that's obviously due to the tubular
steel construction the amazing welds and
it's all reinforced where it matters I
mean when I'm sitting here this thing is
not rocking and bending and creaking all
over the place it is solid it's not
going anywhere now starting with the
pedal base it's pretty cool because it's
got adjustable angle of attack so you
can change what angle the pedals are at
and it's a pre-drilled for all your
common types like the fan of tech
obviously the g27 225 the logitech stuff
the Thrustmaster 500 stuff
which is also very popular so it's
literally just a plug-and-play u-bolt
your your pedals onto there and you're
good to go you adjust the angle if your
pedals are not adjustable and I chose to
leave it on the flattest settings
because the fanta tech club sport pedals
are actually pretty upright already so I
don't want them feeling awkward what I
would have liked though which is to have
seen some way of hanging the pedals that
way they feel more like a street car but
then again a lot of race cars have
floor-mounted pedals anyway so this is
fine that was a pretty easy thing to get
over now moving up to the base for the
steering wheel it is height adjustable
it's got this giant knob underneath that
you can loosen and you can move the
steering wheel closer to you farther
away from you you can even adjust the
angle of the steering wheel and again
it's pre-drilled for your common
steering wheel servos and you have a
little bit of angle adjustment which is
kind of nice I would have liked to have
angled the wheel back just slightly it's
really up and down at the moment but if
I did that then it puts the wheel a
little bit higher because the angle is
more of a pivot rather than just a tilt
so we're not going to so I don't want to
raise it up any higher than it is I'm
six foot four this is a perfect height
for me some of my other friends who are
not quite as tall might find the wheel
to be more like right in their face and
look like Grandma driving to do to
church on Sunday and we don't want that
so it's perfect where it is for me now
something that's really cool that's
included with the cockpit is this
keyboard and mouse tray now it's on an
articulating arm you can push it away
and pull it near you you could use it
technically as a work platform you'll
put your mouse and keyboard on and use
it as kind of like a workstation if you
wanted to it's also got this really nice
neoprene cut-to-fit pad on top which
acts as a mousepad as well as a
protection you know for the surface and
things aren't going to be sliding all
over the place and scratching its even
height adjustable so you can move it up
and down in the mounting arm so you can
get it just right my only problem with
this is it's pretty heavy and because of
that and all the different joints that
are built into the arm it's got a bit of
play in there so it can kind of wiggle
up and down a little bit I've actually
taken this apart and tightened up the
joints as tight as I possibly can it
doesn't really seem to make any
improvement because there's just so much
torque on this arm when this thing is
extended out I feel like that bearing is
wearing a little bit so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend trying to use this
as a workstation in lieu of a desk
but the nice thing is it's included it
gives you a place to put your mouse and
keyboard especially when you're you know
change in between your games and stuff
you're not having to reach down the
floor and whatever else now let's go and
move on to the seat because that is in
my opinion the most important part of
any racing cockpit doesn't matter how
good the wheel mount is the shifter
mount the pedal mount if the seat sucks
it doesn't matter you're not going to
enjoy playing on this thing now the nice
thing about the butter revolution seat
is not only is it extremely robust and
durable it definitely has a racecar feel
it's certainly a bucket obviously it's
not a fixed seat it is an adjustable
back so you can change the how upright
you are in the seat if you want a
gangster lean you can do that but I
digress don't do that then I say it's
made out of fabric now it's got these
really nice kind of leatherette almost
carbon-fiber looking inserts in there
that give it a nice racing feel but the
problem with the other cockpit that I
had was it was a leather seat so sitting
in that for any length of time
whatsoever meant that I was sweating
through my clothes and leaving sweaty
butt prints on the seat which made the
next person that would get in after me
to want to play go in I'm sitting in
Jays butt sweat that's just gross yeah
NIC actually said that once that's okay
I sat in his butt - I - so fabric is
obviously breathable which means you can
play in this for a while and get up and
you're not going to leave sweaty prints
all over the seats the padding in here
is also firm but soft enough to where
you feel comfortable and not like you're
sitting on a rock but firm enough to
where you also feel like you're pretty
supported now something to keep in mind
if you've got broad shoulders like me of
course the shoulder supports on the seat
might start to feel a little bit
restrictive but when you got your hands
forward and you're on the wheel your
shoulders kind of roll forward a little
bit and you fit in there nicely but if
you're a broad-shouldered fella or
you're a bro at the gym and you're
constantly doing upper body and
shoulders then you're probably going to
feel like this is a little bit
restrictive unfortunately this is the
only seat offered so it's not something
you can really change out and of course
it is on a slider so you can't adjust it
forward and back now let's move on to
the shifter here this is also the club
sport shifter from fnatic I also have a
hydro brake mounted to it which means
I'm constantly yanking and pulling on
this thing you might have noticed though
that this is the one mount on this brand
that is not a tubular construction
that's because I'm not actually using
the mount that came with the Oh butter
revolution this is actually directly off
my art cockpit and the nice thing is the
holes actually mounted up perfectly they
lined it perfectly
so I just ran the same bolts through and
I'm using this to mount my shifter now
the reason for that is this is what
comes with the old butter revolution you
can see it's another one of these
tubular arms that are welded pieces
together and you got this platform here
that you can mount your shifter to the
problem is because it's round stock one
it can kind of twist a little bit in the
mount and as I'm pulling on the hydro
brake which is off to the side of where
this mounts it puts side leverage on it
which means it's constantly wanting to
turn same thing when I'm rowing through
the shifters what I have friends that
get on here I think they forget they're
in a racing simulator and they just
start to like cram the hell out of this
thing that's like help folder you guys
here actually has a couple are pretty
neat right they just start rowing the
hell through the shifter and start
slamming it like they're in a real
gearbox I don't understand that they
forget they can just it's just it's just
little switches guys you don't have to
throw it around but the hydro brake you
know that's spring loaded there's a lot
of tension on that the problem with
though like I said is this thing wants
to move around no matter how much I
crank it down which is really kind of
annoying
I could put a drill a hole through it
and do a nut and a bolt that would keep
it from moving but then I lose the quick
removability of it removability on it
that's a word the other reason why I'm
not using it is because I'm lazy and it
doesn't come with holes drilled for the
shifter which I thought was very odd now
this is going to be one of the things
that I give it a negative for its got
pre-drilled holes for the different
pedal manufacturers it's got pre-drilled
holes for the different steering wheel
base manufactures I don't understand why
they left out the shifter that's one of
the reasons why I'm using this one here
because the GT Omega has the universal
mounting holes on the bottom and my
fanta tech club sport shifter mounted
right up to it so when I saw that the
holes lined up we pretty much took the
easy way out and just did that but trust
me and I say I'd rather use this one
here so I'm probably going to find a way
to mount this and make it more rigid in
the future but this has been working for
me just fine so far the placement of it
is working really well and I'm happy
with that
one thing that's nice to see though is
it does have some cable management in
mind you can actually run the cables for
the steering wheel right down through
the neck on the frame and they come out
the back you could just hit tie it
neatly like I did and kind of put them
out of the way it would have been nice
though to have maybe another cleaner way
to bring the cables from the frame to
the shifter especially since the length
of the cables often are not
enough to run them a zip-tie them along
the whole frame like I kind of did with
the power cable but they're kind of off
to the side here it doesn't really
matter and I might explore a cleaner way
to do that in the future but it's really
hasn't bothered me I haven't kicked it
or bumped it on accident so it's not
really an issue now this is actually a
newer revision than barnacles barclays
has one of these as well that's why I
wanted it because I saw his in person
and I thought this was such a nice and
well built frame I wanted it but it
turns out his doesn't actually have the
pre-drilled holes for the servo base for
the fan of tech and whatnot
now the club sport pedals I believe
mounted with the bass in it so they've
made some changes to drilling holes to
the bass I just still wish they had done
that for the shifter anyway I think
you're going to be hard-pressed to find
a better racing cockpit especially for
this price it comes at about $700 and I
know that sounds like a lot of money but
trust me
these things get up into the thousands
so the build quality that you get for
this price point I think it's pretty
much unmatched and I'm going to go guys
thanks for watching today's video and if
you're a car enthusiast and a PC
enthusiast you should definitely do
yourself a favor and consider building
something like this this whole setup the
whole thing with the steering wheel and
everything can be had for about 2500
again I know it's a lot of money that's
still so cheap compared to how expensive
they can get thanks for watching guys as
always I will see you in</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
