the race breaks on the Z and I made a
comment in there about like you know
liking my wheels and stuff but this one
wheel in particular I always said I
would replace them for what wheel what
wheel was that Nick an official true
raised Volk te 37 what does that look
like are there and what that one was
like right there but there's a problem
with these t37 they're not the color I
like you know it's sad though these are
actually the Tokyo Time Attack special
or limited edition black with polished
lips and I'm changing the color which is
almost blasphemous in a way one of the
one of the wheels has a little damage to
the lip that was started to be repaired
it hasn't been fixed yet you can see all
these machine marks in the lip right
here because this lip was had some work
done to it and they didn't finish the
work so it's about all this machine
lines in it and we're gonna be getting
this all fixed obviously and we'll be
changing the color to the new toque it's
the new te 37 SL color and it's a
gunmetal like a almost like an
anthracite but it's a little darker
actually but it has a lot of shine to it
so these are going to be taken down to
Orange County right now and we're gonna
be getting these things resurfaced I
also got new tires coming for those and
something else because now I don't want
to track on these wheels because if I
have to replace them they're like a
thousand dollars apiece and like a six
month waiting period
so I'm actually ordering Ray's gram
lights for the track so here in the last
video I'm like screw wheels I want and
I'm getting two different sets of well
and I also sold the Nismo wheels which I
would have been happy tracking on but I
sold those cuz the guy who bought these
wheels for me later was like okay it's a
funny story
some of you guys may not know this if
you watched Jerry's morning coffee rows
on the show with him this guy I got
these for 800 dollars less than his like
off price so he was already like I won't
take a penny less than this well I got
for $800 less with tires that I didn't
want because he mounted the tires and
one of them without tires and they
weren't mounted so he mounted the tires
cuz no one was buying the wheels and
then finally like agreed to my price and
then the same day he was like hey are
you interested in selling your Nismo
wheels and those tires that I and maybe
throw in those tires that I I gave you
and I was like well I'll show you the
wheels with the tires mounted but I'm
charging you for the tires and so he was
like okay so so I sold him back
mine is mow wheels and I sold him his
tires that he gave me for free I used to
work in sales so I mean I was pretty
good at that but anyway wait enough
talking we got to take these off and
take them to Orange County but first we
got put on gloves so that we don't get
our dirty little or our-our-our girly
little hands all dirty if you can't tell
though we've got two different sizes
obviously the rear has a ton of dish
like look at that look at the amount of
dish there is on the rear wheel because
we have a fairly aggressive offset in
the back in the front there's not nearly
as much dish because I am running a
staggered setup but I'm actually gonna
be going with a either too sick I'm
going with a 265 on these in the front
but my actual race wheels I'm putting on
here the ones but I call race wheels
because they're gonna be from the track
are gonna be 275 square wheels load it
up we're heading out it feels a little
blasphemous to be painting over these
wheels but I mean I tried it okay I uh I
ordered him I went picked him up I got
him
used obviously and had my tires mounted
on them but it's like I just you know
how I feel about black wheels to begin
with yeah
and then the black with the polished lip
lip looks really good in pictures and
some cars it looks really good on but I
don't think it looks good on my car you
and Jerry both because Jerry was here
when I picked him up both of you guys I
think we're like it looks good with the
with the carbon fiber hood yeah but I
just I did I don't like it enough to
where I cannot live with it but I mean
they are an alternate rare wheel they
were only available for a short period
of time you cannot buy them they're used
only the only thing they're missing is
the actual tire sticker on them that say
Tokyo Time Attack so there they were TE
37 TTS is what they were to her Tokyo
Time Attack and yeah it's like
and I can't even get those stickers you
can't even buy those stickers because
you know Rays will sell you the spoke
sticker for the SLS and they'll sell you
the the other stickers for the or it
says work or Volk and phrase yeah but
yeah because I can't replace the sticker
and like refurbish them and make them
appropriate anyway I might as well at
least change the color you know because
I don't think they're gonna hold that
much value in terms of being true Tokyo
time attacks because they're not perfect
and I'm they're missing the sticker and
stuff so I think if they had everything
they needed and we're like pristine like
preserved condition then they might have
had value we're petting the truck brakes
now never traffic ever you guys see that
oh yeah it fixed it very traffic we're
in Southern California where else would
we be I don't know where else would they
have bad traffic food coma
so we dropped off the wheels and getting
those back like next week sometime but
we we stopped at Roscoe's chicken and
waffles in Anaheim sure a lot of you
know where that tower is now we're
pretty sure we're walking diabetes I'm
gonna die I'm gonna die happy it's going
his seat belt won't fit that's why it's
Deena but you're like the waffle mix I
was just saying I really like the Walt
Cummings okay let me give you free candy
that's nice but I passed on the candy
he's a hell out of this here up to Idol
8 butter right no regrets no regrets no
regrets for reals so week has gone by
actually no it's been a little under
week lame day right yeah there's no it's
been a week so let me we're gonna go
pick up the wheels the wheels are ready
but first we have your dirty trevin's
sorry first we have to get some food in
our bellies because I'm starting to feel
a little famished
I mean look at me I'm wasting away to
nothing he's just kidding bones I have
to make sure he is on full of bones
we picked up the wheels having probably
more excited than he is because they
look gorgeous they're pretty yes I mean
I don't know you're like me and video
games Tuesday it's like I'm not excited
when they come out like I don't I'm not
hype about anything anymore it's just
like smooth bass level I'm surprised
that how well these tires have held up
though being tracked on be honest
proof that you can run aggressive
cameras okay even where it's all about
toe toe chews up tires not camber it's a
sick wait but no don't say that like
because you're gonna get like people
running all the stretch tires and stuff
now it's okay
it's okay because people wearing stretch
tires inevitably end up dealing with
their own problem and yeah usually they
end up crashing and burning these tires
are still good so have a lot of tread
left on there look at that yeah did you
show them no no I tried to avoid it okay
I want you going okay oh my gosh they're
pretty that's what there are something
like a tire shop around here
so take a moment to invite admire the
full amount of tread you have on these
babies well so that's cool about these
tires is it's got this D in this W in
the tread right here and these are wear
indicators so when the W is gone and
they're no longer safe for a wet
traction tire like on track and when the
D is gone then it's time to replace the
tire unity is gone when the D is gone so
I got this I got the raised lugs to go
with it too because I can't use the
factory flat lugs on these wheels so
we've got a super-duper lightweight
raise these things are freakishly light
man but they're also locking although I
mean what's the point of a locking lug
when you can just buy a set of lugs and
have a lock for if you're a wheel thief
it really doesn't offer any protection
this is really why I do all my lifting
just back up my wheel on the back oh my
god okay seriously locking nut I went
with the slightly longer lugs as well
but they're easier to tighten down you
could say you car almost had 50 shades
of gray doesn't mean he does he here
though hey no because at that moment he
knew he had too much sass today this is
like the most boring part of the video
but it's build-up for the record I'm not
putting on tire dressing for like shine
there's no shine to this guessing it's a
tire cleaner just getting off all a jump
that they put on these tires to keep
them from sticking when they're in
storage can you like speed it up can you
like speed up drop it such a perfect
scene
what you think their backs freaking me
out only because it's tucked more
I feel like this is a very milestone
moment for any car runner or enthusiast
when they put their new wheels on and
they just get to look at it for a good
well yeah see that piece he's so happy
they look black like and you know I you
know how I feel with black wheels but no
they're not black yeah but you know I
feel about black wheels so I think it
looks really good though but it had to
be darker than the body color you know I
mean yeah lighter than the Bartek I look
weird this just looks like I'm rolling
on shade now I'm always throwing shade
so anyway that's it
t37 s they I swear to God in this dark
light they almost like black I can't
wait to see what they look like in the
daylight tomorrow with because the Sun
is going down it's overcast so that's
that tell what you guys think and as
always we'll see in the next one we'll
do more car videos you guys really seem
to be liking these</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
