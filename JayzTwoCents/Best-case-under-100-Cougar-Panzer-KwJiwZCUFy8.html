you've ever shopped for a case then you
know that they could range from
inexpensive and crappy build quality
that wants to cut your fingers off to
massively expensive where one chance you
can cost more than people's entire
systems well today we're going to take a
look at a chest that gives you kind of
everything you really need but it
doesn't even cost a hundred bucks US
comes in at $89.99 and it includes
tempered glass side panels Wow
cooler masters master key pro series of
keyboards offer sixteen point seven
million color RGB genuine carry switches
a variety of sizes as well as surface
mounted controls allowing full
customization without the need for
stand-alone software learn more by
following the link down below ok so this
has actually been my editing rig for the
chat we got a new sketch on the desk
that face you just gave me I'm sorry
let's gonna start with the tempered
glass panel you can see right here it is
tinted which is nice you got tempered
glass on both the front and the back of
the case but because it's tinted does a
good job of hiding wiring in the back it
even does a really good job of hiding
the logo which is I think the very first
thing people see in this case is like oh
my god I don't want to see that big
giant orange cougar logo the nice thing
is though I mean as you guys saw it
definitely covers it up quite a bit but
you know you can also cover that up with
paint if you want you to paint it you
could put like 3m carbon fiber wrap
material on it that's what we were going
to do until we put the side panel on and
what you don't really not that bad
problem this is not a decal so you can't
like can't peel it off it's actually
painted on there so that's unfortunate
but anyway this case right here it's
hard to find a case that really meets
the needs of both water coolers and air
coolers because water cooling has a
whole different set of requirements in
terms of what you'd look for in a case
then something like air cooling now
let's go and start with some of the
water cooling trending features here
because you guys know that's kind of my
thing
we've got 360 worth of fans on the front
of this we've got three 120 millimeter
Corsair Maglev fans so they're mounted
on the inside of the case right now but
you can actually mount those on the
outside of the case
underneath the grill if you want which
leaves plenty
have room for push-pull 360 rad config
on the front you can actually go all the
way up to like a 60 mil rad and still
not interfere with your graphics cards
it just makes it hard to find a place to
put your reservoir in your pump but
could technically fit it now on the top
I'm running to 140 millimeter maglev
fans on my Kraken X 62 and I have the
radiator mounted on top of the chassis
underneath the grille but unfortunately
you can't do push-pull on the top
because there's simply not enough room
as you can see between the fans and the
motherboard and there's not enough room
on top of the radiator before you hit
the grill and this is only a 30 mil rad
now in terms of length of graphics card
support if you have the fans mounted on
inside like with you here you could fit
a four hundred and twenty five
millimeter graphics card I don't know of
any doubt of that long I mean that's a
massively long card that be filling out
the length of this entire case
practically but once you put the fans on
the inside it drops down to 400 mil but
you can see we are nowhere near those
fans now there's still plenty of room
for a radiator and a reservoir and still
have full-length long graphics cards
like these without any issue now in the
front of the case for connectivity we
have two USB 3.0 two USB 2.0 a mic and a
headphone jack as well the power button
that's pretty standard these days none
terms a motherboard support it fits up
to ATX it doesn't really fit dat X like
a true EA TX the one we have in here
right now this is a gigabyte X 99 SOC
champion it's a little bit wider than an
ATX but it's still considered an ATX but
the reason why it can't fit larger
motherboards is because there's an
offset on the motherboard panel so the
motherboard is actually reset slightly
from the rest of the chassis which gives
you on the backside a little bit better
room for when it comes to cable
management so that means you can't have
a motherboard that is wider than where
that gap is and as you can see the SSE
champion barely fits in there but most
motherboards these days are ATX or that
80 X plus e ATX is somebody not really
run into an issue with and to start
going into the extreme platform and the
enthusiast platform X 99 X 299 and
whatever possible X 399 stuff comes from
AMD it's probably going to be ATX as
well something else it's nice to see
though is this case is friendly for both
tabletop placement as well as placing it
on carpet and still having your PSU fan
facing down so that doesn't draw in dust
or whatever from the rest of the case
because it's facing down and this
chassis is raised up as much as it is it
pulls an air from right
on the sides and it's not going to
actually be choked off because there's
more than enough height to put this on
carpet not have it choke off your system
so that's nice now in terms of storage
support that's probably where this
chassis is lacking just a little bit
because it's a four plus two config so
that means you can fit four SSDs into
three and a half inch drives but you can
also mount two two and a half inch
drives or SSDs where the three hats go
for a total of six two and a half inch
drives for support so you put a lot of
SSDs in the same plus whatever m2 is on
your motherboard but unfortunately it's
not very friendly with three and a half
inch drives so this is not a very ideal
chassis for like an AZ or something like
that now unfortunately there is no
five-and-a-quarter
bays expansion based support for this so
if you've got five and a quarter maybe a
reservoir like bay reservoir or card
reader fan control or whatever
unfortunately this case does not offer
any support for that loved chassis
seemed to kind of be going the way of
getting rid of those and lieu a better
airflow because a lot of people are
going to digital downloads and stuff so
need optical drives which is what those
are always intended for unfortunately
accessory support goes out the window as
well when they lose all optical drive
support so that's something worth
keeping in mind for sure
now this chassis is also perfect for
those that are interested in air flow
because both the top and the front is
nothing but big open wide ventilation so
right now with these fans on the front
only running at 50 percent there's a
massive amount of airflow coming in same
thing on the top right here even with
140 millimeter fans which have a little
bit less static pressure than one 20s
and a radiator in between the fans and
the vent right here there's a lot of
airflow actually coming out of the top
so that's something worth keeping in
mind
now unfortunately when it comes to air
cooling support though it only has a max
supported cooler height of 160
millimeters and I know a lot of air
coolers like naktu a lot of cooler
master coolers are taller than that
start like 160 to go to like 170 180 but
hopefully with the improved airflow of
the chassis as a whole so the smaller
coolers will be more efficient now
something else that was a problem with
this case when I was building in it is
unfortunately the feet where it touches
the table it narrows in and it tapers in
which means your motherboard and stuff
is off to the side a little bit outset
from where the feet actually touched the
table and when I was building this I
almost knocked
several times because unfortunately
until you get the graphics cards in the
power supply in which kind of weights it
down a little bit it really wants to
fall backwards very easily I mean you
can kind of see right here just how
narrow the feet are on this so I turn
this like this with it it definitely I
get certainly tippy
I'm not putting much pressure on that
whatsoever anyway this was actually just
a temporary build it wasn't even meant
to stay together I was just using this
to do video editing here at the office
it was meant to just kind of be
literally let me get up and running and
I liked it so much I kept it together
and I kind of want to do a full custom
water-cooled build in this but I don't
know we might see also what their pans
are Max has to hold or has to offer
because it's the full tower version of
this chassis unfortunately no tempered
glass side panels but it's bigger
overall which might also give us even
more radiator support I believe that I
can fit a 360 on the front and on the
top on that chassis as well but this one
right here the price of performance and
the value you get for 89 bucks it's
absolutely amazing tempered glass size
now two of them for 89 bucks with a
chassis like this that fits water
cooling most air coolers and actually
has plenty of air flow where I can have
my two air-cooled for the win three
graphics cards in here not starving for
air I definitely couldn't have asked for
more value for 90 bucks that's for sure
anyway that's time to go guys thanks for
watching today's video let me know what
you guys think of this chassis what
mid-tower chances are you using if you
think there's one better or one that you
want us to take a look at make sure you
comment down below or better yet head on
over to social media Twitter Instagram
whatever pictures of this build happened
on Instagram as I was building it so
it's definitely some value to following
there and if you're new around here once
you hit that subscribe button it's
absolutely free and we'd love to have
you stick around because we we have an
amazing community here a PC enthusiast
and we'd love to have you so with that
said I'm gonna go thanks for watching
guys and as always I'll see you in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
