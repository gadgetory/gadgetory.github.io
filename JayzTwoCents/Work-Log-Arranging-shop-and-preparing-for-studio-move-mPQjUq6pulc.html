no yeah we're going to move some stuff
out of here we have Bank we need power
steering fluid in this part these are
the tears of haters on the side of this
thing we got to put like a violent star
on the side do it I'm like he just made
me feel bad about it he didn't yell at
me about it he just made me feel bad
anyway well this stuff should probably
stay here
yeah because that's just something used
to build well I also would like to keep
it near and close what's cool though is
the storage unit we I got has an alarm
on it
and it's in a climate-controlled room I
was worried that was gonna follow me the
other day because it was out of sight
and out of a camera range well it's in
sight now thank you range look no we
should have done is set up a big Oprah
time-lapse camera in here but now if
something tells me we just take too long
to get it going
although maybe not because I have the
battery pack and you have those memory
cards too
we'll be back okay that's gonna do a
time-lapse now of us trying to get a lot
of the stuff in here in storage and then
make this a much more usable build space
because let me tell you right now when
I'm recording in here I've got this boom
mic all like this extended right point
at me I've got the camera here and I've
got this light over here it's not easy
to get around and there's still gonna be
some videos recorded in here even though
we're moving into the studio in a couple
weeks because this is still gonna be my
build space like for the custom stuff
like regular old PC builds that are
fairly basic will happen in the studio
the custom things like the Terry Crews
is gonna happen here so anyway we'll
gonna put that down we'll blog some
stuff throughout the day yeah let's do
this all out paul's hardware well okay i
know how he does it just time-lapse
everything it looks cool though i have
to get this going just in case you paul
i i've done it this before and fallen
the shoes aren't helping here there we
go these are my old fat pants
yeah remember i'ma say used to be 500
pounds I wasn't kidding these are these
are my biggest pants I ever owned I'm
now in one leg I thought you get into
girls nice pants before
whoo egos at the gym my trainer you got
two of the female trainers to get in
these pants with me
dang why I was able to say I've had two
girls in my pants at the same time all
that just for bragging rights
now you're just ready to go to raves
yeah like the fattest pants fair like MC
Hammer did a bit parachute pants
birthing in the 90s Oh see I don't spell
in the box it looks like you're twerking
but surely not
it's almost like we're on the show
storage wars look what I found in this
unit a lot of money I can tell you
exactly what you're worth the taste of
revisit you got it right I emailed to
you yeah I guess it just means you have
it the kiss compliance so here's our
storage unit it's got a high ceiling up
there but yeah this is where stuff is
gonna go in him that's why I'm gonna
keep him when I'm not actually making
him work yeah yeah no there's no living
in the storage units I signed a contract
that says I can't so I can't fit no and
we can't store drugs and stuff in here
either that means I'm back under your
stairs no vaping in here either
ah shit so anyway yeah we're gonna make
some more runs you know like these
conditions already man you will get to
Ikea wait I got this woman hey my cart
is 1gz powered never heard that before
oh my gosh but halfway there it is it's
already almost 2 o'clock
it's 142 we got through ten minutes for
two anyways
all right
better so we got the storage stuff done
which he's really excited about because
now he has most eco space well built
shop space I still have to move all the
recording equipment back in there though
we'll kind of do at the end of this
video like a little run-through of the
equipment I'm using now
not like us I don't know if it deserves
some dedicated video you guys can tell
me if you think it does we'll talk about
what camera is I'm using the sliders and
lights and all that stuff the things it
takes to bring the magic that is Jay is
two cents to your screens the behind the
scenes I told him a while back to get
why and see take his deals he's done to
his Nikon or Nichkhun and they be done
whatever you want to call it because
everyone calls us I'm a little different
to take his camera and just film shit
just practice film shit and show me what
he can come up with as he showed me
anything I had
we've done anything that storyboarded I
have this vision but I want to like nail
it to show you because if I felt like I
want to be able to do it so I could be
proud of it instead of like hey look
this is what I did and destroy anything
you do is gonna meet my standard that
you set for yourself you're wrong you're
never gonna meet your standards but a
video it's going to be perfect but like
a baseline and then build off of that
dude trust me you're gonna have a lot to
build on okay if you're not gonna nail
this your first time nobody does I
didn't I'm still not nailing it almost
five years into this and I'm still
evolving and growing I just wanted to
see where you are now so I knew what I
need to do to train you to get you more
hands off
for me being hands off behind the scenes
but you're not as showing me anything
less micromanaging geez you need to show
me what you can do that's the point of
yeah movements maybe maybe the exercise
had nothing to do with the video at all
holy shit
mind blown I care about your creativity
got it
last we break this week okay yeah I'm
gonna do something I'm not even gonna be
in town so I can't even help you I know
that's the best part
when I did the whole like how to build
your own workbenches I used the light
density wood which didn't take much for
it to start warping and bowing because
of the weight and I don't want to put a
leg in the middle of it because I just
keep kicking that leg so we're just like
to find another solution maybe a heavier
heavier duty okay well he's never got
the whole idea from Paul's hardware yeah
but he didn't chip out like I did he got
the good wood Paul's got good wood it's
got that good wood no it's called part
of Paul's hardware for everything to
keep it hard
we got stuff at IKEA new tabletops and
these are the exact same ones Paul has
now these are very dense a lot less
likely to bow because I don't have you
can actually tell what those right there
those make it down lower they're bowed
because they're like a particle board
not actually a dense wood the weight of
just building computers and stuff on
this has caused us to bow so we got the
heavy duty ones and then this one iego
island countertop that we're putting
heavy-duty legs on there so that I can
actually have bigger workspace out here
it's kind of a whole point of this
anyway the time-lapse is still going
we'll just you guys can watch the
time-lapse of this all going together
been a long day like 13 hours or so
cuz it's 9:30 we started at 8:30 this
morning yeah we got a lot done in here
so much more room for activities this is
what we do when we do a room
uh yeah so look at the size of this
thing Wow
that's what she said uh yeah so that's
new that's new this is real wood not
like particle board it's not gonna bow
on us hopefully nice heavy-duty oh you
can get a good idea of the size of it
that's the tattoo point oh right there
so this is a pretty big countertop sorry
about some of the equipment we use on
the channel here real quick this is my
main camera right here this is the sony
FS 5 with the metabones adapter and a
sigma 18 to 35 millimeter lens this is
very overkill for a youtube channel
trust me this is a Manfrotto 502 head on
a e image tripod video tripod this is
the newest addition this is Steve what
are you doing Eve anna whiting yeah this
is the sony a7s 2 again with another of
sigma 18 to 35 I love this lens this
lens is so sharp I mean it's not even
funny how sharp this lens is for the
price it's fresh the body is super small
again it's on another 502 head which is
on my Rhino evolution or Evo slider and
it's got the ebo motion on there as well
as the Rhino Ark head which is a panhead
think I've said this before maybe I
haven't but I can actually control this
thing via this little guys and we're
going to turn on turn on the arc so this
guy is on right here we to tell with a
24-inch slider I also have the 4-foot
steel rails which we'll be using in the
studio this is obviously not the studio
so if I tell it we also have the arc
head and there's that let's good so we
can set up a move here it's gonna
calibrate itself and now I can tell it
where I want it to point the camera on
that position you
this little wheel here so let's say I
want to point at the chair it's gonna go
to the other end of the slider now all
by itself
I tell it once again where to point out
let's say I want to point that way it's
made a big move it's go like that way
now I can control the speed at which it
does AK and I could go fast make it go
even faster if I want but I can also
make it go really slow see that so yeah
that's that's how I've been getting some
that really sexy b-roll - you guys have
been seeing lately
then the tripods for those those are
tube in row adventurer carbon fiber
tripods on there so and then that's Nick
of course this is just one of my soft
boxes here I've got a bunch of cheap
soft boxes one there - nothing special
with the lighting I've got more lighting
in the upstairs office this is my boom
arm that I will extend and then that's
my audio technica 40 53 B type record a
cardioid microphone I love this
microphone it's the best microphone I've
ever used for vocals and then I've got
more stuff obviously in the studio so
all that stuff can be moving to the new
studio but anyway
it's time to go this video was kind of
pointless but to UM browsing any content
out while we were doing all this work
cuz it's I'm just going to tell them
that before they tell me that yeah I
gotta try and at least say some of the
hate myself before they do because then
I take it I take the power away take the
power when you make fun of yourself you
take away the power remember that folks
alright we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
