I'm wearing a brightly colored shirt
which means we're gonna do a affordable
review of a something or another I've
told you guys on Twitter now for a while
that I'm excited because I get to
finally build a desktop computer for my
wife and I decided you know why not take
this as the perfect opportunity to bring
you guys kind of a build log and show
you how much power you can really get
for under $1000 including the operating
system I swear to god everyone out there
who does these reviews never put the
operating system into the cost but let's
face it if you're going to do a Windows
build there's going to be the cost of
Windows and I don't condone piracy
whatsoever unless it's Pirates of the
Caribbean at Disneyland or it's jake and
the neverland pirates on Disney but then
I'm gonna have a five-year-old so you
know whatever don't judge me don't judge
me but there are some things in this
build that I think I would change if I
were you and I'll kind of explain them
as we go over the parts now first things
first the price I'm putting down in the
PC part picker link PC part picker
picked a peck of pickled peppers that's
actually an hour to say down in the
description there you're going to notice
that the case that we're using here the
ROS will mx2 is $199 I don't recommend a
$200 case and a hundred and $79 graphics
card because that doesn't really make a
whole lot of sense I would prefer you
guys buy a hundred dollar case and buy a
$279 graphics card that would make more
sense but of course because these parts
were supplied by our sponsors we'll go
ahead and list those sponsors now that's
why we are using that case now this
build is sponsored specifically by
Roseville ADATA Coolermaster EVGA and
gigabyte now let's go ahead and talk
about the parts and why I chose them and
I'll tell you where I would kind of move
around the money just a little bit if
this were your build to get the most out
of your money graphics cards I have two
of them sitting up here obviously 750ti
is do not go in SLI I honestly don't
know which one I want to use and you can
watch both of those reviews to find out
the positives and the negatives to both
and you can see why I'm a little bit
horn the end of the day we'll see which
one to end up putting in there and you
can make your own decision for the
motherboard I am using the gigabyte 990
FX au d3 motherboard best mother part on
the market for a 990 FX chip set and a 8
core processor from AMD if you use an 80
320 or 80 350 I don't think you could
find a better budget motherboard period
I've seen them go for as low as a
hundred and twenty-nine dollars and that
is amazing it says the revision 4 has
the better heat pipe in there so you're
not going to have any of the vrm or
Northbridge cooling issues that some of
the revision 3s had so for the CPU we
are using AMD FX 8350 M
now for power we are going with the
Rosewill high 550 watt modular power
supply 80 plus bronze nothing too
spectacular about it it is semi modular
and didn't need to go overkill on the
power supply because this is already a
very efficient bill that's going to be
using a couple hundred watts total we do
have an a data SP 900 128 gigabyte SSD
for our operating system as well as a
couple of favorite games and programs
and then we do have for mass storage a
500 gigabyte Barracuda 7200 rpm Mass
Storage driver hard drive and then for
ram we do have the a data X PG 8
gigabyte kit 1600 megahertz ram now this
build is going to be for my wife and
I've already said that a few times on
Twitter
chances are she probably won't play any
games on this and that's going to be
entirely depressing to me but I hope
that maybe now that she'll have her own
computer this might be what it takes to
get her playing a couple of games and
I'll go ahead and put it out there she
didn't enjoy playing World of Warcraft
but one day I got her to play it a long
long time ago but I know maybe we'll get
her playing something I could see you're
playing some titanfall ok I can't really
say that with a straight face and you
laughed over there I hear you laugh yeah
that guy's laughing right
so it was kind of funny all right guys
enough talk let's go ahead and put these
parts together we'll do a performance
review at the end and then we'll see
exactly what less than a thousand
dollars with an operating system can get
you here with with J's two cents this is
this guy that's good and we're the
bright shirt so you know you can trust
me
you
okay guys it's been about a week now
that the system's been together and I
just have to give a huge shout out to
the sponsors for this build coolermaster
a data EVGA gigabyte rose will you guys
are awesome thank you for hooking us up
with this machine so that we could do
this video for you guys showing what you
could get for about a thousand dollars
now I did run into a couple of snags
with the Rosewill case and I'm going to
go ahead and talk about in just a second
but first I want to explain why I'm
sitting now in a room that looks like it
was created in 1963 that's because it
was this house was actually built in
1963 I don't own the house therefore I'm
not going to remodel it so we're stuck
with this really ugly wood paneling but
I have to admit it does really good when
it comes to the echo in the room of
killing the echo so don't judge me when
it comes to the walls in this place well
they're so ugly okay now that I got that
out of my system let's just go ahead and
show you the little setup I set up for
the setup the setup I set up for the
wife she kicked me out of the warehouse
this was basically my warehouse where I
stored all of my extra parts and things
that were too big to go into man cave
and set her up with that nice IKEA set
up back there with her drawers and
whatnot got her her shelf over there to
display her knickknacks and you can see
the evil MacBook Pro sitting right over
there evil temperature-wise it is
absolutely amazing now when it comes to
the cooler I wasn't able to use the
cooler that I showed you guys in the
beginning of the video that tpc 6:12
because it's too tall and that was the
problem I encountered was the side panel
wouldn't snap back on because the tool
the cooler was about 15 millimeters too
tall so we went ahead and exchanged that
for the hyper t4 which is one step down
from the 212 and I'm going to go ahead
and tell you right now it is an amazing
cooler a lot better than I thought it
was going to be it has four copper heat
pipes that make direct contact with the
CPU and right now while overclocked to
4.4 gigahertz on the gigabyte ud3
motherboard here the 990 fxa ud3 i am
running a core package temp package core
temp whatever they call it of 48 degrees
celsius giving me 29 degrees celsius of
headroom what does that mean I could
overclock farther if the chip is stable
enough to handle it but knowing that the
wife is not going to be doing a lot of
power tasks I decided not to go ahead
and do that route and just put it at a
mild 4.4 gigahertz overclock at one
point four volts on the vcore so good
chip regular voltage overclocking got me
to four point four with amazing
temperatures due to that hyper t4 so if
you guys are looking for a cooler that
is very inexpensive but allows very
decent cooling you have to check out
that t4 it truly did surprise the ever
living crap out of me now overclocking
on here was extremely easy using
gigabytes built in UEFI BIOS just went
in and put in a couple of values turned
off a couple of settings and it was very
very simple if you guys want to know how
to overclock on this board I might do
review later but not in the near future
simply because I have too many other
things in the pipeline but maybe we'll
get around to it but the overclocking
was extremely easy it's extremely stable
that a data Ram I overclocked from 1600
to 1866 megahertz and it looks like the
computer monitor just shut off on me
because it's been a long time since it's
been touched I promise it's stable guys
watch
see okay so anyway I was able to
overclock the a data Ram
very solid Ram that xpg Ram and then the
SP 928 gigabyte SSD super solid SSD near
performance of the SX 900 it just is
slower on the right speed which is
perfectly fine because she's not going
to be using that right speed really for
anything so overall everything was great
but if you're looking at doing $1,000
build I still recommend that you take
the $200 at send in this case and buy
yourself a cheaper case maybe something
like 50 bucks or a little bit more
expensive a little bit between fifty and
a hundred bucks it has the features you
need but no extra bells and whistles and
take that extra money and put that into
your graphics card so that you can have
greater graphics performance now if you
want to know how the benchmarking of
this system did you can pretty much just
go and check out the other standalone
videos I've done with the graphics card
showing you how the gtx 750ti from EVGA
performed and you'll see just how well
that did but I was more interested in
overclocking and cooling in this case
with that gigabyte ud3 the revision for
everything is super cool Northbridge
temperatures are sitting down in the 30s
couldn't ask for anything better and
that's with a closed up case with no
side ventilation that top to bottom
airflow with the bottom intake and the
roof exhaust is absolutely perfect it's
just natural convection in the case does
a perfect job at keeping keeping
everything nice and cool and with that
guys I hope you've enjoyed this video
make sure you follow on Twitter if you
have any questions about this it's
easier to get a hold of me there than
dealing with a shitty comment system
down here I do have a major project
coming up called project red dawn that
really should be called project overkill
where it's going to have just a beast of
a system I mean the cooling loop on this
system alone was $1,500 $1,500 worth of
water cooling going into this machine so
you can just imagine what it's going to
be like so with all that said I hope you
guys enjoyed the video and as always I
will see you in my next video because
that's how this works I make a video you
watch it and I theoretically see you
don't physically see you that'd be kind
of creepy
maybe I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
