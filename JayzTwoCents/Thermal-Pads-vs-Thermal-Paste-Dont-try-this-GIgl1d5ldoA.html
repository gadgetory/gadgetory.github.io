gonna do a video today I've kind of Li
wanted to do for a little while I don't
know how well it's gonna go but if you
guys have been paying attention to new
thermal technologies you guys might have
noticed that there is a new thermal pad
that has come out designed for CPUs to
replace the messy thermal paste that we
are all accustomed to now as you guys
know there are all kinds of different
thermal paste on the market including
liquid metal which is technically not a
paste at all but there is different like
Arctic Silver's there's thermal Grizzly
all kinds of stuff and the debate
continues forever and endlessly about
which one is best
well today I'm not going to use the
actual thermal pad that people are using
I came in with the name of it to be
honest but it got me thinking why can't
I use a thermal pad that I get with the
GPU blocks I mean we use it on RAM and
stuff like that but is this actually
gonna conduct enough thermal transfer to
keep us from overheating our stuff or
will it actually insulate in some way
and not transfer heat well enough and
it's gonna overheat our CPUs which will
make me wonder whether or not this is
actually working at all
so that's we're gonna do today we're
gonna check it out with our test bench
and see whether or not this whole groom
method actually works today's video is
sponsored by Nordby pn and it is more
important than ever to start protecting
your online experience with constant
database breaches and the ongoing
constant discussion regarding net
neutrality protecting yourself is more
important than ever an or VPN has over
4300 servers available in 62 countries
and pretty much every region around the
world including Africa the Middle East
Asia the United States I mean you get it
but the best part about Nord VPN is they
don't keep logs which means you are
experiencing a truly 100% anonymous
online experience so start taking your
online security serious by heading to
north VPN comm /jc two cents and save
seventy seven percent on a three-year
membership by using offer code Jase two
cents at checkout so now we can sort of
be doing a couple of different methods
today of course we need our control this
is my test bench 8,700 case sitting on a
Z 370 now we are actually running the ek
echo therm that comes with the GPU
blocks I've been using it on CPUs for a
while and we actually had our test
running here media datasets inside of OC
CT now for 17 minutes to make sure our
loop connection
equalised now in terms of the cooling
capacity of the loop itself that's not
going to be as important as a whole to
this particular experiment we want to
see how it compares to our control which
is a 360 read with at 8700 K that has
got an all core overclock of 4.7 yeah I
know it's a turbo clock but memory
usually a one or two cores will ramp to
4.7 we've got all six cores ramping to
4.7 and we are pumping 1.4 2 volts to it
that's a lot of volt for this CPU so
this test has been running now for 18
minutes it looks like our averages are
sitting in the mid to upper 60s going
into the 70s momentarily with our Peaks
actually reaching 90s and low 90s high
80s remember these are outliers these
are these big Peaks that you see like
this one right here this is not
indicative of your everyday use the
standard the regular temperature you're
seeing here as it fluctuates this is our
temperature that matters this is
stressing our system as it's designed to
to just punch the CPU hard you're never
gonna see these types of temperatures
under regular day-to-day use even
rendering videos especially playing
games and stuff like that we are going
to cut a piece of this this is a point
five millimeter this is a half
millimeter thermal pad that comes with
the EK water blocks for GPUs and this is
what we're gonna actually use and we're
gonna we're gonna cut a piece that
covers the bulk of the IHS or the an
internal heat spreader and then we are
going to test it after all is said and
done with no thermal pad and no thermal
paste just so you guys can kind of see
what happens when there's no transfer
material whatsoever so I'm using paper
towels normally like coffee filters work
pretty good but these paper towels I'm
using actually pretty good about not
leaving a lot of lint behind as you can
see I have not deleted my 8700 K I
probably will do that at some point just
to fix terrible Intel shortcomings with
thermal paste so as you can see it's a
pretty good cover it doesn't cover the
very very edges but remember the die on
this chip is right in the middle right
here this is a spreader so you have to
actually cover every square millimeter
of this but you do want to get obviously
the bulk of it so I'm just gonna sort of
mark where the edge of it is you can see
it made a little indentation I'm going
to
and then we were going to apply now you
want to make sure you clean it with
alcohol and stuff the cpu that way this
actually sticks to it otherwise it won't
stick very well but because I just
cleaned it with alcohol this should
stick nicely oh yeah it's definitely
sticking especially because it's warm
too that wasn't centered though did that
centered I am really bad at arts and
crafts as you can tell so all the
thermal pastes does is fill all those
microscopic cracks and crevices that are
on these surfaces of these materials
they look and feel flat to our scale but
once you get down to the microscopic
levels they look like the Grand Canyon
they are not perfectly flat so that's
all thermal paste is designed to do the
thermal pad whether or not it can do the
same thing and not and transfer that
heat quick enough that's what we're
gonna be checking here so we're gonna
start by checking our initial temps in
BIOS before we even go to the desktop
and we're sitting at 35 C at idle I
don't recall what it was before
doesn't seem terrible though alright
we're gonna start the tests and we'll
know right away if we get like an
initial like just big-ass spike of some
sort so our temperatures right here it's
currently sitting at 40 for 45 and this
is this is warmer at idle I'm almost
positive all right we're gonna start it
are you ready Oh big right to thermal
throttling did you hear the fans good
like a hundred percent so we went one
hundred eighty eight eighty four 100 194
eighty-seven try it again
100 Wow well some of the cores are below
100 well that was short okay so now we
need to actually make this video worth
something we should go to the kitchen
and see what we have that we could use
as a thermal paste let's go
you try pieces piece no that's not a
piece of cheese we try ranch dressing
you know Nick's like melted popsicle
toothpaste it is it kind of makes you
wonder then how well these pads
thermally conducted all then because we
use them on VRMs we use them on memory
chips whom use them on all kinds of
things but if it can't transfer the heat
fast enough and like for instance VRMs
get really really hot so I guess the
question then begs to differ
does it does it really work at all so if
you know the answer to wear thermal pads
make sense and why they make sense can
you please put it in the comments below
because I'll be honest I have no idea
now this is obviously a lot easier to
work with right but I promise we would
try it with nothing so we got to do that
and I think we'll see pretty much the
same result it'll just go until the
thermal throttles so I'd like to point
out that we are actually idling less
with nothing no thermal paste and no pad
here's the pad we used right here
we're actually idling about what almost
10 C less then when we had the thermal
pad on there and we have no paste or
anything now as soon as I hit start on
this test it's just gonna whoop right -
it's gonna woof - his bark which wasn't
a stupid we're gonna it's gonna go right
to like a hundred watch or it's gonna
sit in the damn 60s what the frig or
there's 80s fans kicking up there's the
90s how is this do it better than the
pad because the pad was insulating this
is actually allowing some sort of
transfer of heat because the surfaces
are touching but remember they're
they're still not touching perfectly
flat on that microscopic level whereas
this was actually creating an insulated
layer
between the heat spreader and the block
so again I go back to my original
question how does this help when you put
it on things like VRMs and RAM modules I
mean it goes all the way back to that
eat kit or the the EVGA issue where they
didn't put thermal pads on the vrm on
part of the original 1084 the wind too
but we did see an improvement on
temperatures on the VRMs once these were
applied so obviously they work but I
believe in a very specific circumstance
are we even throttling right now let me
see
we're not even throttling we did hit a
hundred C on a couple of them but look
we're still sitting upper 90s and
t.j.maxx on this is 105 so until one of
these hit 105 it won't throttle so no
thermal paste is actually working better
than he pad our thermal pad whatever
insulating pads what we'll call it now I
know we've done this before but I'm
gonna go ahead and do it now just to
show how toothpaste versus thermal pad
to see which does better I already know
kind of the results gonna be like I said
we've done toothpaste back when we did
our video about crazy household items
being used the thermal paste the peanut
butter did the worst no actually the
Oreo cookie filling did the worst that
day okay I'm apply this with my fingers
I don't know if that's gonna actually
spread out as good I think this is the
part where people start to say Jays done
run out of ideas you know I don't hands
are the devil's playthings rather I put
my hand on my computer than so I forgot
that this one has like those whitening
crystals so you can actually hear what I
push it down listen oh that's like
crunchy our toothpaste has been
installed whoa we're idling much warmer
this is not gonna work okay we're ready
to start it's gonna go straight to
thermal throttle watch
70's 80's 90's up red lights coming on
for cpu right there it's telling me that
it's hot the thing is it's hitting 100
and coming back down to the 90s where as
a thermal pad we're hit 100 and kind of
stay there
so as crest white 3d white toothpaste
better than thermal pads no because like
we're one hundred one hundred hundred
hundred hundred hundred ninety eight
hundred so here's the bottom line I need
to do this video again but I need to
actually order the thermal pads that
were designed for CPUs I tried but
they're out of stock because I think
Linus did a video about it and who other
people did and then of course everyone
bought them up so I will check it out
because if it turns out to be good and
worth it I will try it on the CPU I'll
try it on GPUs especially remember GPUs
have more focus heat than a CPU and I
would love an alternative to dealing
with nasty thermal paste
I hate thermal paste it gets everywhere
so yeah we're gonna go guys this is this
is definitely one of those videos it was
just like at the end of the day I'm like
this was really one of those ideas that
I should have flushed down the toilet
and not taken out of the bathroom with
me not like the leaf blower that was a
good one guys you guys don't know what
I'm talking about then you definitely
wanna go and check that one out all
right guys I'm gonna go thanks for
watching if you've got any crazy ideas
that you think we should try and make
sure you let me know obviously we'll try
it we're desperate at this point because
we're bored we're bored the summer times
it's might be summertime we need things
to do alright guys thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one it smells
nice though right
it smells very minty fresh
I was really concentrated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
