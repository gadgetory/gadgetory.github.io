video coming in for you guys here today
I changing the lights I need to get some
car stuff done because I'm April 21st
I'm gonna be tracking my 370z again over
at Buttonwillow doing 13 CCW in group
for advanced open passing blah blah blah
so it's gonna be the most intense
driving I've done yet the way you know
it's gonna be a car video today is
because I've got the coma

the description below
well okay so I'm six foot three and a
half I've shrunk a little hitting a four
point roll cage in here along with a six
point harness and a spark go racing
seats in the JDM car with a guy my size
is not easy
look at the way I have to do the break
the ebrake I might have to demonstrate
it later but I can get out of this car
in under two seconds you can't tell us
that and then not demonstrated it's
funny looking and my wife was like your
asset to everything on the way out what
I did it I was like at this if I ever
got in an accident in this car at the
track and it's on fire you better
believe I'm get the hell out and buh-bum
my ass and everything along the way yeah
can you imagine with how tight I am
buckled in I could still get out in
about two seconds that's insane that's
why we go with the cantilever style
don't do long drivers oh man
so I actually hit into my buddy's shop
his name's Michael true I'll put a link
to his uh his shop down below he's in
Santa Ana so he is my he's my tire
dealer he's mine got any more to them
rubbers that sounds like something else
actually works really well I already did
all right so mate the Santa Anna we're
at true performance Motorsports here and
we'll put a link down below like I said
so these are the Nexen surfboard G's
it's actually a drift compound tire
really soft but we use it on track days
because it's kind of a cheater tire it
hasn't been banned in my class yet and
it's really cheap so I use it as long as
I can but I don't think it's always
gonna be allowed so as you can see we're
pretty worn out on the shoulders though
this is from my last track day at
streets of streets of Willow running
counterclockwise so turning left that's
all the most of the wear on the right
side of the far right so because you go
downhill high speed in the skid pad and
it's flat we wear them out pretty
quickly but I got four track the exec of
these which isn't too bad it's four
sessions each so what is that sixteen
actual sessions and I must I don't think
I'm slowed by any means so we're gonna
get the same tire put on two
seventy-five 40 18 square which is kind
of interesting because I've got a nine
and a half inch wheel at front a ten and
a half inch in the back so technically I
should be running a ten and a half up
front also
but with what my suspension setup I will
rub so I've got a little bit of bulge on
the front but so far it's eat these
things but so far I seem to be getting
the job done
it's so awesome the things Nissan can do
when they care it's a mighty big lens he
got they're broken were you confident
yes if you can only keep one of your
cars forever which one would it be the
1500 because I have to think forever
have to think utilitarian and so I guess
still mod that to be 700 horsepower to
the truck I can go out on track I just
make the first turn and then I just go
across the track to the last turn and
then come back so earlier I said that I
could get out of this car extremely
quickly if I had to now I guess I have
to put my money where my mouth is right
so I told you
I figured I've it's been a long time
since I've actually talked to you guys
about this car figure maybe we'll go
ahead and do that now a lot of you guys
actually thought I sold this probably
bought the zl1 1le you know this car has
actually been transitioning more and
more into a a road race car if that
makes sense like it's still a road car a
real road car not a race car but it can
do race car things I see because he were
rubbing a little bit here I forgot this
I dealt with this last time too we're
not fully rolled so we are rubbing
slightly but I am gonna be raising this
car up slightly on the front and adding
a little bit more camera because of base
how the wear was on the last tire so
we're gonna go up based off that if we
come back here we clearly don't wrote
rub anywhere in the back we've got lotsa
actually you know what I bet you I know
why we're rubbing
he put my rears on the front of my
friends on the rears really yeah so
we'll be I guess switching those later
at home Hey look I didn't tell him it
wasn't a square setup that's my pet but
now I know ten-and-a-half fit with a
minute minor rubbing that looks really
medius oh yeah one of the things
I did do in here though is I do have a
four-point roll cage obviously because
Safety's we've got crossbars SCCA
approved that's what my Sparco is
attached to in terms of our six point
harness and in terms of like power mods
and stuff on this nothing's changed
since I lasted this video with the
exception I've not SPL control arms all
around including uppers on the front
I've got em CA which are a little bit
different tune in my previous MCAS these
are stiffer they have a different spring
rate different valving rate and then
power mods are still nothing more than
an intake exhaust in a tune so as you
can see under here it's still pretty
much bone stock under this underneath
this saipan carbon fiber hood the
exception the intakes um it does have a
upgraded radiator and such this is an
alpha seat which is the biggest seat I
could fit in here hadn't even have to
get custom brackets made for it but you
can see down there but the seat doesn't
move whatsoever the harness is actually
properly mounted drilled through the
floor and anchored and all that sort of
stuff so we're not going anywhere and as
you saw earlier I can get out of it
quickly if I have to but I decided be
fun to kind of be you guys along for
another one of my hobbies I don't talk
about a lot in social media well I guess
I do in social me about not so much on
YouTube because no matter what someone's
gonna say well that car sucks this cars
better why didn't you get you should
have gotten those opinions really don't
matter to me honestly this is this is
fun for me I decided to kind of see how
you guys handle it once again with me
sharing one of my hobbies if you guys
can't act mature I won't do it again or
I will a spite so either way you will
you won't see this again we depth rack
they cannot mix Sunday so maybe we will
I don't know
alright guys anyway just want to take
you along for this ride I need to get
this done because the track day next
weekend and if I didn't do this today I
wouldn't had time to get these tires put
on so I'm gonna go home I'm gonna swap
the rear there the rear is back to the
rear where they belong and yeah
I immediately saw that I was like that's
offsets wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
