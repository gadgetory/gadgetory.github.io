now not everyone is as comfortable with
putting liquid inside of their computers
as I am which leaves you with the only
choice of going with air cooling now we
haven't taken a look at a whole lot of
air coolers on this channel but today
we're going to be looking at cooler
masters brand-new master air maker 8
it's kind of a silly name but is it a
silly cooler I don't know let's find out
I'm gonna play
go
now I don't typically do unboxings but
I'm going to do that today and include
that in today's review because I feel
that any company that takes the amount
of time and effort to make the
presentation good is definitely a
company that cares about the product
that's inside so I wanted to go ahead
and show that to you guys today now one
of the things that makes the master air
maker 8 so unique is the fact that it is
a customizable air cooler you don't see
a whole lot of that when it comes to air
cooling and considering it's very
difficult to find a one cooler fits all
type of scenario they've made a lot of
adjustable aspects to this that I think
is very neat and I can't wait to show
you guys that so anyway once you open up
the package here you can see that it
does have a very well thought-out
presentation here here's the cooler
labeled our hair manual and accessories
the 120 ARS 12 centimeter or 120
millimeter fan brackets so that you can
switch out the included 140 millimeter
fans on here if you wanted to with
something of your choice and then the
top plate so we'll talk about that in a
second now the cooler measures 172
millimeters tall so automatically it's
going to not exactly be form factor
friendly when it comes to the ITX builds
or super small form factor cases so
definitely keep that in mind
172 millimeters is pretty tall it comes
installed with a push and pull
configuration on both sides of the heat
sink this is 140 millimeter fans with
LEDs in there as well so that it will
glow and look pretty but also it's got
eight copper heat pipes in here as well
as a 3d vapor chamber so you're getting
kind of dual purpose here we've got
vapor chamber and heat pipes giving you
the best dissipation that you possibly
can which is kind of taken it as sort of
a hybrid cooler in a way where the vapor
chamber as the heatsink heats up the
vapor is going to turn into a gas it's
going to carry heat to the top of the
pipe the heat sinks going to carry that
heat away as that heat is carried away
it's going to condense back down to a
liquid move to the bottom and continue
that sort of process vapor chambers are
actually very neat if you think about it
arguably one of the most frustrating
things about tall heat seat coolers like
this is that they give you amazing
cooling and part of the height of the
stack of the thin array here and the
heat pipes is giving you amazing cooling
but when you have a push-pull
configuration
like this with a fan on both sides where
it comes in one side and out the other
it's going to give you the best
efficiency but at the same time it takes
up a lot of space and you guys know that
right next to the CPU socket is where
your memory goes at a lot of memory
tends to be taller than standard now
because of the fact that they are
including high heatsink spreaders or
heat spreaders on top of the memory
which can impact the fans of your
heatsink tower I know a lot of folks
have encountered that where they
couldn't go push pull on their heatsink
fans simply because the memory was
striking the bottom of the fan
what cooler masters thought about that
and they have these two tabs on either
side of the cooler you simply push those
in if I can find the other one here
there we go you push those in and then
you can slide the fan up and down to get
some extra cooling on there or some
extra clearance on there it's kind of a
big deal not only that it also makes it
extremely easy to take your fans off of
the heatsink and clean them you can get
inside the thin array here very very
easily and then put the fans right back
on without having to get entirely too
technical with dealing with clips and
pool you know rubber pull tabs or screws
it's very very easy now the fin stack
here it's very very heavy actually this
whole thing weighs over 1,300 grams when
it's all put together so that's
something to keep in mind when it comes
to leverage for pulling on your
motherboard but it is very very sturdy
the aluminum fins on here are nice and
thick there's a lot of them it's going
to give you a lot of heat dissipation I
have no concerns about putting this on
any CPU that you could possibly find so
it's going to give you really good
cooling we're going to test that today
on my 59 30 K okay so here's what the
top of the cooler looks like it is a
well as you can see it is a piano finish
which you guys know I am just like that
I hate piano finish so if you're the
kind of guy like me that looks that goes
oh man that just sucks because over time
you're going to wipe this you're going
to clean it it's going to get
fingerprints effect I'm putting
fingerprints all over it right now it's
going to get scratched if you wipe it
too many times and that's just
unfortunate well Coolermaster includes
this little box right here when we
opened up you saw it said top plate and
in here is a replacement top plate which
is apparently smarter than me I can't
get it open
so there's only one in there it's kind
of a big box with this big top plate but
guess what this guy is this one is not
piano finish it is abs textured way to
go on that that makes me fact that metal
well I only looked at this through the
plastic the first time I open this box
to kind of get acquainted with this I
thought it was plastic it's not this is
aluminum so there are several things
that you can do with this in fact it is
a a bead blasted kind of a dusted
anodized black aluminum here now that
means you could paint this and you could
get that paint stripped off if you
decide you don't like it start all over
with using something like an air craft
remover it's not going to strip the
anodizing but it will strip the paint
off and you can repaint this thing over
and over that is freaking amazing so
let's go ahead and get this thing
installed on here in fact before we do
that when we go ahead and show you the
hardware but we will install this thing
to show you look at the arrangement of
the hardware here have you ever seen
hardware that's actually been you know
presented this nicely with this little
plastic pouch here with all the screws
you've got your manual here you've got
your back plates for all of your sockets
including AMD as well as Intel it's
going to include 2011 sockets 1366 1150
LM 51 LGA 775 AM 2a + 3 + AM sockets I
mean it's it's everything it's going to
fit everything and that's what makes
this cooler really neat is it's not
catering to just one or the other all
right so anyway let's say you want to
change this top cover here because you
hate the piano finish which I do it's
pretty easy you simply grab it by the
side push it to one end and then it will
pop up you've got a cooler master logo
right here which does light up so we'll
light up underneath this cover but then
all you got to do is take your aluminum
aluminum indium one here place it over
snap it down so everything is lined up
and then the cooler master logo there
pops through and there it is right there
which this looks so much better to me
than this piano finish hate that hate
piano finishes now one last accessory to
talk about here is it does come with a
pwm splitter which is a big deal because
of the fact that a lot of motherboards
especially if you're using this in a
smaller form factor
like a micro-atx or something you might
only have one CPU fan header not an
optional besides you're going to want
these fans to speed up and slow down
together so it does include a PWM
splitter so you control both of your
fans as well as this little plug right
here that plugs into the harness coming
off the middle of the heatsink so that
you can make this guy light up but if
you don't want the logo to light up then
all you have to simply do is don't plug
that in all right let's go ahead and
hook this thing up and let's see how
well it performs so installation is
super easy and it's no harder than any
other aircrews you've probably ever
installed if you've installed any sort
of cooler master heatsink in the past
like a hyper 212 Evo or something like
that or a v8 it's very very similar to
the way that those all install you've
got brackets that go on the motherboard
and then the heatsink mounts to the
bracket it's very very easy to get to
it's very easy to install too as long as
you don't make stupid mistakes like I
did now I'd like to share my mistakes
with you guys because it helps everybody
learn and I want to show that even the
best of us makes stupid mistakes now I
installed this thing and I loaded up a
264 and I expected it to not be as good
as my water cooling obviously I mean
this thing's got my test bench typically
has a custom loop triple 360 right on
there lots of lots of headroom when it
comes to water cooling my 59 30 K
running at 4.4 gigahertz now here's the
thing or four point five years sorry
here's the thing I installed it and it
immediately went up into the ninety
degrees Celsius range and thermal
throttled up to like 18 to 20 percent on
thermal throttling that tells me we were
hitting over 90 C remember thorough
thermal throttling on x99 platform CPUs
is much lower than 105 on a standard CPU
so I was racking my brain trying to
figure out what the heck is going on why
is it thermal throttling like this and I
decided to go ahead and take a break
from it and it started editing together
the first half of this video would you
guys think about that you guys like that
musical intro with the b-roll and anyway
you guys can tell me in the comments
whether you liked it or hated it but
anyway it's kind of like fourth-wall
break huh I'm talking about something
that happened in this video while
recording this video before it's even
done but
part of it was already edited anyway I
realized I was looking at my editing
going
I forgot I know someone here has already
said this someone's already said they
know what the problem is I forgot to
take off the little plastic protector
for the bottom of the block yeah the
actual copper base I forgot to take the
plastic off that I mean you kind of get
in that the moment where you're building
you just doing your thing and you forget
to peel the stupid thing off because
it's facing down you don't really way
yeah I did that so anyway I ran back
down here took the thing apart yep there
it was cleaned off all the old thermal
paste put it back together and we are
running a 264 right now the temperature
of 71 C at a hundred percent load
averages on the cores are 60 57 65 60 62
and 59 with an average package temp of
72 point eight and right now temps just
came back down to 67 66 and the thing
you have to understand what 8 o 64 is it
does FPU testing it does memory stress
testing it does all the algorithms it
pushes the CPU as hard as it possibly
can it's going to be pushed harder than
any real-world scenario would ever do
adobe rendering none of that is going to
push the CPU in terms of stress testing
and temperature testing as something
like a 264 so it's going to be a hell of
a lot lower than that when it comes to
temperatures now to put that into
perspective my custom water cooling loop
tends to sit anywhere between 59 and 63
depending on the amount of load on it in
a 264 so we're only about 10 see higher
than that with air cooling and a hell of
a lot cheaper than it was to buy a
custom water cooling loop now of course
nothing is perfect there is a drawback
to this and I have to mention this
it is absolutely nearly impossible to
get your graphics card out once it's
installed if depending on the distance
between your CPU and your top card when
you have a graphics card in the top the
cooler is right next to that and
practically touching it which means it's
impossible to get the graphics card out
when the cooler and the fans are
installed it's easiest to just take the
fans off and then take the memory out
and try and get your finger in there
keep the clean guys this is a family
tech show keep it clean I mean it but
you
got to really like finagle your
appendage down in there and to UM
unlatch the PCI Express retention clip
on the graphics card it was a real pain
in the butt getting that out and I knew
that it was going to be when I installed
it and I getting it out was harder than
I thought it was going to be so
unfortunately if you're running like an
X 99 board or something that has a lot
of PCIe slots and it puts the top slot
really close to the CPU that's something
you're gonna have to keep in mind that's
really the only drawback I could think
to this yeah I really couldn't think of
any other drawbacks it really is a
fantastic cooler does a great job of
cooling it looks great it is by far one
of the sharpest looking air coolers I
think I've ever seen and some of them do
a really good job at cooling but look
terrible and then some of them look
really good but cool terrible this is
one of the few that give you both and
you've got some adjustability in there
for RAM clearance as well as beautiful
LEDs and an option on the top that you
can install and paint or do something
custom with anyway guys tell me what you
thought of this video how you guys like
the editing style and stuff also - if
you feel like supporting and I never do
this I hope you guys don't get mad but
if you guys feel like helping support
outside of YouTube I do have an Amazon
affiliate links there in the description
of this video I've only got three
countries set up I'll try and set up
some more but anyway it really helps the
channel out a lot and it helps me not
have to put as many ads and stuff in
front of you guys which means I can get
back to me on better content creation
rather than trying to figure out how to
keep the channel going outside of
YouTube's shitty income model anyway
guys thanks for watching today's video
again I really hope you guys will tell
me what you think and I will see you in
the next one which is probably going to
be this guy right here I left it back
there as a teaser I'm sure someone's
already commented without getting to
this point of the video but I digress
it's time to go and I'm gonna go ahead
and I guess I'm gonna finish editing
this video huh anyway see you later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
