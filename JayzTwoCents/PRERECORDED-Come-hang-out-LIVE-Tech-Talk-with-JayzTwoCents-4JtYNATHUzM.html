gonna book a date zoosk the smart way to
plate
Oh
you
oh how about that yay for amateur hour
whoo I love me some amateur hour amateur
hours how do you come in a Twitter okay
guys uh this is this is how we're gonna
do this this is a very unplanned very
unfit of this way I'm on vacation right
now and I decided that a lot of my UK
guys I was I never get to watch your
live stream because you always do them
so late at night and that's stupid and
blah blah blah so here I am guess what
during the day kids asleep wife's at
work and I've got a little time to
myself so I decided I want to come and
hang out with all you guys that I love
and admire so much because you guys are
all crazy enough to give two shits about
what I have to say so I don't have
anything planned I just want to talk to
you guys I wanna talk a little bit about
something I did on my vlog channel
yesterday that I started a hell of a
conversation I can tell you that much um
obviously I live in the US of A and here
we like our guns and I'm gonna go there
I am gonna talk about a little bit about
guns in this live stream simply because
of the conversations that start it over
on my vlog channel and by the way if if
you guys don't know that I have a vlog
channel it's right there in the
description it says sub to my vlog
channel is over 550 subs over there now
and I do a daily vlog almost every
single day um just talking about I
like to talk about so it's a little bit
everything over there for you so go
check it out if you like it hit sub and
we'll see you over there every single
day for starters I talked about on my
blog channel that I have a 9-millimeter
1911 a handgun that was that was given
to me by my father I'm gonna go ahead
and show that and I'm just letting you
guys know that if any of you guys um
severely don't like okay so you guys
really can't hear you we can't hear you
but I don't know how delayed the audio
is or the this the comments are ok so
I'm gonna assume you guys can hear me
right now because you guys are now
tweeting me that you can hear me so okay
um if you guys don't like guns at all
then you might want to go ahead and turn
off because i'm going to be showing you
some guns here and I apologize but I
would never tell somebody they're wrong
for not liking guns and I would hope no
one would ever tell me I'm wrong for
liking them and with that we'll go ahead
and get started with my my 1911
nine-millimeter right here now if you
guys follow me on the blog channel you
guys to know that yesterday I talked
about the fact that I was really upset
that the magazine for this gun it took a
crap and what I mean by that is the
magazine was extremely old this this
weapon is almost 30 years old I was
given to me by my father and he was a a
weapons instructor in the Navy and so he
this was a gift for him and he gave it
to me and I just want to show that i'm
excited because even though the color
doesn't match i did manage to find a
magazine that only took a little bit of
modifications to get to work and now
it's in there and on sunday i'm going
shooting with my wife and i want to
point out that i said i'm going shooting
with my wife and I'm not shooting my
wife very big difference between the two
just like um you know depending on the
way you say things can really determine
the way they sound like what was that
saying um all right i forgot to mute
skype all y'all stopped skyping me
seriously Robbie stop it stop it I mean
we go to mute those sound it's like I
said amateur hour guys amateur hour
there we go muted all right um but I
want to show you guys what I think is
like the most pimp little gangster gun
I've ever I've ever gotten and my mom
gave me this actually um Duke dragon
said I should fap when I have the chance
don't need to I'm married and I have a
wife that will take care of that for me
just soon so I've got this 38 special
right here this is like the most pimp
gun ever i'm telling you right now
who this is like the gun you see in all
the movies regular they pull out of
their ankle holster or they've got it
hidden in like their bra I guess I just
think this is a bad little gun I can't
wait to shoot that this weekend this is
awesome anyway I'm not going to talk all
about guns I just wanted that's what I
was doing prior to starting the stream
when I said hey I want to go ahead and
stream to my friends all the people who
love me on the Internet are you crazy
people so I just thought it man some
people might care to see this so I
figured I'd go ahead and show it I know
if any of you guys start to get a little
crazy you know but you know what I
there's gonna be a vlog on Sunday
because we're going shooting sunday
where I'm gonna shoot we're gonna shoot
this my wife and I and a bunch of
friends I feel like the one I shoot it I
have to like hold it like this like I
can't I can't hold it the correct way I
feel like I have to be like stick them
up stick them up or you have to like you
know like in all the old 60s like um you
know private I detective movies are
always like you know they like turn it
all sideways cuz this just doesn't quite
work gangster style with this this just
doesn't work I mean I get you left I did
what so uh huh so man just it's a
stick-up give me you know it isn't work
you know but you gotta be like give me
money see give me all your money cuz
i've got i got this this guy right here
in i can't i can't quite get to snap
closed but then again it's an old gun so
it's got to be cleaned up and always
left and stuff but anyway some people
want me to finish the story from the
vlog and i thought about that later i
went you know I didn't finish the story
did I I started to talk about the fact
that somebody tried to break into my
house and they're trying to beat down
the door and the police are 20 minutes
away because of where I live and I'm
standing there on the other side of my
door with this weapon just like this and
everyone wants to know did Jake kill a
guy did I stab him in the heart with a
trident am I wanted for murder uh no
actually um because it took the police
sodium long to get here because of where
I live he just left often left and of
course that really screws you up for a
little while because you keep thinking
what if he's going to come back so i
kept the
get the gun very close by but I mean it
was a very unclaimed attic ending but
the bottom line is if and you know the
discussions over on the vlog were you
were gonna kill a guy just because he's
breaking into your house and I didn't
say I was going to kill a guy for
breaking into my house I said I was
prepared to kill a guy if he was Trent
gonna try and harm us that's what I said
and so what ended up happening was over
on the vlog channel the guy said you
know like I said you'd kill ago for
breaking your health and good that's
just really stupid good uh and and when
people say what do you think you should
have done I was gonna reply and be like
well you know I could have had a cup of
coffee waiting for him I could have made
me giving him some doughnuts you know
maybe say hey bro what's going on you
know come on in my house take my stuff
I'm not gonna do anything so just noodle
to take my stuff no I don't think so his
suggestion was that and by the way in
the house at the time was myself my
sister my mom my dad and my sisters kids
who happen to be a very young girls so
his suggestion was that we all climb out
the window and wait outside for the
police I'm sorry but I was got to be the
stupidest thing I've ever heard by far
the stupidest suggestion I ever heard
and no I was not prepared to kill the
guy for coming into my house but here's
the way I look at it I have a two and a
half inch thick solid oak door the front
door to my house my wife just texted me
that's really cool a two and a half inch
solid oak door and Jake and Nick I know
you're in this stream and I know you
felt that door that door is solid and it
is heavy as hell and on the other side
of that door is a steel security screen
and it's got a double latch and it's got
all steel hinges can't be cut can't be
bent here's the bottom line if he got
through that door and then got through a
two-and-a-half-inch sick thick solid oak
door he's not coming into play xbox guys
he's he's coming in with an agenda and
the bottom line was I was prepared to
find out what that agenda were not to
find out what that agenda was and the
moment he came through both of those
doors it was considered a life threat as
far as I'm concerned but there we go I'm
done
I'm done talking about guns and ranting
about guns the last couple of days have
been very good and heavy for my wife and
I cinch the yes Ombey the unicorn says
yes the door is freaking heavy yes it's
a heavy door and you imagine what it
takes to get through that after getting
through the screen yeah there's no way
I'm gonna wait for that ah he said let
them in and steal and jump out the
window yeah exactly Mike mode serious it
was I couldn't understand that I just
couldn't fathom that I'm supposed to
what throw everyone out the window come
on dad come on mom come on kids let's go
at the window would be quiet because we
don't want a little know we're coming
out the window uh anyway um but it made
me realize favorite tweet I got
yesterday when I was tweeting about my
my hand guns was somebody's step dad
owns a gun store and they put a picture
of Obama up as gun salesman of the year
and that's really interesting because
when we went to bass pro shops yesterday
there was not a single handgun in stock
not a single handgun and we're talking
just last time i went there in december
there was every gun you could imagine
every kind of glock smith and wesson
Kimber you know Springfield Ruger
everything everything was there Glock
but yet I went last night because my
wife wants a gun of her own now and
there wasn't a damn thing in stock and I
went to several gun stores today and it
was the same thing I was like wow okay
you know threatened to uh I sounded like
Kermit the Frog threaten to take our
guns and hmm I don't think you should
take our guns that sounds nothing like
hermit but anyway it you threaten an
American to take away their guns and
well guess what you get the opposite
reaction apparently the statistic is
right now that over fifty three percent
of america's americans are armed yeah
you know privates guess what man that's
the country we live in I don't judge
people in their countries for having
their laws or doing things their way in
fact I have a up most respect for the
british police because of the fact that
they do it without gun so i couldn't
imagine I've good friends that are
policemen
family members that are police officers
and I cannot imagine them doing their
job here without guns sure they they
would just they'd be screwed that's the
only there is to it but enough about
that what would you guys like to talk
about today um I've got some really
exciting stuff being sent to me by
munition you guys aren't surprised about
that i need to put their little logo up
here because they've supported me so
much and by the way i've never been paid
for anything I've ever set up truly
believe in me initio as a company but a
company that i discovered on a company
that i discovered it while at CES called
tilt is sending you some really cool
stuff this week in fact and some stuff
that's currently in development they're
sending me probably later in the month
but they're gonna so I'm really looking
forward to that you guys are going to
see some product reviews coming up here
x-pro defy wants to know my opinion on
the titan my video honestly granted it
was over the top and quite a bit of
acting and burning a fake money the
analogy was 100% how i feel it is a
waste of money simply because it was the
original 680 that didn't come to pass
because the 660 was beating the hell out
of the 7970 already so they rebadged the
662 vs 680 and since am be effectively
told them got them to show their
products early and then camp AMD says el
we're not going to come out with a card
till later in the year nvidia quickly
halted the accelerated timeline of the
700 series called this the the gk110
chip titan and then did a limited
production of them i believe the only
did a thousand cards at a thousand bucks
and it's a waste of freakin money it is
a waste of money for the price that it
is seven hundred dollars yeah fine seven
hundred dollars but no way does playing
call of duty a card play a card player
do 21 wants to know does playing call of
duty help you with your gun skills no
but it certainly helps you with your
anger issues it really helps to hone
your hang angry assurances talk about
graphics cards well I could talk all day
just about graphics cards you know in
the beginning there was
the processor and on the processor there
were various processes that had to be
handled in order to render graphics and
one day they discovered that if they
were to offload that the process off of
the main the CPU the main CPU the
central processing unit and developed a
graphics processing units the two could
work in conjunction and therefore
alleviate some of the bottle necking and
performance issues which really took us
out of the 8-bit genre put us into
16-bit 32-bit and from there on
everything just you know so you can just
talk about anything so you got to be a
little more specific and I'm trying to
read the comments here as you guys know
they can be very slowly make sure you
tweet me too if you have any questions
that you won't answer in fact i'ma check
Twitter first and then I'll come back to
facebook only because I know that
there's going to be less Tweety birds in
here ah let's see mmm J oh that was
earlier ok holy crap has a lot of people
following me right now and none of the
tweets that are on my phone are showing
up on the desktop Gigi Gigi Twitter G
frickin G all right let's go ahead and
scroll down here into the youtubes um
coconut monkey says I reminds me the
scene from super troopers when they are
shooting the bulletproof cup huh yeah
zombie unicorn says she fax for you I
must get me one of these wives yeah well
you know finisher sword from the blog
into that technical quipped no but you
know I'm really looking forward to see
what kind of accessories and attachments
might be upgraded trigger this is a very
heavy trigger the trigger pull on this
is very heavy but tonight we're going
over to a friend's house a true gun
aficionado and we're going to completely
rebuild both of these guns completely
disassembled ljubim up all them up see
if we can't get them you know nice and
smooth um let's see here snood ex says
if some broke into my house and they
plan to hurt us or steal anything I
would shoot them exactly I mean shoot
exactly shoot yeah I'm so 8-bit says hey
Jay i'm getting back into RC cars i was
wondering what type you have and what
if you would recommend nitro brushless I
definitely recommend electric if you
just want to kind of get into it screw
around this is my buggy right here it is
a vitara twin hammers it's starting to
become quite custom I've already
upgraded the tires these are enter code
TSL swampers as you can see they are
like you know like the super swampers
you see on trucks they're extremely soft
if you I mean you barely you can barely
touch these things and they squish
because I'm building my truck this
truggy for a rock crawler type style you
can see the rear suspension like has
really crazy articulation in it I mean
like this I cut the roll cage just the
other day and made it shorter took out
the spare tires with less wheels in the
back carbon fiber wrap the body panels
getting ready to do all-new electronics
and this thing put some weights up front
but yeah it's a really fun truck I used
to do Nitro and I used to do nitro
eighth scale what's your bigger trucks
the problem with nitro is they're loud
and they're messy and you know every
time you're done playing them you got to
clean them and you got a deal with air
filter oiling and you gotta tune pipes
and you've got you know you get a roll
over and you can if you roll the truck
over oil or no fuel can flood the
carburetor and it stops running and then
you've got to deal with glow plugs and
it's just a pain in the ass granted
they're cool to see you know Mary earned
there really fast but they're loud your
neighbors get pissed off sometimes I go
out at night in the backyard just kind
of slow crawl over my rocks and it makes
no noise it's a lot of fun so I
recommend anything electric and and
there's all sorts of cars out there
trucks cars that you just about anything
so you decide what kind of file a style
you think is fun and go with that tangy
had Cox says love EJ hey love you too
what is your what is your icon Mara
camera tell scaring me Daniel Palmer
says 3570k with EBD a 68 esc
superclocked or 3770k with 674 the wind
can decide with extra money but into
well I would honestly say if if those
two packages you managed to find them to
be the same price then I would maybe go
with the 3770k in the 670 for the win at
670 is within five to ten percent
performance of the 680 and you can
easily get that performance by a mild
overclock which you can do even with the
stock cooler if you get one like the the
the direct CU 2 from like asus or the
twin froze or something from msi
something with a nice upgraded cooler on
it and you then end up with that 3770k
that's super powerful if you want to do
other things like streaming or video
editing or whatever it's going to be
3570k hands now if all you're doing is
gaming you don't plan on doing any sort
of rendering you don't want to stream
you don't want to do any of that you
don't think you're going to do any of
that then go ahead and go with 35 70 and
get the 680 coconut monkey says red dawn
is upon us then when the Chinese invade
that's okay right now they're a little
bit preoccupied with North Korea robbie
says Lulu British police yeah British
police you wanker um and see card player
do 21 has asked that same question like
56 times yeah okay I already answered
that but but but to do pottermore fan
says hey Jo awesome hey Pottermore
haven't seen in a while tfp 1138 says he
talks about Red Dawn and now I hear
airplanes hey Jay I need some help I
have a three-screen set up with an intel
d 77 bh 55k motherboard the gtx 690
should I get a new motherboard I don't
know it's a z77 motherboard I don't like
intel motherboards specifically because
they're not nearly as friendly with
overclocking as likes a gigabyte or msi
or ace you already a dovish motherboards
I just don't like intel motherboards so
if you want to have full control over
overclocking and stuff then yeah if you
just leave if you just plug it in and
let it go then shoot ya just
stick with the Intel uh coconut monkey
says make angry I was sure assuming he's
talking about call of duty what do you
think about new features added to the
Titan I've been following it I if I had
a Titan it would I would probably use it
to prop my door open dynamite horse says
I'm about to build a pc do I have to
have case fans of course you got to keep
it cool you got to have airflo misja
graphics hard when it comes to gaming
I'll just sort of talked on that make
twig 79 says what is the best Intel
processor you could get for around three
hundred bucks if you live near
microcenter you can get us at 3770k for
two hundred and thirty dollars otherwise
for that price you could end up getting
well the 3570k would be fine there are
some I sevens and you can find for
around three hundred bucks their lesser
than the 3770 but still good what's my
thought on the new Intel 4000 series
chips coming out I don't mess around
with what ap use or integrated graphics
at all even my daughter's computer has a
9800 GTX in it so I'm sorry I can help
you Jay what's my views in battlefield 4
if there's been a preview on it yet I
haven't seen it I did go to the
battlefield webpage and took a look I
haven't really been playing battlefield
3 even that much I played an game twice
so far that's not so much because I
don't like the game as much as it is
time wise I mean I really did enjoy
aftermath but I just wanted much time
anymore I mean look the last video i put
up was saturday today's Thursday it's
part of the reason why I'm doing the
live stream today I want to let you guys
know that hey I'm still alive got some
things that I'm working on though some
videos I think you guys are going to
like and I was very pleasantly surprised
at how much you guys like that really
really retarded video i did about the
insula installing the cpu i am shocked
how much you guys like that so that
makes it easy for me because guess what
that video was easy to make i was able
to edit it quickly and i think from the
moment i decided I was gonna make a
video to the moment it was online was
like less than an hour and if you guys
like that kind of stuff that's gonna
make my life a hell of a lot easier
um let's see uh overlord says overlord
93 says which would be a better choice
performance to price ratio 7950 or 7970
well the 7950 is a great that's a great
graphics card but so is the 7970 but if
we're talking two gigahertz version
performance to price anything of the
7900 series would be good you can get
away with 7950 if you're only doing
1080p gaming gamers with reason what do
you think of machine guns because when
you showed your guns there wasn't any
machine guns that's because machine guns
are illegal in California me I think
that might be illegal no I don't think
they're illegal federally right now
which by the way I'm hearing rumors that
the federal gun band bill was shot down
yes which means maybe I'll be able to
get myself an ar-15 when I can afford it
because it won't be all sold out before
the gun ban everyone was afraid of um
yeah I in California right live you
can't have more than a 10 round clip and
you can't have anything more than
semi-automatic which means no three
round burst or auto full auto or knew
that semi only ten round left or mags or
less only card play a dude xbox or ps3 I
do not want a ps3 but i do own an xbox
so we'll go with that dang ahead I
don't mind your picture I like a picture
I just couldn't tell what it is but but
dr. snood XXX source nutribullet says I
would go for the 3770 and 670 GPU seemed
to be killed faster than CPUs not really
there they were on fairly close time
cycles and life cycles in fact a lot of
the GPU makers are and they do talk to
CPU manufacturers so that they can kind
of time their latest generations
somewhat around each other zombie dude
where can I get that mic stand I got
this mic stand from guitar center
actually had them order it for me they
don't carry it in stock it's an
expensive mic stand though it's a look
at that little product placement right
there it's 120 bucks I was pulled right
off my desk but I mean it's full
articulating and stuff
so I like it because I like to do a lot
of the voice stuff and so it's nice to
have this a lot of people say I have a
really good voice um will you think I
think I should go to radio mama always
said I had a face for radio a coconut
monkey must go me I'll check back when
you get back k see you later um tactica
banana says I have a gtx 560 2k by a 60
100 how long do you think should wait to
upgrade until your computer can no
longer play games at the resolutions you
like to play the mat that's the easiest
answer I can give you that dynamite
horse is cool hey hot Fonzie says reach
water i'm going to read water i'm going
over there in a second i like one more
comment i want to read here i would love
to see some AMD motherboards with eight
ram slots and thunderbird under bolt
port but for now it's there are mother
there the crossfire the crossfire five
formula thunderbolt edition has a
thunderbolt card in it so you can do
that you're not going to see you're not
going to see quad channel ram on AMD
until AMD decides to have quad channel
controllers in their cpu so if AMD
doesn't decide to do that which they
probably won't for the enthusiast market
at least it's very very unlikely that's
in the current timeline that they show
for steamroller and escalator i
seriously doubt you're going to see quad
channel ram for AMD i really don't but
then again quad channel unless you're
doing a lot of rendering and stuff and
very heavy photoshop you're not going to
really see any sort of a you're gonna
see any ruling major improvements anyway
okay let's go check out twitter let's
check out Twitter's gorm it gormiti 100
says talk about okay I did that type of
graphics cards okay go Vinny 100 is
intel i5 3570k for gaming yes it's
probably one of the most highly
recommended gaming CPUs out there it's
all the power of the 3770 just without
the hyper threading so it doesn't have
virtual cores enabled in it so it's for
physical cores
unlike the i7s which are four cores with
hyper-threading on each core which makes
it act as to so the 35 70 though is
definitely one of the most sought-after
gaming chips let's go and update
facebook I don't think there's been any
Facebookers under I think you guys
should all go like my facebook page if
you haven't already once again the link
is right there in the description just
waiting for you all you do is click it
I'm sure all you guys are already logged
into Facebook anyway because we know how
much you guys love facebook we all know
how much you love to hang out with your
your girlfriend's up on the Facebook and
in that interwebs I don't know anything
in your web uh let's see let's scroll
down here there were 28 new comments
here okay tib okay check Twitter I just
did what do I think of the 3570k versus
8350 ah there have been so much oh my
gosh okay there have been so much
benchmarking done so many reviews done
on that particular topic go into a
search and what you're going to find is
you're going to find a lot of mixed
opinions you're going to find people who
feel that the 8350 is better and you're
going to find people if I say the 3570k
is better they're very close to the
price I like the 8350 because I was able
to overclock mine to over five gigs
finely but I am on water cooling which
is very required for that type of
overclock on AMD and so the price to
performance ratio on that aspect was
already worth it for me because I was
already on amd's platform if I had to
buy a new motherboard I would have just
gone straight Intel the 3570k though is
very freaking close to the 8350 even
when the 8350 is overclocked but when it
comes to rendering and stuff the 4th
Reds just can't keep up with the a
threads even though the individual core
speed
and and you know the processing power of
the individual cores of the 8350 is
slower there's just more of them so okay
tfp 1138 yeah 2700 processor is that
fast enough for gtx 690 it's plenty fast
it's an i7 it's just it's just a sandy
bridge version of the 3770k it's the
same thing really I think less than ten
percent difference in fact the Ivy
Bridge tends to run a bit hotter huh
Brian grandma says he has a ram question
please answer I don't see your question
uh we ask it I guess hey Bjorn oh so you
finally caught a live stream hey a live
stream no finally caught you Thank You
Duke dragon says I think you have a sexy
voice do you really think the way I talk
it's good they say I should go on the
radio talk to people in their cars when
they're driving and stuff I don't know
maybe maybe pottermore fans SJ are you a
programmer also what is your job title
and what is it entail i am not a
programmer however i work at a soft i
work for a software development company
my actual job title it's funny it oh
it's constantly changing by the way
because i do about four different things
for the company that i work for i am i
am director for our software support i
am I T where I help keep things running
I am a network administered Minh and
server admin for some of our platforms
that are up in Canada so I'm always
remoting into those servers and doing
updates and and keeping the server
running I am also a global admin for
user accounts in our company I also do
QA and QV which is Quality Assurance
quality verification testing the
software that has been developed prior
to it going to release writing up
Sprint's dealing with bugs writing up
bugs putting up test cases for the bugs
and regression testing yeah but it's
very boring
it's very boring if you don't care about
that sort of stuff dr. Cain brother says
Jay my tech-talk bro how do I find out
if your pc will fit another video card
measured the distance between the little
I don't have one available right here
you know the vents in the back of your
computer where you take it out and
that's where the like your motherboard
or your your cables go for your USB or
your video card cable measure from there
to whatever obstruction there is and
whatever that distance is you need to
make sure is greater than the length of
the card and the length of the card is
always part of the specifications when
you look at a card online it'll say 11
inches long 11 and a half inches 10
inches whatever our bro says ask better
questions you knobs hey why don't you
ask a question knob you I don't see any
questions from you I don't see anything
to do Brian grin wis says you have four
gigs of ram and you have upgraded to
eight gig your mobile detects it but
window says it's eight gigs 3.46 gigs is
usable what the you can't figure it
out well are you on a 64 bit version of
Windows if you're on a 32 bit version of
Windows it's only going to recognize 4
gigs minus any other peripherals so for
instance if you have 4 gigabytes of ram
in there and I know you said you have
eight but let's say you have four gigs
of RAM inside your computer you have a
video card that has 512 k or 512
megabytes that's subtracted from the
four gigs which could give you that 3.46
or if you have a sound card in there
that's 128 megabytes sound card that
subtracted sounds a lot to me like
you're running a 32-bit version of
Windows my friend why do I dislike the
Titan just go watch the Titan video it I
meant everything I said in there I
honestly did what is the best way to go
about getting a job as an its computer
IT yeah just determine what you want to
do with computers because computer
sciences is a huge broad spectrum of
different types of jobs programming
network admin network security server
administration server development I
think I already said programming on
there's different types of programming
platforms you got java asp net there's
all sorts of different languages in
there and they all typically fall under
two different type of platform mobile
apps is becoming a very very booming
industry for programmers you've got your
a plus certifications which is basic
hardware un plus which is your network
certification you guys cisco certs
microsoft certified administrator you've
got a lot of different things you can do
so you need to determine what it is you
want to do with computers before you go
about finding out what cut that job
because it's a whole different line of
schooling think of it as like doctors
you can be a doctor doing general
practice general practitioner as i call
it so you can see like a clinic you can
see anyone about any sort of
non-emergency thing that comes in or you
can be a podiatrist or you can be you
know a heart surgeon or you can be you
can go into dentistry and orthodontics
you can go into you mean optometrist
which is an eye doctor I think
podiatrist is a foot doctor by the way
you can go into orthopedics which is
bones and you know stuff like that you
can become a pediatrician or you become
an OBGYN so they're all doctors and
they're all in a medical field but they
all do a different thing that's same
thing with computers so that's my best
advice to you find out what it is you
think you would enjoy doing and start
learning it start teaching yourself
before you even go to schools start
paying someone to teach you you may find
out you hate it before you even get
there uh Jake gaming MC says you just
bought a corsair h80i any thoughts on it
you haven't gotten it yeah it's a 120 I
believes 120 millimeter radiator because
of the decent fan it's fairly quiet it
cools much better than air at very quiet
operation so I think you'll really enjoy
it and Zach 95 should you pay 250
dollars for a gig from gigabyte for 7970
your friends salesmen yes two hundred
fifty dollars is a great price for a
7970 gigabyte edition gigabyte do it if
it's a gigahertz edition then you're
practically stealing it from him do I
think course tailor-make will make h110
I I don't know I'm waiting for chris
able to come out with a triple radiator
version because
the so many cases now have room for a
triple radiator up top I'm surprised I
haven't done it yet especially to
compete with the the Swift X h220 and
the they have a triple radiator version
of all in like sealed not sealed kit but
a very easily to assemble kit so I'm
surprised I haven't done it yet gosta
wet my whistle yeah that's how i whistle
i whistle don't judge me what does the
fan what does fan hysteria sis do an
EVGA precision x4 the graphics GTX
graphics cards I tried to figure it out
just can't sure I don't use the EVGA
precision I am big fan of msi
afterburner I think has steris asst I
have no idea it sounds like it would be
some sort of a different type of a
ramping profile not even sure Brian
Green with says you do have 64 64 bit
version of Windows ok there's then the
only other thing I can think of is that
one of your ram sticks may have maybe
failed your ram slot may have a math
problem that's all I can think of
honestly my dog is trying to kill
something fave my favorite video game of
all time oh boy that's a hard uh you
know I had this game I played when I was
a kid and it was called aces over the
Pacific and then there was another
version of it called aces over Europe
and it was a it was a combat simulator
World War two flying combat simulator I
played that out of that when I was
a kid I still I think would be my
favorite game of all time I have so much
pumped that game and if you guys see
back to see me on battlefield you know I
really like to fly so that shouldn't
come on it's too much of a surprise and
take 95 for that 7970 run of the 500
watt psu I think 550 is recommended
minimum so you might have a problem with
that just sayin polymorph an IT jobs
scarce in general uh you know in my area
right
there are more people looking for IT
jobs than there are jobs so it went from
being a very highly needed / profession
to being over saturated just kind of
like what happened with nursing back in
like the 90s and the early 2000s as
everyone says he were the other we were
shortage of nurses everyone go to
nursing school so everyone went to
nursing school now guess what for your
nourish you have a hell of a time
finding a job it's that way in my area
however our corporate are no I shouldn't
say corporate I worked with a corporate
headquarters of my company but we our
main office for RIT development is out
in Cambridge Massachusetts which is
right across the river from Boston and
in Cambridge you have MIT you have the
which is the massachusetts institute of
technology you have Harvard you have in
that general area to you have Boston
University at Northwestern they're all
have very strong IT and programming
programs especially MIT in fact our
office is practically on the campus of
MIT and there are not enough jobs I take
the back there are not enough people
applying for the jobs because that is
like the technology central of America
and in fact a lot of the world there are
not enough people applying for jobs and
and that is that we've been trying to
hire out there for months and nobody's
been it's not that nobody's been a like
qualified but we haven't had enough
people applying to find the right person
that's qualified you know we're not
going to just hire anyone that applies
so looks like Facebook just blew up and
puked all over the place so I'm gonna go
check facebook real quick cuz I don't
want to leave anybody out and I always
get people accusing me of leaving people
out okay chris says do you really need
anything higher than 660 Ti I mean
everything plays fine on your LG TV
55-inch hundred twenty Hertz 3d piece of
 since I refuse to use a computer
monitors granted some people say using a
TV monitor as a bad thing such as I see
no difference since you love playing
games in 3d at times but it is even
worth the time to try and get a 670 I
already have a
770 k 8 gigs of ram you currently have a
660 Ti it's burnt out you went back to
using a 560 TI you just want to see if
you just get 70 or stay with a 660 ti no
games like blah blah blah okay the
reason why no games really black no
blames really glad what the 660 Ti is
because you're still running at 1080p
it's not very super resolution the 660
ti would should be just fine it's got
quite a bit of cuda cores everything and
it is spec-wise is actually better than
the gtx 580 which was the flagship for
the last series you're more that you're
more than fine i bought the 680 because
i read more than one monitor and there's
times i have videos going on one screen
and i have i'm playing you know games
like battlefield 3 completely maxed out
on the other screen so it's usable but a
lot of people think that hooking a
computer up to a TV is bad the TV is
going to display what's being output by
the graphics card the TV has no bearing
on the load of the graphics card only if
you were to up the resolution let's say
you got a 4k TV yeah you know you
wouldn't even be able to pump up the
graphics card to that resolution unless
you had like a 1600 p monitor you're not
you're not stressing that graphics card
at all so but if you got the 670 you
could theoretically be a you know future
proof for a few more months I guess
whatever sideways 0011 wants to know how
the gun video go which gun video I I'm
going shooting sunday not today so if
you're talking about the video of me
shoot guns it's gonna be on Sunday
zombie unicorn wants to know if I am
avoiding him the answer is yes I am
always avoiding you have I done any pen
testing any pen testing I have no idea
what that is you know the other that was
by Robert Johnstone you're gonna have to
fill me in on that one my friend with
the update pc ps4 vs gaming pc how about
we all get our hands on a ps4 first and
determine whether
not it's worth comparing can't compare
something before it's in my hands you
want to make tech videos any advice yeah
make them good Eric there's nothing
there's nothing more difficult in my
opinion then taking a boring topic like
technology and computers and trying to
make it interesting I frankly have
absolutely no Reno idea why any of you
people watch me you guys are all crazy
guys are all nuts but you do it so yeah
there's some Twitter questions 7
gourment 100 once again 780 or 7870 vs.
660 if we're talking about the non TI
660 i would recommend the 7870 if you're
doing anything that uses the cuda
rendering like Sony Vegas or any that
like non cs6 adobe like CS 5.5 or older
then I would go to the nvidia eric
Mollenhauer wants to know what could
make your laptop freeze every couple of
seconds in the game like diablo 3 but
runs flawless on a game like battlefield
3 on ultra games are very hit and miss
with the freezing so you're confused
sounds like drivers to me I would
download a program called driver sweeper
draw a lot of people don't know that
when you when you update your drivers if
you just install them over the top of
your existing driver sometimes it can
cause some really interesting problems
so whenever you update a driver in my
opinion in my what what I do with my
practice is I take driver sweeper I
remove all drivers and all remnants of
existing drivers that you're going to
update reboot so that windows like if
you're doing graphics card when you
reboot you're going to get that nasty
like 680 by 400 resolution you know
where the icons are like that big and
then you reinstall your drivers over a
fresh install and that fixes a lot of
problems I would do that first I'm
scrolling down here to find what you
guys I'm cuz you know you guys have so
many comments it's hard to read and then
you get mad at me and you want to shoot
me with my own gun
sat night speaks good part more fan says
wicked is experienced something that
interviews wicked I don't I don't know
what I think you had a stroke I don't
know that means it's experience
something that interview interviewers
look for what if you have no experience
plus if you wanted to get into the IT
field anywhere in IT where should what
should you do for work experience you
need to be going to school and I've said
it before and other streams and and when
people have asked this question look for
internships unpaid internships you can
usually do them while you're going to
school a lot of schools if you do an
internship thats related to your field
of studies will give you school credit
towards what you learn in your
internship in fact the person who like
your boss at the intern get the
paperwork you can fill out and then they
will give you they will apply school
credits at least here they do I
definitely recommend that our company
hires interns all the time out in the
cambridge in massachusetts area so
buttocks that's how you get experience
while you're going to school that way
when you come out of school you not only
have a degree or certificates or
whatever it may be that says you can do
this you also have the work experience
that says that you can do it i'm very
lucky unique situation i managed to i
managed to get into IT working as an IT
professional and being paid way more
probably than anyone else who I hadn't
already proven myself with would pay me
because I have I do not have an IT
degree I do not have a computer science
degree I'm 100-percent self-taught but
I've been you know I've been doing this
sort of stuff since I was my daughter's
age and she's turning 4 I mean I was 3
the first time I ever was dealing with
syntax errors on the Commodore 64 and it
just always made sense to me my brain
just always comprehended computers and
so by the time I was you know in my
mid-20s I was already I already knew so
much more than anybody who was fresh out
of school had no work experience and
even now there's still times where I
know more than people who have been
doing it for a long long time I'm not
like floating my own boat here but it's
just I I'm lucky because I was met I
managed to do that and it's almost
impossible to get into any sort of IT
professional about having any sort of a
degree that says you can do it
fortunately now I've got the work
history to go along with it and so I've
got what's more valuable than a degree
but you know again it's still hard to
get your foot in the door without it
catch 22 and I'm just got really lucky
wwo buck whoa whoa buck whoa whoa buck
says you always find a text an issue on
large screen TVs it always looks blurry
even when the best smart TVs yes because
they're still 1080p and in order to get
1080p resolution on a 55 inch or 60 inch
or an 80-inch why TV is you make the
pixels bigger by doing that text it's
the first thing that takes a hit when it
comes to the large format so that's why
I don't like gaming on a TV that's why i
had my 32 inch TV that's sitting right
over there as I monitor and end up
putting it over there and using it as a
TV in buying the 27-inch the 27 inches
as big as i'll go at 1080p resolution
you also asked what webcam am I using
logitech yes it is the Logitech c920
amazing camera amazing video quality but
horrible horrible mic quality I don't
even know why has a mic on its garbage
what is the GPU the ps4 I don't know
I've honestly not really cared to look I
don't I I don't get off on the whole
press release and all that crap I don't
care about that sort of stuff I care
more about real world the way things
work in the real world so what I do is I
just I wait until you get my hands on in
fact I have I know several people who
are buying ps4 ism they've already told
me hey Jay when would I get my ps4 you
want to do a video do you do it do it
I'm like well and inside I'm really
going gay something I get to do that's
gonna get a lot of hits and a lot of
views I don't have to pay for it on the
outside of going well you know I don't
have a lot of time um
I I'll try and fit it in and I'm really
going yay another video I get to do so
yeah I've got more tweeters some more
tweeter water's coming in here Austin
messenger is that your is that really
your name is your name really messenger
so when they say don't shoot the
messenger are they talking about you
anyway hey quick question i'm running 16
gigs of ram water-cooled gtx 560ti with
an i5 processor and 500 watt should you
upgrade said you're running an i5 which
I five is an i5 like a 720 is it like a
2500 k is it like a 2300 k is it a or
2350 wherever it was is it a 3570k what
kind of processor but i do think you
should upgrade that 650 TI i'm not a fan
of the 650 TI or non TI they barely pull
our weight there's specs on them i don't
know there's I know that nvidia has to
make entry level graphics cards but and
people I know who have them have had no
problems with them I'm just so freaking
spoiled by my 680 I couldn't do it the
660 ti i think is the lowest i would go
and even then i personally want two of
them Jace thinks we're crazy unsub woody
woody but your name's not woody it's the
almighty kim pc game is making a
comeback yeah as long as the a doesn't
come in and it all up like always
now that the EA CEO realizes that he's a
douchebag and is like single-handedly
been ruining gaming specifically pc
gaming maybe we can make a future for
ourselves holy crap to take a company
like Maxis and they make them look like
garbage they make they made me hate dice
yeah I played pulse no I have not played
pulse sorry I just didn't get to play
much games in fact i would i instead of
doing this live stream i was thinking
livestream gaming livestream gaming well
i decided i want to do the live stream
so here we are today talking to you guys
you guys are hanging out here with me in
my office my my
golf clubs right there haven't been used
in like a year mm-hmm read any good
books lately oh there's so many things I
want to do that enough time for I want
to go shooting when I played my RC car I
want to play video games I want to you
know hang out with my daughter I've got
work I want to you know do things with
the life I would love I am trying to
read this book right now called now know
your strengths and I need my wife gets
onto me at night she's like instead of
playing man on your computer and playing
with your RC car why don't you come and
read your book and I'm like I know no
one that I don't but that's a really
good book so far from what I've read of
it spectre-2 47 says thinking of
upgrading your GPU should you get a 680
or wait to the 700 series I think we're
still going to be I don't think we're
going to see any 700 series stuff until
at least q3 of this year so another six
months well could be as early as three
months I'm thinking august-september ish
so you could potentially have another
six months but the bottom line is
anything you buy today is still going to
be good through the next series I rarely
ever upgrade from serious to series i
just happen to go from a 582 a 680 this
time I think anything you buy today 680
is going to be perfectly fine not to
mention when the new series comes out is
680 prices are going to drop quite a bit
and so you could just throw another one
in there if your power if your graphics
card or your power supply can handle it
uh have i heard about natural selection
2 i've heard about it I don't know
anything about it Steven ma barbaric lo
barroco Barlow anyone else having the
sound out of sync it might be the camera
might be slightly out of sync it happens
with YouTube only like when I'm
streaming to twitch it's perfectly
synced when i stream to youtube it's out
of sync so I don't know she into putting
says you're late yeah I'm actually
ending the stream here in about seven
minutes so you're very late you're very
very late and if as long as you're not a
girl that's probably a good thing
ready player one Duke awesome book
anyone else at okay have I heard about
Nash okay I think I'm all caught up on
the comments is that possible maybe I
just need to hit refresh and then I'll
become depressed because i'll be like 82
behind oh yeah way behind holy crap holy
crap son goku goku who says if your
channel gets really big which i think
might happen well I dumped my job never
but I wouldn't mind letting my wife quit
her job I would never put the security
of my family and my daughter and my wife
and my house and my cars in the hands of
Google because any time they could say
hey this partner thing you know we don't
really like the way it works anymore so
we're not gonna pay you guys anymore and
they could do at any time in fact the
whole partnership thing is technically
what they consider like in a beta um you
know it's been a couple of years now
they don't they still consider it like a
testing phase believe it or not but no I
would never quit my job for YouTube
unless like something extremely major
happened which I highly doubt but i
would i would allow my wife to quit her
job and what's funny is the madam they
met have you know the little bit of
money that i am making on youtube right
now is paying quite a few bills a month
so it's getting there and that would be
awesome oh I could quit her job and do
something she loves doing rather than
something she has to do although I kind
of like my wife having a job where she
does cuz she she works at a company that
fabricates stuff so she like it's like
my metal dealer I've got heck you can
see like right there I've got some sheet
metal sitting right there against the
and some some grill material there so
the grills for my computer and the sheet
metal's from my RC car and so it's nice
that she works at a place like that
where she can get me do hookups okay mr.
Jesse 451 says you have a GTX 656 TTI if
you add your old gtx 260 has a secondary
card for physics oh should you or to run
your second monitor on well and well you
notice the difference or should you even
bother if you're just running a second
monitor for a monitor like a desktop
while you're gaming it won't put any
strain on the 560 you could put the 260
in there with physics and five
CTI is your gaming it would help on
games that use a lot of physics like
I'll be honest I don't even know if
pineapple 3 has physics enabled but bad
Borderlands 2 and stuff like that I
guess would work ah Z 1 2 3 2 1 says
what do I prefer for budget PC
secondhand gain word gtx580 never even
heard of game word three gigabyte or
asus gtx 660 i would go with the 580
instead of the 660 however if it was a
660 ti I would get that you already have
an asus p5b motherboard intel quad core
2 quad 6600 well that 6600 is sure
certainly showing its age more than you
may realize so you might want to
consider getting a new motherboard and
processor take that much now woo woo 10
680 and by the way guys getting your
questions generated end the stream here
so where this is going to be kind of
like boogies lightning round only the
right no Thunderdome I saw today that in
the news that YouTube is considering
charging viewers to watch certain
channels I know it would only affect
some channels but what are you yeah
they're like a premium channel Lamarr
Wilson was talking about that a few
weeks back it would be certain channels
where the subscription itself is you
would pay for to see the content where
it would be put on by like real networks
sort of thing so I don't know I mean he
didn't have good things to say about it
and I definitely don't blame him on that
and it changed my sorry this is like
really bright whoa stark okay um he so
that that was supposedly the concept
behind that but he also had a little bit
of a rant that I totally agree with
about the word subscription for YouTube
channels that if now you're going to
have channels that you have to pay for
thats a subscription that might make
people stop clicking subscribe because
they think they're going to get charged
or have to pay sort of thing so he's
like change it to like twitter follow or
something like that you know and then
have subscriptions that you have to pay
for which i think makes perfect sense
but I don't I don't think it'll work out
I think YouTube will realize that you're
already making money off the ad so I'm
try and charge channels to or charge for
certain channels I don't think it's
going to work ok a couple more questions
here you have a razer naga and black
widow you love them both add the Black
Widow yeah i wish i had the stealth but
i do have the black widow ultimate and
that's why it's so loud when i'm
clicking those buttons as you can hear
right there okay is that postural of a
little sister behind me know that poster
would actually be of my daughter I don't
have a little sister I'm actually the
young one in the family and I'm turning
32 I've turned 32 years young this year
and that's my great-granddaughter right
there and her dress darn bad you to
streaming um you know I just use all
works fine yes razors bent over price I
agree I do not like the razer deathadder
mouse i have one floating around
somewhere the scroll wheels kind of
retarded on so you need to play a game
live stream with the subs yeah i was
trying to put together a battlefield
thing for i'm supposed to get a private
server it just hasn't worked out yet I
don't do any gaming on the YouTube side
just because when I do a stream gaming I
like to I like to support the the twitch
channels or the twitch crowd because
that's as you know dedicated gaming site
so I in fact I'm going to put it in the
description now I forgot to put my
twitch channel because I do have a
twitch channel in fact i was doing
twitch before YouTube I'm gonna add this
right now so you guys can all go over
and follow me on twitch that way you
guys all know when I'm streaming
gameplay because I do it from time to
time and twitch TV if you guys aren't
aware it's just it's just like YouTube
only its streaming and there if you guys
were to refresh your page the
description will update and at the very
bottom you'll see my twitch channel and
you can click on that it'll take you to
my twitch channel and then you will get
notified if you hit that follow button
