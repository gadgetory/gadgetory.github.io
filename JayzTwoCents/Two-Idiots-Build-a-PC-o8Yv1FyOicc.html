meter oh look there you are
is it gonna overlap too I always see
anything all I see is your crotch why
are you looking at my crotch why you
guys staring at me you were expecting
the video today aren't you
you're so mistaken but you re all right
here's we're gonna do today I haven't
built a computer with this guy in a
while I think he's only built had the to
hand hold this thing that's two
computers yeah but on the channel oh you
only got one in the channel right yeah
yeah channel so I figure what the heck
we got some new parts here that we've
had for a while that we need to do a
review on not really review but some
sort of content on we've got the 780 T
right there from Corsair had that for a
while we just got the new Jeep the g1
gaming Phoenix SLI okay pay for it that
boom look at that I said it looked very
tight and follow you never ones like no
looks very as mom and then AJ as mom
yeah I thought it's like titanfall - and
then he said everyone say s mom like oh
crap says the guy who plays csgo swear
does that tell you I'm too cheap for
Asimov though okay but we need parts
here so we need to grab stuff off the
shelf when you go shopping I'm just
gonna get everything off of this show
alright so we need a graphics card this
is taking way too long okay do the
water-cooled one yeah okay you would
almost think this was a gigabyte
sponsored video at the rate that you're
grabbing parts here well I said one I
said one putting the other one back
relax come down geez so let's do a stack
of parts there we got motherboard
we've got graphics card grab the x99
motherboard down there only because that
has the 5820k in it which is the only
x99 cpu I have right now it's not being
used the it's right there yeah we're
just gonna it's holding the CPU right
now so I gotcha okay we need some memory
Dominator stuff or we have to use ddr4
I'm thinking that that 32 gig not the
corsair dominator
I'm thinking the because I have another
use for that the g.skill you inventoried
it so where's the G scale
the audio I just thing about headsets
can use it yet we have to build the
system first well this is like
preemptive strike so if we get this
table we don't speak it out later
we need a cooler what do you mean is
that predator mmm-hmm or do you want to
do that keep your own custom lip cuz
there's two beans over there well I
don't have a whole lot of water cling
stuff we will do cooler laughs cuz I
don't know exactly what I want to do it
okay we need a power supply the only one
down there unless you want to go like
extreme stupid overkill with the V 1200
I think we should do the V 1200 just cuz
people will be mad like you don't need
1200 watts
yes we do yeah yeah we do an interesting
story about this guy here you might
notice that that is the Platinum one
right if you look down there I've got
the same box that's a gold version that
was actually a prototype Oh motherboard
GPU CPU Ram case power supply what else
we need oh we need some hard drives
don't worry
well we have stacks on stacks of hard
drives I mean you want something those
are hard drives though we don't want
hard drives mark I started right than
that harder drives yeah
you mean hard is in solid yeah how about
you grab that that 240 gig for the for
the OS drive oh it you did my own Tory
you should know where that I think I
remember what the T was it's a it's a
hyper X oh no that's my that's my SSD
legs there it is is it in there
yeah here's what we'll do since this is
kind of an older drive it's a three
gigabit per second made in 2011 it's
five years old it's kind of a junk drive
go ahead and put that one aside we'll
just put the SSD in there for now and
because that's all we need to really get
the system working and you can add a
hard drive pretty easily later so let's
do this
that's about all we need for now so we
need to dig out this way cooler
properties do that the end because I
just I can't decipher one do custom loop
yet or a predator let's do
rock-paper-scissors for it I can't I'll
drop my camera I'll hold it and I'll
hold the other pissed you so those are
the parts that we chose right there not
bad for a
just going shopping inside the shop huh
yeah yeah you guys can tell this is all
about coconut monkey and we are a
limited time I need you to actually like
not be afraid like it's that touching
stuff and I'm really gentle yo sorry put
it on the floor be easier to take it out
Oh some manual fell out hope you don't
need that oh when your case comes
with its own little canvas bag that's
why we can have nice things
well I kind of suck sighted I had asked
for the white one and they sent me the
the black one it's kind of neat looking
though yeah I personally just don't like
black cases cuz they're dust magnets it
looks like it looks like that it does it
looks like my start stuff but no my car
is your people yeah all right get it
ready did you just shock you yeah you
ready to peel it 46 minutes later he's
still cooling tape oh yeah look at one
part when I make this morning all that
glass oh my god I still think that the
white wooden black wouldn't look better
guys so now we need to put with a board
uh technically let's take all the things
off the desk we don't need you already
broke it I fixed it fix it this is the
be open this is all like jammed in here
like this they must have been in a hurry
to get rid of this easy this one was
built on a Friday like hell yeah we got
overstock we'll send you one right away
who's calling me kind of feel like the
classified would might probably look
better in here if we go for this whole
blacked out thing but it's windowed so
we really want this to shine
yeah it does have a ton of LEDs on
it yeah this one where it's gonna be
sweet it's gonna be dope yeah did I do
it right today that I usually a young
guy slogan I'm finished her I'm not
young anymore nope
have you ever put in x99 CPU in before
no there's first time for everything
then undo the little latches alright
you're whistling gameofthrones a lot I'm
sorry did you see last night's episode
of popular reality TV q okay leave it
there don't take it out yet go ahead and
open up that one I like the anodized
black on can you see all that you see
all the LED strips next to the RAM yeah
now take out that CPU and you see how
that that dot is in the corner
yeah like facing downward
that dots gonna be in the same corner on
this CPU on this motherboard here don't
hold it above the socket like that if
you drop it you're gonna break the pins
okay there now go ahead and drop it in
there some of the tabs line up you're so
gentle it's cute
all right now fold the cover over and
then do the latches in the right order
see you missed you missed a little tab
there's a tab the back you see it just
uh you know put that one down then the
other one down and it will pop the cover
off on its own will be cover yeah all
done thanks for watching guys we'll see
you know
no wait never quite done not quite done
yet hey come back you have to help me
finish the computer no I don't know what
I'm gonna do now oh that's a really
pretty motherboard yeah that's why I
wanted to build something with it I felt
it was a shame to have it just sit there
that's okay because I have the MSI
god-like carbon Siri place already
she is it's over there in a box still
okay wait wait you forgot the IO shield
yeah haha you pass by that's haha oh
it's sealed still you use the buying
stuff where it's just like a metal piece
that tries to cut your finger off shut
up they're all that room above it for
activities you put a fat radiator in
there yeah
good a fat radiator in there so how they
can be terribly bleeding's one tiny
scoop boy I'd be screwed if you watch
Sesame Street before you came over
maybe is it my fault you had Mickey
Mouse code you can't do that that's
gonna introduce static electricity in
here no so what comes in the box over
there lots of cool so you need to
know you get this lovely plaque to put
on your door
or we said it should go in the bathroom
yeah so if you feel at risk a you just
like go put it on the enter when you're
actually in yeah maybe full dump in
there yeah I think I'm really excited
about these they're like clear chrome go
along with the rest of those you get
some labeling stickers for your cables
it's a velcro strap yeah a velcro strap
for cable ties yeah that's pretty sweet
gigabyte you skipped over something
really important sir the manual no this
is a wireless motherboard sure the
antennas oh oh right right
take this out and Tanner's it's pretty
sweet and you get an SLI bridge for
asipi sloppy ones wait and they get a
three three-way
please dude yeah I'm surprised there's
no four-way SLI one yeah but you can go
up to three-way you know might as well
go ahead and put into memories the
memories yeah those were the original
skunkworks RAM sticks remember how I
didn't like the sticker yeah did you
line up the notch yeah here your line up
a notch it's lined up alright cuz you
don't to a clicks there you go okay
man that was dangerous that's awfully
close to like that panel on the back
it's not plastic the plastic panels in
the hurricane you are such an idiot so
are you I know I wonder if I get my own
reddit thread after this I guess we're
gonna remove the rear 140 fan because
he's going to plug in his oh wow that
smells bad sorry thanks for sharing
sharing is caring my nose oh my god I
need a break after that oh that's all
you man you have it can you just get
like one of your wife's oils in here
please the good smelling stuff like the
one in the bathroom or the lemon scented
one please
you know I'll just text her I decided
I'll go ahead and suffer with you really
you just let it fall forward wrong with
you reddit thread it's kind of cool it's
gonna match a little bit even though
it's orange on the bottom it's the 980ti
extreme extreme extrude this is the one
I broke the fan on so I had to put
another fan on there but I put another
high static pressure fans were good so
we decided to ditch the extreme and go
with a blower style cooler because the
fep tubing is just so stiff it's so
stiff it just looks terrible no matter
what we do I hate fep tubing so much
please for the love of God companies use
rubber maybe is this fractal design fan
here actually cuz it's white and I think
it looks better than the grey fan that
comes with the Corsair but case agreed
they give you LED fans for the front
then they give you that ugly-ass gray
fan for the rear that's really
unfortunate so I think that this looks
better overall
don't you yeah people get mad when you
flip fans like that when they're plugged
into the motherboard cuz of the RPM why
I have never once had a problem thinking
I also build my computers on carpet most
of the time
that's the one we chose to go with after
all the g1 gaming for the d1 gaming
board
yeah doesn't any yellow or orange
accents but that's okay yeah it's kind
of cool-looking anyway it is pretty
cool-looking I remember this one I kind
of wish I had two of those
now screw it down down right there okay
we need a physics card I'm thinking
Titan you have like four three of them
are in skunkworks right now but I have
four they're old and slow now you're old
and slow okay
Oh CS what'd you get yeah would you drop
it scared no it's right here okay we
need the power supply it's so much more
power than we need that's exactly why we
need it by the power of Grayskull green
Odin's beard yeah for real oh look at
this
oh it's more canvas bags play putting
fan upper fan down gun down yeah you
it's gonna probably sit on a desk
so pen down yeah I don't put any my
systems on carpet even if I did this
one's got a lot of space for the fan on
the bottom such a good song totally
recording yeah so that jumble of wires
is next oh boy
it's front panel connectors USB audio
for like headphones all I see you your
hand my belly gurgle that's a bad sign
so you're lucky this motherboard
actually has two USB 3.0 headers one
there and one there I kind of wish they
put them next to each other but that
means both of these USB 3.0 head that
you got oh there's only one huh yeah and
I thought you had to cuz it's right here
so the pop those front panel connectors
though as we found out we're like it
looked like there was a lot it has
built-in fan controllers so like all
this crap right here
the plus or minus my god what the cool
thing about the back of the case is you
can be as messy as you want with the
wiring no one will know you're having
too much fun over there aren't you yeah
yeah I like these things it's not gonna
show so the way the SSD mails are kind
of cool put up top it literally just
slides in the only it sucks is the way
that it is because of the way the cables
have to go it's upside down taking
longer to do this cable management that
is to build a whole PC I bet that's how
it was what most I that
I need zip ties all them power cables
they have short ones and it's what I
walked my head into that I hate that was
my head right there why would you do so
I'm tall no no no plugging in the pair
slackers
okay closest to this autofocus is so
confused doesn't know what to do
I mean your big old head gets in the way
sorry so just push it in you just being
a baby
it's not good in the bottom one this one
yeah I thought it was one of those
things that you just plug in wherever
but oh my god
yeah plug it in wherever watch
everything blow up oh are you done yet
shut up are you done yet
shut up don't we meet over there don't
make me come over there I dare you
you're not very intimidating okay I'm
trying to work on the baby it doesn't
really work out in my favor it's like oh
he's so me your war face
wasting away
isn't that sailing away well today I'm
currently wasting away waiting for you
to get these damn cables you want to
pull it through you want to give me a
hand
no huh no this is just a demo build why
are you getting on you know because you
gotta build it anyways as well put your
effort into it welcome to molex molex
suck you can see the
no those don't spread out like that make
sure you just have it upside down it
wouldn't be two idiots if you could
install them bollocks right so for the
cooler I think I've decided to go ahead
and donate to this bill because again
you know what this this bill does just
because I felt like billion computer
last week I was like hey couldn't money
went clover can we build a computer and
he was like sure I decided was it going
to put the h2 20 X in here I'm gonna go
ahead and need you to come into work on
Sunday too but actually try to get you
over Sunday you're like I got I got
family obligations and dinner
it's so pretty and it's gonna light up
white we've got the white insert in
there I think the blue would have
clashed just a little bit just plug that
one into CPU yeah wait that's CPU fan
two optional well plug it into the
meeting one right there
we're gonna go like this I'd everyone
talk about the way I'm doing it wrong
remember guys this is a 59 or uh 5820k
it's bigger you want to tighten these
down in like a cross pattern I could do
it in wheels yeah I can't integrated all
right so you're back up now you're up
what do I do
so we built the system here that has a
water cooling system that lights up a
graphics card that lights up a
motherboard that lights up all that
light chase fans that light up any day
you'll get the ramp up in any day I
figured yeah you're probably just gonna
plug those fans into the fan controller
right whoa jeez yeah
are they gonna reach they might not that
way all the fans now will be controlled
by that switch all right so let's go and
move the s2 or the nano s bill and let's
plug it in over here and let's see if it
boots up are you scared yeah because if
you broke anything I'm gonna have to
charge you for it okay this is a
wireless but it's two gigabit ports Wow
you could actually have two gigabit
throughput if you have to eat your Nets
plugged into it powering on look at all
those lights whoo those lights don't
name it squishy and it
be mine yay yeah did you do that partly
that plugging in there on display for it
what did you do that this report plug-in
around you broke it
you've got to love new system boots I'm
sitting here looking at it going what
the heck
and it sat there idle for like a minute
and then it was like oh hey by the way I
work yeah so what do you think do you
think it's got red LEDs on the front
white LEDs on the graphics card white
LEDs on the pump we can exchange the you
can change the motherboard LEDs yeah
right top fans are going damn sweet what
do you think I approve your proof well
I'm glad because it's your birthday
present oh you're serious I'm dead
serious dude
thanks yeah he seriously didn't know
that was coming
oh my god that's awesome thanks I'm just
gonna be the camera pointing at you
occupied Lina can we keep it here since
I'm watching your house for a while
that's a skunkworks eli can you leave it
here that's why I was like if it broke
all on you one thing you guys don't know
about coconut monkey he's going to
University of Redlands and he's a
business major and an art major and he's
been telling me he wants to build a
computer because he wants to do all of
his editing and stuff and his current
computers a little bit on the older side
and he's like I don't have the money to
build a new computer but I want to but I
also want to do car parts and stuff I
want him to do car parts so I took care
of the computer part so anyway there you
go
unfortunately he's gonna have to buy a
hard drive I guess I have failed I have
failed him for my guys totally fail to
be surprised you nailed me thank you got
any words to say before we go alright oh
my god two idiots build a computer for
an idiot yeah alright guys thanks for
watching we'll see in the next it itself
maybe maybe we'll get you to do a video
about benchmarking it and see how it
does yeah alright guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
