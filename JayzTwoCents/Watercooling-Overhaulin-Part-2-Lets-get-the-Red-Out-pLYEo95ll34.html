project blank slate I think that's what
some people came up with this name of
project blank slate if you guys remember
in the last video we kind of did the
bleeding of the system and just kind of
talked about we're going to be doing now
today's video I'm not going to really do
any acrylic bending today so if you guys
are hoping to see that I'm sorry you'll
just have to wait till next week to see
those videos but I'm going to be trying
to attempt getting rid of all the red in
this system in a creative way that's not
going to look horrible but it's also
reversible so that it's not permanently
black or blue or whatever we're going to
do I'm also going to start by painting
the fan rings black today I'm not going
to do blue two reasons for that
reason number one being the coolant
color is going to be different than the
fan ring color that comes with the
corsair fans they're different shades of
blue entirely reason number two being we
don't have those rings anymore i built
this system in March of last year and I
get rid of all my extra rings when I'm
not using them which I guess in
hindsight might have been useful to keep
them but hey I digress
so let's go ahead and get in here and
start figure out what we're going to do
to get rid of some of this red okay so
here it is right here and obviously we
take all the red rings and get those
painted to black but the red I start to
deal with this right there on the
motherboard the SATA plug spots and then
the PCI Express slots and stuff so I've
kind of got an idea of what I want to do
and this is what it is I still have
quite a bit of this carbon fiber vinyl
revine 'el it's actually a simulated
carbon fiber wrap from 3m so I'm
thinking to incorporate that into there
as much as I can to try and get rid of
some of that red so I'm going to take
the graphics cards back out and start
brainstorming on that but first I'm
going to paint the ring so those can dry
while I'm doing all of that alright so
here's some of the materials measuring
tape scissors carbon fiber wrap
and there's what it sort of looks like
on there this is a focus so I mean it
doesn't look perfect but then again it's
not going to really be too visible you
know the other graphics cards on top so
I'm just going to do the other two now
make the slit down the middle so the
graphics cards can go in and out within
without interfering got to do the same
thing over there on the SATA and then
I've got to do it up there on the block
the BRM blob I think it'll look pretty
good at that point but we enough read
taken out to where it's not going to be
distracting all right there we go it's
about as red free as I'm going to be
able to get it I still have to do the
heat shrink on the pump there but I've
got carbon fiber wrap on all the slots
so as you can see that bottom slot is no
longer red that's carbon fiber carbon
fiber over the heat seat or the yeah the
heatsink right there I just moved the
RAM from the black channels to the red
Channel so as you can see there's still
a little red there but I'm just going to
leave it the way it is and it's not
perfect by any means I'm the one on the
heatsink I'm not a huge fan of but it's
better than painting it and I think it
actually turned out pretty good full
systems really starting to look sleek
and I think once the blue is in there
it's going to look really really good so
yeah
it's a starting to really come together
alright since I was at it making all the
colors match I can't do anything about
the copper blocks I went with copper
instead of nickel when I did this system
because these blocks were during the era
when ek was having its nickel plating
issues of flaking so I don't want any
chances of that and a customer build so
I would nook nickel block so I can't or
a copper block so I can't do anything
about the copper I want to paint it I
don't want to stick anything to it
getting texted like crazy right now but
I also took care of the power supply
while I was at it some guy said the
power supply sticks out like a sore
thumb now and I still have to heat
shrink that obviously but now the power
supply as you can see is kind of blacked
out with carbon fiber 3m dye knock and
the red is really starting to get out of
the system nicely so I think what I'm
gonna do next is I'm going to go ahead
and carbon-fiber the pump while I'm at
it might as well I mean shoot I'm not
going to be doing any bending tonight so
to be easy enough a nice simple build
blog but I think it's really
starting to look nice I mean remember
guys this this build was already put
together this was nothing but a
beautifying project and this customer
pays well so he gets a lot of my
attention so yeah this is a purely a
beautifying project and I figure we'll
just go ahead and well make it pretty
okay so there's our carbon fiber on the
pump carbon fiber on the PSU all the
carbon fiber covering up the red now
we're going to tackle that guy and I
figured instead of just showing you guys
like before and after I figure I'll just
go and make this like a quick little
tutorial built in with this build blog
so it's kind of like a vlog Oriole of
Liguria l-- get it alright so in order
to get this changed over to the right
color there's a couple of things you're
going to need first things you're going
to need are your sleeping tools now I
have all those guys right here and this
is actually the molex removal tool right
here now what you need to also do is
remember the position of the pins so
you've got red which is your 12 volt on
the outside and you have got your black
which is your ground next to that but
you need to remember the orientation so
the way I'm going to remember this
pretty much is just that if I have the
flat side down it goes red than black so
you just take this pin out tool it's
quite literally nothing more than just a
tube that fits right over the Mullis on
the inside right there so you just take
this you push it down in there and the
molex will quite literally just pop on
out there once you get it in there the
right way don't you know I don't know
how I can be able to see that but the
pins in there are actually jacked up so
the tool is not working right now so
fortunately I have the materials to
repin this now the pins are jacked up
they're actually the tabs are bent back
so when you stick with tube in there
it doesn't actually decompress those or
compress them so that I can pull the
pins out so I'm just going to cut off
this end and I'm just going to go ahead
and make a new molex plug out of this I
guess we'll go ahead and do a quick
little tutorial on how to make that was
intense anticipating that but I guess
we'll do it now okay now before I
actually do the new ends I need to go
ahead and get this red taken care of now
instead of trying to get this heat
shrink off which is already nice and
tight on there I'm just going to put new
heat shrink over the top of that because
everyone's sleep instead of using my
loud heat gun I'm just going to I'm just
going to use the lighter method which
works just fine with with heat shrink
by travelpod member
all right so here we go
it's all black now and as you may have
noticed the lighter kept blowing out on
me and that's because I have the fan on
me it's way too hot to turn it off so I
just dealt with it but there now we no
longer have any red heat shrink tubing
on there so let's go ahead and get this
pinned out and fixed all right so first
things first is you need to take a piece
of your heat shrink tube and push it up
out of the way because if you put the
end on first you won't be able to
actually get your heat shrink tube on
you'll get your to bond so finagle that
up and out of the way like so that one's
really tight I went with a fatter tube
down here because I was going over the
top of the red tube so I had to use a
fatter one but anyway that one's up and
out of the way you're going to have to
have a set of tools you need to have the
end here for the molex I've actually got
it off-camera so there it is right there
and you've got to have two of the
specific pins for the female side
they're different pins for male and
female so you got to break off a couple
of those I need two of them and just
kind of work that back and forth
remember like I said you need to pay
attention to the pin out so for me
buttface this flat side down red is on
the left and black is on the right now
you've got to prepare your wire here so
you need to strip off about a quarter of
an inch per side twist that up that way
it's all nice and tight trim it down to
about the right size which is going to
be a little less than a quarter inch
don't have the exact science down on
that now what you're going to do is
you're going to get it ready with your
crimper here you've got to have your
crimpers there's just a specific tool
for this if you don't have your crimpers
you cannot do the job properly
don't even try so you've got to line it
up properly along on the teeth it's
actually a fat side a small side now
once you get it lined up in there if you
just kind of get it till it clicks twice
it'll hold it in there you see it
actually holds it in there but then it
gives you an opening in there
so as you can see right there it's
actually open just enough for us to
actually put our wire in there and then
we can crimp it down
and just like that there is our ground
perfectly on there hopefully it's in
focus now we just rinse and repeat for
the 12-volt side and then we're good to
go so as I said get a lighter that's a
butane left in it and crimp her down
shrink her down as you can see my fan is
blowing it out again
all right and our our pump is now done I
hope you guys have enjoyed today's
lesson use it properly do it good yeah
all right so here's the black rings
right here just well painted black it's
actually painted now people always ask
me this I don't understand why I get
asked so many times what would you use
the paint it
well paint I mean technically this is
black primer but any paint will do guys
it's plastic it's a rough finish
everything will stick to it but I got to
ask myself I don't understand why
Corsair never included black white over
black never made sense I mean it's such
a staple color so many things would need
black and why they never included it is
just beyond me I mean there's a there's
a black one right there as you can see
and I think it looks great you know in a
build like this if you were doing some
kind of a stealth build what good is
white red or blue gonna do you so anyway
there's our black rings we'll get those
installed get them in the bottom red and
then I think we're going to be done for
tonight I might just do the tube that
goes across from the top of the
reservoir to the radiator and then we'll
call it we'll call it done for the day
I just want to point out one other
reason why I went with primer on the
fans instead of paint as you can see
because the fans are plastic the primers
texture and color matched a little
better than black paint would have in
fact you can you can kind of see you
have sort of a hard time figuring out
where the actual ring starts and stops
which is exactly what we wanted oh and
also to some people here may be saying
why are you using AF fans on a radiator
stupid well we've already gone over this
they're gonna make very little
difference in this case especially with
these radiators and the split fins very
low restriction but yeah go ahead and go
ahead and keep the AF versus SP battle
going guys I'll eat my popcorn why you
guys argue over it all right we're done
for the night
I ended up not doing the top tube up
there I'm just going to save all that
for another day when I do all of the
other tubing so if you guys are looking
forward to that sorry I also I'm going
to make the same rings out of carbon
fiber for those fans and the center
portion of that fan just like I did for
skunk
works that way is just a little bit more
stealthy and that's pretty much where
we're going to leave it for today so as
you can see our goal is to get rid of as
much of the red as we could and I think
compared to when we started we did a
pretty damn good job one of the things I
hate most about doing this obviously is
the mess I mean I've got tools
everywhere I've got trash everywhere got
all this stuff under here to deal with
all that crap to deal with I don't I'm
kind of a messy builder so anyway guys
thanks for hanging out today I hope you
like part two of project blank slate or
Overhaulin PC overhaul and water-cooler
Overhaulin whatever going to call it and
get the heck on out of here guys as
always see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
