yep
oh my god brake pad love it
Oh
all right guys here we are over here at
chuckwalla Valley Raceway you guys were
bugging me to get the car on the track
you guys haven't really seen the car
unless you follow my social media stuff
I've had it for a year now it's kind of
sad
and yeah so anyway here it is this is my
2010 Nissan Nismo 370z it's got a lot
done to it like I'm not gonna go through
the whole mod list here I'll put a mod
list in the description
it's got cooling mods it's got a ton of
suspension mod it's got some go-fast
parts it's got a lot done to it the
point here today is to just get out on
track and let all these parts and we've
been accumulating on this car it's a
very loud I think it was a rotary goes
by its going to have some fun today what
we're doing today though is I'm not just
throwing it out on track and going I
haven't been on track in over 10 years
so what I did was I actually paid for
instruction from Stephen Doherty if you
guys don't know who he is he's one of
the GT Academy winners a professional
driver internationally known driver and
so he is going to be my instructor for
the day we're trying to see if we can
get him in the car right now to drive as
well it's kind of weird the way things
work and get him to get a feel for the
car and then we're just going to go so
it's gonna be a lot like the dirtfish
video we're literate we're just going to
go out there and see what the hell
happens
one Corvette when you're gonna give up
you let it go
there we go getting into it alright
our little or of Bieber yeah yeah
inside inside Oh
I know
but being a just pass
got the point by finally took him like
four lap yeah
Georgia didn't turn today
let's speed with the steering
Milutin don't worry about him
run the short radius just like that
let's go get you a picture into it there
you go
momentum New Roman
into into it
 also
Oh
so that was that that was my first time
taking nizzy on the track with this
setup and is Stevens right it's still
it's still a little loose and so I don't
know we're going to do a we thought we
talked about just connecting the rear
sway bar and then tightening up the
suspension again I don't know I feel
like it's predictable I kinda want to
leave the right word set but I was
worried that the suspension would be too
soft when it came to running over those
curbs
this MC a suspension literally just
sucks it up so I'm so surprised doesn't
rub tires or heat cycling we got we got
scratch pattern were putting on their
brakes are burning in nicely that nice
and even blue okay guys so this is
Steven Doherty um that name might sound
familiar if you paid attention to the GT
Academy me so real quick I want to ask
you like how did that come about so yeah
basically GT Academy is a way for Nissan
to find professional drivers who aren't
rich right right anybody with a
PlayStation Gran Turismo could basically
play Gran Turismo these were people who
had never had track experience - some of
them didn't yeah didn't and my only
track experience was racing like short
track oval tracks no circle treat like
you told me started under well a little
sort of probably front wheel drive
circle track cars yeah on pavement okay
little both but yeah so that was
basically all all the racing experience
I ever had and four hundred dollar cars
or whatever you know I mean right the
cheapest absolute cheapest form of
racing out there that you can do so so
you're one of the winners of this
competition and then you put on a racing
team yeah so they have a qualification
round where you go on your PlayStation
at home and you run the fastest lap that
you can and they take so many
like my year was 32 people out of the
whole United States Wow and they bring
us together and they put us through a
whole bunch of sim race trials and then
they took 16 from that and 16 of us went
to England where we did like a boot camp
race camp right type of thing and
basically they narrowed it down to four
people and then I won I was in the final
four and I won the race it was I had to
head race in in Rio 370 ZZZ yeah and
whoever won the race won a pro racing
contract benissa which which you were
part of yeah and you said you've driven
in the GT for net mismo yeah so we I
drove group n 370 Z's I drove GT for
370z zai drove the 370z that ran in
Continental Tire Series and right in the
states and then eventually they bumped
us to the gt3 in Europe it's funny like
you know I get all excited because I'm
like wow my car is doing so good so he
takes that he takes the car out
I let him drive the first session
because I really wanted his opinion on
the car setup and then I felt like with
him knowing the how my car drove he
could kind of tailor the instruction to
not only proper driving but also the
cars capabilities and I'm thinking that
we're just tearing it up right and I'm
literally just tunnel vision because I'm
trying to just not get carsick over
there pretty much and I asked him so
what do you think he goes well it's kind
of hard to see you have to tell when you
can't get going fast and I'm like what
make it go fast I'm about to check out
the window and but anyway so okay you
you we did three private sessions out
there today
four-and-a-half second improvement in my
times from my first session with you
which was kind of ugly and we got around
the track we did anything but it wasn't
pretty to my last session be my fastest
which is the one I actually did with
Nick in the car without you here and I
told Steve and I said I think part of
that was when he's over here giving me
instruction I find myself waiting for
his next piece of instruction rather
than driving the car so I was more
nervous going out by myself with with
Nick here then without with them without
you in the car so I was nervous but then
I just I just went to the instruction
and drove the car and that four and a
half second improvement was on the lat
session because I only gain I only only
gain point three between first and
second session and then four and a half
on the last yeah a lot of traffic in the
first two sessions - yeah and also
something to keep in mind generally the
track will always be fastest in the
morning and it is only afternoon yeah so
the track slows down in the afternoon so
your lap that was four and a half
seconds weaker might have been six and a
half yeah if you did at first sessions
right that's a that's a strong
improvement the car did really well
didn't overheat oil temp stayed well in
check even when he was driving never
went above about 250 yes yeah you start
to get you started back off around 260
or you'll start heating lit mode but man
nizzy did really well I'm really
impressed
alright so ultimately how do you think
it went then I think it went good you
did a good job you stayed on track you
had fun hmm you obviously improved
yourself quite a bit that last session
even though there weren't as many cars
as earlier I got four point buys and I
didn't have to point any one bike so I
was happy with that yeah you can you can
tell that right away if you're not
pointing people by then I kept looking
in my mirror there was no one behind me
yeah and the nice thing about coaching
too you can take this to your next car
you had a car after that right car after
that the fundamentals don't change ya
the fundamentals don't change any car
you get in could be someone else's car
mm-hmm and and the time and the money
and everything you invest in yourself
yeah
actually pays off when I'm over here
thinking like well you know you've never
driven my car but then it was apparent
after by about three or four laps as you
were kind of easing into it that you
finally were just like yeah yeah well I
was I to take it easy for your sake for
the first few laps I just like okay to
be fair yes I did
at one point we hit traffic I was like
thank God thank God because the the
passenger seat lies to you it you have
nothing to reference where the limits of
the car I have no steering wheel no
brake pedal gas pedal so I don't know
where we are in traction and from my
perspective over there every turn was
just on the edge of death but according
to Stephen we were far from it I want to
give a huge thank you to Scott not just
for towing me out today guys I said I
had a friend that was telling me I
didn't want to go to the track without a
tow vehicle because if something went
wrong and I want to be stranded
Scott works at the Fontana Nissan race
shop which is you guys have seen me plug
this shop they've done a lot of work to
my car a lot of planning with my car and
this is the face of the Fontana Nissan
race shop so it's been a year now it's
been a year journey build
his car yes sir you thought you've kind
of dealt with the bitchy side of me
you've dealt with the never you've dealt
with the indecisive side of me never um
so how do you feel about the car I mean
I know you didn't get to riding it today
but you've gotten to see us talking
about it and stuff and you can see it on
track from out here what's it what's it
like I've been watching from afar from
what I've seen I've really liked what
I've seen your driving has improved
tremendously but what I haven't seen you
can review the footage in then you tell
me later the car looks like he's been
doing great you're held together that's
the thing because like like Scott's shop
right the Fontana Nissan race shop has
done like the clutch for me they did the
brake lines and and a lot of the the
work that I just didn't want to screw up
but the suspension I took on myself you
ordered the arms and stuff for me but I
installed everything myself so a little
nerve-wracking moment going okay we're
gonna find out if I if I put this
together right you did a hell of a job
you didn't have any extra parts
nothing's come loose nothing smoking the
cars held up the entire day cools off
instantly when we do our cooldown laps
it takes forever to get up to temp so it
means it's not overheating you're you're
getting ready to go out for the last
session of the day and half the people
here at the track have already left and
you're still going so that's the
testament of the car of being built you
didn't over build the car yeah yeah you
upgraded the parts that need to be
upgraded and it works yeah it's it feels
really good that last session I was
pushing myself I'm curious as to what
the time is cuz I was I was literally
trying to drive at my limits and grant
it was nothing like Stephen Doherty
driving oh my god that was it's not
often you get to be an international Pro
driving instructor Scott also has a
channel guys so go and check out his
stuff it's the adventures of Scott I
will link it in the description of this
video he does okay so he started off as
kind of a moto vlogger guy but he's
branching out because he's really an
all-encompassing Motorsports guy he's
got a race car himself it's a b13
powered Sentra and an unlimited class
time attack car which you're gonna be
bringing out next year again hopefully
yep yep just trying to get the final
touches on it but actually a the channel
actually started off as as a motor
sports channel it was gonna follow me my
girlfriend in a racing but because we
had so many issues with the cars and
it's just been such a challenge it
morphed itself into a most motorcycle
channel right and now I'm trying to
bring it back but include both
motorcycles and cars so there'll be a
lot of variety and every week you never
know what you're gonna get this is
another side of me this is another huge
passion of mine and I put it up on the
tech channel and that's not your thing
then there's other tech videos that you
can watch but there was a lot of
Technology in this car today there in
fact I'm on the first two laps of that
last session I'm going what the hell's
going on with the car was like crap
PDC's I push the button of a god how
we're going I was trying figure out why
the car was intervening with me yeah the
way that the vehicle dynamic control in
these uh in these cars are very
conservative because they don't want you
spinning out on the street but on the
track you got to turn that off there it
is if you guys want to see more track
stuff let me know I did dirt fish which
was fun I'm telling you Jerry this is my
realm this is where I dump I'll dominate
you out here man alright guys thanks for
watching any parting words
now just watch more videos from this guy
and in him he's got some entertaining
stuff he's got a very unique style in
the way he does his videos so go and
check him out alright guys with that
it's time to go I'm gonna do whatever
the other car vlogger does I'm just
gonna cover the camera with my hand some
home now editing this video next one to
say man I had so much fun huge thank you
to everyone who was involved in this
Ponton Nissan Scott were towing me out
Nick for helping out literally being a
my camera Mac guy I did count on him for
everything and I think he nailed it he
did a good job there was like four
GoPros and an ax 33 and an Osmo so he
did a great job
Corner three Motorsports for putting on
the Nissan challenge and giving us a
place to to race each other and have fun
and of course were Stephen Doherty for
his priceless instruction which I will
be getting again in fact I'm trying to
get back out to the track now on
December 3rd only a few days away to do
it all over again I cannot wait I just
want to say - Stephen is looking for a
seat for 2017 and I really hope that
that happens he's looking for a team
because I I like the humble beginnings
that the GT Academy started where it's
not about race teams being rich and
drivers coming from the rich I like
grassroots type stuff and so I really
hope you get to see
because I'm going to force him to get me
tickets to a race nothing selfish about
that right anyway guys thanks for
watching I know it's different but this
is my life these are the things I do and
that's the point of this channel is to
share it all of you alright guys thanks
for watching see you the next one yeah
find this on yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
