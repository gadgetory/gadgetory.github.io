in the description to learn more hey
what's up guys Jays two cents here in
Little J and I've been talking about on
Twitter for a while now that I'm going
to build her a new computer and you tell
them why because my my this computer was
my old computer and now when I turned it
on it takes like five minutes to load on
and now that's really slow and I had it
for a long time me and my dad are gonna
build a new computer that's right this
one right here I don't even remember all
the specs to be honest but if you have
any indication of the age it's got IDE
cables for the hard drives and the
optical drive so it's pretty old yeah it
legitimately takes anywhere between five
to 10 minutes to boot up it's so slow
it's an Athlon AMD x3 I don't even
remember wench motherboard it's a bio
starts and ends 6 8 s 3 what yeah we
built this when she was 3 you just
turned 3 actually now you're 5 and now
it's time to get an upgrade so let's go
ahead and get all the new parts out here
and I'm gonna show you what's going in
your new computer okay so for parts this
is what we're going with now I've been
watching your guys's Twitter comments
she's not getting three-way 7 80s she's
not getting x99 she's not getting the r9
290x matrix Platinum this is what she's
getting she's getting the gigabyte f2
888 XD 3 H what a cute little model
right here I'm telling you huh it's an
FM 2 plus processor which we're going to
be putting my 810
7850 K Kaveri apu in there and because
we're putting that apu in there if you
guys are copying this build there's some
things on here wouldn't exactly copy
like for instance i wouldn't put the if
you're going to put a graphics card in
there i wouldn't put the a10 7850 cad go
with like the Athlon 760 or the new 860
it would make more sense it'd be cheaper
actually the graphics card we are going
to be
the r7 250 from sapphire this is the
passively cooled one I'll probably put
it in dual graphics mode because really
why the heck not it's there enter max
has sent over the revolution xt gold 530
watt power supply so this was sponsored
by enter max thank you for that to keep
things nice and cool we've got the
cooler master hyper D 92 cooler it's a
pretty decent for pipe direct copper
contact cooler it's going to be going
inside there to keep things nice and
cool her old case was all stock cooler
stuff it was pretty terrible and when I
wanted to turn it on it took like
finance to Lu she's never gonna stop
letting everyone know that because it
she really hated how long it took some
parts that are being reused here we're
using a Seagate 7200 RPM 250 gigabyte
Drive in a crucial m4 SSD this was
actually my first SSD I got a long time
ago it's made it through like three or
four of my computers so got 100% life on
it so we're going to go ahead and reuse
that that's going to be replacing her
terrible IDE hard drive now for RAM here
when you're using the now I know I know
you guys are going to have some probably
some crooked faces when you see this
it's actually the AMD r9 Radeon gaming
Ram please stop it 2400 rpm rpm 20 400
megahertz same thing for a computer
right and it's a little bit overkill for
this bill but really it's the only ddr3
dimms I have right now that are not
being used so these will probably get
swapped out in the future
you were being window do or I tell you
these are probably swapped out for
something a little less extravagant but
anyway enter max also sent over the
these fans right here these 412 segments
centimeter white LED fans which will
look really good in her inner Mac ostrog
pink case she's all about the princess
theme stuff so we went with a pink case
so I definitely have to send a huge
shout out to gigabyte and enter max for
supporting the parts of the build that
we did not have and of course if it
wasn't for sponsors and viewers and
stuff like that we wouldn't be able to
do these builds so you better tell
everybody thank you
I know right how could you say no to
that face if I want something I just say
it's for my daughter send that picture
and anything I want comes in here that's
how you get reviews product people
alright so we're gonna go ahead and just
build this thing she is gonna be my
helper when I make her do all the
screwing let's go and get started
Oh
Oh
Oh
No
No
Oh
you
you
we
you
alright guys so we are done and she has
just built her very first computer and I
want to talk about a couple of things
here real quick I still have to put her
wireless card in here from the other
computer I forgot to yank that out and
we did change the cooler midway through
from the cooler master d92
to the cooler master hyper 6:12 and the
reason why we did that is it appears we
might have been missing some hardware so
I'll be contacting coolermaster and
asking them to send over the missing AMD
bracket and screws that were supposed to
go with it but anyway why don't you tell
us how you felt about building your
first computer I loved building my first
computer it was really awesome well what
was the hardest part Oh pulling little
rubber things yeah and I only things I
really had to help her with like
actually really more or less do with her
hands on there so that she know what it
felt like was the front panel connectors
cuz those are always real tedious
although she had no problems plugging
them in the problem was I told her to do
it color coded and the color coding on
this motherboard is not the same color
coding as what's on the case plugs so
those were different but other than that
she pretty much did this one all by
herself and we went ahead did it helped
me I did help you but you did this like
you were the one doing the work on this
so the cable management I helped with a
little bit but other than that I did a
piece now we already did a test boot on
this in her little desk area and it
boots up pretty good
well actually boots yeah all the LED
fans light up the inside of the case
real nice I'm not and on the pink part
one of the pink parts um it has a red
glowing light pretty awesome well the
front of the case because as an LED fan
in there but it's a solid panel the LED
actually makes a glowing circle in the
front of the case so guys if my five
year old can build a PC you guys can
build a PC so I just did this video one
cos she need a new computer too it would
it was a good daddy daughter bonding
experience and three
I just wanted to show those people who
said building a computer they're afraid
to try it and they just want to do
store-bought guys if a five-year-old can
do this with a little bit of help I
think you guys can too so anyway we're
going to get on out of here say bye to
everybody and yeah and I guess what
might load some steam on here and see
what kind of kids games we've got she
does never steam steam she's never had a
computer that could run anything from
steam and I think it's time to start
checking out the kids library alright
guys see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
