think we ready to do this video hey
what's going on guys Jase $0.02 here and
I've talked about my new laptop a couple
of times over the last month or so and
there's been a pretty loud and
resounding why the hell how did you
review the damn thing yet just like with
most things that I review I like to
spend a little bit of time with it
before I actually do the review so I
feel like I'm armed and with enough user
experience now this particular notebook
slash laptop slash heavy ass portable
computer to be able to actually give you
guys a little bit of information that
might actually help gigabytes flex
display technology automatically detects
and connects up to four displays for the
best gaming experience in multi display
Ultra HD click the link in the
description to find out more so today's
focus is actually going to be more on
the gaming aspect of this laptop because
while it is rog republic of gamers now
my model is the asus rog g7 51 gaming
laptop it's actually the jy there's a
few different different acronyms there
and I don't know what they actually mean
but anyway I guess it doesn't really
matter now the specs on mine right here
and forgive me I'm going to use some
notes here because I would inevitably
totally screw up all of these specs here
it is a 17.3 inch full HD monitor so
this bad boy is huge in fact it's so big
I had to go out and I had to get myself
the biggest backpack I could possibly
find one that's actually meant for an 18
inch laptop just a fit padang thing my
my Swiss skier that I had that was meant
for a 17 inch laptop wouldn't fit it and
part of that is because it has kind of a
rear exhaust system that hangs out over
the back of the laptop that really makes
it much bigger than a standard 17-inch
but as I mentioned it is a 17.3 inch
full HD with g-sync this is a g-sync
panel and it's a 75 Hertz panel so
you're going to get more than the
standard 60 and I do think the extra 15
frames per second you know rendering is
actually very noticeable and will talk a
little bit more about that the future
it's got 24 gigabytes of 1600 megahertz
ddr3 L actually not sure what the L is
low profile maybe I don't know it's got
a 1 terabyte hard drive with a
256 gigabyte SSD in there and the hard
drive is partitioned into two 500
gigabyte partitions in there so you can
kind of keep things separated but
obviously it's a single drive that's
partitioned it does have a blu-ray DVD
and a rewrite a blu-ray rewrite as well
and it's got the nvidia geforce gtx 980m
in this model I think they might and I
could be wrong but I think they do have
a model that's an SLI 980m
but that's not mine it does have 4
gigabytes of video memory obviously and
the communication is a wireless LAN with
Gigabit Ethernet built in as well and
you get up to 4 hours on the battery
life now the dimensions of this guy
you're sixteen point four inches by
twelve and a half inches by anywhere
between point nine inches to one point
seven inches high this is actually the
taller version of it because we do have
like all of those hardware specs crammed
in there but it weighs 8.4 pounds
yeah that's why earlier I said really
heavy thing because of the fact that it
is it is not really designed to be the
most portable solution but it is a fully
specked out portable computer especially
since it has an i7 47:10 47 ya 47:10 HQ
2.5 gigahertz with 3.5 gigahertz turbo
clock cpu in there giving you quad core
with hyper threading in a notebook so
yeah there is eight usable threads of
computational power in the CPU for
connectivity it's got USB 3.0 it's got
Thunderbolt HDMI pass-through headphone
output an amplified headphone output so
you could use high-end gaming headphones
or your favorite studio headphones it's
got a line out it's got a line in the
blu-ray drive Kensington lock you
mention it it's got lots of features on
there now where I want to start out here
with the performance part of this review
it's going to be the boot time so let's
go ahead and let's just go ahead and
push the power button and we'll see how
long it takes to boot this is not a
sleep mode this was a shutdown although
it does have a really fast wake mode on
there option so hitting the power button
now as you can see it's got a nice red
backlit keyboard
you know I'm going to shut it down again
because I'm telling you right now this
thing boots up so freaking fast you
would think it's coming out of sleep but
it's not because I just hit shut down
again not sleep and I'm gonna hit the
power button and this was freaking me
out because it turns on so damn fast I
mean you guys saw the ROG logo pop up
there this boots incredibly fast I mean
I thought I was putting it to sleep it
was working so fast but that's just how
fast it boots from off this is a 1920 by
1080 75 Hertz not a 60 Hertz but it's
also got G sync technology in there so
we'll talk about that a little bit later
in this review when we get to the gaming
side but for now the colors on this look
very vibrant off viewing angles are okay
but it is still a TN panel so off
viewing angles are going to start to
invert some of the colors you know as
you get more to the sides of the panel
as you expect expect from any TN panel
but the colors look great especially
considering it's a matte panel matte
panels tend to have more muddied colors
than say gloss panels have but of course
gloss panels have terrible reflection
and so I would take a matte screen with
a little bit less vibrance and the
colors than any glass panel any day or
any gloss panel whatsoever the trackpad
on this thing is it's fairly responsive
but of course you know trackpads on pcs
have never been you know really as good
as say and I hate to even say this but
in my opinion they've never been as good
as say Mac's
trackpads on like Mac books but I find
this to be very acceptable sometimes
when I'm doing two finger scrolling on
webforms or something with long pages
sometimes I find it tends to freak out
and just jump to the bottom of the page
or go up and down real fast
so I don't know exactly what's causing
that in fact it's not even easily
recreate able but it is something that's
happened so I want to point that out as
well but you've got nice large buttons
on here that are easy for your thumb to
find when you're pushing buttons and
I've got really no complaints about the
keyboard or the the trackpad itself but
one thing to note about the keyboard is
it's red backlit which is fine that's
that's built you know that's a ROG theme
so red is fine but it is
most you know keyboards found in a
notebook or a laptop they are flat keys
and they're very shallow so if you're
used to typing on a standard membrane
keyboard or mechanical keyboard it's
going to feel a bit weird going back and
forth at least until you get used to it
but that's probably more the fact that
it is a flat key instead of a concave
key like a typical keyboard but once you
get used to typing on and it's really
not bad all the keys are responsive I
find that they doesn't tend to skip any
key presses it doesn't double press it
seems very very solid but of course like
most notebooks it's going to depend on
how hard you type on how long it's going
to last you start pounding on the
keyboard real hard of course you're
going to wear down the keyboard and
those membranes in there and it's
especially the springs and they're going
to start becoming sluggish the keyboard
does have some hotkeys on here that come
in very handy you've got an rog hotkey
up here by the d the number pad because
it is a not a ten keyless it's a full 10
key keyboard so you push the ROG button
and it's going to bring up different
gamer profiles ROG game first
optimization macro controls it does have
three macro keys up here em one two and
three
it can bring up GeForce experience so
you can take full control over the way
the computer responds to you know
different profiles but you've also got
over here a steam key you push that and
it's going to bring up steam big steams
big picture I think they believe they
call it big picture and so there's that
but I don't really feel like showing you
guys my ID and then you also have a game
stream key which is useful if your well
a game streamer and has xsplit
pre-installed so you push this button
and it's going to bring up the xsplit
launcher by default and you can get
right into immediately streaming your
games and it says that it's pre
optimized for this laptop so your
settings would be pretty much pre
optimized on there and also it gives you
an unlimited license because you have
this laptop there's kind of an agreement
between xsplit and asus rog so you get a
built-in license with this laptop that's
a plus so with some of the basics out of
the way why don't we go ahead and take a
look at the gaming performance on this
I'm going to preload fraps on this so
that you can see the FPS and then we'll
play some Grand Theft Auto 5 and then
we'll do some Far Cry 4
all right so I just loaded up an online
session here and here's the settings
we've got at 1920 by 1080 aspect ratio
and auto refresh rate is set to 75 FX
AAA is on which is free performance 2x
msaa
and we've got vsync on so Advanced
Options here you can see pretty much
everything in Advanced Options is pretty
much off long shadows high resolution
shadows so this is just detailed
settings I guess well maybe we'll do an
off and then an on anyway there's that
and let's go ahead and see how she does
so you can see already we're sitting at
75 FPS at least here in the apartment my
sensitivity is way too low in this mouse
I need to turn that up will go even
though I have a lot of cars in this
garage I'm gonna hop in one of my
favorite cars right here which is the
hot knife things bad so what we're gonna
pay attention to here is the FPS and how
it you know responds alright so I just
loaded up an online session here and
people are already recognizing the name
so anyway if you said hi to me in the
game hello so let's pay attention to the
FPS here though you can see right now
with 2x msaa on we're still sitting in
the upper 60s it's not capped out at the
75 you'd expect but graphics do look
fantastic let's say that the reason why
I'm driving during this little demo is
the fact that we've got a lot of things
moving and happening running around on
foot would probably yield better FPS
what is going to hurt nailed it
a game like grand theft auto 5 isn't
exactly the easiest game to run it's not
the hardest either but this kind of FPS
on a notebook this is pretty impressive
if you ask me
how dare that guy let me crash into him
huh
yeah I thought
now we got the cops of course the cops
always ruin all the fun it's not exactly
the right car to be running from the
cops in though my Big O hoot scoop makes
it kind of hard to see like my horn
bitch move get out the way get out the
way so you can say I'm having no
problems whatsoever driving well okay
the computer isn't making driving harder
I'm making driving hard and to do that
it's a hot knife you got to drive it
like you stole it even though I bought
it legally oh crap
should have a stand in there
the very violent game isn't it like
reload yep violence ed it's best if
people didn't do anything to me like
that guy didn't do anything maybe I was
dead
terrible I do not condone this behavior
just saying you should never ever ever
shoot at the cops or steal their cars I
think we've got a pretty solid idea of
how the FPS is performing go there Oh
what the heck nailed it
probably never throw grenades at the
cops either they tend not to like that
much hey whoa that grenade went way far
in front of me you gonna nail that car
from here
oh they got me just like I said though
running around on foot the FPS is like
it's about the same as it was in the car
whoa hello there ladies oh you're back
here hurt huh I thought where's your
friend who's your friend get over here
get a bag over here I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna get you uh-huh so I thought
and what are you looking at dinner
didn't dent in it in it oh that was kind
of interesting put a box on your mind
there for approximately mine there put
one there
what is happening
oh man uh that's kind of funny we
shooting to me oh dear I'm so dead oh
alright and how are the temperatures uh
130 degrees Fahrenheit fifty three point
four degrees Celsius coming out the back
it gets a little toasty now I know that
I said that I was going to do some Far
Cry 4 I'm gonna go ahead and skip that
because I decided I wanted to talk about
upgradability on this laptop you pull
back this little rubber plug and you've
got one screw right here which allows
you to open up this plate on the back
eventually
which will allow you to get to the hard
drives the RAM and then you can upgrade
that stuff on your own independently
alright I took a little coaxing because
it's new but anyway there's that so
here's our MDOT two SSD so the main SSD
is an MDOT two here is our hard drive as
well as our memory right here so you
could easily upgrade the memory on this
thing and as well as upgrade the hard
drive but in doing these four screws and
changing out the hard drive but it looks
like we also you know we could undo this
MDOT to and put another standard SSD in
here if we wanted but it doesn't look
like you can retain the m2 functionality
as well as putting in a standard SSD
and/or hard drive but other than that
you can see you get easy access it
doesn't void any warranties there's no
warranty stickers anywhere on here and
you can get to the things that matter
gaming on this laptop for just the 10 or
15 minutes that I did to get you guys
that footage has raised the temperature
in this room considerably if you
remember when we started that segment it
was 78 degrees in this room it is
currently 101 degrees in this room right
now 101 it's hot so I'm gonna try and
get through the end of this video very
quickly now because I want to open this
room up and get it
cool it off ma'am start to sweat so I
guess that leads us to point number one
as a gaming laptop it performs it gives
you a great FPS the g-sync keeps
stuttered to an absolute minimum if
they're at all the 1080p gives you nice
especially at this screen size 1080p at
17-inch is kind of like looking at a
1440p in a 28-inch it's super sharp but
the downside is that level of
performance means you were putting out a
ton of heat into the room the room is
just if you're in a closed room like
this or a small dorm room or a bedroom
unless you have a great AC or tons of
airflow it's gonna get freakin hot I
mean the AC kicked on thank goodness but
that's just this room you know doesn't
get that much cooling it's still 99
degrees in this room right now
so that's downside number one as a
gaming laptop we know they get
freakishly hot and this one is no
exception
I think the styling of the laptop though
on the other hand is absolutely
fantastic I there are very few laptops
in my opinion that look this good
the weight however makes it a little bit
on the unfriendly side for carrying
around in fact this is going with me to
Seattle in a couple of weeks I'm going
up to vlogger fair where I'm going to be
one of the featured guests it's kind of
weird I've never been one of those
before
and in fact I'll do another video
announcing that so you guys know how to
how to go and meet up with me if you
want to meet up with me
but anyway 8.4 pounds plus the weight of
the backpack and other things I'll be
carrying around at least a 10 pound
backpack or more because the power brick
itself is freaking massive this thing
itself is probably about three pounds so
we're looking at over ten pounds here
before anything else goes in my backpack
so that's going to be really heavy in
fact I'm worried about the backpack even
fitting under the seat in front of me
because it's such a big unit that's what
she said I know you guys were waiting
for me to say something like that damn
it have better expectations of me Who am
I kidding so I'm sure someone's already
typed the comment before getting to this
part of the video saying why would
anyone want a gaming laptop they get hot
they break easy and you can buy for the
$2,400 if this thing cost you could have
bought an amazing desktop well you know
there are folks out there who are not
capable or able to have a desktop
currently based on their situation maybe
there
school or they're traveling
businessperson or maybe they just don't
flat want a desktop this is going to
give you desktop performance in a small
form factor that's going to be easier to
transport than a desktop and I'm going
to say easy to transport like I just
told you the downsides of that but it's
going to give you functionality of a
desktop in a small package that you
could carry around quite easily and I
think that if you are that person you're
probably watching this video because
something like that would interest you
computing power on this thing is insane
rendering is going to be I know I didn't
do a rendering video in this one because
I'm going to probably do a separate
video for that especially since I will
be doing rendering on this when I go to
Seattle later this month and then I'll
get a real good sense of how well it
really performs in a real-world scenario
better than just moving some files over
here now and doing a dummy edit I want
to do real edits and edit a real video
using this thing and we'll do that up in
Seattle when I'm visiting Jerry and
going to vlogger fair now at the $2,400
price tag for this units a bit much for
you they do come in other flavors with
lesser end GPUs like 960 s and 970 s non
g-sync versions ones that are not going
to cost as much I think they start even
right around $1,200 depending on you
know the components that you put in this
thing this is going to get a lot of use
for me in fact it's been getting a lot
of use out and living room for what I
just want to get the hell out of this
space because I spend a lot of time in
here and it's nice to get out so anyway
there you go guys the Asus G Series ROG
laptop I definitely wouldn't call it a
notebook tiny it's anything but a
notebook honestly tell me what you guys
think hope you guys have enjoyed this
video oh yeah and don't forget I am
going to vlogger fair August 22nd and
23rd I will be in Seattle for that so
make sure you guys look out probably
going up right after this one here the
announcement video of me going to
vlogger fair and I definitely hope to
see you guys there see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
