you guys have been giving me a lot of
crap on social media saying I have been
tweeting this video and teasing it for
way too long while the time has finally
come where we are going to take a look
at AMD's new 300 series graphics cards
starting with a 390 and I'm going to pin
it up against the equally matched
pricing of the GTX 970 and we are going
to see who is king of the hill of the
330 dollar range graphics cards the
built in resin water pump mounting
locations improve the air flow and
massive radiator support make the define
s from fractal design the obvious choice
for water cooling enthusiasts the S
doesn't stand for sexy but it should
ever since a 300 series was kind of
leaked and just chatted about well
before e3 there was a lot of the word
rebranding thrown around and I was one
of those ones that kind of thought to
myself you know AMD rebranding the
graphics card would be a terrible
terrible thing and I think rebranding as
a whole is something that people would
definitely frown upon but you got to
realize there is a difference between
rebranding and refreshing now here's the
way I kind of look at it a rebrand would
be if we took one of these graphics
cards off this shelf which was a
previous generation changed absolutely
nothing about it
put a new label on it and then sold it
as something else that would actually be
a rebrand now I don't think refresh is
necessarily a bad thing now a lot of
companies actually refresh a lot of
product lines because of advancements in
manufacturing processes where they can
do things more efficiently they can get
better better power delivery lower Heat
and they will package that as a new
product even though the architecture
remains mostly unchanged now this is
something Intel even did with the
Haswell and Devil's Canyon CPUs you've
got the 4770k which everyone complained
about it was a terrible overclocker and
it got extremely hot because of a poor
thermal interface material used under
the heat spreader so people got very
upset over the heat of the Intel CPUs
specifically the 4770k so they did a
minor refresh where they changed the
power delivery to the CPU core to try
and get the temperatures down as well as
improving the manufacturing
process of the way that the heat
spreader is actually applied to the die
so you get the 4790k now that's kind of
what we have here where AMD has had
several years now to kind of refine its
manufacturing process and we've had
about a year and a half about 20 months
or so since the hawaii 290x launched and
now we are sitting here looking at the
390 and 390 x now they are based on the
same hawaii core that the 290 and to 90
x is based on but of course they have
been able to improve the manufacturing
process in my personal experience so far
here i've spent a lot of time with this
card already this isn't one of those
reviews where i kind of do my beginning
of the video and then I do the
benchmarks and then I come back and tell
you what I thought I've already fully
benchmarked this card and I've done it
now for two weeks straight and I've
redone the tests and did them again and
did them again with different drivers
and so I've gotten very intimate I've
gotten very intimate with this card
already now I want to be the first to
say that this is not a rebranded card
like I said if they took the 290
exchanged nothing about it and slap the
label on it to call it something new
then it would be a rebrand this is a
refresh they have gotten the
temperatures down on the core giving you
more overclocking Headroom I'm not sure
how they did it but I was able to
overclock this 390 farther than any 290
or 290 x-series card that I was able to
get my hands on in the past it runs
cooler and it has faster memory and
eight gigs of it so they've changed a
lot about it now I think a lot of people
were hoping that the 300 series cards
were going to have a new core but
obviously the Tahiti core made its way
into Fiji now whether or not Fiji cores
are going to make their way down into
the mainstream graphics cards I have no
idea so let's go ahead and talk about
MSI's offering here because one of the
benefits of this card is the fact that
pretty much every card on the market 393
90 X 380 they are all custom PCBs they
are all board partner designs where
they've taken the core and the
architecture of the RAM and they have
built it to specifications
they feel meets their gaming needs now
MSI obviously includes a very sexy back
plate on the back of their gaming series
that's always good to see it's
ventilated so that you don't have a lot
of heat saturation getting stuck under
the heat spreader and it gives a heavy
card like this more rigidity the
heatsink on this thing is bigger than
just about any heatsink I've ever seen
which is good because the Hawaii core as
we know is still notoriously hot but
there are four massive heat pipes
running the entire length of the card
you can see they come all the way out
here and massive massive massive
aluminum heat sinks on here keeping
everything nice and cool now one of the
things I have always complained about
and I've always used my Asus 290 X
matrix Platinum Card as a prime example
our companies that don't actively cool
the VRMs well MSI is actively cooling
the VRMs the heat plate on here directly
contacts to vrm and goes into the main
heatsink so your main heatsink is
actively cooling the vrm not a dinky
little billet strip of powder of
heatsink
that's just taped on and it's supposed
to cool by downdraft I've already heated
air nope it is taking the heat and it is
going to transfer it to the heat pipes
on this card on top of that you also
have a heat spreader that runs the
entire length of the card that's going
to be giving some cooling to the RAM as
well so MSI has really taken some of the
cooling complaints that AMD fans have
had about the 290 and to 90 X and have
definitely integrated it into this card
now on the back here it's got two DVI
it's got your DisplayPort and an HDMI
1.4 on the back so it's going to give
you good connectivity I like to see dual
DVIs because a lot of people are still
running panels that are 1080p 144 Hertz
or less and they're going to be able to
utilize DVI especially if you're going
to be running multiple panels just like
all of the other gaming series cards
from MSI you have the white glowing logo
on the top and then you've got two 100
millimeter fans keeping things nice and
cool now unfortunately I've said this
before this card is only going to appeal
to two different people and that is
going to be people who want a red themed
build or
people who just don't give a crap about
the color so I don't think it's really
hurt their sales though otherwise they
would have probably changed the color
already
alright enough chatting about the card
you guys want to see performance and let
me tell you what numbers you're about to
look at I did and this took a long time
so feel free to hit that like button for
the amount of hours it took to get these
numbers
I ran the 290x matrix platinum as kind
of my baseline to compare it to previous
generation one of the cards that was
considered one of the best 290 X's
amongst enthusiasts I tend to disagree
but that's the card that I used I use my
EVGA 970 SSC of the super super clock
which is a custom PCB and the msi 398
gigabyte card here now I ran the matrix
platinum at the max 1075 overclock that
I was able to get out of it which is
which was not great I ran this thing at
stock speeds which was I believe 1050
and it's max overclock which was 1200
I've never received 1200 in any AMD card
I've ever received so that was great and
the SSC running at its factory clock of
1170 I believe was 1170 or 11 90 which
is where the boost went to and then
overclocked to 1440 - so you're going to
see what five and different numbers on
the charts you're going to see
overclocked and stock speeds so you guys
can complain that I do overclocked well
I've went ahead and put both numbers in
there so you guys can see how the
performance also scaled so without
further ado and enough chatting let's go
ahead and take a look at those charts
transition
well there you go those are those
numbers and like I said it took so many
hours to do those benchmarks and then I
did them three times each just to make
sure I had good averages now if you look
at those charts obviously you can see
that these two cards were just
leapfrogging stock for stock the 390 was
faster overclocked the 970 it's faster
but overclock the 390 and it's faster
now I have no idea of knowing if all of
the cards are going to reach 1200 in
fact this thing was able to reach about
1250 but it crashed in a couple of tests
and passed others so I pulled it all the
way back to 1200 to be a number that I
thought would be a good median who knows
but even if it only overclocked to say
11 75 or something around there it's
still going to beat the 970 and it still
has a full usable eight gigabytes of
vram on there for a good buffer when it
comes to 1440p I still don't think this
card or the 970 by themselves should
ever be considered for 4k gaming these
cards themselves are just not powerful
enough you would have to crossfire SLI
them but I'm telling you right now the
amount of benefit you get for three
hundred and twenty nine dollars a new
egg right now the time of making this
video three hundred and twenty nine
bucks you can get this beast of a
graphics card and get the kind of
performance that you were seeing in the
charts you know just a few minutes of
just a minute ago I set it to a couple
of the vendors that I currently work
with that offer GTX graphics cards I
said this card needs to give them
concern for their 350 dollar 970 s
because this is 20 dollars cheaper
giving you more FPS a lot more vram and
it's going to give you a lot more future
compatibility with titles starting to
use a lot more vram than they are core
so I really personally at this point
where we are today cannot offer or
recommend a 970 of any variant over a
390 at the same price point actually
with the 390 being a little bit cheaper
don't know if I ever thought I would say
that but this is good we need this type
of performance comparisons and
competition in the market because what's
the logical answer to this going to be
Nvidia it's got to drop the price of the
370 there's no way it makes sense
the 970 used to kind of be the price
point king for the three hundred and
fifty dollars a three hundred twenty
nine to three hundred and fifty dollar
range they dropped the price of the 980
down to five hundred when the 980ti came
out but they really really should have
dropped the price of a nine seventy down
to three hundred 299 or maybe 275
because honestly this is the way you
need to go if that's your price point so
there you go guys my review of the r9
390 here from MSI I can't say enough
good about it that's why I was so
excited in the fury video I know if you
guys saw that I slipped some of these
benchmark numbers in the fury video
because I benchmarked this before I did
the fury I just waited to see what was
gonna happen with drivers on this and so
the drivers obviously for the 300 series
card are solid overclocking was great I
don't know if everyone will be able to
achieve 1200 I hope I actually achieved
1250 I backed it down to 1200 because I
wanted to do a number that I thought
more people will be able to achieve I
didn't want to take what might have been
a golden sample and flaunted and taunted
out there but I pulled it back to 1200
and I know a lot of people achieve
twelve hundred megahertz on their two
hundred series cars or 290 and two
ninety X's so this thing is a freaking
monster well guys I hope you've enjoyed
today's video thanks for watching if
you're not subscribed feel free to hit
the subscribe button stick around got a
lot more stuff coming up on the channel
here I've even got a custom AMD build
that I'm doing it's going to have a gtx
980 graphics card in there but it is
going to be an all custom acrylic /p etg
bent tubing in there full custom you
know case lapse case is going to be
pretty badass one of the best AMD
systems that's going to be built
publicly on youtube why AMD well that's
what the customer can afford but anyway
we're going to go ahead and hop on out
of here
follow on social media twitter facebook
all that sort of stuff if you guys have
any questions there's always the forums
JC sense calm now go ahead and stop
peddling all my social media now and i'm
gonna get the hell on out of here so
feel free to watch another video or
watch another youtube or you guys enjoy
it me barnacle ease or - tech tips or
something anyway
let's drink in that community guys and
as always see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
