you a review of a product that's pretty
unique in that it is a computer chassis
brought to you by a graphics card
manufacturer that's right the folks over
at EVGA are given their hand or giving a
shot at making a mini ITX chassis here
that they think is pretty unique and
pretty cool and we're going to go ahead
and see if that's true or not we're
gonna go ahead and give it the old J's
to sense I just made that up actually
I've never said that before
I might say it again I'm not sure but I
just made that up okay I didn't want to
waste any time taking the damping out of
the box because quite honestly it's
pretty boring box it's just a brown box
it says EVGA had drawn on there that's
right this is the EVGA hadron Air they
have come out with the hadron hydro
which is a little bit bigger to allow
for a little bit of water cooling in
there but we are taking a look at the
had drawn air not to be confused with
the hard on air which seems to be the
most common joke people come up with
when it comes to this chassis now if you
can't tell right off the bat this thing
is really freakin small I mean quite
honestly when I took it out I thought it
was gonna be a lot bigger than it was
it's not what she said entirely okay
before we talk about the case let's just
talk about some of the accessories that
come with it because you know all cases
come with accessories you've got a sled
here which looks like it is for not
entirely sure to be honest with you
looks like it could be a two and a half
inch drive or something pretty neat
nifty looking manual here most of its in
another language anyway you've got some
more short SATA cables which is good for
a small case like this you got your
power cable you've got a had drawn a or
sticker some screws and you've got a
pretty cool looking case badge well I
like stick this on my other build and
then you got some cables
twisty thingies to keep your cables in
place anyway it's enough about that
stuff let's go ahead and talk about the
things that really do matter about this
case and that's the fact that the style
in this case is really awesome I like
the style now it's got a piano finish on
the front a single button right there I
mean it's there's nothing cluttering up
the front you've got EVGA emblem right
on there now the bad thing about the
piano finish and mine's a perfect
example we'll have to clean this up is
it just attracts dust really bad now why
is there already a dust on it well I've
already done this video twice this is
the third time because I'm having a
really hard time with not making sure
the audio is working making sure the
camera is actually recording you would
think I just started doing this anyway
yeah you would think I've never done
this before huh on the side here you've
got a pretty nice looking window um it's
very cloudy looking because I did leave
the film on that in fact we'll go ahead
and ick the film off now the side panel
is held on by three thumb screws pretty
basic nothing too interesting there but
the side panel when you take it off
there is a film in here keeping
everything nice and pretty alright there
we go so now we got a nice clean window
it is not smoked or tinted or anything
like that it is just plain clear as you
can see right then when you open it up
you can see you have a jumble of wires
as I mentioned it's already been opened
I apologize guys this is not a virgin
unboxing it's been looked at and played
with and fondled so but what's cool
about this is it's kind of a chassis but
also kind of sort of the right direction
towards a bare-bones kit because it has
a built in slim low-profile 500 watt
gold rated power supply kudos on that
guys wish it was little bit bigger but I
guess 500 watts is more than enough
power if you were running something like
a Titan Black Edition or a 780ti or
something or even a 290x which is pretty
power consumption if miss Cistus and it
sits down here right on the bottom of
the case not taking up too much room
which is pretty awesome because that
allows them to keep a nice small profile
now moving on to
the harddrive portion here you do have a
sled you just pinch that you can slide
those out and it also does have a
portion in there where you can mount a
an optical slim slot load drive which is
not me I mean nobody's really using a
slot load or even any optical drive
anymore so it's what's cool about that
is they put the slot over here on the
side where it's kind of out of the way
so if you're not using it it's not taken
up into space on the front now the power
supply cables going back to the power
supply the runs of the cable are perfect
and proprietary to this case they pretty
much are already cut to the right length
that makes perfect sense for installing
inside of this case so you don't have to
deal with the standard ATX power supply
with a huge amount of cables that's
designed for an ATX or full tower trying
to cram it in a small form-factor like
this if the runs already are there and
makes sense you do have USB 3.0 cable
you have a HD front HD audio and then
you have your front panel LED and power
switch right there cool so when it comes
to the top of the case in fact you have
to use a screw driver to get this off
and I'm an idiot and I didn't grab a
screwdriver if only I had a screwdriver
on hand haha Leila there you go okay
guys so the top is held on by two
Phillips head screwdrivers and they're
really small you don't want to lose them
in fact there's no real reason to ever
have to take the top off this thing
unless you're trying to change out the
fans I don't know how good the fans are
I've not really tried it yet but I do
really appreciate the style of the top
grill because as you can see here it is
on there really tight now on the top you
can see you've got two 120 millimeter
fans making pretty much the entire top
of the case and exhaust kudos on that
airflow should be good now on the back
of the case here you've got this really
interesting looking panel on there I
don't know what actually mounts up to
that I'm assuming it might be their pump
that mounts up to that for their hydro
series because I know that that's where
the the tubes come in right there and
then on this side of the case you have
another solid black panel with
perforation for airflow USB 3.0 two of
them over here as well as your
headphones and microphone jacks and then
that brings us background on the front
of the
case now oh and then when it comes to
PCI expansion PCI Express you do have a
room for a dual slot card as well as
room for a long card I mean you could
fit a Titan in here without any problems
now this isn't all peaches and cream I
don't know why I just said peaches and
cream I've never said that in a review
before but now I'm just going to say
it's not all peaches and cream as I
mentioned in beginning this video this
is EVGA z-- first attempt at making a
chassis because of that there are some
things about this that don't quite sit
well with me and I'm going to go ahead
and name those the first one being you
have this amazing satin anodizing or
powder coating on here it's not an ax
that's powder coated it is steel it's an
amazing quality finish when you've got
had drawn err itched into there it looks
gorgeous when you flip it over you can
see it's not complete it's bare metal on
the inside okay fine you don't really
see that it doesn't matter too much
maybe it's not that big of a grey but if
we move to the inside of the case here
I'm sure you guys have already noticed
there's no powder coating here there's
no powder coating fair not on the top
and you can see through the inside of
the case where the back panel is also
not powder coated on the inside so you
can see the bare steel through the back
which doesn't make any sense to me I
don't understand why they did that okay
fine so I can get past that but what I
am honestly feel is kind of a cardinal
sin when you take something as beautiful
as this chassis because I'm just going
to say I love the design of this chassis
the aesthetics of this are gorgeous and
I would build out my ITX system in this
chassis to Knight wasn't for one thing
stuck using this power supply and these
ugly cables that came with it quite
honestly guys it feels to me like they
ran out of time and what I mean by that
is you've got this black jet black
chassis piano finish front very elegant
with a window mind you remember guys it
does have a window right here so it's
intended for you to see the inside of
this case so the one on earth do we have
a blue USB 3.0 in 1996
looking tan HD audio cable a green white
and black power switch and LED cable and
then thin sleeving over mesh mesh
leaving over the top of every color of
the rainbow inside of these power cables
if they had just gone with black cables
then this would have been a big deal or
if they had just gone with high-density
sleeping it wouldn't have been a big
deal I've never seen a case for the blue
USB 3.0 since 2.0 3.0 has become more of
the mainstream I saw them in the
beginning when 3.0 first launched to
kind of grab your attention like hey
guys this is 3.0 I don't get it what's
up with that but the tan HD audio cable
is like blasphemy as far as I'm
concerned so anyway guys I'm going to go
ahead and get on out of here this has
been the EVGA hand-drawn err reviewed by
J's $0.02 and as always I hope to see
you guys in my next video or maybe even
go and check out the website WWJ s2
CENTCOM register to day
