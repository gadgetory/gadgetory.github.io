Jays two cents and as you may know today
is Thursday that means Tech Talk ya know
I know that this is the highlight of
your week and you can't wait to watch
tonight's show well unfortunately there
will be no show on my channel tonight
but that's because we are gonna be
hosting it tonight over on Jerry's
channel we're gonna get Jerry a little
get his feet wet a little bit with some
live streaming and see if we can get
through the entire evening without it
turning into just one big giant ball of
fire sorry Austin Evans that wasn't
really um yeah I should have thought
about that a little better but yeah guys
we are gonna be hosting tÃªt talk 2nite
over on barnack Liza's channel barnack
Lee's barnack Liza's barnacle I if
you're an English major please tell me
how to say barnack Liza's sisisisisis so
if you guys would like to check out
tonight's Tech Talk Live you're gonna
wanna head to this place right here on
the screen or check down in the
description if you're watching this on
mobile for links over to barnacle eases
channel make sure you guys are following
on Twitter because we will be
interacting with you guys live on
Twitter during the show as well as the
comment section on YouTube and we'll do
the best we can to check out facebook as
well we can't forget about our Facebook
fans they put their faces against books
and that's just painful for most people
