I'm going to bring you another one of
these bonus videos here that's kind of
on the outside of my normal upload
schedule because a lot of you seem very
interested in my Adobe Premiere Pro
workflow which is very basic but yet
very efficient and a lot of you are
aspiring content creators and I figured
this might help some people now today's
video is being brought to you by video
blocks which is a service that I have
used for three years now because I
started using video blots when I first
started my channel back in 2012 video
blocks is a website where you can
download and use royalty-free different
motion backgrounds templates for After
Effects for creating intros or logo
reveals which is something that a lot of
aspiring content creators lack is a very
good intro so you could download one of
these and tailor it towards your channel
or your stream or whatever you want
stock footage which is really good for
kind of you know project creations if
you're doing maybe little short films or
feature films and you want to you need
like aerial flybys and things I've got
all sorts of stuff there but not only
does video blocks have their templates
here which they host they also have a
marketplace here where professional
content creators and graphics designers
can create templates for people like you
and me to use upload it to the
marketplace and receive 100 percent
commission on their work so it's
definitely worth taking a look at not
only as a content creator for end-users
but also for creating content for other
people to use and make a little bit of
money on your work so if that sounds
interesting to you then head to video
blocks by using the link in the
description sign up for a free trial and
start checking out some of these awesome
templates today and take your project to
the next level so I figured because of
the amount of messages and comments that
I got on the last Premiere Pro video
that I did I would kind of maybe do mini
series here sort of like a noob teaching
a noob now even though I've been video
editing now for many years I'm not a
graphics designer I'm just a basic video
editor I've got my style like it works
and I can get through my editing very
quickly because I don't like editing I
like playing with the hardware I like
hooking it up I like building PCs and
overclocking and benchmarking I don't
like spending hours and hours and hours
on video editing because that's not fun
and even though it's in this necessary
evil and
to get the video out to you guys I just
don't like spending my time on that so I
have found very efficient ways of
getting through my workflow and I
figured I would share that with you guys
today now there's a couple of things I
think we need to do for Adobe Premiere
Pro Creative Cloud which is what I'm
using right here I'm using the 2014
version because I've heard about too
many bugs with the 2015 so I'm using
2014 I figured we'd show you guys a
couple of ways to get it set up so that
one you don't lose all your work and two
you can get through your work more
quickly and have more fun gaming and
building computers or whatever else it
is that you are doing now the first
thing we're going to do here is we're
going to get our premier Pro set up to
do auto saving much more frequently
because by default it's set to 20
minutes now if you were to lose 20
minutes of work it wouldn't be a huge
deal but damn it sometimes I have things
set up exactly how I want them and I
don't want to go backwards 20 minutes if
something crashed and let's face it
Adobe is prone to crashing so you can go
to file I like to the back go to edit
preferences and then just go to general
now in general is where you can play
with a lot of different stuff for
instance you have your video transition
default duration and this is number of
frames or you can set it to seconds now
one of the things that I've done here is
I like much quicker transitions so I've
set that to 6 frames audio transition
duration is a second still image default
duration is 5 seconds we'll set that to
6 actually meant to do that so now every
time you pull a transition or a file
into here like an image it's going to
automatically use these parameters which
is going to save you a lot of time
without having to constantly trim your
transitions or your you know your still
image on screen duration you can set it
here and then adjust it for the ones
that are going to be outside of the norm
but anyway appearance some of you like a
dark screen some of you like a light
screen so you can use this right here to
make it more pleasing on the eyes if
you're doing a lot of nighttime editing
darker would be better you know if
you're in a dark office but anyway we're
going to move down to autosave here
which is very important because we want
to automatically save projects this is a
big deal if you're not automatically
saving and you get a power loss or you
get a corrupt file or you accidentally
hit something to delete your timeline
like a certain somebody on Twitter you
know
you are then you can actually come back
and recover your data I have mine set to
every five minutes by default it's set
to 20 minutes so every five minutes the
worst case scenario I would lose the
last five minutes of work it's also set
to save a maximum of twenty versions of
the project so once it has saved five or
excuse me wants it to save twenty
versions of the project it will then on
project save number 21 it will overwrite
number 120 to overwrite number two etc
etc so you've always got a very several
versions of the project that you can
actually fall back on should you lose
your data now memory is the thing where
you can now memory tab here you can use
to kind of allocate how much memory is
available to Premiere Pro because I've
got 32 gigs of memory on the system and
when I am doing rendering I am using
premiere I'm not really doing other
things on the system so I've allocated
all but six gigabytes of the system
memory to Premiere Pro which really
helps during quicker rendering and good
playback that way we don't get laggy
playback but you can actually customize
this for different projects or programs
in the Adobe cloud as well
we got sync settings here that's no
that's really gonna be all that
important right now but yeah other than
that we are going to go ahead and move
into our workflow now that we've got
that set up so it has saved our project
if we open up our whatchamacallit over
here and we go to our premier folder
which is where I'm using you see right
up here I'm using YouTube premier tips
and tricks for the tips and tricks there
is our autosave right there so there's
the auto-saves that we've just seen
happening as we've been doing this
tutorial and this will continue to stack
up to 20 files and then if something
crashes you just go if this doesn't work
or you accidentally mess up then you can
go back and open up one of these and
continue with your work it's a very good
fallback plan now one of the things with
video editing that you'll find yourself
doing quite often is transitions
trimming lengthening and shortening a
clip multiple video tracks maybe
multiple audio tracks and it can get
very cumbersome and tedious trying to
sit here and you know constantly trim
things and make sure that you know
the transition duration is right where
you want it and that can take forever
now this audio or this transition right
here of video transition is going to
default to wherever we set it over here
in the Preferences if you remember so I
have a set to six frames wherever you
set that when you pull in a transition
that's the default that it's going to be
now navigating over here through the
effects bin you can you can use a search
like you know tip if you know if you
want dip to white you can drag that over
so you want to crossfade you can do
it'll bring up all the crossfade stuff
if you got cross dissolve every up crust
is all but that's tedious and it takes
time and over long periods of time
typing and all that stuff and trying to
find it and drag and drop it's going to
take forever so here's the way I do it I
do right over here in the effects band
down the gray area
I do right-click new custom bin we can
name that whatever we want we'll call it
J's lazy stuff how's that because that's
pretty accurate description now I'm
going to drag all of the stuff that I
know that I use down in there so I used
bass enhancement for the audio and I use
treble enhancement as well because the
level ear mic lacks a little bit of
trouble I like to use cross dissolve so
I'll drag cross dissolve down there I
also like to use exponential fade which
is for audio bring that down there I use
constant gain as well I drag that down
there let's see I use dip to white and
black so we'll drag both of those down
there so now instead of having to search
through all of these files or folders
and then type in stuff I can just open
up my project and know my J's lazy stuff
is going to have all of the stuff in
there that I regularly use so now I can
let's say I just dragged this b-roll
piece over here and I trimmed it to the
right size I just dip the white BAM
let's say we are going to do let's say
we're going to an intro we're gonna do
my intro thing over there so we'll go
over your productivity YouTube
design elements we'll say
intro short will drag that over there
and we'll do that so maybe we'll do this
well just this this editing is not going
to make a whole lot of sense here
because I'm just doing it for the sake
of showing you functionality so now the
numbers really shouldn't be all that
surprising considering this the fourth
980ti that we've taken a look at I find
it kind of it just alright so we need to
say that's a little hook we'll put that
in the front we've got a transition
there we'll snap that all together drag
all of this bring it back to the left so
this is the way it looks now you know
the numbers really shouldn't be all that
surprising considering this is the
fourth 980ti that we've taken a look at
I find it kind of so I've got that red
frame in there that I've got to figure
out that's been bugging me for a while
so I could drag that down get rid of
that red frame and there we go so maybe
you don't want yeah that to just pop in
maybe you want to dip to white and a dip
to white out so you get this look at I
find it kind of interesting that they're
all competing there we go
now speeding up and slowing down so you
get that barnacle ease effect we'll call
it let's find something here that's made
worth speeding up of slowing heiresses
thee and we'll cut this part ends and
how these brands and how they survive if
you guys aren't buying the brand they're
not buying the brand there so we'll cut
it there if you guys aren't buying so
we'll do this now we will do a speed and
duration we'll put that 125 we will also
now highlight this clip here because
when you speed up the volume it's kind
of funny too to also push in a little
bit on the person so we will say we will
highlight this clip we'll go up here to
effects controls click motion and then
you can drag the little edge tool here
and like pull it in I mean look at that
guy that guy are there you could get to
take him serious don't you alright okay
so do it like that's and you get this
dude because your dollars are ultimately
what speaks in you know when it comes to
brands and how they survive if you guys
are buying the brand they're not going
to survive
obviously it's 20 how business works
see there's that that's kind of how the
speed up and slow down works nothing
real crazy about it anyway I hope this
video has helped some people it's just a
quick there's kind of a quick tips and
tricks I wanted to put out there this
bin right here has saved me hours of
time over the long run depending on how
long it takes you to edit in your
workflow it takes me about an hour and a
half now to edit a 15 minute video going
through all of my outtakes and stuff and
messing up and having to do Reece Peaks
and sometimes rerecord that's the way I
get through it so I hope this has helped
you guys hope it makes you guys a little
bit faster at your editing and if you
guys are aspiring to be content creators
then keep at it that's the best piece of
advice I have don't give up and just do
it because you enjoy doing it don't do
it because you hope to get a huge giant
audience and free stuff because that's
really not the way it it usually works
out so best of luck to you guys and tell
me if you want me to keep this series
alive let me know what kinds of things
you would like me to include that way I
know what kind of content to create so I
know what you guys are interested in
when it comes to Premiere Pro anyway
thanks for watching thank you to
videoblocks for sponsoring today's video
member head over to the video blocks if
you want to get some free templates that
you can use now I plan on doing a video
also in the future where I take one of
the template videos or templates for
like an intro and show you guys how you
can use video blocks to make a very
professional and awesome intro for your
live streams or your videos or whatever
so you guys can see exactly how to edit
those files and turn them into something
amazing
so hope this has helped once again
thanks for watching we'll see you on the
social sphere and if not I will see you
in the next video take care and we're
going to save this because that's just
what you do whenever you walk away from
a project you save it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
