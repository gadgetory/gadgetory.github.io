next unboxing an overview of a product
that's going to be going in this ITX
build that I am building for my coverage
and rendering machine at CES
now when you're dealing with a really
small case like the node three or four
here there are going to be some size
constraints when it comes to what kind
of power supply you can put in there and
still allow yourself enough depth to be
able to install a standard length
graphics card so unless you're going
with something small at the 760 gaming
from MSI or the old 670 s that are the
nice short PCB you're gonna have to be
mindful of how big the power supply is
so in order to make sure that we didn't
have any compatibility issues with this
fractal case fractal was kind enough to
send me one of their Integra power
supply units that are intentionally
designed to be installed in a case like
this specifically their node now this is
the Integra R - it's a 650 watt power
supply it is at 80 plus bronze so that
means it's the lowest eighty plus rating
with the exception of just 80 Plus which
means that we are going to be dealing
with about 80% power efficient now there
are going to be some give-and-take when
it comes to power supplies out of this
small so I'm not upset about it being an
eighty plus an 80 plus bronze because
it's still gonna give me that Blanc
bronze rating knowing it has decent
quality parts in there and it's gonna
keep the efficiency at a level that I
can tolerate now this isn't going to be
used extensively for gaming or anything
like that initially it's gonna be just a
rendering machine for me so it does come
with a three-year warranty here from
fractal design and it does feature 180 X
20 pin plus 4 pin that your ATX plug it
doesn't have 180 x 12volts 8 8 pin for
your CPU power it has 2 times PCI
Express ease so I'm assuming this may
not be SLI capable we'll take a look at
that now being the uber dork that I am I
forgot to go back and mention in the
video that this is SLI and crossfire
capable so if you have multiple graphics
cards go ahead and have a ball please
continue has six x SATA power 2 times
peripheral power and one x floppy drive
I wish you guys would just mix that
floppy drive who nobody that was my
Charis where I didn't just fart who uses
the floppy drive plug in e more just get
rid of that it's
just get rid of that but the fact that
it only has two times four pin molex
really shows that we're getting away
from the old-school four pin and
starting to use more SATA when it comes
to power now opening this guy up I have
no idea what to expect I have not looked
at this yet you get a nice heavy-duty
wall plug for your power supply unit big
bundle of wire you do get your four
screws here for your case and a couple
of well three zip ties three penny here
is your users manual and a little bit of
cardboard and here is our power supply
now on the surface it doesn't really
look too much smaller than a standard
sized power supplies but trust me it is
what's actually smaller is the depth now
aesthetically this is pretty pleasing
it's a nice matte black it has a fractal
snowflake kind of embossed on the top
here and it has a 100 look like a 120
millimeter fan on the bottom here that
is gonna be pulling air in and
exhausting out of the back you do have a
power toggle switch which is important I
feel all power supply should have that
toggle switch this makes it easier of
getting power out of the system if you
have to do some work on it always flip
the switch off when you're working on
your system and you do have all of your
cables here that come with a nice little
belt coach velcro strap pulling it all
together now the length of the cable is
pretty much standard I don't think this
is gonna really work for something like
a stacker but for a case like this it's
more than enough for any their arc mini
or maybe their arc XL I'm not sure I'm
sure the cables long enough for that but
here is our CPU power everything has
this kind of a mediocre sleep to it I
mean it's fairly transparent so you can
see all the colors of the wire not
really a huge fan of that but keep in
mind guys it is not modular one of the
reasons why it's not modular is it gives
them control of where the wires are
coming out so it gives us maximum
control of clearance in this case for
having a longer graphics card because
the other the graphics card is going to
basically I know why you can see this
we're looking down in the case of
graphics cards basically going to
right along the back of this power
supply like this so it's important to
make sure that they have the cables
coming out on the right side so they
have full control over that the length
of them I'd say they're right in the
middle which is good because for a case
like this you don't want a huge giant
massive bulb of wires in there and as it
is I'm gonna have my work cut out for me
making this look good in the case like
that you know you really can't see in it
and even though it's being used as CES
pretty much only I'm still a wiring snob
and I have to make sure that it looks
good so guys there it is the fractal
design Integra R - 650 watt 80 plus
bronze rated power supply if you're
looking at building a small case like
this or any IP X form factor and depth
is important when it comes to your power
supply in fact they'd probably be
important if I told you guys what the
depth was on this let's see if it's
actually printed on here yeah it's a
hundred and forty four a hundred and
forty millimeters deep so it really is
small in fact when it comes to the power
curve on here it looks like we're
reaching about eighty eight percent
efficient at around a 50 percent load
and then we drop down to 82 percent
efficient at a hundred percent load so
there you go that's why it has the
bronze rating what still it's perfectly
fine for me I mean 82 percent efficient
isn't horrible it does have a silent 120
millimeter fan and it is low speed and
temperature controlled so as the load
goes up the fan will ramp up so it won't
be super loud and annoying when you're
just idling or browsing the internet or
maybe looking at some of that their
content so there it is guys the fractal
design Integra R - check it out tell me
what you think about this power supply
unit make sure you follow me for all
that CES coverage on twitter you
definitely want to be watching on
twitter because i'll be bringing in lots
of stuff via that social outlet the same
thing with the facebook page all the
information is down in the description
and there's always guys you stumble
across my channel i hope you stick
around and i will see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
