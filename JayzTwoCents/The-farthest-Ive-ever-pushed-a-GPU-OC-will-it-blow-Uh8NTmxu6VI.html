continues our lm2 cheat has failed us
but we have just received a very
unofficial very secretive source we
modified bios for this card that gives
us unlimited power you know what guys I
got new merge it's available now Cod me
calm /jc sense we got zip up hoodies we
got tri-blend we got a new logo I
digress
since 2012 but the wrist logo you guys
been asking for that anyway well guys
little bit uh well kinda stuff zip up
hoodies beanies polos don't take my word
for it cuz obviously I can't do this
edie so just look in the description
below and you guys will find the link
thanks we tested this card on air we set
the fan curve to max 100% because
normally if you set the fan curve to max
it uses a few watts and if you're on the
edge of stability 5 watts or 10 watts to
the fans could actually reduce your
overall stability we actually saw an air
this thing pull 420 watts
I did some you have 420 Watts guys 420
watts it's max draw while overclocked
telling us that we could theoretically
and that was that like 65 percent of its
power cause what it said so you do the
math on that how far this will allow us
to go so the question is can a software
mod like this allow us to actually
forego any sort of shunt modding or any
sort of soldering or any of that stuff
it's a bit of a band-aid I mean there's
still gonna be things in place but the
software at least isn't gonna be getting
involved and what I alluded to when I
said spoiler alert I think I said it in
this take I remember we were able to
pretty much max what we were getting
with our XC ultra with the modified BIOS
on chilled water on air on the for the
win 3 card now I want to go straight to
the kingpin card and/or the Titan I've
talked about the fact that the Titan
cards I want to use in the gold build
and that's still happening I'm just
being lazy because I've got to take the
CP out of my workstation which is my
workstation so until I'm ready to finish
that I can't have that system down order
of events obviously but I thought well I
still would love love to beat Steve
score without using Titans and the next
logical jump up is going to be the
further win 3 car
which has a very overbuilt vrm delivery
or power delivery very very stable and
like I said we saw 20 160 mega Hertz on
the core on this guy armed air something
we couldn't even come close to achieving
on the XE ultras even when we had the
air conditioner plumbed up to it
so now I'm gonna take my homebrew once
again my little homebrew stuff that's
why quick disconnects really come in
handy we're gonna hook this up or you're
gonna chill it as well as our CPU which
we are not going to be L into L entering
the CPU today now we're doing just CPU
test we know how far the cpu will get
we're doing GP tests we know if our the
CPU will get 5.9 gigahertz and I want to
see now how much more Headroom we have
on water with this probably won't be a
lot but again every bit counts in this
competition so let's go ahead and get
this thing ready for water
that is one beef cooler right there if
you don't ask me hey it's not about the
cooler well this one check that out
every time we do this I feel like we
improved the design slightly maybe not
so much aesthetically but at least this
time we've got the condensation sort of
contained in here wrapped up with
electrical tape and lots of paper towel
so we can avoid drips cuz the fittings
anything it's metal that touches the air
is where all the condensation is gonna
form it has a form on the plastic yeah
some does form around the block on the
bottom but believe it or not that's so
close to the heat source that that
condensation isn't really a problem
there with the chilled water simply on
the backside we never really see any
sort of condensation form on the back
side so that scratched exactly no we're
good all right it's gonna get this over
to the test bench and see if we can go
any higher than we did on air if we can
then we'll get ourselves another one of
these cards hopefully if they're
available and then we will we'll go for
it again in another video so another
proof of concept video you know this is
how this works you do proof of concept
like we did with just the CPU we see how
far we can go with that and
theoretically say yeah we should be able
to win and then lose and then go over
here to our GPU and be like well
theoretically if this is higher
independently with a higher CPU then
theoretically we should win but the
problem is I know Steve's probably
working on lnto or dry ice right now
with that 99 80 XC with his Titans which
means the moment we win he's gonna win
again making all this work for nothing
there we go yeah so here's we're going
to do that now I'm gonna go ahead and
load our five point nine profile but
then I'm gonna pull everything back from
there so let's do five Oh I mean the
nice thing about using an icx card those
we can at least see what the different
temperatures are on the board ironically
our VRMs came down like ten degrees
versus when the cooler was on there with
fan running and it's overclocked right
now but it also loaded our previous
settings plus 175 on the core plus 111
80 on the memory so I guess we're gonna
see if it passes that test okay so our
graphics core is a 78 82 and these are
the same settings though upstairs that
it was crashing on air no we didn't get
that on camera but we were crashing if
we went above 1,000 megahertz on the RAM
we're at 1180 on here and if we went
past 170 on the core we were at 175
right now and now 5 mega hurting
currents doesn't happen it's like 12
mega Hertz or 15 mega Hertz increments
on this but we're gonna go ahead now and
start pushing it and seeing if this card
on water with unlimited power limit will
allow us to actually get a higher score
okay so 79 16 we are getting higher
scores and I have really not started
pushing the clocks too much so I think
I'm gonna push memory before I push core
a little bit because it's one of those
things where depending on the test
sometimes memory really does give you a
bigger increase in GPU we've talked
about that and I know Stevens talked
about that at gamers Nexus before where
memory clock can give you a bigger
increase sometimes than GPU cores so if
you pull the core back but clock speed
up on the memory you see bigger gains so
we have to sort of whack-a-mole this and
kind of figure out one before we go to
the other and back and forth same thing
with CPU testing when it comes to the
CPU overclocks
we saw much we got our max CPU scores by
getting memory and memory timings
tighter and there's still a lot of
timings on there we have to what
optimizes some pretty bad matches there
but we saw bigger gains from doing that
then core speed remember we really did
lnto the first time we got all the way
up to what five point seven before we
even matched our five point four on dry
ice when the memory was left at like its
dock settings so it all has to work as a
system 7940 to very minimal gain but
stable
less at 12:25 of the memory clocks in
which 50 and if we look at our
temperature the hottest our core got was
16 C but we know the first like state of
throttling starts at like 28 C so we've
got a lot of headroom vo push this card
439 watts
which is like 65 percent of what the
power limit will allow us to pull
yeah the pump died that could have been
wide this it crashed
because the GPU got hot and then the CPU
shut down which as we're just sitting
here like water what's happening in the
shutdown which probably thermal shutdown
but the pump is turning for sure but
it's making that whining sound because
it can't move any water yeah Phil found
it this wasn't clicking all the way now
now let's turn it on and that should
come shooting down thank god is before i
emptied the loop this is why we have
Phil's skills are important we know that
if we can match our dry ice scores on
water on the CPU that LNT will bring our
scores up remember wait to make up a
hundred points for Steven and we have
from Steven we have to do it before he
goes with ln2 or dry ice our only hope
at that point is that he pulls a noob
mistake and blows his up like I did
but that probably won't happen so my
second hope is that his hair
accidentally dips in the dry ice it
breaks off alright so 7932 again on the
graphics core we are not improving
anymore with extra memory so I'm gonna
go back to 1250 now we're gonna push the
core up a little bit our limited power
of the GPU is pushing the cloud gate
father than you can handle so you have
to offset it with a zero slider if the
slider goes up in both sliders go up the
math it's all wrong you can't do that
look at this it is passing right now
8,000 on the dot by increasing the CPU
to 5.2 so we're just gonna see how high
we can get the CPU now just for the hell
of it because again remember the whole
point of this is testing one card to
theoretically see if they can match an
or beat the other card at much higher
CPU if we can match it with lower C
let me know once we go really high in
the CPU we've been theoretically we also
theoretically thought we were gonna win
last time shut up Phil shut up Phil
actually that's one more test I can do
right now so we determined that
obviously increasing the CPU speed right
now is in helping us for some reason
we're actually seeing a diminishing
return right there which we know isn't
the case when we use Ln two so something
else going on right there I'm not gonna
worry about that too much I don't want
to test something we know 2010 or 210
crashed with the memory super high I'm
gonna drop the memory back down to like
not twelve thousand twelve hundred seven
1300 or 1275 I should know well going
farther 1150 and I want to see if the
core will survive with the memory
reduced and if that works and then score
goes up and everything is said about
leapfrogging it's wrong you know I think
you guys have figured out by now in this
competition we're just guessing in fact
I think one of the extreme overclockers
was even like yeah Jay did pretty good
for not knowing anything about what he's
doing I take that as a compliment
I really do can't take that as an insult
he's absolutely right
well that didn't work
yeah twenty to thirty five we can't seem
to get stable at this current
temperature so the next step is gonna be
for us to drop the temperatures even
further we're gonna somehow get an L n
to pot hooked up to this thing and we
are going to let me go forward I think
we're gonna go for 2,300 Ted leaves not
today
that's another video later on I'll give
you guys some time to sort of simmer
down a bit over this computation assume
you guys think we're milking this but
you understand so we are learning we are
learning through failure and we were
educating through learnings of our
failures anyway guys I'm gonna go thanks
watching today's video but we did learn
indeed that one the for the win three
card with the modified BIOS that removes
the power limit entirely the air cooler
never saw any hotter than 54 C when the
fans were at 100% when we overclocked it
to a 20 145 is what we were seeing on
air and that's a hell of an air cooler
and then once you add colder temps we
were able to push that all the way up to
20 to 20 what
now tells us we can go even colder this
even get it around 0c under load we
could potentially hit 20 50 20 75 who
knows but we're experimenting we're
taking you guys along for the ride which
is the point of these videos thanks for
watching and I have to clean this mess
up because now we have a dedicated area
for this that we we came in on an off
day and actually cleaned sort of just
didn't turn the camera around we can
actually check the just painted 120
barrels yesterday that's the whole point
of these videos we're experimenting can
you guys along for the ride so hope you
just subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
