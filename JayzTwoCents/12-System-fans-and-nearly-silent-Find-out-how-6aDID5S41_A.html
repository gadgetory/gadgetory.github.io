time since I've actually done this kind
of a video setup with the exception of
Tech Talk I mean geez
I've got that monstrosity behind me
we've kind of moved forward in the whole
YouTube sphericals testicles what did I
say that get 10% off anything from
Coolermaster at the cm store see the
description for details
so yesterday on Twitter I put up a straw
poll asking you guys what you wanted my
next video to be and I put up a couple
of choices and I let you guys pick and
so if you want to start getting more
involved on the videos that I make here
on this channel
make sure you head on over to Twitter or
Facebook because they link together and
let yourself be heard on the videos that
I make here on my channel now you guys
spoke up and it was a narrow margin but
the video topic that one over on
strawpoll was learning more about my fan
and fan cooling setup what I call it a
fan cooling setup well obviously my
system is water cooled but this video is
going to be a little bit less about the
water cooling and more about the fans I
chose the type of fan they are why I
chose them the sizes that I chose and
the configuration to have them set in
you know push-pull exhaust intake and
why I went with that now first things
first let's go ahead and get the obvious
out of the way the two things that are
obvious one the case is a 900 D by
Corsair it is huge and so is the case
yeah the case is pretty damn big and it
can fit a lot of fans obvious point
number two yes the fan rings are painted
no they were not purchased that color no
they were not dyed yes I painted them I
get asked this question every single
time I post a picture of my system and I
don't know why more people can't really
just see that they're painted but yes
they're painted I used Valspar self
etching primer included paint thing it's
got primer and paint mixed in one and
it's a goldenrod color because that's
what perfectly matched the Z
77 OC formula from asrock so let's go
and put that to bed yes the rings are
painted you can paint yours to any color
you want just go to get spray paint and
spray clean them all right now what fans
am I using they are all Corsair fans but
we've got a mixture here we have got
three that's how we Americans do three
but if you're European we have got three
of the Corsair AF 140 s airflow 140 s
and they are the quiet addition I have
got nine one two not nine of the Corsair
SP 120 s that is static pressure 120
fans again quiet addition now let's go
ahead and talk about the fan placements
the three AF 140 s our exhaust fans I
have two on the top and one on the rear
pulling air across the motherboard and
out of the case now I have two SP 120
quiet Edition fans on the front in
taking now you guys have asked me why do
you have SP 120 s where airflow would
have made more sense we'll get back to
them on the bottom of the case in the
basement on my two radiators because i
have a quad 120 radiator and a tripple
120 radiator I have seven SP 120 quite
addition fans so there you go there's
the rundown 12 fans in total 3 AF 140 s
9 SP 120 s now why did I put the SP 120
s on the front instead of the airflow
fans well because the way the Corsair is
when we have hard drive cage right in
front of them and you've got the fan
filter right behind it as well as a
little block off plate with a little gap
on the side we need as much pressure as
we can to get the air moving air flow in
that case in that situation did not
perform nearly as well trust me I tried
it with the included airflow fans and
found the SP 120 finished threw up a
little in my mouth I tried it with the
airflow fans that are included with this
case and found that the SPS performed a
lot better not only that the SPS are
generally quieter now when it comes to
controlling dust in this
them you guys asked me all the time how
do you keep your system so clean
I don't guys the system is filthy half
the time I'm dusting it every single day
it's very annoying and I went through
practically an entire can of compressed
air and use this guy this is how I keep
my system clean this little ant I said
electron expressional won't do that a
little foam thingy there and that's how
I keep the system clean but now when it
comes to the noise of my system I am
picky super picky about the noise in my
system it must be quiet so that's why I
have so much radiator space considering
I only have one processor and one
graphics card at the time of this video
another graphics card is going to most
likely be going in in the future when
you have multiple radiators like this
you can use slower speed fans because
you make up for the cooling capacity of
slower speed fans by having more
radiator space so that's why I have
seven fans on my radiator I don't go
push-pull because honestly it's not
necessary in fact I turn the fans off on
my quad radiator unless the system is
doing something otherwise my triple
radiator is running passively passively
actively at about 50% fan speed at all
times now when it comes to controlling
my fans the quad radiator is controlled
by a program I use called speed fan it's
a free piece of software it's not the
easiest software to use in fact you have
to configure it to work with your
motherboard don't even ask me how to
configure it for your motherboard I
don't know how to configure it for your
motherboard you're going to have to play
within the settings and tweak it and
make it work for yourself but it's free
and it works with PWM and 3 pin headers
and that's what I use I use the CPU
header to control the 4 radiator fans on
the quad radiator now unless the system
is under load they are off which helps
with air flow or dust or it doesn't help
with air flow but it helps with dust and
it helps with noise keeping the noise
down and unless the system is under load
then it turns on and they only run at
about 50 to 60 percent depending on the
temperature it is temperature controlled
I use speed fan to say if the
temperatures this
run at this speed and it's a curve just
like if you were using MSI Afterburner
for your graphics card it's the same
thing for that radiator the triple rad
as I mentioned is running actively
always at about fifty to sixty percent I
think I have it set at fifty-five on a
recall now when it comes to controlling
the other fans in my system I am using
the phobia touch six fan controller now
the phobia touch six is pretty nice
actually did a review of it and I'm
going to put it up here somewhere so you
guys can click on and go learn more
about that controller but it's got
temperature probes it's got automatic
and manual settings it's got voltage it
shows voltage it shows rpm and I tend to
be keeping my fans right around 700 rpm
at all times so I use a mixture of
hardware control and software control
for the twelve fans in my system and for
the price that that fan controller is it
is a pretty amazing piece of hardware so
that's what I use to control the rest of
my fans they're on a static setting they
don't ramp up they don't slow down and
they're sitting at about 60% speed at
all times now let's go ahead and Auk
about noise how loud is my system I've
been told Jay you've got 12 fans in your
system plus a power supply that thing
must be so massively loud no you'd be
surprised in fact to prove just how
quiet it is I've gone ahead and put
together this little bit this little
demo so let's go ahead take a look
anyway guys there you have it there is
my fan set up for my radiators and my
900 D I'm not even utilizing all the fan
space I could put another 140 millimeter
on the top and I could put another 120
millimeter on the front if I wanted to
flip my radiators around the other way
not willing to do that because I don't
need the extra cooling down there so
what are you guys doing for cooling in
your case keep in mind if you've got a
smaller case with less fan slots than
this case does you've got to use faster
rpm fans to make up for the amount of
airflow
I like the 900 d because I can fit so
many fans in it I can slow them down
which allows me to keep the case nice
and quiet
while not sacrificing any of the cooling
as you guys may have seen in the past my
system never gets hotter than 65 or so
degrees on the core 43 degree ish on the
CPU socket and 41 degrees maxed with
hacked voltage overclocked
gtx 780 on water so there you have it
guys that's my cooling setup that's how
my fans are configured tell me all about
yours I hope this video has helped you
and remember you can give your input on
what you think my next video should be
by following me on Twitter and watching
for the straw polls where I'm going to
start including you guys more on the
decisions I make on the videos I make
for you guys as always I'm gonna get the
hell on out of here and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
