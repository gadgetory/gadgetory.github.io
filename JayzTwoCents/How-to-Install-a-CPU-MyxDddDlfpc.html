especially for a new builder could be
extremely daunting and nerve-racking so
that's why I jsut sense we're gonna
start a new series here of easy to
consume bite-sized content covering
everything from us basic as CPU
installations all the way up to is
advanced as high-end rigid tubing water
cooling so that's why we're gonna kick
off this series here with a basic how to
install your CPU because I think that's
one of the more nerve-wracking things
for a new builder they're worried about
damaging their CPU or their pins and
today we're aiming to show you just how
easy it really is and you don't have to
be scared it's a whole point of these
videos the new dg7 series cases from
EVGA off for PC enthusiasts more of what
they love like tempered glass side
panels vertical GPU mount integrated RGB
control board DG tuner and an awesome
three year warranty to learn more about
the DG seven series of cases from EVGA
head to the link in the description
below so today we're gonna be covering
the four main platforms that you'll
encounter and this pretty much applies
to current gen stuff and even past gen
stuff it's gonna cover about 99% of what
you can expect we're gonna do Intel
mainstream AMD mainstream Intel extreme
and AMD extreme what we've got right
here is a Z 370 motherboard but the
socket retention systems been the same
for about over 10 years now so this is
going to apply and this is our CPU right
here this is actually I 5 8400 now this
is the way it's gonna come out of the
box it's gonna have this little cover on
it it's gonna have this little lever and
we're gonna leave the cover on a mistake
a lot of people make is they take the
cover off which exposes the pins and the
pins are the delicate part of an intel
mainstream you can see here there's no
pins on the CPU well that's because the
pins are on the motherboard so you take
this lever push it out so it comes
around this little arm and then you
swing it up it will then release from
this little screw right here and you can
flip the holes the whole lid back now if
you look on the corner of the CPU you're
gonna notice a gold triangle and that's
gonna align with a gold triangle that's
on the corner of the socket now you're
also going to notice there's two notches
are at the top of the mainstream CPUs on
Intel those are also going to line with
two notches that exist right here in the
socket so take your fingertips fold it
on the side just like this you don't
want to get any oils and stuff on the
bottom and you're gonna just drop it
right down in the center
of the socket and you'll notice those
little tabs online and then the corner
of the arrow is pointing into the soccer
there give it a little wiggle to make
sure it's seated leave the cover on
you're gonna fold the lid back down
align it under the screw right there and
when you push this lever down the lid is
gonna pop off and you're gonna line the
lever under that tab and you've now just
installed your Intel mainstream seat
view now AMD mainstream is very very
similar only what you're going to notice
with an AMD CPU is the pins are located
on the CPU itself at least on the
mainstream AMD thread rippers different
we'll talk about that in a second so
what we're gonna do here is the same
thing there's no cover on an AMD CPU but
you're gonna pull the lever out and fold
it back and you can see the whole
mechanism kind of moves when you do that
so that's what that way when you push it
down it slides and makes contact with
the pins but just like the Intel CPU but
we've got a gold arrow right on the
corner and it might be hard to pick up
on camera but we have a arrow right here
in the corner of the socket as well
there's no notches on this one just the
arrow that you have to line up but
you're gonna line the arrows up you're
gonna sort of align the pins with the
holes and it will just drop down give a
little wiggle make sure it's in push the
lever down snap it in place and now your
AMD main stream is installed now the
Intel Extreme platform like the X 79 X
99 X 299 is going to be very similar to
the main stream only you're going to
notice that the retention system here
has two levers so you're gonna actually
have to read you have to do this lever
on the left side first then this lever
on the right side and when you do that
they'll fold apart and then you can fold
this back so unlike mainstream or goes
up this one folds back and you'll notice
here not only do we have the gold arrow
once again we also have two sets of tabs
so those two little notches right here
and two more notches on the top but
these have different offsets so it can
only go in one way a tip I like to use
is look at the writing on the CPU orient
that upside down and you now have it
facing the right way to go into the
socket so be gentle push it down give it
a little bit of a wiggle make sure it's
in place fold the lid down
do the right side tab first do the left
side tab and this will pop off in this
case it didn't but then you can just pop
it up
there's your installed extreme series
Intel CPU now thread Ripper is brand
spankin new this is a TR four socket
this one actually requires a tool and
all thread Ripper CPUs come with the
required tool now what we're gonna do
here is we have to pull off this
retention bracket and if you look right
here on the socket itself you can see
we've got a close and it says one two
three that's the order that you tighten
down the screws and to open it it's the
reverse
three two one so to open it we're gonna
loosen up number three which is this
corner cuz it's marked they are captive
so these screws will not fall out and
loosen up to and loosen up one and this
is spring-loaded so as soon as that
comes loose it pops up just like that
nobody had this other mechanism in here
it's sort of a sort of a tray or a sled
you're gonna grab this little piece
right here it's a little tab and you're
gonna pull up and it's gonna have a
little bit of resistance to it but it
will pop up and then you're gonna slide
this guy out just like this now this is
our socket retention cover this is going
to protect our pins until we install so
I don't like to remove this until I'm
actually ready to close the lid now here
is your thread Ripper CPU it's got this
orange sort of a cassette we leave this
in some mistakes people make as they pop
this off we leave this on and we are
going to slide it into this rail system
now if you kind of look right here
you're gonna see there's a there's a
rail on either side and that rail aligns
with this orange cassette so with the
pins side of the CPU facing up
technically we were just gonna slide
this down just like that until it snaps
into place and now we are ready to
remove this cover right here and to
remove it there's two little grab points
where it says remove just pop that up
take the cassette snap it down into
place then you can take your lid and
push that down now to close it you're
gonna go in the order it says one two
three so we're just gonna start number
one we're not gonna be tightening it
down fully yet get the threads started
on number two get the threads started on
number three and this is technically a
torque wrench it's already set to the
proper torque specs for
this socket so once we started the
threads and all three of them go back to
one and turn it until the little knob
clicks just like that so one is now good
go to two and do the same thing until
the torque wrench clicks and then do the
same thing for number three till it
clicks just like that
now don't go past where it clicks some
mistakes people have made is they keep
turning and then they actually snap the
head right off the screw on their socket
so once it clicks that's it you're set
so there you go guys it's just that
simple that is how you install a CPU on
pretty much any platform now in 2017 and
probably forward and backwards as well
it's not that hard once it's in place
everything's pretty much ready to go for
your cooler and continue on with your
bill every guys thanks for watching and
we'll see you in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
