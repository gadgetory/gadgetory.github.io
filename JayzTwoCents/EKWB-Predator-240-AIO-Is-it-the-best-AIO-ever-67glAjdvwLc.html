been following my channel for more than
five minutes you should get the vibe
already that I am a huge water cooling
advocate that should that should really
come as no surprise and I've watched
water cooling kind of take off and then
simmer down and take off again over the
12 years I've been doing it and I've
really been trying to make people
comfortable with building their own
custom water cooling loops especially
when you don't really have to do all the
legwork to make sure you get all the
right parts when you have nice complete
kits in a box like this one here from ek
which happens to be the ek x360 kit
you're not to worry about me having
enough fittings or having all the right
adapters because it's all in the box
well what if you're still not
comfortable with that maybe your problem
wasn't buying the parts or picking the
parts it was just being afraid of
assembling it now even though I've done
some how to water cool your PC videos
showing just how simple it is I
understand that there are folks out
there who still just don't want to go
that route so what do you do well you
stay subscribed and you keep watching my
channels and you grow a pair I'm just
kidding
okay that was uncalled for but if you
still are not willing to take the leap
of faith and try to do your own custom
loop you do have an option because ek
has just launched their ek water blocks
predator all the one water cooling kit
and I call it a kit even though it's
assembled because there is a lot of
functionality in this thing we're going
to talk about that coming up right after
this
did what it's so oh you really think so
what is a wife thing well she says it
gets the job done - ugh that smell a
fractal design node - OH - it's not
about how big it is but all about how
you use it
now what makes the predator unique is
the fact that EK has taken like their
best-selling products and preassembled
them in a all-in-one water cooling kit
format basically it is preassembled
custom loop it's not like they took you
know some sort of a dinky little pump
top our block top pump where they put
the pump on top of the block and then
you just have to kind of hope for the
best and hope it lasts and then it's not
too noisy this is a full-fledged custom
components preassembled by ek so what
they did was they took some of their
best parts and put them together for you
but it also keeps it expandable let's go
and start with the block the block here
is their ek supremacy MX block this is
like kind of a clear plexi it's got
holes in here where you could add LEDs
if you wanted it's got the backplate
pre-installed the hoses are
pre-installed it's prefilled obviously
so it's the same exact block if you went
to ek s online store or performance pcs
or wherever and looked at CPU water
blocks you would find this block sold by
itself for people who want to do custom
loops because that's how this cut block
was actually you know release first
custom block for a custom loop now the
tubing on here is not that cheap fep
flexible tubing that you tend to see
that looks like terrible terrible heater
hose this is a real 3/8 inch rubber tube
which as you can see here is very very
flexible we got no problems maneuvering
this thing into position of however you
might need it I think the matte colored
black tubing looks amazing on this thing
and it really kind of adds to the
overall aesthetic of the kit now the
pump on this thing is a laying DDC 12
volt PWM control pump so this is again
the same pump that you would buy on a
stand alone if you were building to us a
loop on your own buying parts this is a
very common pump now the radiator
here is their cool stream radiator in
fact I've been using the cool stream
radiator in my test bench the triple
version that the 360 version ever since
I got the cryo venom 290 from vision
tech which included an EK water block
loop I set that up on the test bench and
that's been my cooling scenario ever
since for the test bench so this is a
240 variant with to 120 millimeters via
our 2200 rpm PWM controlled fans but you
can also get this in a 360 variant now
you do have a fitting right here that
you can use for drain and fill as well
as the top of a little integrated
reservoir right here because the system
is expandable this is designed for you
to be able to grow or build the system
out as your system grows if you need to
add say another radiator or another
block like a GPU block or something of
that nature but when it comes to the
cooling if you're doing just a CPU this
is going to be more than enough for just
about any CPU on the market now what I
like is the way that the fans are
pre-wired in here using this little
control board on the end so you don't
have to worry about hooking up fans
anywhere you're not to worry about
finding enough headers for your fans
because the this is going to distribute
power based on plugging in this static
cable right here so all you've got to do
for power is plug in this one cable so
they've got power for the pump and the
fans all taken care of one power plug
you don't have to worry about that and
then you plug in the RPM circuit right
here for the PWM channel and then you're
going to be able to control the pump and
the fans together through one fan header
that is freaking amazing because one of
the worst parts of putting together a
custom loop is trying to figure out
where the hell you're going to plug in
all the fans and the pump and then
control them all together
Ek is done all the legwork right here
and they even have another fan header
here they use the same piece here for
the 360 so you could have a third fan
plugged in right there and you are going
to be able to control all of that right
off this one unit so what I do is go
into your motherboard BIOS or your
favorite fan control software if your
motherboard has fan control built in and
you can do it all at the same time now
the only thing I would have liked to
have seen is you can obviously do
push-pull on this if you put two more
fans on the bottom it would have been
nice to have seen extra headers on here
if you were going to do push-pull
because we only have one extra fan
header here but room for two more fans
at least on this unit
so if you were going to do push-pull
then you are going to be stuck with the
other two fan header is having to be
controlled somewhere else now you might
have noticed this thing is a little bit
thicker than your average all one water
cooling unit in fact it's 68 millimeters
thick so you're going to want to make
sure you have plenty of clearance not
only for the 68 millimeters of thickness
but also the tubes coming off the bottom
in your case to make sure this isn't
going to interfere with your motherboard
in any way now here's how we're going to
test this thing out and some people may
say this isn't fair but I don't care
because it's all it's all Ek stuff we're
testing here is we're going to take the
cool stream three sixty millimeter
radiator set up I have right now on the
test bench cooling my 59 30 K at 4.4
gigahertz we're gonna do a base test on
that get temperature readings then we're
going to hook this guy up to the 59 30 K
and we're going to compare so we're
going to see how this all-in-one water
cooling loop that's a 240 variant with
the pro to our fans
compares to the 360 variant and we're
going to see whether or not you know
this thing actually does what it's
designed to do is it going to keep an
overclock 59 30 K nice and cool I think
we already know the answer to that but
let's just go ahead and see how cool it
can actually keep it okay so we ran the
test here for about 10 minutes as you
can see in a 264 which is a stress test
so we're stressing the CPU as hard as we
possibly can when we do this so keep in
mind the temperatures you're going to
see here are absolute worst case
scenarios because we are doing a
floating-point we are doing cash we are
stressing the CPU we're even stressing
the system memory so this is doing as
much heat damage as we can to the CPU to
see what happens so our minimums here
were in the mid to upper 30s and our
maximum is on the core 1 through 6 range
anywhere from 70 to 80 1 so we have
about 11 degrees swing between the cores
which is actually pretty normal but
we're sitting here it looks like what's
okay so core 174 70 80 173 80 and 72
with a max package temp of 86 so this is
actually really good considering this is
a 6 core or it's a hex core extreme not
extreme but enthusiast CPU that is being
stressed as hard as we possibly
could and that is at one point three one
two volts so you can see the voltage is
not super high but it's also not low so
I think these temperatures are fantastic
for the voltage but it should be it's a
triple because it's a triple radiator
custom loop so how does the predator
perform let's find out
alright so I was installing this thing
or trying to install it in my ads Rock
motherboard and I came across a design
flaw that I think is important that I
point out so as you can see right here
we have got the retention clip is held
on with a c-clip right there these are
not designed to come off and it's
designed to be a dual purpose where the
longer thinner thread right here will
push all the way through the motherboard
and then it will thread on to the
retention bracket behind the motherboard
to hold it in place and then 4x 79 and X
99 2011 - 3
technically any 2011 socket they use the
same retention clips it's designed for
this small part to push all the way
through the bracket for the thick part
to thread in well here's the problem
with that my as rock board doesn't
actually have holes that go all the way
through the motherboard neither does the
gigabyte X 99 you d4p as you can see
right there there's the socket hole it's
solid it doesn't go through and I
thought well geez how many motherboards
are like this so I grabbed another
motherboard out of my closet the x99
gaming 7 and you can see those do have
the holes see how the holes go all the
way through the socket right there so
that's a whole different retention
mechanism you know supplier the MSI used
so I cannot mount this thing onto my
asrock as it is shipped in the state
that it's currently shipped in because I
can't push them through the holes right
there so if you've cut an X 99 this is
not going to affect any of the you know
LGA - 775 or LGA 1150 1151 it's not
going to affect any of those because
they all have holes that go all the way
through because you have to use a
retention bracket so if you are on an x
99 or and x79
you need to look on your motherboard
before you buy this to see if it
actually has the hole to allow this
portion of the thread to push through I
can go forward with my review because I
still have the
the 2011 retention set from the
Supremacy block that is on the
motherboard now from the custom loop and
I'm just going to undo the see clips on
the block with the predator and I'm
going to use these to hold it down so I
can do that test but you if you're
looking at buying the predator need to
check your motherboard and see if you
have the holes and the retention threads
or not so those stupid C clips are
proving more difficult to get off the
night hoped so now for the sake of
bringing you guys this video I am
literally taking a drill to my
motherboard oh dear go slow
whoo that is not a comforting feeling at
all sure hope I don't break the thing
this is probably the most stupid thing
I've ever done
blow all that shit off of there and my
god I hope my test pinch isn't dead now
mmm well guys I killed it and I don't
mean like yeah I did it I meant I killed
it oh this sucks but hey my my learning
experiences can also be yours
so I drilled the holes all the way
through because I looked at my I looked
at my gigabyte board and went okay well
they took in these holes into account on
the traces so there's there's nothing in
the way there when it comes to traces
well that's true for the gigabyte board
however that is not true for the asrock
board so if you look here closely you'll
see I drilled right through some of the
traces oh man I don't like killing
motherboards because of stupid mistakes
so let this be a lesson to you the
talking finger telling you to check
before you drill anyway we went ahead
and performed the mod on the x99 you d4p
and as you can see there is nothing in
the way of those holes those holes were
already there I just had to punch out
the middle of them so we're go ahead now
II just need to check and see that I
didn't kill my CPU and my my ram and all
that stuff keep your fingers crossed my
lord
okay well it's installed now we've got
the gigabyte UT 4 P in there now and if
I said I wasn't disappointed that I
killed my house rock board I'd be lying
but anyway it's important to also know
that that was not ek water blocks fault
that was my fault for not looking before
I drilled but I did talk to ek before
completing this video because I want to
know how they were going to address the
x99 issue there and they did basically
say that there is a note on their
website saying as rock and Gigabyte are
pretty much using non-standard sockets
and that would be a problem right now
for people who have those motherboards
however they did say that they're going
to be including hardware for you to swap
out for particular motherboards that may
not be compatible with their particular
mechanism of mounting so anyway now that
everything is working thank God I didn't
kill my CPU or the RAM or the Titan X
that was in there because when you drill
through traces like that and then you
stick middle metal posts in there you
cause all kinds of problems but anyway
let's move forward let's go ahead and
benchmark this thing I've got all the
parameters identical 1.3 1 volts on the
vcore 44 multiplier for a 4.4 gigahertz
overclock temperature in the room is
identical to what it was earlier and
we've got the predator hooked up now so
let's go ahead and kind of do a jump cut
here and come back with the results okay
the test has been running for just over
10 minutes let's go ahead and stop it
but school is when the moment you stop
the test the PWM circuit sends to the
all-in-one and then the fans ramp down
and they ramp up based on PWM load so
it's going to look at the statistics
here as you can see we've got minimums
we're sitting in the mid 30s to low 40s
and the maximum is here 80 70 183 73 83
72 and in the CPU package 86 so we're
within a couple of degrees of a custom
loop and the thermal paste on here
hasn't even had a time to cure I just
put the thing on put the I put the
thermal paste on then I put on the block
and then ran the test whereas the other
block was on here for months and was
nice and cured so these temps would
actually come down over time but as you
can see the speed for the same CPU
clocked 4.4 voltage 3.1.3 100 so as you
can see we are getting custom loop
performance on a smaller radiator and an
all-in-one loop that's cool let's go
ahead and do some final thoughts here
now I could have just as easily left out
the whole part where I killed the
motherboard and just started over but
you know part of doing this especially
when you start modding things or you
start customizing is things can go wrong
and I've killed a 780 through bad BIOS
I've now killed a motherboard because I
just blindly drilled through it without
looking behind there and I learned a
lesson today and one that I can
guarantee that I will not repeat but I
leave these these mistakes in here
they happen because you guys can learn
from that but anyway there you go I hope
this is helped you guys decide that
maybe water cooling custom loops isn't
for you but you do have options out
there where you can get the same
benefits of those temperatures without
having to do all of the legwork or all
the custom building you can literally
just bolt it in as long as it takes to
mount down the block plug in two cables
and then mount the fans to the top of
your case or the front of your case or
wherever you're going to put it so there
you go guys make sure you check out the
link down the description if you want to
preorder this thing I'm not getting any
kickbacks no affiliates or anything but
this is probably one of the most
anticipated water coolers on the market
and we're going to review we're going to
do a couple other tests in the future
here where we compare it to a swift tech
to 20x because I think that's the most
common cooler that people are going to
ask about and we're going to also
compare it to the Corsair h 100 and this
thing coming in yet $200 us sounds like
a lot but go and look up the price of a
lane DDC a 240 mm your cool stream
radiator or a small inexpensive
reservoirs remember you need a reservoir
as well as a iko iko EK supremacy block
add those all together plus the fittings
plus the coolant plus the tubing and
let's see if you can build it for 200
bucks you're not going to build
something this nice for 200 so I think
the price is definitely right on this
alright guys time to get out of here
thanks for watching I'll see you on
social media and if you're not there
then I will see you in my next video I
can't believe I killed the fucking
motherboard I got really lucky that I
didn't kill the CPU RAM and GPU hooked
up to it or anything else plugged into
the motherboard for that matter when you
start when you start drilling through
traces and then bridging them with a
screw terrible things can happen so let
this be a lesson to you look before you
drill I'm fortunate that I had another
motherboard laying around you guys
more than likely don't so please learn
from my mistake Jay is a dickhole</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
