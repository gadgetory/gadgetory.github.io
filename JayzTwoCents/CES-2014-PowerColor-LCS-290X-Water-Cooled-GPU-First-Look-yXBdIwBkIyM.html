insider coverage of CES 2014 our trip
this year is brought to you by aqua
tuning your global source for PC modding
and cooling components and by Sennheiser
the pursuit of perfect sound and of
course by generous viewers like you so
strapped in with Jays two cents as he
takes you on a wild ride through CES
2014 hey guys Jays two cents here at CES
2014 continuing our exclusive insider
coverage and I am here at the power
color sweet checking out some really
awesome graphics card so you guys may
recognize this bad boy right here this
is the 270x devil that has been out
since around October to add some pretty
neat features aftermarket cooling
full-length PCB and of course this
really awesome back plate but we're
going to take a look at some things
today better new for CES and power color
because you guys have been asking about
290x custom cooler solutions and
obviously everybody is responding to at
the same time as there are now a ton of
custom cooler options and that's what we
have right here what I am holding in my
hand is the power color 290x with the
pcs+ cooling option on here this is
available in a 290 and 290x and the
specs on this for the 290x are 1,000 50
megahertz on the core clock for the 290x
and 1040 megahert core clock on the 290
so as you know with the 290 and 290x the
specs are very very similar I mean it's
got 1,350 megahert yeah 1350 megahert
memory speed on there at 5.4 gbps it's
got 512 megabit memory bus width which
is really unique obviously for this next
generation AMD card but what really
makes these coolers unique now is the
fact that they're able to tame the heat
that has just been generated in these
cards now the cooling options that power
colors come out with have generally been
pretty cool now maybe air cooling isn't
your thing maybe you're a water cooler
like I am what I'm holding here is the
power color LCS r9 290x i'm assuming LCS
stands for liquid cooling system now
power color has teamed up with EK to
bring you a high quality water block
right out of the box so you don't have
to take off the water or the air cooler
you not to worry about maybe
warranty they've already done it for you
now the speed on this is 1,000 60
megahertz core clock the same memory
speed at 1350 and it is a 4 gigabyte
model so it's only 10 megahertz faster
than the 290x pcs+ version but you're
going to have a lot more Headroom for
overclocking on this absolutely one
hundred percent silent operation of a
graphics card and you're going to have
just pretty much the ability to say that
you have a badass card here with water
cooling out of the box I mean a lot of
companies have gone with some reference
cooling for liquid coolers and they've
teamed up with some companies but they
just don't look good the power color
pulled out all the stops and went with
EK which we all know is a sexy water
block and of course it has this really
cool looking back play already on there
so even though it's got some heft to it
you're not going to be worrying about
bending the card at all or or yanking it
out of your motherboard because it's got
the support right on there ok so we
talked about the LCS 290x here from
power color but just how does it perform
well we've got an LCS system right here
in this build here at the power color
sweet but we're running battlefield 4
here on an affinity setup so for
clarification we have one 290x LCS in
here and going to come over here and
show the the screens here now this is
using I affinity and right now I have
this set on high settings which I feel
would be where you would want to set the
system for a 3 monitor setup like this
with one card and as you can see we're
just under 50 frames per second over
here so one card that's able to give you
that kind of power and I'm assuming that
it's not even overclocked beyond a
factory now imagine if you were to put
two of these in one system what would be
capable of what you could do with that
so if you're considering building an
affinity setup or surround system or you
just want to go for the ultimate gaming
experience you definitely want to
consider the power color LCS 290x it's
gonna be available hopefully in the next
hopefully this quarter but as you guys
know when it comes to releases and
things anything could change so as for
release you guys are just going to have
to keep checking with power color to see
when that's available but if you you
know you guys know battlefield is an
extremely extremely strenuous game
especially with the new frostbite engine
so and clearly right here it has no
issues whatsoever now I want to see how
it was doing on ultra just for the heck
of it and at 3 x 1080p monitors on ultra
was still
about 30 frames per second solid with no
tearing and no stutters or anything so
there you go guys this has been the
power color LCS 290x here at CES 2014
make sure you're following on twitter so
you don't miss any of our coverage and
as always I will see you in my next
