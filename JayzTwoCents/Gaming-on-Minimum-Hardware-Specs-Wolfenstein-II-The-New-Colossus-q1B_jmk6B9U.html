are keeping with our tradition of
testing new games and their minimum
requirements you guys really liked that
video and you requested that I keep
doing it
so that's we're gonna do so today we're
today we're talking about Wolfenstein -
the new Colossus which is interesting
because it has two sets of minimum
requirements basically it's got a
minimum like a bare minimum for 720p
gaming which I think it's kind of rare
these days I don't think that many
people are giving at 720p but we also
have a set of requirements for 1080p so
we're gonna check both of those out
today this is the best part watches
watches guys's need Celsius x36 from
fractal design yeah so but do you know
what it does yeah it makes things cool
yeah cool hey guys and today I am super
excited to be doing a video with the one
and only next - sense yo
I am excited man so what are we doing
today we're gonna review the Celsius s
36 I get that a lot today what's up sure
I could give you some workout tips how's
tomorrow sound awesome later
and server
the new Celsius as 36 can make almost
anything cooler almost I'm so cool now
the minimal requirements for 720p is an
FX 8350 processor 8 gigabytes of system
memory as well as a r9 290 graphics card
now I don't have that exact hardware so
I'm kind of well Jimmy rigged up my own
set of hardware to be similar to that as
possible
gotta 8320 overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz
which is matching the 8350 fortunately
the 8320 and 8350 the only difference is
clock speed so fortunately there's that
and I'm also running an r9 380 in here
not a 290 because I don't have one but
if you look up both graphics cards on
GPU boss you'll see that they are the
exact same score well I think the point
one difference and even GPU boss said it
can't determine a winner because they're
too closely matched now it also
recommends either an i7 3770k or a gtx
770 i don't have either of those GPUs or
the CPU or the motherboard and CPU combo
but the 770 is a 2 gigabyte vm video
card whereas so is this so I think it's
close enough nice thing is because it's
running Vulcan it gets us all of these
metrics right here that we can see so
this is frame timing right here FPS
frame timing of course our CPU usage
which you can see one of our cores is
pegged pretty normal here we are
starting to ask a lot of an fx CPU
here's our V RAM in our graphics card
now it is running Vulcan so that means
that we should be able to get some
pretty good performance out of emelius
where are you at 720p settings on low
which is what it recommended and we are
sitting in the game in the 120s 130s
yeah I mean this FPS is actually not bad
which has me kind of curious yeah and
yes I know we're just in a starting zone
here in the boat but I think obviously
this is yeah this is this is good it's
good actually what happens if we
actually put this to 1080 now I'm kind
of curious even though we are not at the
recommended now we're gonna be going to
1080 which is not recommended for our
hardware but I'm curious now as to if it
can do it
let's apply that
Louis we're still sitting at 66 six
dances and all the settings are
strolling low though so that's important
to remember it's not easy moving around
in a wheelchair with one hand and a gun
I'm just kind of going around in circles
now but I think the FPS so far we are we
are asking more of this than the minimum
requirements so I think we're okay with
this okay so there's that we're gonna do
right now is we're going to go ahead and
test the 1080p high settings
recommendations which is an i7 4770k
with 16 gigabytes of system memory so
we've got that built out right here
we're also going to be putting on there
once again our gtx 1066 gigabyte card
because that's what it recommends and
we're gonna try 1080p on high settings
and see what we can get so we have to
recommend a 1080p system built 4770k no
overclocking applied whatsoever I just
figured out of the box settings right if
we overclock it we kind of skew some of
that we've got a Founders Edition GTX
1060 again no overclocking and 16
gigabytes of 1600 megahertz ddr3 so I
think it's a pretty rounded system and
we are running as you might guess as our
recommendations are 1080p at high and so
far we've got some pretty good FPS here
I mean we're sitting right around 100
100 FPS as we roll around our little
wheelchair here in Wolfenstein
I'm not really that surprised it's
running this good because of the fact
that I mean it's Bethesda right there
this is running Vulcan the requirements
a little bit higher than doom but fairly
similar I'm surprised though that it has
such a CP requirement I just died I'm
kind of surprised it has such a high CP
requirement though a 4770k for 1080p I I
guess I don't maybe I'm just dumb oh I'm
dead again so running around in a
wheelchair not really my thing this is
just one more time I'm curious so we're
still sitting though at the 100 FPS I
kept regime jump I'm in I'm in a
wheelchair it's kind of silly right okay
go back this way
well I like to I mean you can't tell me
what to do
so the fact that we can maintain 90 to
100 FPS in 1080p high settings makes
sense right but what's funny is their
requirements say that that's for 60 fps
and we were clearly higher than that so
as me thinking that they're being fairly
conservative with their requirements for
1080p so I'm wondering how far we can
actually go now so what I've done is a
just restarted the game with the ultra
settings loaded you have to restart the
game every time you change the profile
like that but I'm curious now as to what
kind of FPS we're gonna get with the
ultra settings and then we'll try it
we'll step it up and see how far we can
actually push this hardware but I mean
so far nothing's changed we're still
sitting 100 FPS here inside the
submarine it'll probably drop down a
little bit though once you're in a
larger world but this isn't a huge like
world game like say something like Ghost
Recon this is fairly linear at least
Wolfenstein usually was seen behind me
yes how many times have I died already
ten at least
I need a death counter yeah oh I'm so
bad at this that didn't really change
fps why is it all did it so let's try it
uber and I know we have to restart the
game we're running over settings right
now and it's still sitting at the same
like about a hundred to 110 FPS I feel
like I'm gonna die when I go down this
thing oh god don't go into the thing
there's all those stupid forcefield
things
yeah I mean this is I'm you know what
I'm having such fun with these types of
videos because don't die I'm having so
much fun with these types of videos
because this is just showing now that
you don't need skunkworks level hardware
you don't need 1080 is you don't need
Vega graphics cards you don't need any
of that stuff to enjoy games when
they're built well like this right here
vulcan is an amazing api dx12 i don't
think it's as good as everyone hoped it
was going to be in terms of performance
overhead but clearly we are running a
what this is almost a five-year-old
hardware platform the 4770k came out and
what 2013 right so we're pretty damn
close to this thing being five years old
the gtx 1060 doesn't cost a fortune and
yet you can still get a hundred FPS in
the game like Wolfenstein 2 which just
launched here at the end of 2017 so
anyway tell what you guys thought about
this right here I this is fun this is
fun now because it actually just really
opens up the door for so many gamers to
see a real-world performance and to see
that there's actually a bit of
conservativeness conservative
conservativism conservative conserve you
actually get better performance with the
minimums then they're actually telling
you because we were able to gain at
1080p with low settings with the initial
720p hardware I mean it was 50 to 60 FPS
but that's the number a lot of people
are looking for that's what we got with
destiny on the minimum hardware so if
that's good enough for destiny it's good
enough for Wolfenstein anyway guys quick
video here just showing you what the
minimums were like thanks for watching
again
give me the titles that you guys want me
to do this with and every time my game
launches I will buy it and I will do
this anyway guys thanks for watching and
as always I'll see you in the next one
I'll go back to my wheelchair simulator
