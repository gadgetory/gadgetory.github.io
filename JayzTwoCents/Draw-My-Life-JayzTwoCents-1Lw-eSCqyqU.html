ahead and jump on this whole draw my
life bandwagon a lot of you guys really
wanted me to do it I thought it would be
kind of hard I didn't really know if I
wanted to throw that much personal life
out on YouTube but I figured what the
heck you guys are fans of Jays $0.02 and
you want to know a little more about me
so I figured I'll go ahead and do that
for starters my real name is Jason and
my middle name is Scott however I dodged
a bullet because my middle name almost
became Rutherford but my dad said hell
no and he put his foot down and my
middle name became Scott I was born on
June 3rd 1981 and what I think is funny
about that it when I look at old family
photos my dad still had an afro but I
was supposed to be born on May 12th 1981
so I was a little late to my own party I
was born in a suburb of Boston called
Newton you guys may have recognized that
name from recent events in Boston
I wasn't born to a very big family in
fact my mother and my father had
previous marriages in which they both
had other kids we'll get more to that
later my dad's name is Robert and my
mom's name is Peggy and I had an six
year older sister and her name is Debbie
she wasn't too keen on having a little
brother in fact she asked at one point
if she could put me back and an
important point there is no e on the end
of her name it is Debbie with Ann I do
not make the mistake of putting an e or
she gets very upset and that's me
running around terrorizing her going
bang bang shooter with guns and really
terrorizing her life because that's what
little brothers do to big sisters as I
mentioned both of my parents had
previous marriages in which they had
other kids by the time I came around all
of the other kids were already grown and
out of the house except for my older
sister Debbie my mom had a daughter
named Nanette she was a half-sister we
call her nan and she has another
daughter which you already heard of it's
my half-sister Debbie she's still close
to me to this day my dad had three boys
on his side he had Robert jr. Daniel and
David and all three of them were also
grown in out of a house long before I
was a twinkle in my mother's eye as my
dad used to say so I don't have very
close relationships with them because I
never really got a chance to know them
my dad was a career military man he
spent over 20 years in the Navy as a
weapons instructor he was in the Seabees
he was also in the frogmen
he did a lot of stuff in the military he
was a bona fide badass you've heard me
talk about him before after putting in
more than 20 years in the United States
Navy my dad retired from the military
and started his own business doing
project management for the government
and private businesses my mom she was a
records keeper and a police dispatcher
for the Dallas Police Department and
then the Ontario Police Department wants
me moved to California she retired and
she worked nights which was fine with me
because I didn't get to see her much
during the day when I was young we had
moved from Newton all the way to Upland
California when I was only one and then
from Upland when I was four we moved to
a little city called Rialto it's about
60 miles east of Los Angeles not a whole
lot to see here most of you have
probably never heard of it can't say I
blame me when I was a kid I remember my
father spending lots and lots of time on
his computer doing programming writing
software working and being a
self-employed entrepreneur and our
entire livelihood depended on it from
the time that I was a little baby
leaving dollops of poop behind me
apparently I can remember my dad playing
around on his computers and as I started
to get older I started to get interested
in computers and my first computer was a
Commodore 64 and it was a really old
computer that you had to do command
lions and hit command prompts to make
the programs run and I was so excited
that I could run my own programs at my
dad I remember him sitting behind me and
saying that's my boy because I was only
three years old the first time I ever
learned how to use a Commodore 64 and if
you've never seen one it's not like
today you don't put in a you know CD and
push play and off you go you had to
manually do stuff my sister on the other
hand since we had such a big age
difference since she was six years older
than me by the time I was old enough to
do anything and that's a cord coming off
the phone by the way we're talking about
80s here I was an annoying little
brother and almost anything I did really
seemed to bother her but I think that's
kind of normal when you have that kind
of age gap leaving my toys around and
I'm asking her to play with me and she's
tell me go away you're annoying and
she's trying to play with her boyfriends
and you know her friends and do the
things that girls do which I didn't
understand whatsoever and to this day I
honestly still don't my parents tell me
that when I was a small child they could
put me on the floor with some toys or a
coloring book or a book and I would
spend hours and hours just playing and
being quiet and not me
Mesa's and just being the best little
boy that you could possibly imagine
because I wasn't a whole lot of trouble
I was very quiet and I was very very shy
but then came the very first day of
school and that all changed I do
remember my first day of kindergarten I
was terrified my mom dropped me off and
she went off to work and I was afraid
because I didn't know what's going to
happen I didn't know any of the kids and
it was very very scary but the school
had this racetrack out front where we
could take our tricycles and we could
ride around and some of them had a wagon
and I always pulled the girls around and
I became a ladies man at the age of
kindergarten and I became known as the
kindergarten pimp no I'm just kidding
but I love school so much I came home
and I haven't shut up since now his
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah school school
school and my mom said I never stopped
talking since the first day of
kindergarten and Here I am going on 32
years old and I'm still talking and
doing it somewhat for a living but as
with most people in school there became
a time when I was bullied I was called
stupid I was called retarded I was
called fat even though it wasn't fat I
was still called fat and of course it
was happening by a group of boys that
were constantly making my life a living
hell and I didn't have any friends so
that made things just that much more
lonely and that much more difficult this
same group of kids every single day
never let up they used to sit there and
block my entrance into the cafeteria and
tell me that I wasn't welcome and that I
was ugly and then I had no friends and
that I shouldn't be in there and I
didn't belong and that I should just go
out into the schoolyard and sit in the
grass by myself and eat lunch because
nobody want to be around me because I
smelled and I spent pretty much every
day of school by myself outside this
didn't only happen at school this same
group of boys would hide behind trees
and hide behind bushes and they knew
where I lived and they would stop
somewhere along the path of the school
in my house and they would wait for me
behind trees and when I would come
riding by on my bike they would be
waiting for me and next thing I know
they're throwing rocks at me and one of
them one time hit me in the face and I
remember falling off my bike and all of
the other school kids were there and saw
it and nobody did anything
we tried to help nobody tried to make
them stop I just was completely alone in
that situation but I do remember one day
in the second grade a new kid moved into
the school and he immediately became my
friend his name was Nathan and he was a
little bit older than me and so he was
kind of like a role model because he
told me don't listen to those guys those
guys are stupid they're you don't worry
about them just come hang out with me so
we did all sorts of stuff together and
we play tetherball and go on the swings
and we talked about games because we had
Nintendo and we just had a really good
time and I wasn't being bullied so much
but one day Nathan told me that he had
to move his father was in the military
and they were moving so once again I
found myself by myself in the playground
rocks being thrown and being bullied
every single day of my life
it was so bad I looked for reasons not
to go to school like every other kid
who's ever been bullied I pretended to
be sick but that only works for so long
before your parents realize you're
faking and they think you just don't
want to go to school but you don't
really tell them the truth because you
just are kind of ashamed that you are
being bullied and you're not sticking up
for yourself one day in middle school
this had been going on for a solid five
years by this point at least this same
kid every single day would keep
pestering me and calling me names and
blocking my way and knocking things out
of my hand but by now I had grown taller
and I had grown bigger but my
self-esteem had been so damaged that I
still allowed myself to be bullied and I
remember once I told my dad about this
bully and his advice to me was defend
yourself so one day this kid cornered me
in the locker room at the gym and he
wouldn't let me leave and at this point
I became very angry and I saw red and I
remember just losing control and I
punched this kid square in the face and
next thing I knew he was on the ground
and all of his friends couldn't get out
of there fast enough I've never been
bullied a day in my life since that
event that's the first time in my life I
felt like I had actually stood up for
myself and my confidence was running
high I was feeling good
nobody was messing with me
and things were going pretty good for me
in fact that computer thing I talked
about earlier the computer aids and the
computer lab used to regularly call me
out of class because they need to help
fixing the computers because they didn't
know how to fix them so you can kind of
consider that my very first IT gig life
went on as it generally has a way of
doing I went into high school and I
became into sports I was really good at
tennis I even coached tennis I played on
the tennis team for the school I played
football I was big I was strong and I
had a lot of friends things were going
pretty good for me and then I noticed I
really was shy I had a hard time talking
to people I girls would approach me and
they would want to hang out and they
would tell me that they thought that I
was cute or that I was funny I didn't
notice it had boobs and I liked it but I
was still really shy but my very first
girlfriend I remember we did everything
together
and one day she cheated on me and she
broke my heart
but that's okay a new girl came along
and once again she cheated on me and
broke my heart
I started to really have a hard time
trusting people because of the bullying
and the girls making fun of me and I
just had a really hard time dealing with
it and I noticed I started to cope with
food and I started to put on weight by
this time I figured who would want to be
with a fat loser like me and all those
things that the kids used to call me
back in grade school and middle school
started to come back and haunt me but
this one girl came and she said I think
you're cute and I think you're funny and
she started to bring back my confidence
and I started to work out and I started
to lose weight I had just graduated high
school and we were falling in love and
when I was 18 I asked her to marry me
and she said yes I was really excited I
thought my life was going forward and I
couldn't wait to see what was next but
one day she told me she was moving to
San Diego because she was going to live
with her mom she had been living with
her grandma up until that point so I
said okay that's fine we can make this
work so every single weekend I would hop
in my truck and I would drive down to
San Diego and she would be there waiting
for me with her boobs and everything was
great and I was happy and she was happy
and we were planning out our life and
I'd spent all of my money to get her an
engagement ring
she lived at the marina in San Diego
which is where they parked the boats and
she lived on a boat I came to surprise
her one day and I brought some flowers I
didn't tell her I was coming down to San
Diego to visit her and one of her
co-workers she worked at the restaurant
stopped to tell me that she was at the
pool so I thought that was a little bit
weird because he had kind of a weird
look on his face so I went to the pool
to see what was going on and there she
was she was in the pool and I could see
her she was kind of swimming around
there were other people in the pool and
next thing I know she grabs one of the
muscley 6-pack Marina guys that you
would expect to see and they kiss and
right as I was walking up I couldn't
believe what I saw and I yelled out what
the hell and she turned around and she
was very sad and that guy she was with
told me to get lost and at that point I
just walked away and she chased me down
and I asked her for the truth and the
truth was a little more than I think
that I could handle because I found out
that there were a lot more people in
fact she had cheated on me 13 times
since we'd become engaged I was entirely
crushed I didn't know how to handle it I
had never at that point been with anyone
who hadn't cheated on me and every
single relationship I had just ended
with the same result of being cheated on
and I thought about ending my life on
that trip home from San Diego and just
driving off of a cliff but I decided
that I was going to get even that this
was Jay's turn to make somebody get hurt
why did I always have to be the one who
was being hurt all the time so I set out
to find somebody that I could get to
trust me and then intentionally cheat on
them that way for once I'm not the one
that's always being hurt so I met this
really cool girl after dating somebody
that didn't work out for only a couple
of days and it turned out that she
thought I was cute and I told her that
she was pretty fly because it was 1999
and that's the way we talked in the 90s
so don't judge me I still think she's
fly to this very day but I told myself I
don't care if I'm falling out with this
girl I'm gonna break her heart because
that's what I set out to do but next
thing I knew I forgot all about those
plans and I fell in love with this girl
and she had entirely rekindled my hope
that maybe I could be married one day
but
alas we broke up because all of the
things that have happened to me in the
past just kept coming and haunting me
and I was a mean person and we broke up
but we got back together and next thing
I know I asked her to marry me and we're
getting married and everything is happy
and it's beautiful and she's got this
gorgeous dress and his beautiful music
playing in October 15th and 2005 I
married my soul mate and you guys know
her today as Miss J's two cents this
woman took me and returned to me back to
the kind of person I thought I was going
to be but something was happening to me
I was changing I was putting on a lot of
weight my self-confidence was gone and I
was turning to food as a comfort coping
mechanism and I had grown to nearly 500
pounds but one day I was on my way to
work and I was sitting in traffic on the
freeway and a big truck hit me from
behind doing 60 miles per hour and it
completely crushed my vehicle and this
is when I realized I had hit rock bottom
because it took eight firefighters to
lift me on the gurney and to put me in
the ambulance I was so big I didn't even
fit in the MRI machines I couldn't even
get a cat scan because I was too big to
fit in any of the emergency room
equipment that's when I made the choice
to get bariatric gastric bypass surgery
and on May 27 2009 one of the nation's
leading experts on bariatric surgery
gave me a laparoscopic version of the
surgery and I began to lose weight and
next thing I know
day after day I'm getting skinnier and
I'm getting skinnier and my confidence
is coming back and I'm starting to be a
happy person again and on April 17th
2009 the best thing that could possibly
happen in my life was about to happen my
wife and I had gone to the hospital and
she had a baby monitor hooked up to her
and she was having contractions and she
was screaming and I was terrified and it
was all worth it because next thing I
knew I was a dad and I was so excited
and it was a girl I couldn't believe it
she was so cute she looked like her mom
she looked like me I didn't know what to
do I was terrified I didn't know what
kind of dad I was gonna be and I've got
my daughter and I've got my wife and
I've got my
health but for some reason that didn't
really seem to make any sort of a
difference because I kept finding myself
sad I still had no confidence because I
had never developed any confidence in
myself because of that group of kids my
entire life that sat there picking on me
and when I was fat and that as an adult
I had adults picking on me so I never
had an opportunity to develop any sort
of confidence so last year on a dare I
started a YouTube channel just where I
wanted to talk about different
technology things that I really liked I
didn't expect it to go anywhere didn't
expect anybody to watch I would have
watched me after all I was a boring guy
but next day I knew people were saying I
was funny and I was cool and I was smart
and my channel was growing and we're
almost 10,000 subscribers sure there's
people on YouTube who still like to say
mean and hurtful things but for every
mean comment there is there's five or
six good comments that you guys give me
that make me feel better about myself
every single day and it makes me want to
go harder it makes me want to try and do
better and it makes me want to bring you
guys the best content that I possibly
can and just keep going and just see how
far we can take this thing together
thank you for that you guys have been
instrumental and getting my confidence
back thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
