live right now and the gloriousness of
60fps because that's what people are
always like what is it that goes to you
people are ok so yeah yeah that'd be
good it looks good to me
I know I might not even use this laptop
I might just use yours cause yours is
nice and light and this one's heavy and
hot and I like the idea Wow look how
smooth that is right account looks a
little reddish but mine looks well I
like the color profile on the monitor
looks good but the problem is the
capture card is not set because it uh
what's up guys so we are doing this now
because well I've got nothing else to
really do today I could have like I said
in Twitter if you guys have been
following on Twitter I could have made a
really half-assed video like more
half-ass than we normally do but I'm in
vacation mode I don't I don't really
feel like you've already checked out the
office I'm not even here right now ok
you hooked your bike like he texted me
like before I even left to work I told
you yesterday I was gonna ride my bike
today no yeah I wasn't expecting so
we're going I needed time to get here
and shower and change and freshen up I
mean this does not just happen
I thought it did my bad this actually
there's effort put into this I'm taking
my shoes off no shoes Club uncomfortable
and once you just sit down let's just
sit down together if you came into this
livestream expecting to see some sort of
produced content then you came to the
wrong place I'm just saying it's Friday
the Friday before my vacation don't
expect anything out of me seriously so
we're gonna do those we're just gonna
hang out for a little bit we're gonna
talk I like to talk to you guys because
you you guys give us a lot of ideas on
how we want to run the channel how what
kind of video content we want to put out
like for instance the review for this
laptop right here of course going into
this we knew the comments we're just
gonna be like oh my god that's an
overpriced pile
crap right and the desktop killer tag in
the title literally with just to trigger
people and it worked
and people were triggered and I love it
and it's fine give me the CD so that it
and and that basically inspired us to
come up with a new series that we're
starting called cool you can't
afford or maybe you know someone even
suggested we drop the cool and just put
 you can't afford
alright then someone had a very good
rebuttal and said but then you need to
counter that with a you can't
afford mmm but but but how can I say
someone can afford something the same
way I can say they can't afford it I
guess a probably more people can't
afford this then can't afford it yeah
but yeah this thing right here is
effective stupidly expensive like I
think I kind of want to do a video where
it's like okay what can you buy Desktop
wise with this like the price of this
because it ranges from $39.99 $43.99 is
this one's configured because it has the
one terabyte raid zero configuration and
then forty $8.99 for the two terabyte
configuration like it would be cheaper
to just buy the $39.99 version and then
put in a single nvme drive and it you
would have more like a single one
terabyte and you have more space in this
little slower readwrite but you'd have
more space in this for less I don't
understand I mean raid zero I get it
it's gonna be it's it's makes the drives
look fat bigger but why not why to 256
and we're not a single 512 why - why -
512 is not a single one terabyte true
you know so there's that well are those
proprietary drives - or easy-to-reach -
if you want change about know you can
easily get to everything on the bottom
okay
people are saying the audios too low I
know you guys think the audio is too low
should we turn it up up the volume why
streaming only at 480 ah your internet
probably sucks cuz I'm got 1080 60
option here I also have 1080 60 yeah
okay
you entertained them while I up the
volume okay we're gonna we're gonna get
turnt up we're gonna turn up buckle your
seatbelts we're going for a ride
yeah like normally I put a filter on
there to help the game uh-huh
give this coffee here trust us they're
just off his coffees their minds right
title with just the troll Jerry that was
pretty obvious but we have copy copy
confirmed did it checking one two audio
is fine I'm not stripping for you check
one two okay there yeah it better be
better feedback yeah okay that should
have improved I mean obviously guys we
have the mic just off camera here which
it looks like we could have gotten lower
with it but you know hello Nick set up
the mic blame him I feel like we can get
closer closer yeah no no our bodies it's
11:00 here so it's two o'clock somewhere
yeah
the mic is making noise because I'm
moving it oh that's too low right there
should be fine right but shot coming in
hold on you got a one for butts okay oh
look this wants to update windows
Dibley not that I'm a machine this one
these news I've been so using this for
it the problem is I've been telling it
fine update but then it goes through the
update and then it comes back later was
like update failed and it just keeps
failing so I'm like whatever I just I
just say forget it
okay as always guys donations on the
stream are not solicited but if you so
happen to feel inclined we will read
those comments
so Daniel Mankato says this may sound
like a stupid question but what if you
were to use alcohol instead of water in
a cooling loop after replacing all the
rubber with silicon I don't know I don't
know what happens when alcohol comes in
contact with nickel and copper and stuff
like that you should probably try it
I know I know alcohol evaporates
extremely fast so I don't know I
honestly don't know I mean I have plenty
of hardware laying around like
cooling stuff no dude that is probably
the most requested topic of water
cooling it's like J what happens if you
just use alcohol should we do it we
should do it if you think we should just
do a cooling loop with no rubber we can
do it with what you do it's hard line
tubing to I think I don't know what the
reactions gonna be with you know what we
should just do it with all the materials
we'll do it with rubber will do a
silicon will do it with vinyl do it with
ptg and acrylic so I have like different
sections of that whole loop may have
different materials yes see efficiency
so instead of having to have all those
loops it's like okay this run is acrylic
yeah this run is final
you know this run is Robert no I don't I
could do rubber we know what's gonna
happen with rubber the alcohol is gonna
deteriorate the rubber and it's gonna
fail how long it's gonna take is a
different question so then we'll do a
ptg run I'm gonna make notes of this
silicon run actually the season remember
because that's do not the drinking kind
you know this might be the the most
professional-looking stream we've done
yet yes nature makes a good backdrop
it's really has suggested that we do
videos sitting against this window and
every time I shoot it down and I'm like
no I don't want to do the outside we
talked to PC nerds they're afraid of
outside there's sunlight it's real
sunlight okay fine
sm4 like s master says hey Jay I'm
trying to figure out if I got a good
1700 in the lottery I can run 3.8
gigahertz stable with Intel burn test at
one point three volts H 115 I at 52
degrees that's
pretty run-of-the-mill actually to me
doesn't sound like a lottery winner get
that sucker to like 4.3 then you have a
water lottery winner heat plus alcohol
equals da-da-da-da-da mmm yeah but if
he's talking about like the combustive
properties of alcohol I it needs to be
it needs a source of ignition not just
heat like a PC loop I don't it's not
gonna get anywhere near hot enough to
ignite alcohol and burn it I mean
usually the water temps are like 25 26 C
at the hottest steering load I don't
think that's hot enough to make if we
burn the place down then you'll know it
was a bad idea you'll have a video to
followup with that it's just a sudden
clip to the fire department yeah
what are your thoughts on pineapple as a
pizza topping I love it
all right I have to be with chicken has
to be chicken yeah see I love Hawaiian
pizza yeah so I'm perfectly fine with
the Hawaiian pizza
barbecue chicken pizza I wouldn't do
barbecue chicken with pineapple but I do
it but it has to be a Hawaiian theme
right so we like Canadian bacon or ham
you know all the non kosher stuff just
pile it up put some pineapple done we
did a pizza once with chicken nuggets on
it remember that dough is awesome cannot
complain 200 something donation what the
heck that's a 200 looks like some sort
of Asian currency hi Jase sir I just
want to say thank you so much for your
great content hope someday you will come
to India oh they're probably peas
probably and I shall meet to you love
from 15 year old fan from India what's
up this guy's family from India you do
don't you I don't think they're still
there no but I mean you you have
heritage for me like my heritage is from
France and Germany yeah yeah a fan fan
or was it DNA that runs back their DNA
with the Jurassic Park you're like a
mosquito flu another that's instant
reset that has your DNA probably they're
gonna recreate the monkey we've
resurrected a man-child know it oh we
got here Jared Reid says what are your
thoughts on put audience without mm-hmm
JB my daddy and there was lots of hype
about the extreme rampage 9 what
happened oh that water cool block
motherboard no I don't have the rampage
I had the I have
the Maximus rampage has always been like
the extreme like that's gonna be next to
99 bro I have the Maximus extreme and I
also have the Maximus formula
she's an alcohol loop you know what
happened I'll tell you what happened a
lot of my my builds around here kind of
ceased mmm because with everything being
so up in the air with hardware I would
just I Nick will tell you it has been a
struggle for me to figure out what I
want to do and how I want to do it
because hardware's just weird right now
right Rison 3 is coming out I'm excited
about Rison 3 sorry I'm excited about
Rison 3 because that that's gonna open
up the entry point for so many gamers to
get into good performance that's not
gonna break the bank because of what
it's what I'm assuming it's gonna do I
don't know the pricing yet guys and yes
I do have my rise in 3 chips they came
like a week and a half ago or a week ago
they are in my opinion going to replace
the FX series as we know it today
because the FX right now the 8320 8350
whatever they are they're kind of your
your entry point right you can spend the
same 80 bucks to 130 bucks depend on the
ones you get and get an Intel i3 or a
pentium Edition which is okay like I pcs
are okay on that but you stuck a dual
course at that point the hyper threading
I three like we took a look at and put
on the Shelf once we were done which was
a waste of money a 180 bucks for a hyper
threading i3 that there's no point in
that so I'm really hoping that the four
core for thread performance on Rison 3
possibly being sub $100 that's I'm more
excited about that I'm more excited
about the cheap stuff you guys might not
believe me when I say that because
brands are very like we want to send you
our best right yeah because they want
they want to dominate the church they
want to look like the best but they
always tend to forget about price to
performance I can't tell you guys how
many times I've requested a lower tier
product and then been sent the top to
your product this laptop is a perfect
example I requested the blade I
requested the 14 inch blade and they
sent me the clip rope so it is what it
is you know mm-hmm
and so what we started doing guys is we
just started buying this
we just started buying it because the
companies don't want to support our our
push for price to performance so I just
started spending my own money corporate
money on the parts that you guys see
that are that are entry-level and if
that's what we got to do and that's what
we got you Amy but in the end it pays
off well it's great to have around too I
mean we always make our money back right
because it costs us a few hundred
dollars to do those types of videos they
always make more than a few hundred in
the end the thing is I'm out now the
money now and then it takes 60 days to
get that money back yeah you know so I
was like don't you tell me the streaming
machines trying to update no yeah doing
something oh it says restart now hold on
Windows 10 on all of our
machines are just trying to like we
really are day yeah geez how you heard
that right
and then I'd like to restart now popped
up with a little timer like No okay it's
like a bomb
let's see Bobby Middendorf says huh hey
J all right J I'm building a custom case
with water cooling in mind could you
look at it let me know if it could be
improved I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
click your link but what I can tell you
is airflow is airflow regardless of its
air cooled or water cooled you just keep
open air flow in mind that's why the SMA
eight case that I use it's just one big
open cube and you can't ask for anything
more
when it comes to air flow also to put
plenty of intakes on the front of your
case that way you can promote positive
pressure if you're using radiators as an
exhaust a lot of companies will put like
you know three exhaust fans on top and
an exhaust fan in the rear but they'll
give you two intakes mmm so then you're
you're kind of stuck with possibly a
neutral to negative pressure situation
and if you have a smaller form factor
case then you're gonna want to put rads
maybe in the front and the exhaust so
try and balance it out that's my biggest
and and keep obstructions to a minimum
you don't need to have solid front
panels that are blocking air flow you
need to have drive cages right behind it
I think a lot of people who do water
cooling would happily sacrifice some
storage space for air flow I
you know even today like you could get
SSDs a little bit cheaper and just mount
on the back of your case it allows it
yeah no that's that's true there's also
now Intel obtained which we're doing a
review on Intel obtained when I come
back from vacation about how to get SSD
like performance oh the fans hitting
your hairs it happens to me ya know if I
push the bottom of the case like he can
hear the fan oh like if I bring my fans
too close like I hear it oh no my knee
was pushing up on the grill which was
pushing into the fan actually because
it's thin metal right there anyway so
the idea of Intel octane is being able
to basically have a cache drive it 16
gigabyte cache drive for your up if your
mechanical drive that will give you SSD
like a SATA SSD not like nvme m2 stuff
no but like SATA SSD performance what
with the capacity of a hard drive so
we'll be doing that as well how to deep
clean a motherboard six years of being
an ear smoker I could see the oil layer
building up what could I do
is it worth the effort alcohol swabs is
about the best you can do
alcohol is not gonna hurt your
components alcohol will also dry very
evaporate very quickly that's about the
best you're gonna be able to do and just
air it out because my old case I got
back head babe juice like you can see it
is vape all over the place so oh because
of your friend you lent it to ya I went
to him but I let the air out it's going
down I know who you are
blowing that douche I know who don't
piss off the vapors man they might revit
you big nation I'm falling behind on
some of the donation stuff here guys
some problem the donations is it coming
so quickly
hey Jay Ben watch you forever and you
inspired me to make a channel thanks for
all you guys do would you use thread
Ripper for main production absolutely
absolutely but I need to get my hands on
it first I'm gonna say we're going to an
AMD event later on so hopefully we'll
learn some more just like anything else
it comes down to how the real-world
performance translates and we have not
received that data yet so takes time
um and again if I miss your donation I
apologize I really do we see if I can
pull up the archive was there waited for
them yeah I can do it on the control
panel and you can kind of go through
some of the comments while I'm agreeing
this up one third cat one third youtuber
one third gamers Vega Effie worth it we
haven't tried Vega yet okay so Alex
offered to send me a Vega Vega frontier
edition so I don't know I mean we're not
that far away from Vega gaming edition
but I okay so a lot of the a lot of the
focus like PC / did a really good video
on it
gamers Nexus did they all they have
these stuff you guys have seen out there
so far it's pretty much been purchased
by the outlets that are showing it cuz
AMD didn't send those and gaming
performance has been lackluster but the
frontier founders Edition card parts at
the frontier the Vega powders Edition
card though is not a gaming card like
AMD themselves has said this card is not
designed a particular card as we know it
as a frontier Edition with the BIOS and
stuff that's on there is not set up for
gaming it's set for deep learning and
all that sort of stuff they they're
trying to compete directly with like the
Titan stuff and whatnot from Nvidia in
terms of that aspect of of GPU compute
power now I personally seen that that
you guys can't see it but that three fan
card in the case over there is a fire
pro card and it is the exact same card
that we knew as the 77 90 okay or this
is or is it seventy nine ninety I care
what the numbers were which was a dual
GPU gaming card it's the exact same
hardware with different firmware and if
you took the firmware and swapped it
that card could become a gaming card and
it's game performance goes way up and
it's compute power goes way down so the
firmware and the BIOS have a lot to do
with the performance of the card so I'm
expecting Vega to hopefully be that
because there's been a lot of hype
around Vega and if it doesn't deliver
this is gonna be a really weird scenario
where we have the CPU division AMD
finally competing and performing where
you want it to be but then the graphics
division which is always been decent
falls back
huh I mean time will tell yeah okay so I
have my PC of a two sapphire r9 390x
Nitro paired with a 700 X at 4 gig
gigahertz do you think Rx vega is for me
recently moved from z170 with 660 700 to
1700 X this is the best experience I had
I would expect your Vega rx performance
to be better than a 390 X it has to
because then you're talking a gaming
card versus another gaming car and if a
previous gen standard PCB layout
graphics card like the 390 X is not
being beaten handily by a 3d Ram or 3d
memory card like Vega with HBM then
what's the point so it has to beat it
now I can your asked you can't ask me
advice on what I think you should do
about a product that's not out yet you
can't I just can't
that's irresponsible to make
recommendations to people on a piece of
product I have not personally tested it
ok is there a market for enhance the
efficiency liquid cooling feasible to
compete you know if the compact system
can get theoretical sub m8 temps that's
a bit confusing but I'm guessing liquid
nitrogen
L&amp;amp;T no no no the problem liquid nitrogen
is it is it's a it's a temporary cooling
mmm it evaporates yeah like if you guys
look at my video we did a Computex when
we did the EVGA press day mm-hmm we did
a video with kingpin and he actually
demonstrated that he has a closed-loop
nitrogen system which is really neat but
that's not efficient by any means I mean
they have to read with the level of
overclocking they're doing and how much
nitrogen they go through or ln2 they he
said they have to fill those tanks like
weekly and it's like 150 liter days look
like half of the room yeah that set up
ok so I've got all the super Chesser
here ok yeah and there's a lot of them
holy crap guys let's go from top to
bottom
yeah looks like it
the new ones just come in yeah new ones
coming in the bottom that's weird
so newest is on the bottom okay let's
see Cuba 42 says love your stuff my pump
doesn't owe you you keep an eye on the
main chat okay I'll keep an eye on the
superjet Cuba 42 says love your stuff my
pump doesn't always start with the
computer usually requires me to fiddle
with it I can feel it stutter and give
up its DDC so like anything else the
pump is a bearing and bearings do wear
out that's why if you run pumps at full
speed they can over time wear out the
bearing could wear out the electronics
can wear out and it's probably time for
a new pump and that's if you if you hit
it and it starts to go sometimes that
means the the impeller I don't if you've
ever seen inside the DDC just like the
d5 it's just a magnet in there okay and
it spins on a magnet and so that can
start to get off balance and touch the
side and get kind of wedged which is why
if if you smack it and it starts to go
what's that funny like you'd imagine you
smack in but it's much a lot you've seen
me do it before yeah it's a lot more
violent is it if you have to do this
it's time for a new pump there's no fix
Zebby thanks for all your videos it's
given me so much started water cool
because of you and there is a new
computer coming coming
custom loop wait and there is my there
is in my new computer coming custom loop
I think we're dealing with a English not
as the foreign or the first so I'm doing
my best here I'm starting with soft
tubing like they spoke to me this this
thing and go up later love your work
thank you there's nothing wrong with
soft tubing it's not if you get good
tubing like the LRT stuff from primo
chill the problem with cheap soft tubing
is like happened with yours
yeah is it leaches plasticizer and
plasticizer is what makes it soft and
malleable okay and that starts to make
it look cloudy and kind of film filmed
up inside and that's the definition of
cheap tubing and the good to me now what
I could remand to if you don't want to
deal with that is get colored tubing
white black you can get red blue green
just to fill it out yeah so you can have
a colored theme without worrying about
the fluid changing colors or worried
about plasticizer clouding up your
system
anything in the main chat you wanna talk
about uh not yet
blink twice if what if JC sense is
holding you captive only myself captive
holding itself Kat why would you do that
hmm you know I'm pretty I'm pretty
positive that oh we have to finish wait
to finish registering for the AMD thing
today oh don't let me it's like people
know when I'm going on vacation nick has
seen it firsthand it's like my email my
phone everything blows up it's just
everyone's like oh my god Jay we need
your attention before you go it's like
no you don't I'm gone I'm good
peace out let's see I already answered
that one about the thread Ripper
computer oh are you guys judging the
EVGA commercial contest
no no it's all being handled internally
all I'm doing is building the system
that were giving away they they asked me
if I would be willing to do a custom
build and they're providing most of the
hardware I'm providing all the articles
stuff through sponsorship of course and
probably going with prima chill on that
one
and I'm gonna do all the custom hard
line tubing and all that stuff and then
they are gonna be shipping it off but
it's going to be built and if the winner
wants signed by me I'll tag your system
and devalue it some you should just get
little plaques with like your signature
see you know what riveted I know look at
the Nismo plaques in the car yeah just
get a bunch of those I heard a trash
check are you really into Diesel's no
that wasn't a diesel truck that that's a
street sweeper that sounds terrible
don't worry about he's in the street
sweepers you guys for it oh my god it's
like a that's like um it's like a LNT
choice I love Ellen to take our
deliveries here no scam that's what we'd
be dealing rate here yeah it's for them
it's for the bar yeah yeah we're by a
bar whose convenience guess where we're
going right oh you taught that ribbing
yeah okay oh man so sure I'm not gonna
tell them any details yeah cuz I already
put out a tweet right
saying if i started a gt3 we started a
gt3 Cup team and made a channel about
would you guys watch any people thought
we were talking about sim racing no
we're talking about the real
thing oh I guess yeah I was hyped about
that a lot of people work yeah a lot of
people know we're talking about doing
the real thing no not me driving hell no
no no a professional driver professional
team right now we've already started
communicating with a few manufacturers
we hit up Bentley McLaren we got a quote
back from McLaren a little out of our
price range though
what about out Heat I don't know we
didn't talk to out yet but yeah the
McLaren quote came back at like 1.5
million so I know but this is we're
trying really hard to make this happen
hey a YouTube funded and sponsored race
team was so sweet no one's done that if
you try and do it now and then you're
copying us sorry TJ millennial dead
option oh we already do that one went
third winter okay
Fiat those Slav lips Chet I'm sure I
mutilated your name hey Jay I have my PC
with two semi where did that one do me I
think so recently moved from his do you
want something yeah okay so you've
answered that one greetings from Germany
hi grete they normally say greets from
Germany cuz like greetings like
translates directly to Greece oh this is
a funny-looking barnacle huh yeah I got
coffee it's right here it's white girls
coffee but it's okay to be 'basic
unbasic bitch okay answer that one lyric
Jay I did a thing thanks for the
inspiration I can't send links but it's
a case lads gallery ooh the case I'm
also gonna be doing something at
September with case labs it's me cool
some cool stuff coming up
I knew Bismarck thank you for the
donation where's Jerry just kidding love
you too in the stream thank you
where's Jerry I don't know I imagine
he's off doing history maybe I like the
rooms i like the pilgrims to be careful
with the alcohol has a low boiling point
local KVA ssin bubbles forming and it
will eat away at your metal needs to
stay below a DC
oh god dude the fluid it's like I said
the water never gets higher than like
2060 yeah so unless alcohol just
inherently gets harder because it
absorbs more which I highly doubt it's
gonna absorb three times or four times
as much
we should stay way below EDC if he's
talking about fluid temp so that's why
whatever hardware we do this with we
have to expect to just write it off as a
loss you know I mean go full line us on
that that's a risk you Lana take no go
whoever wins Barney please looks
different this morning must be the new
coffee crazy dad damn house is good
evening from the UK daughter daughter
just started pc gaming as a dad would
you recommend her first is a potato PC
or something for her friends to be
envious of you know that really comes
down to you as a parent so I'm all for
spoiling my daughters when they deserve
it
but I'm also I'm also a hard-ass parent
when I need to be do you agree yeah my
daughter's been playing games now since
she was five so and she's eight and a
half well eight now so she's been
playing three years on the same a ten
7850 k APU with they had a 240 250 in it
no r7 250 in it and then I upgraded her
to a 380 X but it's still running the
same system and she's really been
bugging me for a new one
but every time we go to do it man she
she turns on that little attitude and
then I tell her I'm not building a new
PC heck no so it's it's up to you as a
parent building her something no for a
friends to be envious of I feel like
this is my parenting advice take it or
leave it
I feel like that's putting the wrong
attitude in your child because that's
gonna promote bragging no one likes a
braggart and I wouldn't want my daughter
going making people who have less than
her feel bad because my daughter is very
fortunate she has lots of stuff we have
lots of stuff but the last thing I want
is for people around her to feel bad
because I don't have what she has I mean
that's just as terrible that's gotta
keep strong on a lot of levels got to
keep in the humble zone but I can also
understand from the dad perspective that
you just want the best for your kids
Yeah right so
it's it's a heart but it's a hard thing
for me but I certainly don't I certainly
don't spoil her it is still worth buying
a razor blade gtx 1060 2017 now are my
better off waiting for the 11th gen and
be the gps live your channel dude they
just started the the 1080 max q GPUs I
don't think we're gonna see another
mobile GPU for a while honestly we might
see maybe a max Q like 1070 maybe but I
feel like this should have had him
execute it honestly McGill Warren this
is it's just sitting here like you feel
like feel the topper here that feels
like Milan is running like better load
yeah yeah this is just sitting here idle
looking at the stream it is it's toasty
my lap is getting sweaty
that's my bed don't look at it I would
recommend for someone that needs a
laptop that's portable and good for
gaming this guy right here this stealth
I love this stealth I love this self huh
I do too yeah this is that one I did the
review of and this winded up being his
graduation present that we gave him and
it's thin it's a really thin form factor
super 7700 HQ and it's got SSD as well
as a 1068 and the monitor his oh it's a
hundred twenty Hertz yes 1080p cam that
is like yeah and it came in at like
$14.99 so 1500 bucks and it for what it
is it's a great it's a brushed aluminum
I can't say anything bad about it
honestly other than it's very smeary and
smudgy just like this one but because
it's got that brushed aluminum yeah it's
a nice finish but it's a little
difficult to keep clean yeah it's still
worth my look J do to tighten XP cards
overclock better than to EVGA 1080i for
the win three cards I should've just
wait for two kingpins now the kingpin is
still the same core as a 1080i okay the
kingpin itself as it ships is not going
to really be any faster than a for the
win three on air it's still a tear the
difference is it's a guaranteed 2025
overclock so there binned now 2025 just
about every GPU we got come through here
achieves that so I mean it's a guarantee
so it kind of takes some of
that lottery aspect out of it but it
comes with a completely custom power
delivery system built onto the board
it's not the same power delivery that's
on the for the win three which a lot of
people have been spreading this
information going odds just it's just
got a copper cool or it's the same thing
as before the wooden three no it's
completely different power design and
that's only gonna be beneficial to
people looking to do exotic cooling to
try and break records and do
overclocking as a hobby if that's not
you then don't wait for the kingpins the
tenant the Titan XP though has more cuda
cores than a 1080i core and it is much
faster than my tight necks pascal's but
not the newest Pascal card on water so
yeah and I'm running mine on water at
twenty fifty both of them on SLI at home
with skunk works and the ones I put in
Terry's bill just decimated mine by a
lot and I thought I thought maybe we'd
be talking a little bit of a difference
here no a Long's yeah so yeah and those
two cards I put in Terry's system we're
still the only 2x piece I got my hands
on and they were gone two days later
right so I still don't have any
long-term experience with him oh he's a
good one do you ever think about doing a
budget gaming build for around five
hundred six hundred seven one seven
hundred we've already done that yeah but
it died so where we gonna start that
back up again remember that well it died
because I pushed it really hard I was
like we could just keep overclocking
overclocked I still think the CP might
be a good actually
quite a few people messaged me
afterwards now I was very aware that
that gigabyte ud3 board it's got like
five revisions to that board they kept
making changes but a lot of people have
been messaging me going dude it's your
board it's your board I guarantee it's
the board it's like the third ud3 I've
had and I'm not I'm not an experienced
with the ud3 it could very well be the
board the the system we did the video on
my sister system we're more shut down on
us yeah that's also a ud3 board I'm so I
see a trend look at the reviews okay but
anyway I just haven't had time to tear
that apart and see if that CPU is still
good because to be honest like I said
that that that train has left the
station
Rison three is gonna replace all of that
FX stuff in terms of budget builds so
when rise and three comes out you will
see ultra-low costs build guides from us
where our ideas like we've got to
stretch 500 bucks
my own money again cuz I love I'm not
putting my own money on the line because
it makes me think so much different you
put more effort you've seen me sit there
and struggle with like oh my God where
do I want to spend this money yeah when
we have a warehouse full of parts and
then it's like I'm struggling to pick
the parts because now there's so much
more on the line I take yeah but it adds
that element like it puts you in the
other person's shoes like hey I have 500
it forces you to use that and not
stretch it also to there is not a single
build guide or parts list you can put
together that the PC master-race is not
gonna just on and tear apart and
say you did this wrong or you should
pick this or you should have went with
that then no matter how you do it you're
wrong any price point you're wrong I
also think it's timing though because
sometimes you get really good sales and
sometimes you don't like we kind of
cheat a little bit too because we live
local to a micro Center where we get
stupid discounts because the CPUs are
already all under under cost mm-hmm and
then they're like buy a motherboard and
save 30 more dollars so it's yeah it's
easy it's easy to do a $500 bill that
micro Center but the idea I kind of want
to do next is either a 500 where we
spend it at Newegg or like Amazon where
the pricing is much more comparable to
what everyone has access to you I still
think like a crisis challenge would be
kind of cool oh you mean scrapyard Wars
yeah I mean any time you buy used parts
now you're just gonna be compared to
scrapyard wars and that's what I tried
doing with my build just all up kinds of
this but things fell through so I just
started buying it on my own yeah like
you you got that 7700 K and that
motherboard combo you know then you saw
that like you could have got the same
pretty much the same combo Microsoft for
the same price for brand-new yes I mean
you could have you would have spent
maybe 25 bucks more yeah cuz you got a
he got a Strix ZT 70 board for it and
you could have with the discount on the
motherboard and then the CPU only
costing 279 there you mean you could
have got it for the same
yeah but oh well Oh sir you have to make
the drive out yeah it is now we're gonna
have to two hour round trip drive hey
Jay I have a 68 50 K I can get for point
1 gigahertz on 1.35 volts but I can get
four point six table 1 point 4 volts
would you run one point four volts to
get a 500 megahertz
it depends on what you're doing if you
need the 500 megahertz if you're doing
workflow like rendering editing live
stream or whatever where the core clock
is everything like premier loves pork
flock core clock is king with premier I
will see more of an improvement by
overclocking a CPU farther than taking
another CPU at the same frequency range
and adding cores if that makes sense
so core clock is everything with some
programs if that affects you then yeah
as long as you can keep it cool I tend
to run my processors though the x99 and
when that's once you exit to 9 I haven't
tried overclocking that yet I run mine
at one point three five volts daily on
water which is perfectly fine I have run
one point four but the problem is that
once you go above one point three five
then they heat kind of like
exponentially goes up so you might find
that going for one point three five to
one point four might add 15 C you know
what I mean
because it just starts to really curve
up but I would I would say maybe try one
point three five at four point five or
four point four and call it a day hey J
I was looking to buy a 27-inch
2k 165 Hertz monitor is warning of a
1080 is good enough for ultra settings
and games or should I just grab it 1080
TI $200 difference between those cards
at 1080 depending on the title should
get you close to 165 FPS but 1080 Ti is
gonna pretty much guarantee it at 1080p
so yeah my answer is the same every time
when someone asked me like J should I
get a 1080 or should I get a 1080 TI
that if the budgets there get the 1080i
yeah you're gonna you're gonna have
longer longevity out of the card right
right a greater longevity another Claire
I think some might dare to call that
future proofing
we love the term future-proofing in the
PC master-race don't we
how does how do you breach your proof -
boy here's a video title for you guys
how did future proof to avoid your
bottleneck oh my god the amount of the
amount of cringe and just the the
saltiness that would be in that video
not for me from the audience
anything you want to say I might be
talking a lot compared you he's quiet
as a man if you were that ya found
anything all those comments going by and
nothing
well 1080i equals 800 now that's only a
$50 increase
why not banana monkey because coconut
that's why no my gosh
yeah I'll try no promises
sorry boogies been DMing me a lot right
now casino he's getting ready to add his
gastric bypass oh so he's like he's like
really like just nervous
as expected yeah yeah even he was text
me a bunch of updates cuz he got his
surgery was postponed because they saw
something is echo cardio
so they ordered an EKG they want to make
sure it's heart strong enough for
surgery what people don't realize is
when you're really big when you're a
really big guy and you go under
anesthesia it's a huge strain on your
body it's a huge strain on your heart
and so when your heart is already under
huge stress because when you're that big
you've got all that tissue has a supply
blood - it's constantly it's like it's
like 60 psi on stock internals right
when you go under when it's already
under stress you go under anesthesia and
it's under more stress that's that leads
to possible death on the table so
they're there they're crossing their TS
and dot in their eyes before they put
him under the knife and so he's just
been texting me kind of venting a little
bit lots of redundancies well I mean you
got it
the person yeah.well already and I know
this is kind of off topic but we'll get
back on topic um
already he for the longest time for a
couple of years he's been trying to get
the surgery mmm but it was a catch-22
because doctors were like we don't want
to operate on you you're too big he's
like the point of the surgery is to save
the life of a guy like me who's too big
right yeah
and all of the politics società lose it
naturally just whatever that all that
aside it's an intervention technique
okay I had it right and you look at it
this way like basically when a doctor
tells someone like him we're not gonna
operate on you
that's like can that's saying here's
your death sentence hey he's 42 years
old that most people that are over 500
pounds don't live to be 42 years old so
he knows like okay something has to be
done yeah and this is a huge deal this
is this is a huge commitment he's making
and so he's like mentally ready for it
he's been on his liquid diet and
Stephanie gets a call yesterday or day
before and he's like they're postponing
my surgery he's like freaking out
because he's already just kind of like
okay I'm trying to get myself where I
need to be I'm scared I'm making a life
change I don't know what to expect
am I gonna die during surgery and he's
like ready and then suddenly he's told
like we're postponing a week because
that just is like a slap to your
psychology yeah you know anyway back on
topic um what about the beauty of DZ
that's his yeah that's fine
you might people still think I
have a 350z and I sold it two years ago
almost you gotta oh hello I bought the
370 Thanksgiving Day 2015 I got the
Texan thanks cutie like what are you
doing it's like I got kayaking like oh
yeah but what's funny what's what I love
so much is when and this is this is
asshole Jay I'm sorry if this is you but
it has to be said when someone will put
in the comment section oh my god that's
the most beautiful 350z I've ever seen
it seen 350z with hearts e melodies it's
like if you love the 350z so much you
would know that's not a 350z you
just said you loved it yeah okay anyway
as a car guy as a car guy you guys
that's like someone pointing to your 10
atti and going oh my god I love that ten
seven I love that rx 580 it's the same
thing so of course it's gonna trigger me
foxie studio says hey Jay NIC thanks for
the awesome videos I've learned so much
so I want to give you guys something
back much love from Denmark and keep up
the
good work love you both no homo will
love you homo - it's fine especially for
that 200 DKK donation have no idea what
that translates to but I'm gonna pretend
that's like $2,000 thank you sir
Jaya have an msi r9 390x gaming I
literally cannot overclock anything or
undervolt at stock without artifacting
and fire strike ideas by Nvidia no
that's not that's not me being an AMD
hater
that's just AMD graphics cards have
never been known for their overclocking
and say the last four generations mm-hmm
okay you had that problem when we play
battlefield 2 like way back in the day
you said AMD I never had and egrets
first I'd my AMD CPU okay I had a 570
and then have 518 and a 680 and that's
780 we've had 780 sli that 780 3 Way SLI
and then had 980 3-way SLI and that was
to let 580 by them and then I skipped
980ti altogether I never put 980 eyes in
my system and then I went straight to
1080 mm-hmm and oh no I skipped 980 I
because I want me tight Nick Maxwell
3-way SLI and then from Titan X Maxwell
to Titan X P X that was kind of
clustered because it is still a cluster
and then I went back to 2 way because 3
Way is no longer supported by my what is
your best GPU RMA experience I'm dealing
with a terrible one right now I'm
probably not the right guy to ask you
understand
the unfortunate thing and I say
unfortunate but it's a nice thing to
have but the unfortunate thing is when I
have a problem
brands fall all over themselves to make
it right because I'm a person of
influence and I leverage that at times
like for instance my 780 remember when I
was doing the custom BIOS flashing and
brand-new one brand new one the day I
got it
I I wrecked it I bricked it because I
flashed the wrong BIOS to it
and it was an EVGA card and I had just
started working with EVGA at that time
like they sent me like a 750ti to do a
review on they didn't send me 780 s
because they didn't know me I didn't
have a big channel they were like well
we'll send you 750 Ti
because when you work with a brain
and that's new to you usually they'll
send you something that's more or less
like if you walk away with it they have
less of a loss you don't fulfill your
end of the bargain I like applying for
your loan
exactly so what what what I did was I
basically hit up EVGA and I was like
guys I bricked this card I was straight
up with them I could have just been like
I don't know whatever not know I told
him guys I was doing BIOS flashing and I
bricked it I can't get it back
and they are I made it for me okay but
they could have also been like sorry
can't do it that's all on you yeah the
prop the thing is an average consumer
probably would have gotten the you're
 out of luck response you know and
then to be completely transparent
I have not dealt with video card RMA's
prior to YouTube I never had a video
card die on me so I never had to
experience that
so my experience from our Emmys today I
don't feel like are directly comparable
to the general public now
now what if we did this have me do it no
no yeah that's the secret shopper Yeah
right what if we start auditing the RMA
experiences amongst these brands
ourselves because we are in a position
where if the brand's just were like Jay
you're cut off we're not sending you
nothing no more I'd be like bye I've got
the funds to run this channel myself
yeah so if a brand didn't like that we
exposed bad army experience we could
just still float the company ourselves
but I think warranties and standing buy
your product isn't as important as the
product performance itself when do you
agree yeah totally completely agree
totally
we'll call the we'll call it the I know
would call but definitely it would be
like a yeah that person it would
definitely be like auditing the RMA
experience no secret shoppers do you get
an A or do you get an F are you okay
with the scene yeah there's always that
student that's like oh my god I got to
see my parents gonna kill me yes I
survived does that guy that got a
d-minus and they're like yeah I'm
graduating right there's a certain
cutoff Jay is so privileged and my
private is
the pigment of my skin is that why I'm
privileged no my because I work hard
near a dumbass just to have a tree in
the morning love your videos do you
remind me a lot of my friends older
brother is that a good thing
not only the PC enthusiasm but also he
looks like the TV could be almost twins
poor guy it had that conversation like
what if you had a twin to work for you
like if there are two days
Oh two days two days easy Justin slagle
is asking so Nick has a new car
I'm loving it I can't wait to start
modding it or I make up army undercover
army brands watch this stream so you
guys might want to expect something pop
quiz here we go what I mean surgery we'd
have to register the product and
everything with like a burner account
yeah what we do is we like take the
cooler off and just like mess up the
thermal paste and put it back on
most of these brands don't put warranty
stickers like oh yeah a lot of them some
do most don't just like restarted and
Quality Assurance for everybody just by
saying that we are the industry QA you
got to get drunk on live stream again
you're such a useless useless drinker
absolutely would you guys ever do retro
so what am I wait useless drinker what's
a useful drinker I have never met a
useful drinker
well I guess I mean beer pong and stuff
that's that's when they could win cuz
they could just keep drinking even if
you guys lose so you keep playing but
you gotta get better like you gotta be
good female Christensen says I'd donate
to a JC since racing team make it happen
and what TV channel would it be shown on
then I say about this is we wouldn't be
taking no donations for this it'd be
it'd be all venture capitalists money so
Oh would you guys ever do retro 70s
deaths on to ATX build of course they're
just hard to find yeah
that'd be pretty fun though is a 78 20x
worth it for gaming and a bit of video
production currently 6700 K guys give up
your awesome work I would say stick with
your 6700 K if you're only doing a
little bit of video production 6700 K is
perfectly fine and like I said earlier
with premier loves core clock those can
overclock decently push it to 4.6 4.7
call it a day don't spend don't spend
money on adopting X 299 for something
you're not spending the majority of your
time doing it yeah
bo Kelly asks have you ever thought
about doing a collab with a case maker
to come out with your own case line
maybe a limited edition from fractal or
keas labs the problem is the amount of
money that goes into the tooling of case
production mmm
I think the last estimate I was told
once by one of the manufacturers and
we're not talking manufacturers that
make super custom stuff like the cosmos
special edition sitting over there right
is just the tooling cost not the
manufacturing cost the tooling cost of
getting tools and CNC machines and
benders and all that stuff set up to
make a case runs north of $100,000 oh so
that's a hell of an investment from
someone to invest into me and say J
helped us design a case yeah right I've
had brands approached me for J's $0.02
Edition stuff so far nothing's come
through but for a case that we kind of
unique though because I'd like to see
what you do for it I'd like to see what
I would do I don't know like this said
she'll is I'm designing something yeah
that'd be cool
any thoughts on AMD thread river or GPUs
I answered that earlier I don't I don't
give my thoughts on rumors you'll get my
thoughts when I get my hands on it if I
we get our 99 TX is a decent price would
it be worth it now miners screwed up the
RX market 290x is a bit dated man people
I I people I know who so have a 290x are
starting to struggle do you let my CPU
use liquid metal on top of CPU - I've
seen the videos that are out there
people using the liquid metal it showed
like a 4 to 5 C drop on air I don't know
about the longevity of it I also don't
know about
um conductivity of it like if you put a
little bit too much and it squirts out
the side and gets on the PCB what's
gonna happen it's gonna short it out I
don't know so I'm not very familiar with
the liquid metal stuff that people have
been using see Ricky Merton hey J try
gurgling water is he not - keep clearing
your throat also live channel needs more
planty planty um yeah I should gargle
water on live stream yeah that's what I
should do now my throat's dried today
because I rode to the room I bike to the
office and I tend to ride like Michael
Jordan dunks it's like yeah I used to
chew gum when I would ride cuz it kept
my mouth moist this is this is these are
things you just want talk money in a big
league chew I like to keep my mouth
moist keeps my throat moist what's a
favorite gum to chew excited for rising
three line up planning a build for my
daughter who is 5 to play some basic
games personally I would love to go
overkill on it but the wife is being an
overbearing voice of reason that's what
wives are for solution don't have kids
don't have wife but if you have if you
have a picky car it's kind of the same
thing yeah it costs just as much moving
on moving to you liquid soon any tips or
tricks for a noob don't spill it you
know I've done some videos about water
cooling for noobs if they're a bit dated
but they they still apply I mean we
should do a new one with the nice
production value but yeah it's funny
when people get mad like Jay you've
already done that video and then I'm
like did I and I look it up and it's
like I did it in 2013 things obtained I
did it in my living room it was the
worst production value ever so trying to
do it and make him again and make things
look a little bit more bearable with
recycled content I mean come on I mean
Simpsons already did it it's already get
to update it though because like you
know especially like back then things
weren't as unique or upgraded to scale
up to what they all right now sorry that
didn't sound right at all
I'm just trying to get what you're
saying but things aren't scaled up to
what they are today like it's a lot
easier to get a hold of water cool
like a ton easier because they come in
kits like there's definitely more kits
today but I would say the parts
availability from when I started this
channel five years ago till now hasn't
really changed I mean you still have
your outlets performance - pcs comm is
the main one now ever since the frozen
CPU debacle few years back I actually
argue and say there's probably less
water cooling outlets today than there
used to be in terms of where to buy the
parts mmm
but more of these companies have now
started focusing on all in all-in-one
kits that you assemble but it has
everything you need you have to worry
about it being compatible what you have
now though is more blocks for GPUs and
there ever been back back in the day and
I say back in the day I'm talking like
only just three or four years ago even
GPU blocks usually only supported the
reference designs like reference cards
were the only things that got blocks but
now you you're finding companies like ek
and and bits power and and now even
fantex getting involved in the water
cooling market that are supporting in
Corsair has that remember we looked at
that see yes Corsair has outlined a
custom cooling water stuff which again
is just a collaboration with aqua
computer but they support a lot of the
custom GPUs now which they didn't before
so now it's like yeah water-cooled of
custom stuff take advantage of that
power delivery and get some more out of
it considered a water chiller a
phase-change cooling briefly the problem
with phase change and chillers is the
system doesn't get to power right on it
takes time for the faith change to
happen because it takes time to remove
the heat from the liquid in there so the
way it works is the chiller is usually
tied in to the power switch so that when
you turn on the power switch the chiller
comes on and then it gets down to its
its minimum temp and then it will power
on the motherboard like it goes through
the chiller it's like a it's in between
bridged I don't know what the proper
term is but you can't turn on your
system to the chillers at the proper
time and then that could take several
minutes five minutes sometimes and so a
lot of times you've seen it might crap I
got to do this real quick I go I flip on
the system I do what I gotta do when I
turn it off I don't have time to wait so
I would never personally do it as a main
system for me something to play with
vini
you just have to insulate the
motherboard this condensation right what
happens when you go deep below the
ambient temperature condensation happens
it's no different than a glass of iced
water right yeah the condensation forms
on the outside of the glass because yes
because the difference in temperature
between the sealed environment or even
its I guess it be sealed in the liquid
but in the sealed environment versus the
exterior the conversation starts to form
where it's warmer so the condensation
would start to form on the outside right
that no proper pail tears and chillers
have a lot of redundancy or not
redundancy but safety measures in place
but you still have to like insulate the
motherboard with clay and other things
and it's just a lot of hassle why would
he is the main issue with a computer our
power PCIe connect or PCI connectors
standardized but not thermal management
leaving us with a million heat sinks and
water blocks for each component I don't
think that's a very fair question
because interfaces are a lot different
than thermal standardized standardizing
I mean you're comparing connectors to
thermal management I don't I don't see
how those two relate honestly in
anything you want to say over there
sorry I'm kind of getting towards the
bottom of this but there's a lot yeah
hope you were asking were your where is
your car in the garage yes Missy doesn't
drive much the longest trip she's been
on recently with someone went to San
Diego yeah to go meet up with one of our
internet friends who was on vacation out
here and we went to k1 karting and stuff
we played around though we were revenant
we were making fire we were making
flames and we were scaring little ladies
and that lady was scared though she she
drove by with her ears yeah she was like
this your mind she was like plugging her
ear and her windows were up yeah if it
my car is kind of loud I mean it's it's
a lot of like even when you go by a wall
and you rev it oh like I just bounce
exactly
yeah like we go into a tunnel of light
if I blip the throttle or do a rip match
usually I've seen him like to jump over
there if he's not expecting it was not
expecting hello from Saudi Arabia love
you guys
sup tech for life I assume things were
warm in Saudi just a Starbucks donation
nice thank you
oh I started at the wrong sorry guys
start at the bottom
hey Jay I'm looking to upgrade my case I
was looking for suggestions I currently
have a cm storm strike around I'm
looking for something flashy uh okay so
if you like your cm storm striker wait a
month or so we twink that stuff you saw
at Computex is gonna be out soon from
coolermaster the new half case looks
really cool
we'll be getting doing reviews on that
so if you want something flashy go with
a lot of stuff from Coolermaster now is
coming with RGB and stuff built-in so a
lot of it well the whole theme was RGB
let's see yes there's a lot of snow
doesn't see us competition oh yes sorry
did I say see yes
I think he says he okay cocky tax when
we went to Taiwan your Dinks sje do you
and Nick have anything special you would
advise for a new youtuber and what are
you two most looking forward to for tech
this year for PC technology I'll let
Nicky answer that since he's the one
getting to experience this as a new
newbie himself jumping into a
well-established channel yeah what are
the challenges you've experienced camera
roots you got to be consistent and at
least and he's free to say whatever he
wants I mean gotta work on consistency
with camera work and just overall
structured because I mean if you're
starting out I think you have a little
more play room to experiment with your
style would you agree yeah because your
style grows with you yeah and then I've
got five years of doing this so I kinda
have to jump into line I can't like get
creative itch it's it's hard for you
because you've jumped into a standard
that's expected already yeah and you're
finding that even with your photography
background
it's a bro diesel sorry about your penis
man big old tires anyway um so yeah it's
it's one of the things where the camera
work has to be a certain a certain
stamina
there there's some things that I mean
you kind of call yourself a
perfectionist but you're realizing that
like there's a different level of
perfection that I expect that and we're
never going to achieve it but we strive
toward at least that there's some things
you're willing to let slide that I'm not
yeah right on the flip side it's really
weird for me to offload a lot of the
camera work to you because you still
have that expectation that you have in
your head but oh yeah I can see the
shots and things I want in my head but
it's very difficult for me to translate
that to you yeah that's why I tell you
to spend a lot of time watching my
videos and just to learn it
yeah it's like when I did I shot all the
bureau for this Nick was actually gone
buying his car when I was doing the
review for this so he was here when I
was doing the talking head part and then
he split and I did all the mural I think
you would agree there was some angles in
there that I use that you probably would
have thought of yeah but you also like
even at Computex we went over like how I
should shoot and and slowly it's like
yeah I see a structure now when you
start doing that yeah I gave him sort of
like an outline of like if shooting a
GPU these are the shots you should get
if shooting a like we supposed to do
motherboard ones and stuff but yeah and
becomes some sort of guidance because
that that was the hardest part for me as
as being the boss was delegating
something to him but not giving enough
direction that make sense yeah and then
like cuz when we started what I tried to
get too creative with it and I always
got stuck on certain angles I just kept
doing over and over yeah you would give
me like ten clips of the same thing and
because you also if if I shoot a shot
and I don't like it I delete the clip
and because it saves me so much time
later digging through garbage clips to
get the ones I like but for a new
youtuber though there's only one piece
of advice I give anyone and that is
consistency the YouTube algorithm it
from it Awards consistency you have to
upload on a consistent basis you have to
be you have to constantly be feeding
the algorithm you you drop off the
relevancy meter it's like a relevancy
meter right this channel is always up
uploading this channels always getting
comments and likes and dislikes and
interactions and shares and subscribes
so the channel gets ranked ranked higher
in the relevancy meter but if you're
just sporadically uploading and you're
getting 100 views 50 views 10 views or
whatever you're so far off the meter on
the bottom that you never get any air
you never you never get any lift
consistency gives you the lift you need
that's the only thing I can suggest
growth as much as I'd like to say the
studio and the backdrops and the nice
camera and all that promote our growth
it doesn't the way we present ourselves
promotes our growth the personality so
you've also got to be entertaining to
watch you know if you're like hey guys
today I'm gonna do a review of this
laptop and I think it's a good laptop
like no one wants to watch that yeah you
can have like an awesome setup but if
you're you as a person aren't you know
it's entertaining to watch if you've
ever gone to it if you've ever gone to a
theater and I don't mean like movie
theater I mean live play that you know
stage stage theater okay
have you ever looked at one of those
actors up close do you go out awful
amount of makeup they're wearing mm-hmm
have you noticed that like up close that
close okay so we have a family member
that does theater production okay
the amount of makeup that they wear is
terrifying up close oh right it is like
mannequin levels of makeup because from
a distance it gives the feature it gives
defined features on the face and the
eyes and all that stuff so it makes the
person look more like sharpened and
whatnot so the makeup isn't isn't
basically put on for this range it's put
on for people that are way out in the
theater to be able to see and identify
what's happening with the characters so
when you present yourself on cameras the
same way you have to be super animated
and over-the-top and and maybe not Kile
levels of animated and over-the-top but
no just good so you have to you have to
have more inflection in your voice you
have to have more
you know peaks and valleys in your
tonality it doesn't even word I don't
know so you have to have you have to
think theater makeup in your actions you
have to just people tell me all that
don't be like me you're getting there
it's the same do with camerawork
movement controls emotion yes that's the
mood mute movement can do an awful lot
for a shot a boring shot but you need
angle to it yeah but movement can do a
lot with a boring shot because something
that could be otherwise not
uninteresting can be made interesting
with a slide shot or a reveal or
whatever I get so many people they're
like Jay stop moving the camera and just
put it on a tripod those are the people
whose channels would never go anywhere
because they would just place a camera
on a tripod and go in front of it and
talk super monotone like this because
they don't get it they don't understand
presentation mmm that's so I told the
story a bunch of times like to get used
to talking on camera what I used to do
when I would drive back and forth to
work which is about it was like a
25-minute commute each way it's I would
do that super like you know monster
truck sunday sunday sunday we're driving
down the freeway right now there's a red
car going by oh my god like I would do
that I look like a lunatic and my
windows would be down in the nice
weather and I would just be doing that
in my car narrating everything I saw
working on not saying um uh and you know
all the different things people do when
I go filler like the filler well guess
what happens there is I kind of get
ahead of their mouths their thoughts
dude
so the burped your brain kind of like
hits the brakes for a second to catch up
and that's where the necking brains
bottleneck in your mouth
no your bottom your mouth is blocking
your brain so I did that for a long time
and the reason why I did that super
over-the-top was because you then pull
it down into a place where it makes more
sense like I think people would agree
right now while we're talking in this
stream you're more mellow and monotone
than me yeah because I'm so used to
talking like this
and I never talk like this you guys go
watch my first videos welcome to Jays
two cents YouTube channels where I feel
like I have so much more to offer the
Kim
I do cars PC of tech working on cars I
would say that Lily better than my first
video but I had already been practicing
because remember I started with guidance
from holiday doc who was coaching me oh
yeah
so I had already had some some ideas of
what to do
but even then I thought that I was
talking like like radio like like like
radio crackhead but no if you go back
and watch the videos like the first five
videos you'll see that it's just it was
so it's crazy it's so bad another tip
expect lots of like retakes or like
resetting even now yeah
but like more more than usual because
like my experience of my doing my first
video it's like there's love like Chris
words and then restart in it's like get
this fart and its grew up it's a I think
a lot of people try and emphasize the
one take and that's the one take is like
a holy grail of video production one
takes are rare and I think you've
noticed that we've started a healthy
audiences notice we've started leading
some of the bloopers and stuff in that
are funny
because I am struggling with trying to
pull myself out of being too produced to
corporate produced to where I don't want
to dilute my personality by trying to
make it to corporate having the bloopers
breaks that tension I've tried be it
keep it but there's bloopers worth
showing now too because I get to bounce
off you where when I was alone in my
home studio
you just look crazy just yeah it was
just a misspeak and I would start over
there was nothing funny mmm
the video that's gonna be going live
next week it's you guys have been asked
he's already laughing we spent 8 hours
editing that yesterday and we still
laughing we still laugh this is gonna be
good it's gonna be good
it's it's good because it's awful we did
a full feature-length video with fractal
design and so we basically kind of took
the premise of how we do our ads and
it's a 12-minute video about a product
it's so it's just we left in a lot of
the bloopers because there was just no
way not to we would laugh so hard and
I'm like I can't edit this out
sure we did a retake where we did it
without the blooper but
it was so much less funny that way yeah
anyway that's gonna go live on Tuesday
look for Tuesday should be good it
should be really in because yeah you
just we turned it into something
hilarious I bleed in the video
[Laughter]
sacrifices to the PC gods
we're indeed made let's see
Chad Robert says I want to do a custom
water loop but how often we need a
change with fluid also have a 7700 K to
1080 TI and SLI any recommendations go
at least two three sixty millimeter
radiators in my opinion if you can fit
fluid changing is going to depend on
quite a few things one the manufacturer
suggestion is first and foremost also to
how hot is a fluid game the hotter fluid
gets the more it tends to break down
over time you have to 1080 T eyes in
there which are gonna be toasty and
that's that's gonna be approximately 500
watts where the peak to dissipate just
between the graphics cards not even
including the CPU so my my option my
suggestion to you would be to go with as
much efficient radiator space that you
can to try and keep the fluid
temperatures down which will increase
the longevity I find it to be a better
rule of thumb to switch your fluid once
a year some manufacturers will say you
can go two years I would go once here
you haven't been following that I know
time with my fast alright this year one
year later I'm gonna replace it Thomas
says hey Jay have you ever driven a 300
ZX a video let's go man Z 32 s so back
when I was in high school one of our
sports teachers camera her name she was
an older older PE coach she drove a
yellow one shed a yellow z32 at the
t-tops it was brand new was an it was a
net well I guess it was already like
five years old that time it was like a
90 or an anyone who moves 90 I remember
anyway I just always that was where my
infatuation with the Z platform started
started to grow was that car heard she
had the chrome wheels I was all factory
ride had the factory chrome wheels it
was the twin turbo and so it was it was
just like that car was so beautiful
doing and
think most people would agree that the
z32 body style was ahead of its time it
was very rounded and such and it was
coming off the heels of the first 300zx
which was the various it looked like a
280 but very squared in a head of turbo
version but so that was where I really
wanted to start getting a disease and
then a couple decades went by before I
got my first one god I've never driven a
300 ZX and there are a few of them in
our Nissan challenge group I got the
city one they feel awesome just because
well they they feel kind of big though
don't they no it feels more like a jet
fighter cockpit just because the console
is a little bit higher up it felt really
neat just I haven't said you have to
when you're driving by do you have to
okay good okay for takeoff the catapult
that and like I was like like the I was
talking the guy he had like it has rear
rear steering as well hmm do they all
mmm I think just all the drives but here
specifically he was gonna do a walk out
on it because yeah most people do yeah
has anyone even commented that we're
streaming in 60fps there is in the
beginning but mainly spam now yeah
Victor s says 200 SEK is about
twenty-four point 23.2 388 US dollars
Wow cool I don't know what SDK is though
Jose what is better to GT X 1080 and SLI
or one gtx 980ti what can your wallet
handle is it true that if you do SLI you
can only put one monitor per Cartman
that's not true alright three monitors
on one card in fact it depends on the
mode you want to do for instance if you
want to do SLI performance mode which is
where you improve your gaming
performance you have to put them all on
one card it won't let you split them if
you want to do surround then you then
you can split them but yeah it actually
tells you and try and enable SLI like
it'll show you where that we plugged in
and whatnot so that's bogus when people
say you can only put one card per
monitor that's not right
oh here's one do you think your 370
could take my cab forward mark six GTI
yes I think through seven you would walk
it you know more about GTI's than I do
yeah I think I think it'd be a straight
walk like it wouldn't it wouldn't be
like when I erase your mark for but it
would definitely come over time they
begin with a cake
a sicko for the recap for they were
stuck on the mic six I believe it on the
to point out the turbos mm-hmm
alright a tuned one tuned one it might
have you might have to fight it in
convening but top end you'll walk the
GTI has me on wait right
yeah even the mark sixes I believes it
uh hmm is it habit hoon though I'm
pretty sure the kf4 wasn't aftermarket
though so you might be running a tune so
my you're running a changing yeah
actually yeah but I'm pretty confident
to eat walk still like I said I don't I
don't know boats wagons that much so I
couldn't say all I can say is is there's
yet to be an na 370z that sweet me no
but like like several manufacturers have
said he might caught my my VQ is Titus
back like it's just everything is just
flawless with it compression is good at
leak out is good it makes a ton of power
for what it is he and it's just the
power band is perfect on it I love
everything about the car that's that's
why for the longest time it was you've
seen I was I was just so conflicted with
power and boosting it yeah and it had
that appointment with fast intentions
and we were talking 675 wheel horsepower
with e85 flex-fuel kit yeah that means
sweet but you also saw me cancel that
appointment yeah
because because the power to the power
to money ratio was it was it was $28,000
was the quote now of course people get
back no I could she turbo kits for 8,000
but that's just the turbo kit you don't
understand what goes in into Italy the
amount of labor that goes into the
installation they have to drop the
engine the amount of transmission
upgrades that have to be done because I
would drop my JWT and I'd have to step
up to a stage 3 my stage 2 won't hold
that kind of power
there's also rear-end upgrades that have
to be done because my V LSD is already
starting to go out and the rear ends
gonna have to be updated there's the
flex fuel computer which alone is two
thousand dollars so it doesn't include
any of the pump upgrades the fuel pumps
that need to be upgrading the 370z so I
can make a right turn without fuel
starving we don't want fuel starvation
under a boost that's bad and then the
amount of cooling upgrades you have to
do on top of it now a lot of it I
already have done but there's all those
at
to make it work properly that people
don't understand yes what run like a
thousand so you see injectors to or
throw the e yeah yeah yeah cuz e85
memory did yep you have to dump a
shit-ton I've been in there to get it to
burn but the nights about 85 is so
compressible without predetonation so
that's where all the power comes out of
e85 and then you saw the zl1 come on
yeah the 1l the CL one and only yeah
yeah that's that's a that's a obtainable
dream car for me right now but there was
that there was that special to AE and
put out last Christmas remember that I
was tempted to my car off the mean
or wherever they are am was doing their
twin turbo kit tuned and installed for
ten thousand remember I showed you that
yeah I came and it was a guaranteed 475
horsepower it doesn't it doesn't it
didn't have a flex fuel kit or any of
that stuff and it doesn't have any of
the transmission mods and stuff but the
car would come back to you tuned and
safe but I also live in California so
yes the guy with the key or he says puts
down 338 HP with 390 torque wheels I
think I think it's a walk possibly he
has more torque than me but I've got
I've got a lot more was the top end in
response yeah let's see oh yeah I mean
my car's not smog legal now but let's
just say my it's easy to fix turbo kits
aren't exactly easy to fix
I should know have you ever thought
about playing battlegrounds or a game
like it no not really
I mean it sounds neat king of the hill
type of game but it oh wait can you the
kill king of the hill kena it's just
last person surviving yeah and then it's
all based on like spawn pickups and
stuff so you get people that start
spawning hurt or spamming and camping
spawns so games like that literally
player games
yeah games like that become really old
Friday 13 spend a lot of fun though for
us it's a lot more fun we haven't played
in like a week and a half but the what
makes it fun for us is we've been
playing it with with subscribers
but thinking of a non computer-based
comment so what is you guys thoughts on
furries also should I replace my
original H 102 that paired with an 18 in
advance what the hell is a furry I think
I do that can you read that um so I'm in
4k right now in this and accidentally
just put my font text to 25% at 4k I
can't read it you need by not clears
from that you get it back what made me
pick the Z is my car well I got really
attached to jay-z and I just really
liked the handle easy oh well I really
like the handling and I had to convince
myself it was a way better platform to
start for track instead of trying to
track a GTI because the amount of
suspension work I want to do on a Jeep
GT I would just be better invested into
a new platform instead because that have
to like get the lower like the whole
suspension off in our 32 it's one of the
reasons also why you didn't go with a
240 or NS chassis yeah this is just lot
a lot better yeah and then the S chassis
is it's it's got that drift tax with it
right now I'm surprised you got your 350
HR for the price you did - that was way
undervalued but it was yeah you got a
really good deal um the S chassis that
has a stupid drift tax on it and he
might have worked you have to put into
an S chassis just to get it to the
performance of a stock 350 is stupid
yeah the people the people who get s
chassis so they get him for the
nostalgia of them you know not so much
about their raw performance because they
have no overall performance mm-hmm it's
just it was a small compact Japanese car
that was rear-wheel drive which is kind
of is a super rare these days right yeah
well well that's where the FRS filled in
that gap okay let's see J do you think
EK water blocks e XC 360 is a good
enough rad to cool a 1080i in i7 I do
hey Jade do you need a matched pair do
you need a matched pair Zeon in a server
or are two of the same type sounds
enough I don't do much dual CPU socket
stuff so I don't know the answer to that
I would assume paired would be the best
idea
I think it's required actually um hello
from Mexico love you guys
take my filthy pesos for all the ad
blocking thank you for the peso sir okay
when you one word when you test obtain
will you be testing it in a mechanical
system and SSD mech systems also if you
had to mech drives would you need to
obtain cards good question I will I will
add that to the database of questions I
have for Intel when we start preparing
this you're cooking at monkey I'm
thinking of building a CS government or
any recommendations don't build one nope
all right okay a better better answer
pick the ones guns that he is
consistently and just stick with those
there's no point trying to build an
inventory full of different skins
just because you probably won't switch
to one to different skin after you get
used to one screen already and like
personally I go for like the 75 cent
stattrak pistols and stuff like that I
don't the last time I went I've ever put
the most amount money I put into that
game was for an off which I regret
selling is 15 bucks turned around and
sold it for 20 but now that off is worth
about like 35 or something like that and
I kind of wish I kept it because they
were just going up in price now but I
stopped playing that game because I rage
quit so much now you rage quit never
only we go like two thousand that night
we won't speak about that night you were
one step behind the entire map it says
Mike dead no he's just not talking Nick
Nixon makes angry I could tell but I
could just feel it through the night and
I was right yeah I didn't call you out
they were asking what's up and I just
give me I know it looks like I hate it
when he's ready Jay we need to
overclocking my EVGA 670 and killed it
and they already made it no problem even
offer a discount cross ship I damaged
the cooler on my 980 putting liquid
cooler on I had a problem arming at love
EVGA EVGA does have a very strong arm at
high from Hong Kong 4 a.m. here what em
ATX case can you recommend for water
coin almost bought the fantex evolve I
don't look at that much MA ATX cases
BitFenix picked some good mitx stuff
I can't think of any kids off the top of
my head I recommend for mitx
I just don't I usually do full etx stuff
for everything Chris McNair says thanks
for all that you guys do would you ever
consider doing a new budget gaming PC
since a resident came out or one rise
and three comes up we already talked
about that at the beginning of the
stream actually the answer is yes
OC then II five sixteen fifty v16 for
24.5 at one point four it's as good yeah
I guess he's is he on obviously I don't
know how much juice the Zeon's light to
get to be honest
CJ tagged you last night on Twitter but
wanted to say thanks for the channel and
giving me all the knowledge just build
this new PC beast beast PC thank you sir
I haven't really been on Twitter today
other than to post like that we were
gonna do this dream today so I have not
seen it yet what's the best a o in the
market for 82 102 that's a really weird
range 102 are you including shipping and
tax or never include that I don't know H
100 H 100 is always a go-to yeah its
standard ish I also really liked the
early version of the inner max yeah it's
one that I'd like that super beefy red
but you could like using the hammer but
then they got it rid of it they went
back to like the more ASA textile of
Reds so I don't recommend those as much
anymore um found to use 370z Nismo for
20k the appearances claim it has 88 km
the odometer owe us money here probably
you put dollar sign oh wow would you
know what to look would you know what I
should look for that may go bad well I
guarantee the diff pushings probably
shot at that mileage differential
subframe bushing the atak
hey yeah mine was shot at 42 okay when I
bought it who knows how long before that
so you got extend this is a rear-wheel
drive car that a lot of people will go
out there and do launches and maybe
slide it a little bit
constantly you know hammer on the
throttle and so that rubber bushing in
the differential connected to the
subframe just goes bad
it's a fluid-filled bushing so when it
tears it pisses out its fluid then the
differential flops around
that's almost guaranteed to be bad 370
Z's if it's a manual they the CSC the
concentric slave cylinder is going to go
bad on you someday so when I did my
clutch and the stupid thing is Nissan
had relocated the CSC from external of
the transmission which is like a five
minute swap like on his car to inside
the transmission and made it out of
plastic yeah they made a plastic CSC in
an internal transmission part that
pushes against that looks so wrong
it pushes a key there's a meme it pushes
against the pressure plate to engage
your clutch so or disengage your
pleasure
that was a stupidest thing Nissan every
day they've been they've been class
action law student for that law suited
class action lawsuit suit whatever so
many times but Nissan has a really good
lawyer
that keeps getting them out of it and
yeah so when I did my clutch upgrade I
also did the Z speed CNC won this metal
and it will probably fail at some point
too but it's gonna have a lot more
durability those are the two major
things and then an oil cooler would be
good to have because there isn't one on
anything between oh nine and twenty
eleven and then in 2012 they added a
nine row oil cooler to the bottom of the
radiator which hardly does anything
let's see oh by the way I've been part
of building three three hundred Z's fun
car nice toms technical ramblings new
mid-tower have 110 by 110 EK res 280 red
1080 GTX GPU bits power block and a rise
in 1702 x EK supremacy block alpha cool
pump block ptg showcase knoefel TG
not oniy damn it tower okay and he's
tell me buddy's got but the finance -
finance yeah you're you're not gonna
find a better case in mid-tower format
that's set up for water cooling than the
fractal design define s is a lot more
time in that it's open
yeah it's open there's no drive cages so
much room it's wide open you could fit a
360 in the front you could fit a 480 on
the top or no 360 on the top but you can
fit two 360s and there's so much room in
the front you could go with a thick rat
or push pool if you want it's offset on
the top if you want to do 130 millimeter
fans which I rep I recommend instead of
140 is that way you can clear your
motherboard more and you could go with a
thick rat or a push-pull again it's got
all the mounting spots for both a pump
as well as reservoirs I mean it's it's
designed for water cooling and I highly
recommend it and no Josh didn't pay me
to say that but I will send him a bill
now see where's the coffee it's down
here what it's white chicks coffee hey
Jay should I buy a gal exten atti Hall
of Fame for 1,100 or is that too much
for 10 atti if that's eleven hundred US
dollars it's way too much man
way too much JB ever dived into the
world of password cracking what is the
largest number of GPUs you've ever had
in a single system three is the largest
number I've ever had in a single system
and why would I get into password
cracking and hey Jay out of curiosity is
ever necessary to replace to fluent in
AI Oh mine is approaching four years old
they have not touched it since its
original installation no a iOS like any
asa tech based a IO which is gonna be
like a lot of Corsair stuff and like the
NZXT crack and stuff they are not
designed to be serviced even the ones
that are expandable are not designed to
be serviced unless you expand them
there's a little hint about what our
video is about with fractal it's about
expanding one and here's a last comment
that I can see here it just sent to me
from chat so I have to refresh it thanks
a lot Jay I'm your fan for a long time I
also want to do full custom water
cooling loop but I don't have the cash
for it
you do what you do thank you sir just
save that's all I can recommend save
your monies the budgets the budgets oh
yeah there's a lot more here my god
there's so many what's happened in the
main chat over there
kudos everyone 980 what why does

salute yeah but I really don't give a
 where you live and guests
you know whenever you put a time up
everyone on the Internet
seems like it's cool to post what time
it is for them I don't care I don't give
two cents about where you live honestly
why would I care oh you mean when I get
a feel of what time it is outside I have
a world clock on my phone I just don't
care
I heard donation from row well thank you
bro
Nick you the man it's what's this oh
yeah I wasn't complimenting your singing
that's yeah he was complimenting me he
probably wanted me to read it so that I
was giving you a compliment
worse to say it whatever you still said
it works okay accounts see evil mick
kinky he boma kinky hey Jael of your van
sees a bit of cash for Adblock but I
grabbed an EVGA 1080 TI sc2 and cannot
find a full cover water block any
suggestion as much love from the high
desert give EK some time they're making
blocks for whatever reason though they
always seem to go to Ebay EBG at last
which I don't understand cuz
sells a pretty high amount of nvidia
cards considering that's the only cards
they sell and they are they are
extremely popular so I don't understand
why I almost feel like ek has some sort
of like vendetta against them in some
way did the GTI heavy race to me then
not yet but I think it's gonna happen
when I get it back yeah after you did
what
hard pipe tubing front mount new tune
weds been wideband o2 should be good you
better beat it button stock Sienna with
car seats in it and a stroller in the
back oh good you better be it's like 48
hundred pounds you should put the whole
family in there too that way if you do
pull away from me it's just even more
insult this sad part is like when the
cart when the van is full of the family
it doesn't feel any slower and then it
has that ECT mode of the etc mode as we
call it it's a spaceship it's just
underneath I call it star tours it looks
like star tours and it feels like
started fishing the turns even with it
because it's an SC so it's a sport
Edition even those night teens and stuff
yeah I've been wanting to put spacers on
it to give it a more aggressive look but
then I know my wife's gonna curb it so
lets me go put the hubcap covers she's
already curbed the van a few times but
hasn't fortunately is enough sidewall on
that tired wear doesn't mess up the
wheels we got to get her those bumpers
like they have k1 just wrap the whole
tire we know we need to get like the
1970s Cadillac feelers the little side
whiskers they're called feelers for the
curbs they were designed for back then
they were designed so you could park a
car close to the curb without rubbing it
because you would hear that that's why
they were called feelers
thank you yeah um let me jog oh I see
now the upset I didn't mean to cut you
up Jay what's the most ji pzr business
all in a single system I want to build
one for password cracking with multiple
GPUs I feel like um I kind of feel like
I shouldn't be talking to you cuz I
don't I don't feel like you're up to any
good
lure the sienna and put 2020 by Tetons
on it oh I had plans to do van culture
remember oh yeah I would pimp that van
that van is awesome I love that man but
instead I got a truck and then I went
the other way there so to make it a
bigger dad mobile mm-hmm I feel like I
need a big ass American flag hanging off
the back of my Chevy yeah no he needed
no step of snake stickers no step on
snick snick just grab some coffee to
join you guys I know the ATX form factor
is strong in the market but what are
your thoughts on em ATX I'm fine with em
ATX
honestly I'm you can still SLI m-80s but
I never needed to build one I mean it's
a it's it allows you to just go with a
smaller case it's the same with his 80s
it's just shorter right ITX Mini ITX a
super small but I just I guess I don't
really feel because a lot of the mid
tower cases now not a lot of them are
strictly em ATX anymore we typing there
are you talking to eminence yeah Sanpei
is noticed Wow double noticed J inspired
me to get into water cooling pcs thanks
for the educational bitch this is for
running adblock thank you sir it's funny
if someone donates $5 for running
adblock they just purchased like 10
years worth of viewership on what one
viewer would like cost over time with
that luck the problem is if you have a
million people using adblock there's
obviously a problem I've shown the
numbers before if P it's always an
interesting discussion regarding adblock
and I understand and we'll talk about it
again today right now I understand the
need for adblock especially we go to a
website that has ads everywhere and
you've got like one little square of
text in the middle right and you run an
ad block and then you see just how full
the pages of ads people do that because
they're stacking those ads because
they're realizing the amount of people
who don't get served ads that pings back
to the server and says if an ad was
served you make you make a fraction of a
cent on per view they start stacking
these ads on
of each other because of the fact that
they're trying to make up for the lost
revenues and it's no different for
YouTube right so that's why we inject
our own ads we create into the videos
that Adsense is also running on because
of the fact that the more people use
adblock the more it takes away from
revenue for the channel that makes it
difficult for us to do things like we
talked about with just buying out parts
outright and not going direct with
manufacturers or doing cool projects so
if I look at my analytics here we look
at views over the last 30 days last 30
days was a roll our eyes tell you guys
in the review this thing is super
sensitive yeah okay at 6.5 million views
in the last 30 days that's not great
it's not terrible it's I've kind of been
in the six and a half million range for
four months now of those views how many
of them were monetizable let's take a
look at that shall we
someone did it to do performance we're
looking for here
oh they keep changing this you mean
second here it's really fascinating
though because you can tell you can see
an awful lot of the insight the insight
tells us how to kind of mold and direct
the business side new things the video
production is always going to be the
same we're always going to do the same
types of videos but the choices we make
sometimes are forest based on well I
mean adblock and stuff like that grab
another question while I'm pulling this
up okay cuz they change the way the
dashboards laid out a little bit and
where I'm looking for this so oh I'm
sorry I found it of those 6.5 million
views 2.9 million of them were
monetizable so less than half less than
half of those views were on a
monetizable what means that means more
than half of the viewers are using
adblock and that's why we do direct ad
sales ourself to make up the difference
I don't mean to click this you're like
highlighting the entire chat yeah I bet
if I'm not mistaken I think if you pop
it out can you pop it out no that's
twitch huh yeah oh yeah you can make it
longer
okay I think it is Jesus yeah we need
that we need to end this soon here it's
12:30 night I put on there till 12:30
but let's face it I'm a vacation now so
I don't really care I owe you guys J out
hey J I love your vids but cash Oh ed
luck delivery channel had my Z for five
years but needed a normal car for daily
use and kid plans I bought an Infiniti
and 37 s so you just went with a
four-door version the car is awesome
still as yet heart but just cushy you
know option on infinity I would buy a
twin-turbo three-point liter 3.0 liter q
62-day if I didn't have such a love for
the Z well one one alley right now
because there they're not that far apart
price I it's like 50 55 grand for the
q60 3.0 twin turbocharged 400 horsepower
and then the guys who first got their
hands on it looks phenomenal at the
coupe it looks amazing right
yeah it looks so aggressive and the guy
the guys I care which tuner shop did it
but it's it was a typical Z tuner they
took the car
they didn't even increase the boost to
it all they did was fix the factory fuel
curve the fuel ratio and gained 50 wheel
horsepower 55 zero because I found that
the thing was running stole god damn Pig
rich that it was it was the air/fuel
ratios were super out of whack so all
they did was lean it out to a safe range
in gained 50 wheel horsepower at the
same psi that's offensive I didn't see
their follow up report when they were
gonna go they were gonna go up to 20 psi
because I think stock was 15 mm-hmm but
five extra pounds of boost with that
kind of air fuel ratio they were hoping
for something like 480 to 500 wheel
horsepower out of it that's pretty good
and that's just without doing any bolt
on - that's all stock now the turbo
design on those is really weird like the
manifold and turbos like when you did
okay so to do a turbo kit on that it's
not like they could just make a custom
turbo to bolt right up to the manifold
it's all like integrated to make it
smaller and more compact because every
heat management
these cars as a pain in the ass I would
love the q60 3.0 tte is high on my list
of cars that I would own I'm so you guys
funny people say I'm like I'm too
expensive with my tastes
you've seen it right I'm very like my
dream cars are super obtainable thing
yeah unlike mine gt3 RS it's only 180
grand ish well they don't make them
anymore so the price - RS yeah gt2 it's
gonna be expensive those twin turbos of
surprise that much J a furry as a person
who likes anthro mum-mum Orphic
characters you generally see them in
things called
fur suits basically high quality unique
mascot suit that's a thing I guess
anything's a thing right yeah okay
that's weird
it's Justin W we got your donations
thank you sir I think he had something
to say to you to everybody don't need
like three times that strange
um hey J love your van sees a bit of
cash I already answered that one see if
I grabbed ten atti SC - can't find
waterblock
answer that loan mi z hi J Nick you are
awesome
he said you're off oh you guys are
awesome J I finally bought an EVGA 1080
TI SC for the win 3 because of your
videos it's not an SC for the win 3 it's
just the for the win 3 just a little
minor correction there thank you for
your reviews Nick you're pretty awesome
- thanks they made the smiling teeth
emojis hey guys I own is e31 300zx
that's the one I told you that's like it
looks like a 280 but it's very squared
off
he was like late 80s where'd it go first
manual car I've ever owned and driven
love the darn thing even if it's older
than me enjoy your vacation you earned
it my friend it's my first vacation
since June of last year and over a year
I don't take many vacations my you don't
my last vacation was before that my wife
and I went on a cruise in 2000 and
eleven that's my last vacation
well when I was running the channel all
my vacation time went towards like with
CES so trips I had to take for the
channel yeah so I would take a vacation
from the day job to go to work for the
channel which I didn't mind it's just I
didn't get any R&amp;amp;R but moving into this
place that certainly helped because
there's so much separation now between
this and life I feel like I have one
hope hopping on the odd block train keep
up the great work guys can't wait for
the video on Tuesday I want to push it
live now so bad but we need to fill that
gap because I won't be back in the
office till Thursday and I know when I
get back in like the amount of emails
and things that are gonna be bogging me
down we might not get another video out
until Friday so next week guys bear with
me please that there's probably gonna be
a lack of content I'm actually asking
this guy to vlog you guys want to see a
vlog just of Nick who would I do when
he's not here I would love to see that
oh my gosh it's just you like rubbing
your butt in the ground like a dog just
a couch you know on the Grand room and
your buddy party any keyboard will be
it's our rubbing to but I think keyboard
the but yeah I would probably laugh and
then we would have to have an HR meeting
yeah I put on my HR hat is it a conflict
of interest if your boss is also HR I
don't know I think that would be like a
hilarious movie like I will speak to the
HR one moment I can tell you this much
of business are sighs flies well under
the Family Medical Leave Act radar oh
let's see supporting you Jay since your
videos have supported me and have
expanded my knowledge of PC world at my
own business starting soon related to
pcs message to enquire integrity on my
end message to inquire integrity on my
end okay good luck with your business
though hi Jay I'm looking to build a 4k
gaming rig and I was worrying about the
rs10 atti but I'm not sure I should go
SLI or single GPU for 4k the artist is
powerful I showed that I just don't like
its build quality with the shroud if you
want to get 4k gaming that's
consistently 60
yes go with two of them 4k is still no
joke but you've you've done the gaming
on the test rig with the two 1080 T eyes
and Fort Worth working and how was the
experience it was pretty awesome wait
until the 4k high refresh rate monitors
come out which will have less input lag
my only problem is I'm scared that might
spoil me and then it's like I need to do
this now - yeah it's gonna be north of
$1,000 for that mark hi Jim look oh yeah
I love the adjustable arm monitor mounts
you have in the upstairs set I have
three 27 inch monitors I'm thinking of
getting them used to like them
yeah there's they're still up there
holding the monitors I never sagged or
anything
they're the nitrogen-filled ones though
so there's like pressure in those
Pistons you hold them up there Matt it
was at first like the damn things are
holding the monitors and they said they
were hold the way house like oh there's
a screw I was like what happens when you
turn it out in the monitor was like Shh
oh it helps when you use it right but
it's it's it's backwards
you would think tightening a screw would
make something stronger no that's
backwards if you tighten the screw and
push it in then it gets weaker if you
bring the screw out it gets stronger
that's kind of like chrono hanging tip
in the sort of yeah if you pull it out
it's more velocity push it in less
velocity yeah so it was it was the
similar thing it wasn't until I actually
and and thing was remember the manual
that came with that was like
non-existent good so I actually found
that out by looking at the the amazon
reviews weirder nothing to build a
14-game rig I think I'm getting all
ready in today um hey Jay I have a 750 D
case going to a 70 900 X with a single
360 read 1080i OC Strix if the rampage
six extreme isn't really soon what's
next feature-rich motherboard got the
x-29 pro carbon here from MSI seems nice
I really like the deluxe one bit of luck
so we got I feel like the X 299 deluxe
is a good sweet spot motherboard but of
course the rampage is just gonna have
all the ROG features in it Strix is
always a good one
I've not got my hands on any of the EVGA
boards yet I was told and end of July is
when they'd be available so I have not
gotten my hands on any of those yet I
still think the ex 299 classified dark
it's gonna be a nice one because it's
all blacked out and stuff right and they
actually put lighting on the motherboard
for the first time still be so cool so
again though I told EVGA this a million
times
your motherboards will always be just
shy of perfect as far as I'm concerned
as long as you don't have fan curve
software built-in yeah and no I don't
mean going into the BIOS and telling it
PWM setting or setting as a static
percentage to run at I mean give me some
sort of curve like the ASA software
where I can go in and control my fans in
the OS until they give you something
like that
it's never gonna be 100% as far as I'm
concerned hey Jay a quick question I'm
on a budget and I am a twitch streamer
will the Rison v 1600 be enough for
streaming and gaming since I'm on a
budget it sounds to me like it has to be
right if you're on a budget and you
can't go much higher than that then you
have to make do with what you have so
you're gonna probably pass stream at
720p 30fps and you just meant to do the
best you can with that so Rison also
likes memory speed so go with fast
memory that's that is validated for
resin and call it a day it's kind of
like my situation right we're at home I
have skunkworks an extremely powerful 20
thread machine that I have to stream at
720p because of my god awful uploads be
at home yeah that's the other factor how
good's your internet so you could have
the best system ever but if your
internet can't handle the bitrate you
want to upload then you can also tune
yourself based on your upload so if you
have crap upload that's like I have 5
megabit up ok and 720p that can barely
handle that and so yeah it's one of
those things where I could use a much
lesser machine and still maintain 70
this is getting so hot beuliss yeah that
is really hot you get where those laptop
pads they have it they need to just fix
their and know how to be so hot
look if they had that fan blown your
legs I know yeah he said of a fan back
there blowing like header crotches
across from to crush man
um hey Jay do you happen to know why my
7700 K at stock speeds reaches ATC on a
280 red H 110 i huge favor channel
here's a block compensation what are you
using to measure your temps um when I
first got them that's me yeah you're
swishing it when I first got my 7700 K I
was using hardware monitor to tell me my
temps and I found that there was like
almost a 15 to 20 C deviation between
what hardware monitor was reporting and
what a 264 was reporting so it turned
out it was actually running much cooler
than I thought because I was seeing like
95 C on water and I'm going what the
actual hell is happening here so I would
double check with what you're using to
monitor those temps and your voltage if
you're running around 1.3 or less you
shouldn't be anywhere near that Hut try
reseeding the block and thermal paste
someone gave us a donation for adblock
thank you sir don't feel obligated to
donate if you use adblock no one Shepard
feel obligated to donate ever
we don't solicit them it's just it's
part of the stream guilt trip don't
guilt trip yourselves I will never guilt
trip someone for using ED luck
hello I understand why it exists yeah it
sucks that it does directly dilute the
amount of value that our work has it
produces right it's its content consumed
for free
I try to keep my ads from being
intrusive so what I mean by that is I
never enable long on when you look at
the monetization tab in YouTube is a
bunch of different options
I never enabled the long non skippable
ads I always have these short mounts
capable ads on there also too I never
really do mid-roll pre-rolls or mid
rolls sometimes I might on a long video
but you'll never find like some channels
I think we've seen it they'll put like 5
or 6 mid rolls in oh right those are
people that are just trying to eat up
that adsense money those are the people
that make ad block feel necessary
because you're like god damn these
people in their ads so guys like me who
are making conscious efforts to not be
intrusive are are being punished by
adblock because of that now there's
white listing so if you use adblock
whitelist your favorite youtubers if
feel so inclined but don't let myself or
any other youtuber ever make you feel
like I've heard some youtubers refer to
people use adblock as some pretty
derogatory terms right but in front of
the camera and behind the camera
discussing with some of these people
I've heard some bad things like things
that make me go well and blush a little
bit at how derogatory they were
regarding adblock users but you'll never
hear that out of me because the views we
get help us sell our ads that we create
because your view your view still has
value even if it didn't serve an at your
view has value to us it's just a little
bit less direct that make sense hey guys
love your stuff want to ask it for
Photoshop a large hike or camp CPU is
worth it I'm debating with an 18 it
unheard X or thread Ripper is it worth
all the money go with the 1,800 X is a
thread Ripper but give yourself more RAM
and faster RAM because same thing with
premiere all of the previews and stuff
and all the effects it's it's rendered
through its RAM rendered so the more
memory you have in the faster of it can
alleviate a lot of the stress of what's
happening in your Photoshop or premiere
so Ram is also a very big key on that
mmm saying anything again sorry I went
silent again he does this a lot you seem
to need more coffee I've already had to
not to Starbucks but had two coffees
this is electric and I had coffee in a
while which probably explains why I
crash when I get home like this caffeine
withdrawals feels like after I get home
I eat during this pass out mm-hmm you
mean your naps that go all night yeah 15
naps it turn into it I can't tell you
how many times he's like I'm gonna take
a quick nap and it's like 6 o'clock and
then he wakes up at like 4:00 a.m. I'm
here to play that they go offline
look if 2 p.m. has rolled around and I
haven't taken to nap yeah I'm not going
to there's no point in taking an
afternoon nap cuz it just screws that
bedtime we learning that real fast have
Jarius tips as he took the day off Jerry
took the day off what no adblock not
enable on YouTube because YouTube red
housing Oh red red is a separate revenue
stream and I have
complaints about red a lot of people
freaked out when read first onerous
dream the amount of time it says we're
live on this computer is different than
that one advance doesn't want to access
this one because I turn this one on 49
minutes ago anyway um YouTube red is is
is a good I have no complaints about
YouTube red is interesting that it's
divvied up amongst the red users and the
VIP channels they watch and the minutes
watched so there is a weird calculation
there when red first came out a lot of a
lot of content creators freaked out
because they thought that that what do
you mean there's some more ads oh my god
how we're gonna make money uh yeah but
the thing is to make money on the
YouTube red but the people who who have
more engagement with their audience get
benefit they benefit more from red so I
obviously don't make nearly as much on
red as someone like Linus but I
definitely make more on red than someone
much smaller than me so it all balances
out right if I took a look right now at
the red oh here's a question okay would
you go one altra ride 1440 or 327 1080s
like 327 aims for gaming I would do the
three okay for mixture of content
creation like I do in gaming the ultra
wide all the way do you say to all
Troy's r11 ultra wide yeah I burning too
which is perfectly fine with me it
doesn't bother my OCD that it's not
perfectly symmetrical so I'm not gonna
show you guys the numbers but nikka see
right here YouTube red is about 10% of
the income yeah yeah so it's about 10%
which is not bad at all gonna do the
maths yeah ultra red I like ultra wide
for content and editing stuff like that
then I get four shooters I don't like it
for shooters that's my only beef with it
but I do love it for racing games like
just wide open games I can't do flat
panel or any panel anymore for racing VR
VR screaming yeah especially now so we
took so much god people were salty
when we put the X 299 and at home
theater PC how many times how much did
we say what we were making that video
that age that met PC master-race was
gonna lose their right because one
everyone's mad at X 99
tell anyway geez you put up this video
 on into oh no you got almost
like I said in that video that I'm still
gonna do video content on it cuz it's up
to you to decide if you want it not me
yeah so it's up to me to present the
information you do what you want with it
dude are from the 4770k system to this
one that is night and day on the VR
perform yeah yes absolutely absolutely
granted the only complaint is still the
blue moon from the Sun I know yeah I'm
project car and project is the blooms a
little bit blinding so we disabled bloom
in VR cuz you can't see anything when
you're driving into the Sun which is
probably real realistic in real life but
the thing is even when the Sun is like
not in direct view like it's above the
roof of the car it still blinds you yeah
it's not much but I just bought the new
in win 101 nice
mo makes great stuff can you buy the new
EK aluminum radiators on their own right
now don't yell at me umm yes they're
gonna be offering those separately I
don't know when but they are gonna be
offering components so that you can
expand your kids they did tell me that I
think what they're doing right now
though is they're just ramping
production up on all the kit creation
and then they're gonna start doing the
individual mmm hi Nick I'm enjoying the
coke coke loud nuts monkey he spelled
your name wrong um show but why have you
got your Butler Ox gene oh well I need
comes because I'm white that's so racist
I have I have the Butler cuz I need
company and I'm really quiet so he does
mostly talking and he's kinda like my
anger translator racist when I get angry
I could quiet but he translates for me I
identify as a black guy um Jake you're
the reason I got my 1080i and started to
overclock and play with all that good
stuff if you ever need some good lovin
and come up to Washington I can't be
that good loving Wow
panda bear said that panda bear wants to
love me there's already a bear up in
Seattle who wants to love me I know the
cuckoo bears - hey Jay my brother's
coming up could you explain to my
girlfriend why it's hard to get a PC
enthusiast a computer gift want to clip
it and show her that's right den de Nez
ex
eleven dinners x11 okay I hope he's
watching right now okay girlfriend PC
master-race and gaming enthusiasts are
very particular about the parts they
they want in their system they research
this stuff they spend hours looking at
reviews like mine and Linus and Paul's
and Kyle's and whoever else they know
what they want and if you try and
surprise him unless you're really good
at paying attention to a search history
and that might be terrifying in itself
then you're probably not gonna get the
right thing and although he'll try and
act surprised and grateful it would not
be the thing he wants it's like if
you're into handbags I don't try and buy
my wife a purse I never will buy my wife
a purse I know I don't know enough about
her tastes to even come close to getting
the right one so if you really loved
your boyfriend you would get him a gift
card yeah that was almost a t-rex hand
flattened by every guy it's not working
okay ed block fee thank you sir I feel
bad when I say that I'm not guilty I
blocked well I guess doing this he said
Holly not holy
Holly holy haven't caught you
license tech top got to go kids have
checkups have my own channel now have
any tips for shortening editing time
have a 6,700 k with 2 times 10 80s and
sli he wrote that only 7 minutes ago
please still here i render at 4k 60p s
love your channel so what I do in
Premiere to to speed up my editing and
nick has seen this is I have a folder
called design elements that has all the
things in there I like to use like my
intro overlays sound effects I use all
the time like the woosh sound when I do
the push transition and stuff like that
that's all in one place I also make a
custom presets bin where instead of
having to dig through all the file
folder break down or type in what I want
every time like a dip the white
transition crossfade constant gain
exponential fade when it comes to like
audio transitions and stuff I take my
most common used elements and I move
those into their own folder and then
that's always open so it's always a
click and drag to things that I need so
I have all my design elements and things
I use the files for the videos all that
stuff on one screen
my timeline and preview on another
screen so that's why I had the two
ultra-wide so when I open up the editor
on there and then I go to edit it's
extremely efficient and streamlined when
I edit on this thing because I don't
have the real estate for that it
literally feels like it takes me twice
as long to zero all it's having you
switching it means that you know really
help you yeah but I also to have a
really small window a really small
timeline all my effects and stuff I mean
it's just too much to fit on a 17 inch
screen gotta get to another monitor yeah
but it was also nice to just sit on the
couch with my feet up on the Ottoman on
editing too because the the video you
guys saw about this was rendered on this
whoa render step chin yeah that video
was made on his laptop wise cooking's
monkeys laptop oh because I'm sitting my
knees a more upright and his he's kinda
like my feet are like stretched out on
the coffee table um I think your fractal
baked in ads are awesome I don't use
that block but I enjoy your content a
lot compared to Netflix this is a
bargain I'd like to now announce that I
am expanding to Netflix another problem
that issues config I haven't I have a
problem that Asus can fix my Asus
crosshair is the problem that they can
fix it or did you typo saying they can't
fix it can't fix my Asus crosshair 6 + r
7 1700 show 17c idol and my is
overclocked at err 3.7 past this at Asus
1 I don't pass RMA stuff on to
manufacturers I get people that that's
this kind of rolls back what we said
earlier like it would make a good series
like if we just kind of went undercover
and use fake names and stuff to go
through RMA process and see what it's
like because I get unfortunately emails
all the time for people saying like my
thing broke and this company won't fix
it and they're jerking me around can you
please send them a message and tell them
to fix it it's like it's not my job to
be mediator between these companies ok
I'm not involved in that it's not it's
not what I do that's that's one of the
the things I was going through my mind
we were talking about like
RMA cop and I've only got a couple left
here undercover RMA
does the reservoir on the EK a 240
contain aluminum no it's all right I
would like to purchase a 240 but for
aesthetic reasons would like a bigger
reservoir no it is all plastic
it's a acetal I believe it acetal no
it's not obviously the see-through part
it's probably acrylic but the the actual
top and bottom is acetal the plugs are
aluminum though so you'll want to
transfer those plugs to any other
reservoir that you get most rez is on
the market like bits power Reza's other
ek Reza's they are they are acetal so
just transfer over the plugs because you
don't want the nickel-plated plugs just
keep it all aluminum for best longevity
and you'll be fine more studio blog so
you can get some progress the problem
with the studio vlogs is they don't get
a lot of traction you know we have to
gauge how much time we put into making a
video and they might have returned we
get on that video this is a business
this is a business content creation is
our business and we want to maximize the
amount of work that we do and in every
turn we get for that work so when we do
vlogs it still has editing time in fact
maybe more editing time even because we
have to scrub through sometimes a couple
hours of footage to try and put together
a 15 minute entertaining video where
when we do a review we might have 20
minutes of video to go through because
it's all thought out and and it's it's
like okay we're shoot this this this
these are our shots put it together off
we go we've got a very streamlined
process you have to take into account
like because it's more streamlined vlogs
we kind of like to go candid with them
and in between the funny moments there
could be like a ton of dead time in
between each so you have to watch the
whole thing to find those moments yeah
and so it takes longer to edit those
videos and then when we do that and we
get less than 10% of viewership then
it's kind of like not worth putting that
much production effort into it a typical
baseline that I like to say is most
channels will get anywhere between 15 on
average 15% of your subscribers will
watch a video two really good videos
perform like 20-25 percent
so for instance at 1.15 million
subscribers right now I expect 100 and
fifteen 115,000 views at minimum per
video okay that's the baseline that's
only ten percent right if I don't get
that then a video has underperformed
significantly so it's not worth pursuing
that anymore or that that's a sad truth
yeah yeah the amount of time that gets
involved in that that's partly our fault
though because we stopped doing vlogs
for a long time and our vlogs needs to
do really well but because we stopped
doing them I think we've had a lot of
growth I mean three or four hundred
thousand extra subscribers since we were
making those only to where the news I
think the new subscribers are like
what's this alright what's this
vlog crap you know you got to remember
this if you're a longtime viewer you've
seen the transition you've seen the the
growth new people haven't unless they go
back and really watch which is unlikely
I've got like 900 videos right just put
two idiots in the search bar yeah they
haven't seen the growth they just know
this and so they're there they're at a
loss of the groceries the history what I
love is when people are like what's the
poor example think about this the other
day was talking about this in the
discord right I said you know it's funny
as my audience loves when I built gaming
computers but if I play games on the
channel they're like why the hell are
you playing games
oh my game it's like I built a gaming
machine obviously I'm into games maybe
but if you play games are like I don't
want you thinking just give it so it's
we're constantly making decisions based
on that and unfortunately there is this
you have your dedicated fan base which
I'd like to say is around like I can
guarantee the same 50,000 people right
now we're gonna watch every video no
matter what I can I could roll I could
put up a 10 second video be like you
guys want to hear me part and we get
50,000 views ok I guarantee it but
that's not gonna paid bills you know
that's reality does he have any restart
how likely are you to recommend this
device to a friend or colleague what
what is this review right now how
likely are you to recommend this device
to a friend a colleague wait the device
or the or the operating system feedback
hub you may contact me for more details
oh please call me
I can't answer this question give us
feedback okay here we go not sure I
understand the question or response
options
tell us more your OS is a steamy pile of
horse that has been sitting in the
Phoenix Summer Sun for two weeks cloud
and blended into a smoothie lingos chat
out again and reap and repeated 14 times
shipped to Bill Gates himself and then
go on turn into a fart sucked out by
Sasha alright I typed that right yeah
okay and submit very good that was the
best time for that to pop up you know
that I appreciate that an opportunity
Windows 10 you're on it that was amazing
Jay I would like to see you do a Burnout
with the car that gonna good doing that
garage you know I don't do burnouts with
my cars cuz that's how gets blown
up like I told you guys about it's built
differential bushings and stuff built
for grip not gift what is she talking
about um while I was doing this live
stream my computer ran really popped up
and Windows 10 wanted me to recommend it
to a friend and then I clicked I don't
understand the question this I said
provide us details and I did it's like
yeah it's like origin asking for
feedback would you recommend a friend no
but if it comes with the game they want
to play they have to use it anyways so I
asked the question yeah Jay should do
$100 build guide build guild hundred or
guild
lol's @j okay I'm gonna I want to try
and get through the last of these
comments were quick yeah and then we're
gonna go I got a hit I'm gonna leave
soon cuz I'm right everyone back to the
office today and I've got to get I got
ride my bike 15 miles back home to wash
up and then go to the gym I'm a monster
I mean like sponge bath yeah he doesn't
wipe down with a wet cloth yeah more
studio of cancer that when Starbucks and
adblock keep doing what you do thank you
sir
you're mentioning VR and racing are you
planning on doing i racing server
anytime soon
with you guys we've done hosted stuff
like a few times but I don't have like
us a dedicated server anything like that
I don't have idea yet and I'm playing i
racing some money pit remember it's a
monthly subscription you start with the
select tracks and cars but almost any
hosted race you've got to download cars
and tracks which cost you 15 bucks a pop
yeah it's stupid I probably I probably
have 500 bucks in this entire racing not
including the subscriptions which I've
had for three years now
dude right so yeah I've got 500 bucks
probably just in DLC I still have to
Explorer said of course because I found
those like you could download tracks
like Monty tracks on what not yeah can't
wait for thread Ripper reviews running
EVGA x58 classified with OCD on fifty
six ninety four point two you could use
refresh after seven years built to know
nine what do you think
I think thread Ripper is going to rip
that thing apart no pun intended
okay fine Emmett massive says I didn't
mean for that to be racist can I change
it to made instead lol oh he made the
Butler comment fine that's better where
black and white you made to wear black
and white right yeah never had the
chance to catch a live show before
here's five by coconut monkey at
Starbucks I bottom what you doing yeah
um keep up the good work so that's just
reimbursement thanks and I used my
redeem stars for a free one so no
monastry they make how do you like the
MSI laptop he has the people of the
version it's awesome and that's why he
doesn't do reviews what yeah I like it
it's it's like it's like alleys corner
and Family Guy
I never go to Ali's corner here for
adopt-a-pet who wants it oh thank you
ollie and it's pretty much what I could
fit my reviews into a single tweet like
he only needs like 92 of 140 characters
that's a good challenge you guys to try
doing that like reviewing a product like
reviewing something in the full tweet
but using all the characters okay you
like that laptop I love it well yeah
it's great I love the high refresh rate
he works for the games I'm not like
trying to play max graphics I didn't
talk about battery life in this it was
it was on my notes but I didn't really
mention it because two things one
reported battery life on this is about
four hours which I could say is about
right because remember we plugged it in
on the on the plane and it didn't charge
yeah episode I think my power supply
both years - yeah required too much
power so it is in charge on the plane I
was just editing away on battery life in
performance mode and I got I think I got
about three hours out of it in
performance optimized mode in premiere
before I got the warning that it was
gonna die I got two levels of doom and
then like five minutes of Forza horizon
3 before it just started chugging like
yeah when we're down to like 10 FPS yeah
like because you were in a game you
weren't able to see the battery pop ups
right but I was in Premiere so I could
see the battery pop ups I'm sorry but a
laptop like this should never be
measured based on its battery life it's
not it's not meant to be like a powerful
computer to use on its battery there's
no battery in the world that can keep
this level of hardware running for hours
and hours it's not a it's not like a
MacBook rerun that thing ten hours you
know yeah ah
it's just tough zg7 a motherboard well
an MDOT to drive stop me using any PCIe
slots I don't know I don't have a tough
motherboard I don't see why it wouldn't
hi Jay nice name by the way Oh his name
is Jay Miller
ah Jay bruh I came on a 7600 K at 4.9
with a hyper 212 Evo can't get it stable
at 5 would it be worth getting a IO to
get 5 because it's stable I don't know
if you're hitting a thermal wall at the
voltage you need to run to hit 5 any i/o
might help
but a 7,600 case and 200k they're still
very warm CPUs so it might help
but you're not gonna if you just want
the five gigs to say I've got a five
gigahertz processor I'm happy then then
go for it otherwise are you doing
anything that's gonna truly utilize the
whole five gigs yeah I was answering
questions randomly so he prefers to type
in chat on stream that actually well
you're at sake so the question was would
G what would be the lowest end CPU you
would recommend for playing a csgo and
overwatch like whether it fits the
budget data the potato tater I don't
know I don't I don't know what the
budget is first of all well I mean csgo
is a hard one right because everyone's
so particular but the FPS they want yeah
some something about the correlation
between the super high refresh rates and
mouse sensitivity I don't know I don't
know I just make sure it's running plus
60 and I could I could play it
yeah but any true csgo like genetics big
sixty pc master race card we
right I don't know hey suck it is so I
stopped playing it and I really suck at
it
J a fractal core 500 build a su Strix
270 I I 7777 said 180
oh I 777 okay he like put it all
together 4.8 get your Hertz over 90
degrees C not to it and HD 15 at 5 gigs
but thermal throttles see I'm doing
deleting or stretch right arrow first
try it a IO first d letting should be a
last resort you ruin all warranty with
it and you could very well damage it
even with the proper deleting device
getting 92 95 cm prime95 small f TT
4790k with each 100 v - any ideas using
c PID and corsair link for monitoring
um prime95 can you try that before you I
don't even want to answer that because
I'm inclined to say something's wrong
with the seating of your block or your
cooler prop maybe air flow to your read
but if that's not the case then try it
with a 264 Free Edition prime95 I don't
use that anymore I don't I don't find it
to be a very good stress test in itself
I prefer to use a 264 because it's it's
just updated better it takes advantage
of the architecture a little better and
truly tests it like it should be prime
95 is something I stopped using several
years ago if you're getting the same
tips temps or something like ADA
then I would take a look and make sure
that your pump in your H 100 isn't dying
what was this beeves I'm looking to
build a PC yeah speak up I'm lucky to
build a PC for 1080p for 144 Hertz ultra
wide should I stick with upgrading the
gtx 1070 or an r5 1600 or wait until
equivalent via card to come out well you
can't really answer that because vague
is not it's not yeah it's gonna be more
powerful in 1070
but if he's ready at 14 if he's 144
Hertz ultra wide I'm gonna assume it's a
34 40 by 1440p panel yeah but he didn't
get the resolution which is a very
important key factor if you're running
an ultra wide and that and a high
refresh rate panel all the GPU
horsepower you can get my friend hello J
Nick love you guys here's for the
adblock started watching your channel
back in 2013 when I built my first
computer continue making outstanding
content thank you
yeah 2013 when you go back and look at
the channel it's kind of shocking yeah
the first thing people say is like wow
Joe you were so much better where
doesn't go jump tickets is fine
I'm still pretty fat today but I'm a lot
better than I was then but also to just
the quality right the mic quality was
terrible the camera quality was terrible
I was I didn't but it's still a learning
curve you know oh yeah yeah start from
something we talked about earlier that's
the evolution of the channel you new
channels don't start with this level of
production quality and those that try to
start with this level of production
quality end up quitting because they put
so much man hour a manpower into it they
don't get the return they wish they
and so they quit because they're like
why am i putting all this time and
effort into this and I'm getting nothing
out of it when instead of just starting
with a webcam and a Yeti mic like I did
they started with all this because
they had the money and then they
realized like I'm not doing all this for
a hundred views no do you like to see
you do a Burnout with your car oh you're
the answer that yeah yeah no hell no I
wouldn't ever do a Burnout in my car
like that I know like I had no tire
sponsors either no you should do it
right before if they get new tires it's
just so hard on the suspension and and
the trim and everything in that car
knowing my luck I would be one of those
guys that's super rare and breaks this
carbon-fiber driveshaft you know which I
think it's replace expensive no the
queer community of all your bids just
supporting the content money isn't
because adblock but I'm sorry if you're
using it I just whitelisted you on it
thank you sir I mean whitelisting it is
definitely the answer if you appreciate
the content and that content creator
doesn't shove ads down your throat with
Adsense like mid rolls and all that
stuff try this earlier but didn't hear
response to a Oh coolers need their
liquid changed hi I answered that I said
I said loops like anything ASA
tech-based Corsair NZXT the new fractal
stuff that stuff is not designed to be
serviced even ones that are expandable
like the Kelvin from fractal which is
not available in the states and the new
s 36 and all that stuff doesn't need to
be serviced unless you open it but the
ones that are expandable if you don't
open it you don't have to service it
they're not meant to be serviced and
there's ones actually that have warranty
stickers on them where if you try and
service it then you void your warranty
thanks to all the tips we'll watch the
whole stream later recently moved most
of my resources to my gaming one
terabyte SSD Adobe on a 500 gigabyte SSD
LS on two terabyte hard drive it sounds
a lot like the way I do my system AJ for
game dev 2x 1080i or one Titan XP I'm
not a game dev I have no idea how you
would utilize that so I can't answer
that do I buy predator now or should I
wait for some new to drop I want
ultra wide curved low
high refresh rate and gsync weights
because the predecessor to the AC Swift
panels that we had a swift panel that we
have now the ultra whites they're 100
Hertz panels are essentially the same
tech that's like in the predator they
have new ones coming out which are 200
Hertz you saw I'm trying to sell it guys
oh oh my god
yeah so 200 Hertz versions of those are
coming out so in their IPs
so yeah it's probably gonna be very
expensive probably gonna cost as much as
his whole system but yeah if you wanna
if you are asking if new stuff is on the
horizon the answer is always yes
want to build a PC for small form-factor
bringing to land want to use the
computer as a streaming computer with
external capture card win at home well
they 7609 kb enough for streaming or
should I get risin 5
it is absolutely enough for live
streaming if that's the only thing is
doing a 7600 K will have a hard time
live streaming the content on the same
machine like your gaming on but if
you're gonna use a capture card to that
machine then it doesn't matter because
the capture card is doing all the
encoding and then your system is sending
up the stream which is not that that
much tasks like the laptop over there
when I started up the stream it's
sitting yeah we're streaming this on a
laptop right now 1080p 60 yet yes
it's sitting at 15% CPU load because
we're using a capture card that bring in
the video and then the OBS is encoding
it up at 6000 kilobits for a second I
feel like you should scoot over a little
bit though right and if it squeeze my
arm in then I'm sinnard see it's just
where my arm is okay maybe so both hi J
and Nick keep up the great content I'll
be building a 12 core thread river box
when it's available I look forward to
the reviews when the parts are out he's
running a I 7 950 with 224 gigabytes of
RAM it's a lot like your old system you
know 929 60 oh you were one step up yeah
I meant to keep
920 but I was a fork or a thread thanks
for the help the highest I got was 67 C
on a 264 yes he already entered me is it
yep see that's why I don't trust prime95
hmm so you got 67 C on a 264 I would go
with that you're cooling a spine prime95
is designed to blow up a I mean
quite harnesses so alright I think with
that guys we're gonna go ahead end this
thanks for hanging out today um like I
said I am going on vacation starting at
the end of the stream you know I gotta
go we got out register for the AMD thing
we got some administrative stuff we have
to do but I will see you guys again next
week we have a video going live on
Tuesday you don't want to miss it if you
liked our fractal ads you don't want to
miss that trust me on that
also to merchandise store has been set
up the shirts are about to drop because
we've been finalizing like the material
or not yeah we've got like 20 different
shirts with different material and
different printing process and stuff on
them to find because I'm extremely picky
that's why I haven't had merch or any
any shirts for a long time because I'm
extremely picky with the way that
clothes fit and if I'm not happy with it
I'm not gonna sell something that
someone else is potentially not gonna be
happy with right so if I'm happy with it
then I feel like at least I could stand
by it but if I'm not happy with it how
am I gonna take your guys's money for
shirts that's how you confidently sell a
product you have to be behind it
I feel like everyone should have
standards like that and I'm not yeah I'm
not Tooting my horn but that's that's
honestly why I have been in the channel
five years and didn't have shirts it
makes logical sense so we finally
decided to decided on a brand and I'm
happy with it
so the store I was simply email
yesterday the store has been set up I
have to approve it make sure I like the
way of things laid out color size
options and the sizes do we'll go up
high because that that was another thing
I actually told the brand okay
we're I'm done I'm not I'm not gonna
work with you even after we've gone
through the logo design and printing and
all of that when they told me that they
weren't gonna carry anything higher than
a 2x and then they're like well we might
be able get a 3x and I was like do you
know how many people have requested 5x
you know as a guy he used to weigh 500
pounds
a guy who used to wear a 6x shirt I'm
not gonna I'm not going to cut off that
portion of my audience and be like sorry
you don't have an option to buy my
merchandise because I went with a brand
of shirt that doesn't support a big guy
and as a former big guy and still
somewhat big guy
that's important to me okay so that's
why this has taken so long I've seen a
lot of people asking me like why the
heck is it taking so long P to sell your
shirts when obviously they're available
what you're seeing or prototypes or
indie if I'm not mistaken I believe we
are carrying up to a 6 X sweet a 6x
shirt only one that would fit you
comfortably like this it's a heavier
material it's a tighter neck the sleeves
are a little longer because the problem
is a lot of these shirts now are what
they're called modern fit so that's what
they're like they have short sleeves up
to here I'm like what is that crap is
that I'm not a hipster I don't need that
 I want a full sleeve like this this
is the shortest sleeve I would ever wear
right here right I'm just and that's
shorter than this yeah this and so this
this the maroon shirt you guys have seen
me wear recently that goes all the way
down to the elbow that's that's the cut
so anyway that's that and we're gonna
end this now thanks for hanging out
today not that mr. donation comment I
sincerely apologize there were tons and
tons of them yeah
but I'm going on vacation see you guys
next week don't miss Tuesday's video and
with that we'll see you in the next one
I guess a button no we got to talk for a
few more seconds I accidentally closed
the page to stop the stream oh that was
the how satisfied are you with YouTube
live like you really want to know how
much I like your is it done god I
want them to respond to that nope not
done yet now it's done all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
