taken a look at some other products here
from coolermaster like the reaper mouse
right here the mech mechanical keyboard
right there that feature something
really unique in the market with that
removable aluminum panel that allows you
to customize the look and feel of your
peripherals if you're a hardcore game or
even if you're not just if you want to
have something custom so we're going to
take a look at the last piece of the
aluminum series from coolermaster and
that is the pulse our headphones
now you guys know me I like to actually
use product I say this in every single
video I don't just unbox it i like to
use it for a while before i formulate an
opinion and these are absolutely no
exception so while i'm wearing them go
ahead and see what the packaging holds
and we'll talk about some of the specs
on this and then i will get into my
opinions about headphones and headsets
the headsets are really hard to review
because you guys can't hear what I'm
hearing and even if you could you may
not be hearing at the exact same way
that I hear I mean our eyes our ears our
tastes everything is subjective to our
own personal taste even though we're
taught my hearing so take everything
that I'm saying here as being my
experience your experiences may vary now
specs on here are 42 millimeter drivers
so there's 42 millimeters worth of
woofer in here giving you some really
good punch to the sound frequency
response is just like everything else on
the market 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz once
again is basically the coverage spectrum
of the human ear basically says you can
produce sound from 20 Hertz which is a
really low base to 20,000 Hertz which is
like a very high buzz basically to put
it the impedance is 50 ohms and the LED
color in there is white as you can see
it's come a kind of be kind of hard to
pick up on the video there are actually
LEDs inside both the beer cans and the
microphone now the microphone pickup
pattern is an omnidirectional so it
doesn't just pick up what's in front of
it it does kind of pick up what's around
it it has a frequency response of 100
Hertz to a thousand Hertz right in the
middle of the human voice spectrum
allowing it to kind of drowned out so
the background noise and pick up what's
common for the human vocal range you
guys may notice immediately that these
do feature a steel headband kudos for
that that gives these ultra durability
now I did have coconut monkey stop by
when i first got these and got his
impressions on them and he felt that
whereas they are small they felt sturdy
they didn't feel like they were going to
break the ear cans are on a swivel so
they are going to match up with your
head whatever angle that your ears may
happen to be because after all we all
have different sized heads right i mean
not it's not necessarily one size fits
all so the adjustability and
the swiveling here of the cans are
perfect for me and the size of them
makes them sit right over my ear but not
really touch anything else other than
the skin around my ear I don't have a
very big head physically maybe
metaphorically I could have some
adjustments but anyway when I wear
headphones especially new headphones I
usually fall victim to the break-in
period and what I mean by that is they
tend to squeeze on my jaw and right
underneath my ear that part of my skull
like it's very uncomfortable so badly
and on some headphones that I have no
choice but the stack up books and let
these sit for a couple of days like this
to kind of break them in rather than
using my head to do it because it's very
uncomfortable that wasn't the case with
these because the size of the ear cans
were pretty much perfect for me now like
I said we all have different sized heads
the earcups themselves are sort of a
pleather here they are I don't know if
they're real leather or not doesn't
really matter they're very comfortable
and they're very soft but I've noticed
that they pretty much have like a memory
foam in there so what makes these really
interesting is the fact that they become
very close cans because the foam sort of
squishes and forms to your head so you
get a perfect seal and for that they
makes them very good at noise-cancelling
especially when you're gaming you're not
going to hear someone coming up behind
you if you're gaming with these so you
may be in for a little bit of a scare
there if someone comes tapping on your
shoulder now on the side of course
you've got the aluminum panel here which
is detachable to allow you to have easy
cleaning access as well as customization
of these you can paint them put a custom
decal on them whatever you want to do
make them your own the cans are
adjustable looks like they're adjustable
about one inch on either side up and
down so if you have an extremely big
head I'm gonna do something about
shrinking you're hit now the padding on
top is very very soft it doesn't feel
like they're pushing down on my head in
fact I've worn these in my livestreams
you guys have seen it on tech talk that
I'm wearing these headphones with the
mic detached because the mic is
detachable so if you just want to use
them as headphones you can do that
configuration on these is analog plugs
for the microphone and the earphones but
a USB power to give the drivers
additional power as well as to light up
the led so the LEDs that are in the ear
cans and the microphone are powered by
USB so it's not very friendly when it
comes to mobile devices although you
could plug it in and still power it and
get some sound now controls in line
controls I do kind of feel this is the
weak link and here is why the mute
switch is a slider a toggle perfectly
fine however the volume is also a slider
I don't like sliders for two reasons one
they're easy to bump and move and two
depending on the position where the
slider is you get static as you're
turning it up and down because it's the
sound of the contact sliding on there
rather than having a dial which is
actually a magnetic device in there that
creates resistance based on the way that
that works the slider on the other hand
you can actually pick up sound and
interference from the mechanism in there
as you're sliding it and depending on
the position you put it in you may end
up with some static just in the position
that it's sitting in so I recommend
using your actual operating system for
controlling your volume not so much the
slider i mean maybe it's good for having
a quick you know you can just turn it
all the way down real quick and all the
way up if you need to turn sound down I
don't really care for the slider though
when it comes to the volume that
definitely is a drawback in my opinion
it's also got a white LED on there they
could have stood a pedal maybe a clip on
there so you can clip it onto your shirt
or something otherwise you do kind of
find yourself fumbling to find it which
is a problem with inline controls I'm
just about any headset I don't like in
mind controls period I prefer on the ear
cup or the can adjustments I have no
problems reaching up and doing that now
the microphone does not move up out of
the way it is fixed in this position
once you plug it in you can adjust where
the mic goes because it's adjustable but
again you can't move it up out of the
way so it's either on or off and then
adjustable in and out closer and farther
away to
your mouth now sound quality on these as
with many gaming headsets they are very
bass heavy they are very bass heavy in
fact i went into my eq and pulled base
out and i like bass I like dubstep and I
like very bassy music so I ended up
pulling bass out because it was very
bass heavy I personally would rather
have a bass-heavy headphones as I pull
base out of through my own eq rather
than having a flat headphone that I
can't bump the bass up on now when I'm
gaming with these in battlefield 4
explosions and things sound amazing the
mids are good and not ear piercing the
highs are crisp but not uh they're not
annoying they're not sharp they're very
smooth highs and how to explain it now
these are not audiophile grade
headphones but i will say that these are
amongst the best headphones i personally
heard when it comes to gaming and music
typically as gamers we get headphones
that are kind of tailored towards sound
for games and they're not very good for
music and vice versa but i did find that
these very comfortably fit the music
music genre and the gaming genre my ears
don't touch the inside when they're on
and even when i push down so i'm not i'm
not dealing with any uncomfort on that
but you know let's go ahead and do a mic
test i'm going to do just like I did
before I'm going to take the mic I'm
going to plug it into my zoom h4n and
you're going to hear raw sound coming
directly into the zoom without having
any interference of any pc parts or
whatnot so let's go ahead and take a
listen to the microphone we have now
switched the audio over to the pulse our
headset and the sound that you are
hearing now is being recorded directly
into my camera now this is what it
sounds like when you plug it in directly
to the recorder not dealing with any of
the interference of the pc components
and stuff which are known to kind of
give a hissing sound a lot of people
want to blame the microphone for a hist
that you hear when you record that is
one hundred percent the fault of the pc
and not the headphone so it could have
something to do with some of the
shielding but then again you guys can
hear right now there's absolutely no
problems now i've worn these headphones
for hours at a time and my ears do get a
little bit hot because they are closed
cans they are there is no adjust
to bowl or removable ear cups that go on
these is one size is what you get and
the one material is all there is but you
know I think for its current price point
the features that it offers the sound
quality the microphone quality is really
well-rounded it's a pretty good deal all
in all with what you get these
headphones are absolutely perfect for
gaming but what I like about them is the
fact that you can also listen to music
on them and have a very enjoyable
experience so it's a well-rounded
headset that has more than one purpose
when hooked up to your PC I don't really
like that it requires USB power for the
LEDs but then again when you're really
one of the only illuminated headsets on
the market a little bit of give and take
with that I mean you got to get power to
the LED somehow I really do like these
headphones you could probably expect to
see some custom decal input on all of
these products here from CM storm with
their customizable removable aluminum
nameplates i'ma probably some j's two
cents branding put on this stuff because
after all that's what this product line
is all about giving you customization
options to make it your own above and
beyond the cool designs that these
already are so guys this has been Jays
two cents talking about the pulse our
gaming headset from CM storm tell me
what you guys think what do you think
about the appearance what do you think
about the features and what would you
change if you could change something as
always guys make sure your subscribe so
you don't miss any content like this or
any of the tutorials that I bring you
about PC gaming and how to customize
your computer and as always guys I will
see you in my next video
