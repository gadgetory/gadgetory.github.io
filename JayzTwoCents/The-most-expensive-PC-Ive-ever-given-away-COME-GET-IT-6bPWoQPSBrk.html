much free stuff so if you guys don't
know what's in this box check the link
down below in the description this is
that custom black and gold system that
was built by NZXT using one of their
extremely limited black and gold 700 I
cases coupled obviously with the black
and gold MSI Lightning Z card now this
system right here is extremely rare
because you can't buy this case anymore
so that's why this giveaway is kind of
exciting for me because one it's a hell
of a system whoever gets this computer
regardless of what you've already got
or don't have or whatever this computer
is freaking amazing so it's got a 9900 K
in there that's slightly overclocked
within that ourselves 32 gigabytes of
g-scale ddr4 tridents er DB memory it's
got a z3 90m eg MSI motherboard which of
course is an overclocking motherboard
and RGB lighting and stuff on that and
of course the 20 80 TI lightning Z a
$1600 graphics card that you can't even
buy so yeah this system is going to make
someone extremely happy now we use gleam
to do our giveaways it keeps things as
fair as possible it keeps us legal
because you have to have things like
terms and conditions and all that sort
of stuff believe it or not there's a lot
of legal tape that goes on with
giveaways so that's one of the reasons
why we use gleen because there's various
ways that we can make sure that we stay
in compliance with our giveaways now if
you want to see a full list of the rules
and the terms and conditions on the
giveaway then you need to go there and
read I won't be answering any questions
in the comments or on Twitter about
when's the giveaway end or this and that
because all the information that you
need is gonna be there but what I'm
thinking with this it's this is
basically they have the idea of J once
you giveaway this system for your two
million subscribers we're about to hit a
hundred or 1.9 million right now I'm
hitting a hundred subscribers once again
guys though I remember where they hit
100 that was a that was an exciting day
for me but I digress bro about 1.9
million right now so we think that with
this giveaway and and some other things
that we're doing that we can get that
number to 2 million pretty quickly where
this will be our celebratory giveaway
this is our 2 million subscriber
giveaway so once we hit that number then
we will draw the winner and all that
stuff will be announced on Twitter so if
you're not following on Twitter you'll
have to follow to actually see the
tweets you
or something I don't know we'll figure
it out but that's it this is going to
one lucky winner the part that makes
people very unhappy and I have no
control over this I didn't make the
rules because this isn't my giveaway
I didn't sponsor it this is
unfortunately going to be a United
States giveaway only nine hundred
percent positive on Canada the rules
will be down below because I'll be
updating them but that's because of all
sorts of legal tape that goes into
sending a system like this overseas and
bonds I have to be set up and taxes and
that and all that sort of stuff so it's
one of those things that in terms of
staying as legally out of trouble as
possible this particular system is not
going to be available to those outside
the United States it's sex I know you're
booing right now and disliking I have no
control over it so I can't even get
upset about it because it's not my doing
I promise
just blame to governments it's all in
the government's man they don't want you
to have this computer man I'm telling
you the dollar conspiracy man anyway
