YouTube I'm sure you guys as inboxes
have been it absolutely exploding well
the AMD rise in and Radeon stuff now
today we're gonna talk about something
extremely important as important as it
could possibly get when it comes to AMD
rise in and that is the fact that we
actually changed out the extension cord
with its unique radiator mounted pump
premium sleeve tubing infinity mirror
RGB block and cam software control the
Kraken m22 all-in-one liquid cooler from
NZXT is the perfect choice for small
form-factor liquid cooling to learn more
click the link in the description below
alright so we're gonna be doing some
overclocking here today with the 3900 X
interesting discussion to take place
here because if you've looked at the
reviews and we said in our review that
we were going to be doing a separate
video regarding overclocking but I'm
you've probably already seen by now that
there is not much overclocking Headroom
so we're going to do today is we're
going to talk about some of the settings
here they're pretty much the same as
previous rise them we're gonna use our
crosshair hero board as an example we're
gonna go through some of the settings
what they mean then we're gonna show you
the max over clocks we can achieve on
our 3900 X it should be no surprise
where it's going to land it's pretty
consistent across the board on where
people are ending up we're gonna talk
about how to sort of prepare for
overclocking and what to expect whether
or not it even is worth it this time
around when it comes to AMD
now obviously the 3900 X being the top
tier at least until later this year with
a 39 50 X comes out four more cores this
is a small process seven nanometer with
12 cores 24 threads on the mainstream
sized I guess package will call it
because member there's more than one die
in there so it's a lot of focused heat
so we've ditched the the prism cooler
and obviously went with a corsair h 100
i a I Oh cooler but what you're gonna
see is that things still get pretty warm
so you obviously want to make sure that
you're going to be having cooling taken
into consideration with your
overclocking because we're not in a
chassis here airflow over the V RMS is
also very important so I just said 120
millimeter fan here to blow directly on
the power delivery if you've got a
chassis with plenty of airflow you
wouldn't have to do this but obviously
for this demonstration we're doing
direct airflow graphics card is a really
matter that's completely independent we
just have a twenty to sixty sitting on
are we gonna be doing any gaming today
just a little bit but we're looking at
basically just max performance we can
get out of CPU instructions and then we
have a 1200 watt power supply here this
is overkill for this what you want to
make sure you have a good quality power
supply that you have nice beefy 12-volt
rails in there and that you have more
obviously output then you need so I
would still recommend something like a
700 or maybe an 800 watt power supply
for this because then you could stay in
that nice efficiency curve the other
thing you obviously need is a
motherboard with an overclocking chipset
usually the 70s cue is going to have all
the bells and whistles and stuff that
you want with beefy VRMs beefy chipset
coolers all that sort of stuff so that
you don't run out of power delivery
because that more often than not when it
comes to overclocking horizon ends up to
being a point of failure because people
are trying to overclock these high core
count mainstream CPUs from AMD with
motherboards that are not exactly robust
enough to to handle that so like I said
we're using the crosshair hero
motherboard but here's some of the
things you need to keep in mind and this
is gonna hold true for any motherboard
manufacturer I've never been a part of
any series launch where the BIOS didn't
go through some sort of a maturing
process where some of the stuff I'm
telling you it's just completely
caddywhompus otherwise of caddywhompus
it's a gray hair thing
if you don't have gray hair don't use
that term it's our turn but what I want
to show here is even though we are on
the latest BIOS that we could basically
get our hands on 7702 there there is a
lot of weirdness that's still going on
FiOS you early adopters you get to deal
with this and guess what we're all bug
testers okay so keep that in mind if you
bought rise in 3000 in terms of the
motherboards there's some stuff that you
need to be aware of and what I'm gonna
show you right now is even though we are
set to defaults this is the way it ships
this is out of the box you plug in your
CPU you turned it on you touch nothing
this is the way it is as of today with
this BIOS our CPU is sitting at one
point four seven three volts I can tell
you right now that's the reason why even
with an H 100 I we are sitting at 40 see
a title that's way too high because that
is about a hundred or 200 millivolts or
so actually higher than we need it to be
for stock settings that there's there's
0x
use for that I should have never let
this fly they'll probably come back and
say all the reasons why this is fine and
I'm telling you that's my opinion it's
not fine so the reason why it's not fine
is we started hitting over-temperature
shut down on the cpu because of it
that's not fine and when that happens
with an AI oh there there's nothing you
could say to excuse that same thing with
that voltage on the memory we're running
21 33 base megahertz we did that for our
testing for a reason and we'll show you
why in this video one point 488 volts is
higher than do CP or XMP settings if you
guys unaware DLC P is the AMD version of
XMP which is basically where it tightens
up the timings and speeds up the memory
it's a it's the actual printed numbers
on the modules that's why that's
different than what's printed on the
module that's way too high that should
be one point 3 5 or 1 point 2 4 stock
speed so again we're over vaulting the
memory unnecessarily the other thing
here check this out SOC voltage this is
the voltage for the fabric the the
interconnect between the chip 'let's on
the actual CPU substrate so that should
actually be more like 1.15 ish that's
1.3 - I have no idea why it's so high in
fact even according to Bayer Bauer doing
ln2 overclocking he said don't exceed
like one point two eight to one point
three at the most
we're at one point three - out of the
box so that's a little this that's a
little concerning so I'm gonna manually
set the CPU right now to one point just
go one point three okay and then our SOC
voltage we're gonna set that to again
manual one point two okay dear and
voltage again one point to go one point
three five we'll just go to the dlc
people to to know we're going to move it
and then the CL do VDD G voltage this is
another piece of the fabric so these two
voltages the SOC and the VDD G are tied
together the SOC is the input input
voltage for the BDD G that needs to be
at least a hundred millivolts below this
stock for that is 0.95 volts or one volt
so I'm setting it to 1 volt I have no
idea what it's sitting at now but based
on what I'm seeing here in the PLL 1.8
voltage sitting at two point one
obviously is too high so I have no
reason to believe that the VDD G
wouldn't be over voltage but hey they
got the Southbridge right so at least
they're 1 for like 12 so anyway now that
we've gone in
and unworked our voltage settings that
the CPU or the motherboard did on its
own now we're ready to actually
overclock in fact now we're ready to
actually just show you the benchmarks
and we'll talk about the overclock and
whether or not they're even worth it
so why don't we just go ahead and show
you this chart I guess that's why you're
here I hope if you're just here to look
at my pretty face well you know there's
Instagram there's Twitter Facebook kind
of dead haven't uploaded there in like
three years
all right so after spending the last
couple of days because like I said we we
did some more back locking yester
actually a lot of overclocking yesterday
and then went back through and redid all
of our testing today for sanity checks
and even added a couple of tests that we
weren't planning on so here's the deal
the 3900 X and admittedly this is only
the 3900 X the behavior on 3700 X and
the other skews might be different you
can look at all the reviews that have
made it out in the market both written
and video format and you'll find that
for 2 for 3 as a sweet spot very few
people hit 4 or 4 if they did it took a
lot of volts to get there some people
got complete duds and lots of silicon
lottery where they couldn't even get 4:1
and so it's one of those things that
it's kind of interesting because the way
that the performance boost that's built
into the CPU is it depending on the
workload it's gonna boost higher or
lower now you can see as high as 4.6
gigahertz on single core and that's
reflected when we do something like r15
or are twenty or something where we can
physically tell it only use one core the
problem is with so much software now
being at least multi-threaded to the
point to where it could utilize four
cores or more even though we've got
twenty four threads sitting here what
starts to happen is you don't see one or
two cores bouncing at 4.6 you see them
dropping down to more like the 4.3 4.2
range what we saw in almost every single
one of our tests whether it be premiere
or it be worse like blender but we even
did a far cry 5 test because we know
that's a multi-threaded game but we also
know it's a bit of a sleepy bottleneck
for a lot of different reasons but what
we saw was we sat more so around the 4
to 4 point 2 to 5 range and that's only
about 75 mega Hertz ish because it would
bounce slightly lower than our max
manual OC which is 4.3 on all course so
the takeaway from that is that the 4.6
looks really good on paper but depending
on what you're doing you're not gonna
see that that often even in games even
though there were threads sitting
completely idle with far cry 5 at
sitting at 0% utilized we still were
seeing about 4 to 2 for 2 to 5 on those
cores bouncing around and sometimes as
low as 4 1 4 1 5 it bounces all around
it's doing what it's supposed to do but
you would think because most people go
our single threat optimization that's
not entirely true these days because
most games that have been developed in
the last four or five years are using
multi-threading now and as soon as you
go past one core being loaded you're not
going to see that for six you're not
going to see a single core bouncing
around at four six and the reason for
that is because the CC X's have to act
in a grouping so each CC X is
independent of the other however you
cannot differentiate core speed between
different cores on the same CC X so
that's why you see them kind of moving
around as a group so as soon as you're
beyond that one core boost you're not
going to see the for six but core
behavior is only one side of the coin
you have to take memory into account too
you can't directly compare Intel and AMD
though like frequency wise the same as
with GPUs between AMD and NVIDIA you
can't just compare them for frequency
speed either because they're two
completely different architectures what
you're dealing with here and rise in and
this is no different this has been the
case all along what you're seeing is a
maturity of their chip --let kind of an
infrastructure here where you've got two
different CC X's with half the amount of
cores on each plus you know SMT s on
both sides so six and twelve on either
side so one could argue it's two six
core twelve thread CPUs kind of I think
Intel use the joke of glued together
well that's called infinity fabric and
you have control over that as well and
the speed between the communication or
the Infinity fabric is known as the F
clock on here which we showed so some of
our testing methodology included not
only overclocking the memory and then
tightening up the timings and playing
around with that or just letting DL CP
do it and then we overclocked the memory
as well as the fabric and what we saw if
you look at those charts is when it
comes to productivity depending on the
title determined whether or not we saw
any improvement at all so that explains
why in Premiere we saw a minimal
difference between just overclocking the
memory and leaving the the CPU speed the
same and then we saw a big improvement
by leaving the overclocked memory in
place but then increasing the fabric or
the speed between the CC X's and then we
saw again by overclocking 24.3 a very
minimal a two-second difference because
again it's only about a seventy five
megahertz overclock versus where it was
losing to on its own but when it comes
to games on the other hand far cry 5 we
chose this title specifically now we're
be aware this is only one title we want
to do a whole other piece of content
where we go through and test all of our
games with our overclocks and all that
sort of stuff to see if we see the type
of improvements we saw in Far Cry 5
across the board but we chose far cry 5
because we know for a fact it's very CPU
bound we know that the CPU is definitely
holding back GPUs even as far down as
like the 2060 and so that's indicative
of the fact that it's only about 65
between 65 and 50 percent utilized on
our 2080 Ti that's overclocked so for
the testing we did 1080p normal settings
because we're trying to get the FPS high
to put more of a strain on the CPU now
if we had gone 1440 and up the the eye
candy would have taken a lot of that
load up the CPU and it wouldn't have
been indicative of whether or not the
overclocking improved the gaming
performance because we had to induce a
bottleneck that was the point and so we
saw a pretty linear improvement where
when we upped the memory we saw a
significant improvement to not only min
and Max but average and then when we
went with the F clock improvement we saw
again a fairly large jump and then what
shocked me to be honest is because we
were monitoring the core clocks and you
can see it on this overlay that it was
still boosting to about four point two
to five again with some coarse sitting
at 0% not being utilized at all that
just means the game physically wasn't
asking for any more than that so I'm
going to pause the video here for a
second and just kind of chime in on
something I fail to mention here in my
my talking head portion you might be
wondering why we only went to 3,600 on
the memory and we didn't push it farther
than the do CP settings
well that's because AMD is very adamant
about letting us know that if you go
above 3,600 and 1800 megahertz on the
the F clock and 36 hundred megahertz on
the memory you dropout of one to one you
go two to one when it comes to the
memory controller and that you would
have to go in there and fine-tune the
actual you clock to be able to go in
there and start getting that speed back
so one of the things that what we were
experiencing but when above 3,600 was
massive frame per second stuttering in
far cry 5 we would see some nominal
improvements and in some of the
synthetics and stuff in fact the FPS was
not reflected as being poor we lost a
little bit once we went above 3600 on
the average FPS but the stuttering it
remind you the best
describe it is it looked like SLI micro
stutter but that's just because of the
fact that we dropped out of one to one
and went two to one when it comes to the
memory controller and at this current
state at least I'm filming this video we
had no control over the U clock for
trying to bump up the memory controller
speed again so just want to put that out
there seeing an overclock should have
helped on that single core but it helps
more than I thought because even though
we jumped from four point two to five to
four point three we saw again a
significant improvement to mid max an
average now some might be going well but
J you could have potentially hurt the
results because if you just left it
alone it would have boosted the four
point six but no like I said earlier
that's not the case that's why some of
the ideology out there have you know
single core single core single core is
there's not a lot these days that truly
is using only single core and if you are
doing something that's using only single
core why would you buy such a heavily
multi-threaded CPU in the first place so
it's one of those things where when it
comes to overclocking yeah there's
improvements to be had and what seemed
fairly marginal is an improvement
nonetheless by just changing a couple of
settings on the screen and as long as
you had adequate cooling keeping it cool
is another whole discussion we saw a t3c
on water
once we overclocked at only one point
three seven five volts it can get away
with one point three five I just did one
point three seven five because that's
still lower than a lot of the reviewers
were saying they had to use in terms of
voltage so I'm curious is what the
temperatures were an air cooler would
have a hard time keeping the CPU tame
again that's because you have to seven
nanometer chip --let's on there plus a
14 nanometer IO chip late-- how also
handling the memory controllers you have
a lot of focus t remember we are talking
1920 X number of CPU cores in half the
size versus thread Ripper just a couple
years ago so they have not only surance
the process they've shrunk the package
as well which is why you're seeing a lot
of heat with this CPU to be honest it
has me a little bit concerned about the
39 50 X coming out later this year
because it's four more cores and eight
Moore's threads than the 3900 X but you
know all in all there was a lot of
discussion about AMD just sucking when
it comes to overclocking and I mean
that's kind of true we're not seeing
like these massive overclocking Headroom
like you're used to seeing on Intel but
as much as I know this sounds like a
shell discussion for AMD it's
it's a discussion worth having where
Intel has had time to sort of refine its
process this is an entirely new
architecture for AMD of course it's
built upon at Zen architecture as we
know but if you think about it
Intel dropped the Northbridge with Ivy
Bridge Sandy Bridge had a North Bridge
but Ivy Bridge was where they moved in
on to the CPU and if you remember
correctly we were still sitting around
the for 142 you could probably many
overclock to like the 4 3 4 4 range the
4770k came out where they they shrunk an
even more and then it's one of those
things where it got incredibly hot sure
they removed the the solder Tim but we
still were seeing a massive amount of
heat if you try to overclock pass like
4.5 then when skylake came out is where
we saw kind of the maturity of the
manufacturing process and we've been
based off skylake ever since but it's
been about 4 years that that process has
now been refined and if you think about
it
ix gin is the first time we actually saw
5 gigahertz being readily achievable
across the board it took a while to get
there it's gonna take a while for AMD's
process to mature as well to where we
could potentially see higher overclocks
I don't know if we're gonna ever see 5
gigahertz on Zen - I have no idea what
the maturity process is gonna be like
but the fact that with even a marginal
overclock like we have here and this
this is marginal this was nothing but
turning on XMP /d OCP profile moving our
affinity fabric from 1400 megahertz to
18 and then doing a manual 4.3 overclock
on all cores got us improvements across
the board some minor some major so
that's why we want to do a gaming
version of this where we only look at
games to see if that holds true across
all different titles so anyway guys
that's been our overclocking video here
with the 3900 X I've seen a lot of
discussion taking place some arrogant
some educated and it's just this is our
results and this is the way it kind of
came out so add our results to the giant
mix of endless AMD's and two topics and
discussions and videos are out there
right now and formulate your own opinion
and what makes sense to you and where
the value is it's one of those things do
you want more cores would you sacrifice
some of that core clock and then you
could play around with a bunch of
different things like VMware you know
doing virtual machines and maybe play
around with some servers and just have a
lot of fun or do you want to go with
less cores but you can find
the Intel side of things but have a
superior core clock which makes the IPC
look better because although the IPC is
better on AMD you have more cycles
happening on Intel which makes it seem
better in the long run because that's
obviously the way that the scale tips so
sign up in the comments below how you
guys feel about where we landed with our
overclocks it seems like we're right in
line with one of the other reviewers are
seeing we've had a solid I know probably
15 hours worth of testing now to get to
these results on just these few
benchmarks and we stand by these results
so sound off in the comments below guys
subscribe if you're new around here and
you wanna see any other rise in or
radeon based content let us know what
kind of test you'd like to see we'll do
our best to incorporate see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
