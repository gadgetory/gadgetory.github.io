video cards fail doesn't usually have
anything to do with electronics it has a
lot to do with the temperatures at which
some of these cards run out as you can
see here we have a GTX 580 that's
running at 81 degrees Celsius and I
think that's a little bit too hot and
I'm going to show you guys how you can
extend the life of your video cards
whether you're overheating or not before
we get into the more advanced techniques
of how to cool off your graphics card
start simple
blow up a dust on the dirt that's
guaranteed to be in your case it doesn't
matter if your water cool to air cooled
dust and debris are going to build up
inside the graphics card it's going to
block airflow and it's going to really
reduce the amount of cooling capacity
available to your card if blowing out
all of the dust or in your case and your
graphics card didn't reduce the
temperatures you might have a more
severe problem when it comes to your
thermal paste now you can change the
thermal paste yourself but there are
some materials are going to need going
into this you're going to need alcohol
pads or wipes you're going to need
thermal paste of your choice and you're
going to need thermal pads you can
generally find these supplies at your
local computer store or somewhere online
the first step in removing your graphics
card is to unplug the PCI Express cables
most graphics cards have to some have
one but you're going to have at least
one plug no matter what
depending on whether or not you have a
dual or a single slot graphics card
you're going to have at least one
retaining screw attaching your graphics
card to the case find the screw and
unscrew it now nevermind all of the
screw and blow comments in this video I
swear to god we're going to keep it
clean while the graphics cards out of
the case you might as well blow it again
this is where things are going to start
to get a little more tedious and you've
got to pull out your fine motor
functions you're going to want to
unscrew all of the screws on the back of
the graphics card to remove your cooler
now this is where you have to put all
your muscles aside and use finesse you
want to gently remove the cooler from
the graphics card it may be stuck pretty
good based on how thick the thermal
grease or the pads are do not pry it off
wiggle it gently and for the love of God
please don't forget to unplug your fan
connector I've seen so many of these
cables get ripped because people pull
their graphics card cooler away and tear
the cable and just as I suspected this
graphics card is suffering from dried
cracked thermal paste the thermal paste
has hardened over time which has really
reduced the amount of temperature that
it's able to transfer due to the correct
corrosive state of the thermal paste so
the culprit in this overheating graphics
card is dry compound that is no longer
doing its job which is not getting the
heat to the heatsink and out of the
graphics card and over time this is
going to lead to inevitable death of
this graphics card
now if you're lucky you might be able to
skip this step the reason why I
recommend you have thermal pads just in
case is in the case of this card when I
remove the cooler many of the thermal
pads torn and they were not able to be
reused and the thermal pads are how you
cool the VRMs and the memory chips on
your graphics card
now you remember that alcohol I was
referring to earlier that wasn't just
for drinking because of the fact that
you're tearing apart your graphics card
and you're scared to death it's to get
all that nasty thermal compound removed
from the heat sink in the GPU now with
all things computer there's definitely
going to be an opinion involved in this
step the method you see me using here of
applying this thermal paste is what's
recommended by ek and installing their
water blocks
now just like when you remove the cooler
and you didn't want to forget to unplug
the power connector for your fan you
want to be sure to reinstall the power
connector in this particular graphics
card when the cooler is installed you
can't access that fan connector so
you're going to want to make sure you
get it on there first now the next thing
you want to do is you want to make sure
that all the screw holes are aligned now
this isn't anything dirty people keep
your minds out of the gutter it's
important to note that the number of
screws and the number of retaining
brackets and things are going to be
different per graphics card when
reinstalling the cooler you want to make
sure that you install the four screws
directly surrounding the GPU first and
you want to tighten these down in a star
pattern now be sure not to over tighten
these screws because you don't want to
crush your GPU heat spreader and you
don't want to strip out the threads now
reinstall your graphics card into your
case by using the reverse method of
however you took it out you're going to
plug in your power connectors you're
going to plug in your video cable boot
your system and you're going to observe
the awesomeness that you are because you
save time and money fixing your
overheating graphics card on your own
and in the case of this GTX 580 by EVGA
we reduced our graphics temperatures
from 81 degrees Celsius to 74 degrees
Celsius and I want to note that the
graphics card was running 81 degrees
Celsius at 75% fan speed and 74 degrees
Celsius at 50% fan speed so there you
are guys J's - since showing you just
how easy it is to fix your own
overheating graphics card with just a
little bit of time and a little bit of
money don't forget I do have a vlog
channel link to it is down below follow
me on Twitter Facebook all of that fun
social media stuff and let me know what
kind of videos you want me to bring you
in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
