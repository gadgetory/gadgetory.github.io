bringing you one of those classic
commentaries something I have not done
in a while and I have to admit I kind of
missed the benefits of doing these they
have some perks like for instance I
don't have to wear any pants you gotta
ask yourself is Jay wearing pants right
now well I guess you'll never know I
could also be doing this video entirely
naked and I apologize for putting that
mental image in your mind it just had to
be said now what am I playing here I'm
playing some battlefield 4 as the
engineer class it is my favorite class I
have a bajillion service stars as a
engineer and my favorite thing to do as
you can see right here is to counter
snipe with my small these guys like to
sit there and the restaurant shooting at
the stairs and vice versa with their
sniper rifles well I like to just pull
out my Big O explosive and well as you
can see blow up their faces with my
small so you're gonna see a whole lot of
that this game and you're also going to
see a whole lot of really shitty
gameplay because well I suck all right
with that said guys let's go ahead move
on to today's topic and that is how to
get the most out of your build budget
now with that said I want to clarify
something this is a build budget not a
budget bill there's actually quite the
difference now I want to kind of talk
about something real quick when it comes
to the word budget many people seem to
think the word budget means cheap AKA
inexpensive AKA spend as little as
possible that is not what budget means
whatsoever people budget simply means
that there is a set dollar amount in
which not to be exceeded that that is
the absolute maximum you have to spend
on any given project now with that said
it could be a five-hundred-dollar budget
it could be a five-thousand-dollar
budget or it could be a fifteen thousand
dollar budget I may come on let's face
it countries have a budget right doesn't
mean it's jape although some countries
kind of
I guess so I just want to put that out
there guys a budget is for you to
determine and my job today is to try and
make your budget go as far as possible
by helping you think about the parts
that you're buying and whether or not
they're right for you now with that said
let's go ahead and move on to the most
important question you need to ask
yourself and believe it or not it's not
how much is my budget because they
already have a price in mind but you
don't know where to spend your money so
you need to ask yourself is this a
gaming computer or are you going to be
doing some rendering maybe making some
YouTube videos a Photoshop are yous
gonna be browsing the internet kind of
checking out some 18 plus type materials
you know where you gotta check that
little box verifying your age is it for
schoolwork college or is it all of the
above I'm feeling most of you are going
to say it's all of the above and if you
haven't been making it rendering
gameplay videos or commentaries or
YouTube chances are you may be
considering it so I have a feeling
you're going to say all of the above now
with that out of the way ask yourself
are you into AMD or intel or do you
truly not care I hope you say you don't
care because there are some pretty good
options on both sides of the fence both
giving you both advantages and
disadvantages now there's a whole
different video about advantages
disadvantages of AMD vs intel but if
you're not going to be biased then you
certainly have a lot of options now it's
kind of what leads to the confusion of
making a video like this necessary
because all of those options make it
very difficult to pick your parts so
let's see if we can't change your
mindset a little bit at the way that you
approach your parts and approach your
build to try and get the most out of it
now do you have any parts to reuse
that's kind of a big deal if you have
any hard drives you can reuse or you
have a computer case may be a decent
power supply you can reuse every dollar
you don't have to spend on a component
is more money you have to put into the
most important components of your build
and those important components are going
to really depend on the answer to
question number one what are you doing
with your computer now we're going to go
ahead and look at it from two different
perspectives i'm going to basically talk
about gamer prioritization and rendering
prioritization now gamers you should
really be prioritizing your GPU over raw
cpu power
I feel that about a third of your budget
should be sent or spent on the GPU so if
you have a thousand dollar budget set
aside about three hundred dollars to go
into graphics card if you have a $1,500
budget set aside about five hundred
dollars to go into your graphics card
it's a pretty good rule of thumb and it
actually goes a long way in terms of
getting the most for your money now with
that said there are some exceptions
where CPU power does come into account
with certain games I mean games like
daisy or minecraft with a lot of texture
mods or maybe a what's that one game
Elder Scrolls or something like that I
remember I wasn't very into the whole
Elder Scrolls thing but I believe
there's a lot of texture mods and things
that can really ramp up the CPU and
memory usage so you need to take a look
at the requirements for the games that
you're playing the mods available and
how you plan on playing those games
those are up to you and those are the
exceptions to the rule so for the most
part gamers should be prioritizing their
GPU overdraw CPU power so you might want
to go with that I five and not the i7
and get yourself a better GPU because
you're going to find most games
battlefield 4 battlefield 3 Metro 33
they tend to not really use a whole lot
of CPU power but they certainly max out
the GPU really quickly so you may find
that you don't actually you lose any
frames per second by going with that i5
or the i7 but you may lose a lot of
frames per second by going with that 770
over the 780 or that 760 over the 770
kind of you gotta see where I'm going
with this alright so if you're building
a gaming computer the next thing you
should be doing is pretty much
prioritizing a large hard drive over
going with an SSD now SSDs are really
tempting those fastboot times in those
fast load times four levels can
certainly seem like a benefit but you've
got to keep in mind too that the
gigabyte per dollar of SSDs although
dropping and getting more hard drive
space for your money it still hasn't
come anywhere close to matching the
storage space on a hard drive so you
could get a two terabyte hard drive for
the same price as a 128 gigabyte SSD in
some cases right now
and for the most part you wouldn't get
more than a 256 gigabyte SSD for the
same price as a two terabyte hard drive
and you're going to find that an SSD
feels up really really fast so it makes
no sense to take money out away from
your GPU or your CPU or your RAM for
that matter to go with an SSD you can
always add it later and if your money is
tight save your money and go with a
large hard drive now when it comes to
ram I tend to find that for gamers a
sweet spot is 8 gigabytes or a 8
gigabyte kit which is to 4 gigabyte dim
sticks at 1866 megahertz I've done
videos in the past you can search my
channel and actually see some tests I
did where I test gaming systems and
whether or not increasing ram speed
makes any noticeable difference at all
four frames per second and you'll find
in most cases it really doesn't just
like anything else there are exceptions
to the rule so I would really recommend
going with an 8 gigabyte kit right
around 1866 definitely seems to be the
sweet spot all right those of you
looking at doing YouTube or making
videos or doing rendering or live
streaming this is now pertaining
directly to you you should be
prioritizing the most powerful CPU that
you can get your hands on if your
primary function is going to be
rendering of some sort reason for that
is the GPU although it's able to lend a
hand when it comes to either live
previews or rendering it's not going to
make a vast measurable difference at all
when it comes to the overall efficiency
and time at your computer spends
performing the tasks of rendering so get
the biggest most powerful CPU that you
can possibly afford now when it comes to
ram ram also plays a big part depending
on the software that you're using most
rendering software that are giving you
live previews like I'm watching right
now while rendering this are actually
rendering to the RAM it's called a ram
preview and the more RAM you have the
faster ram you have it actually buffers
out that Ram preview farther into the
future farther in the timeline which
gives you much smoother playback of the
effects and the things that you're doing
in your rendering timeline so Ram is
actually pretty important to rendering
pc so if you're going to be doing
rendering and gaming you're going to
have to find that sweet spot that middle
ground and sometimes it may make sense
to go with something like an AMD FX
core processor or even an intel i5 and
getting a decent mid-range GPU to go
along with your build once again it
depends on your budget if you've just
got sky is the limit and all kinds of
money to spend i have a feeling you
wouldn't really be watching this video
anyway so you're going to have to do the
best you can to determine what is what
it is you're going to be doing the games
you can be playing the type of rendering
and live streaming that you're going to
be doing now with that said I also agree
for rendering that you want to get the
biggest hard drives that you can and
multiples of them if you can the reason
for that is you'll find that your media
storage can fill up really really fast I
can't even tell you how many times I've
outgrown the storage of my computer and
I'm constantly having to get larger
drives archive files and keep as much
space open as I can now because of that
very reason I don't recommend an SSD for
editing I don't edit on my SSD my SSD
pretty much hosts some games some of my
editing software itself but all of my
files are stored on my two terabyte and
my one gigabyte drive or one gigabyte
wild-eyed be a tiny little drive with my
one terabyte drive does holds all of my
media files so SSDs would also wear out
a lot faster if you were constantly
doing read rights to them when you're
doing rendering playback and things like
that so you definitely are going to want
to get the biggest hard drive you can
and once again if buying an SSD takes
away from something else in the build
where you have to make a compromise it
doesn't make sense to make that
compromise in my opinion okay the last
thing I want to talk about when it comes
to getting the most out of your build
budget is I know a lot of people I can't
even tell you how many times I'm asked
whether or not somebody should wait and
buy next-gen this or next gen dad or
should I wait till the 880 comes out
instead of buying a 780 now so we're
going to talk today right now about the
upgrade path what to consider and when
to determine whether or not you should
upgrade now or wait now when it comes to
the upgrade path ask yourself is the
current socket that I'd be buying a CP
for whether that be the am3+ socket for
AMD or the 1150 or 2011 socket for Intel
is there going to be an upgrade path has
it been out for a while is there a
chance of them built this PC and there's
nowhere to go in the future if I want to
make any incremental upgrades well you
know guys chances are that's going to be
a
no matter what where there's not going
to be an incremental upgrade path for
instance x99 s getting ready to come out
it's still a socket 2011 however any
previous cpu generation for soccer 2011
will not work on x 99 so it wouldn't
matter it anyway for the most part if
you find that you're waiting to buy
next-gen stuff you're going to find that
you're always waiting you're always
going to have that fear of oh my god if
i buy something now something new is
going to come out now you can have that
latest and greatest mentality which is
going to freak you out and chances are
you're going to end up paying a premium
for it and getting a very diminished
return now what do I mean by that well I
mean if you wait and buy the 47 90 k for
instance instead of buying the 4770k
when they first came out you would have
found you were waiting six months and
who got very very very little return and
you actually paid a little bit more in
the long run so it may not be worth it
to wait and with that said sometimes it
makes sense not even to buy the
current-gen any wave may be going with
the previous generation that's on sale
would make the better cost-effective
purchase which allows you to have more
money to put in other places of your
build that makes sense like for instance
maybe you go with a 3770k they're still
on sale somewhere and get yourself a
better GPU and you would have never
known the difference especially if you
were doing a purely gaming build now
this pretty much takes us to our next
topic which is should you wait for a
sale or black friday or Christmas or
something like that to build your
computer well obviously that depends on
what time of the year you're considering
buying your computer I would say may is
probably the worst month to build a
computer and the reason why I say that
is one copy texas in june and computex
is the CES of computer parts if you will
where companies like Intel gigabyte asus
msi they all tend to unveil their latest
and greatest at the world stage which is
computex in taipei so i would not
recommend building a computer in May
when June right around the corner is
more than likely going to hold something
new when it comes to the industry now I
also wouldn't recommend if you're
considering building a computer in June
waiting all the way till November for
black friday
cyber monday that just unless you're in
a absolutely a position where you don't
need it now you're in no rush and you
just want to build something now then
maybe it makes sense to wait because
Black Friday and Cyber Monday yields
some pretty amazing results in sales
when it comes to waiting and buying
online getting the most for your money
but once again that really pertains to
the person who has very little money to
spare and really has to make things go
as far as it can now I want to direct
your attention to the gameplay here if
you just happen to be listening this is
the start of a pretty epic take over the
bridge above us is being held down by
snipers which is just lock down the map
so myself and this support class in
front of me we go up to take the bridge
he dies right away and I make some
pretty epic advancements up here so I'm
going to go ahead and just let you enjoy
the gameplay here with some epic music
and unfortunately just like that they
took the bridge back but hey not a bad
run considering eyes suck and cut them
all off guard and got six kills out of
that including the guy down in the
containers but anyway guys I hope this
video has helped you guys don't run out
there and just buy something for the
sake of buying something I've been
guilty of that in the past and I've made
some pretty poor decisions and before
simply because I just wanted to buy
something now so if you still confuse
you still don't know what to do check
out some of my other videos there more
than likely going to give you a hand
hopefully and if they don't you just
still need some more help feel free to
head on over to Twitter I'm as
interactive as I possibly can over there
and I'm really looking at giving you
guys as much advice as it possibly can
to help you be smarter buyers and create
a prosumer out of you instead of being a
consumer as always guys hope to see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
