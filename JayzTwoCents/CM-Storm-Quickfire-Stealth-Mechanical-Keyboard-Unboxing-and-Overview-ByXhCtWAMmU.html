and if you hear anything in this video
that sounds like a fart I swear to god
it's just my chair I have complete
control over myself I swear
recently we took a look at the CM storm
quickfire ultimate mechanical keyboard
if there's one thing we learned from
that video is that some of you just
don't want flashy you don't want lights
you don't want all kinds of function
keys and you don't want a 10 keypad and
you just want a nice simple mechanical
10 keyless keyboard so that's why for
the sake of today's video we're going to
go ahead and take the Quickfire ultimate
and we are going to toss it aside and
we're gonna take a look at the Quickfire
stealth this is a mechanical keyboard
that's got no flash to it but it still
is pretty damn awesome
now the CM storm stealth that I'm
holding in my hand has the Cherry MX red
switches in it and is available in a few
different switch models so you're just
gonna have to go on the website and
check those out but we do have the
cherry MX red if you don't know what the
MX red is check out this video that's
gonna pop up somewhere right around I
will just stick it over my face is
probably the best place for it it's a
video right here that I've done a few
weeks ago that explains what all the
different switches are that are
available from CM storm so go and check
that out so you know exactly what this
witches mean now getting back here to
the Quickfire stealth it's a pretty cool
keyboard and I've been using it on my
workstation to kind of get a feel for it
because it has a pretty unique feature
about it and we'll get to that a little
bit later now inside the package here
you've got your keyboard in the nice
protective sleeve and you have this is
kind of interesting to me you have a USB
to ps2 adapter in there I don't know how
many people really still using ps2 but
either way they've given you one you've
got this package up here that contains
well nothing behind this is really
awkward I'm gonna break an elbow trying
to do this review there's nothing behind
that sleeve and behind this sleeve you
have two packages right there and in
here you have some replacement keys for
the keyboard got some they're branded
Coolermaster and then you have some red
arrow keys to replace the WASD on the
keyboard if you're a gamer and the red
looks really nice you also have the same
braided cable that comes with the
quick-fire series here because remember
the quick-fire keyboards do feature
removable USB and it's actually hey you
know check it out it's braided that's
cool that's always nice and neat and
then you have your same little Quick
Start Guide here that talks about the
keyboard and some of the other
accessories that are available for the
CM storm line now let's go ahead and
take a look at the keyboard because
there's one thing you may notice about
this
where are the letters and stuff how do
you know what you're typing well they
call it stealth for a reason cuz check
this out
oh there's side printed keys they're not
actually on the top of the key so this
may take a little getting used to for
some of you but it's pretty neat because
that means there's no chance of wearing
off your keys at all it's got a nice a
cm storm logo on the back one of the
things some people gave coolermaster
feedback on was they didn't want to see
branding all over the top of the
keyboard they wanted something nice and
clean so they stuck it on the back that
way they know it's there and you know
it's there but it's not visible from
your angle like this it does have a nice
rubberized finish to it so you don't get
fingerprints all over it if you have the
polished piano finish so all around the
bezel is nice and textured and
rubberized including in here next to the
arrow keys you've got you've got some
function keys up here you've got your
multimedia keys you know pause play
fast-forward rewind volume up and down
and all that and it is controlled by the
function button right here just like you
with a laptop and turn to the bottom
you've got the same type of channel here
as we saw on the ultimate where you can
plug in a USB cable and route up the
back or out the sides or whatever you
want
again it features a nice thick rubber
feet on there as well as your little
flip up device here but the one thing
that this doesn't have that kind of
disappoints me a little bit is these are
plastic feet they're not rubberized like
the bottom of the ultimate so if you're
gonna flip these up to get a nice upward
angle of the keyboard it's not gonna
have as much traction as if it were
rubberized there are only a couple of
keys that light up on here and they are
of course the scroll lock key the caps
lock key and there is no num lock key on
here because it's not a
it's a 10 kilos you do have a red back
plate on this and let me go ahead and
remove a key just to demonstrate that
key popper you take that off and look
down inside there now you can see it's a
red backlit we're not backlit take that
back there is no backlighting on this
keyboard but it is a red back plate with
our cherry MX red switch you see just
how easy this is to use you just pop it
down the key and will pop right on off
there the pop right off don't channel so
this is what it looks like with the red
WASD keys on there and you can see they
do also feature arrows on there if
you're maybe new to gaming and you don't
know WASD is because they're also
movement keys in most modern FPS first
person shooter games and on the bottom
right here on the side of the key it
does still feature the letter just like
the rest of the keys now one thing I did
mention is this is not backlit this is a
confession probably why they call it
stealth not only because it's nice and
black looks like a ninja the keys are on
the side but it also does not have
backlighting which is just simple non
flashy which also helps them keep the
price down it features the same solid I
mean as you can see there's no flex to
this keyboard because again it has a
steel backplate on there keeping it nice
and rigid it is pretty heavy it's got a
nice hefty weight to it and it's very
portable as you can see the size of this
keyboard is very small I do really like
this keyboard and like I mentioned I
have been using it for a bit and it's
just really nice and easy to type on and
you're not gonna wear off any of the
letters on there because there's no
letters to wear up so and the cool thing
about this is because they're cherry
switches you can customize the keys on
here by buying custom keys online and
and really customizing this keyboard to
feet fits your needs this is definitely
a keyboard to go check out guys check
