MSI and the new Z 270 chipset and by
EVGA our trusted graphics card partner
I'm at the cyber power suite here at CES
and we've got some interesting things
we've taken a look at now because it's
been a couple years since I've really
checked out anything new that they have
to offer
and when I walked in here I was not
expecting to see all of these
water-cooled systems that's because
they've got their new luxe line which is
really a premium line designed to just
give you beep well like skunkworks level
system builds at a prebuilt
level and you can actually customize
that and outfit it when you order the
system but you can order it with these
custom loops that are pre-built it's
really a no-holds-barred situation here
when it comes to building custom systems
so if you want this level of hardware
which really was very niche and hard to
find and you couldn't get someone to
build it and you have to do some sort of
a private commissioning of a private
builder and not deal with getting high
level warranties and support you can get
that now this right here is their
creator series and why would we call it
a creator series so this is a dual
system system if that makes sense we've
got an ITX system in here designed for
content creators I want to do live
streaming YouTube live streaming twitch
streaming whatever it is as well as
fully ATX supported motherboards in here
for two completely independent systems
in one case now that's not entirely a
new concept but it's also been something
that typically you had to build yourself
if you wanted it but CyberPower has
built this system here as part of their
creator series that's really being
tailored towards a like one click
purchase solution to get you up and
running and doing all of your favorite
streaming gaming youtubing whatever it
may be but this also is their hyper
liquid it's kind of two different series
put together because you can see it's
got the pastel style fluid here it's all
water-cooled so as you can see you can
outfit this in a ton of different ways
to meet whatever your needs are water
cooled you know all glass side panel
look at this this is actually a glass
door we've seen tempered glass being
used it's not tempered glass door
it looks fantastic we've got a 480 60
mil up top we've got a 360 30 mil in the
front and I'm sure we can even fit more
water cooling in the bottom if we want
it so it really is just and this is
whatever you want to do sky's the limit
it'll fit in here now something else you
guys have been bugging the
crap out of me to take a look at is
AMD's new rise in stuff well guess what
we've got a fully built rise in system
right here we need to turn this on and
take a look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
