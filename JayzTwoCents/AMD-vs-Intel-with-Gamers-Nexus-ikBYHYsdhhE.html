a guest in studio today none other than
Steve from gaber's Nexus Stephen Burke I
really just brought him here to kind of
let him see where we beat his scores by
a lot yeah it's uh it's interesting
though because I was looking around and
there's some things in here that I'm not
sure are legal so I'm gonna need you to
delete those scores today's video is
brought to you by cable odd and the
cable odd configurator if you want
custom cables for your computer if you
want them custom-made with your colors
and your choices and your configs you
can do that on the cable mod
configurator that support all major
brands of PSU is both modular and semi
modular and you can have cable
extensions made but the best part is
previously they offered aluminum cable
combs and only black and white but now
you can get them in various color so if
you want to take your system to the next
step and really make it pop get some
custom cables and make them your way put
the cable mod configurator you can start
playing around with that by using the
link in the description below alright so
as you guys know we're getting ready to
be doing some stuff with the EB GS 20th
anniversary with some overclocking Ellen
2 and obviously when Steve is close by
why not do some sort of a discussion
piece because this isn't this is such a
busy time of the year yes more so than I
think we've talked about this and
publicly and offline that this is
probably the busiest it's ever been and
the duration I've been doing YouTube and
so what's happening here is we've got a
lot of compelling SKUs on both side of
the fence so my idea here was that we do
a discussion piece about the offering of
AMD and Intel and why someone might want
one versus the other and why and I say
one about the brand cuz we're talking
about Andy versus Intel and then
drilling down through those fuse yeah
there's a lot of them right here which
is leading to a lot of I think buyer
confusion because I always preach like
look we can't tell you what's coming but
we can tell you things are coming and
you should wait yeah and and then and
then they wait and then suddenly it's
like wow I've got like 10 choices you
know yeah so first things first would
you agree with the statement that AMD
has certainly come a long way
right the IPC's have improved
obviously the core count has improved
the clocks not so much I've improved a
couple hundred megahertz from first
gender rise in a lot of that it's
falling into precision boost to
territory where it's it's kind of like
GPU boost territory where it's pushing
the maximum out of box clock as high as
as reasonable so this is all over the
head room but at the same time that's
doing it already yeah like that's fine
we're doing it for you but but what
couldn't you also say that the 9900 K is
not really much of an exception either
though because it's you turn on all core
like a CPU enhancement right multi more
yeah it's gonna get pretty close to five
gigs on its own anyway not many CPUs can
go higher than 505 one I mean we kind of
hit our first you know ceiling right
around five - without going much colder
temperatures right so even then you're
only getting about an extra 100 or 200
megahertz but that's a gigahertz faster
than what AMD is currently offering
right so there lies that kind of like
the underlying I think that's a great
topic for buyer confusion because
there's a few things here that I can
immediately think of that I've wanted to
address on our channel as well which is
first of all bigger like bigger number
isn't always better so on Intel side
bigger frequency isn't necessarily
better and on AMD side bigger core count
isn't necessarily better right there are
cases where they're both better but and
that presents itself in all of our
benchmarks right right a bench versus
you know one versus the other but then
there's gaming versus one of the other
and creamier versus yeah
like when we were doing the rise in 3900
X overclocking the other day there
accounts like the yellow - overclocking
yeah it's so like oh you're going for 5
gigahertz on a 3900 X I can do that on
walls yeah air with an okay which is
like okay cool but they're way different
though they're not there are nowhere
near the same architecture obviously I
mean and core counts different - yeah
but but what you have here is because
two companies have taken very different
approaches to have a CPU architecture
works you have a singular game developer
or whatever we're talking about you know
Square Enix or whoever they've got to
sort of make the game work on both and
it's never gonna be perfect on both when
it is someone's always gonna suffer and
I feel like AMD's
the one that sort of suffering because
there's different schedulers and because
there's different subroutines and all
that based on well a lot of it is the
best demonstration of does it like
frequency or threads more you take a
ninety seven hundred okay and a ninety
nine hundred K sent them to the same
frequency and then if there's no GP
bottleneck
are they equal right and if they're
equal then the threads on the 99 higher
K aren't really helping it right so yeah
I guess the to kind of start answering
the question of I'm building a new PC
what should I buy and your Intel
whatever use case yeah so the first
thing to do is figure out what are you
doing and be realistic about it right so
are you only gaming are you only doing
like real work I find that a lot of only
gamers shop at a five hundred dollar CPU
price point though like a nine hundred K
or 30 1913 a hundred x I don't know
anymore I I don't think a lot - yeah
it's kind of like why the 2500 K was
king right four cores no hyper-threading
great core frequency the same thing with
like the i-5 it 6700 K and all those
it's like everyone I guess it was 66 on
R K because I forget now we're at I 9
now yeah but yeah it was one of those
like the non hyper threading part was
always kind of like the superior part
for gaming but what I started to find
that this value proposition was right
right the performance per dollar was
there yeah but what's happening now is I
feel like cork out now is growing at
such an exponential rate the developers
are not able to leverage the power on
either side 9 a header K or even or even
the 3900
I think you start if you start looking
at it as so ultimately you're bound by
how much work can your single fastest
thread do for a lot of these games it's
I'm dolls law and if you start looking
at something like what's your most
populated thread in a game it's probably
gonna be the render thread so ultimately
in gaming for today you are going to be
limited by the single fastest thread
example in a lot of scenarios we saw in
Far Cry 5 moved during our overclock
testing you know post closure I mean
that is an AMD title and stuff but we
saw that you know quite a few threads
were just sitting on 0 quite cousin
we're just sitting at 0 doing nothing
and then Becky said that that render
thread
didn't move much and it was usually peg
to the upper 80s or higher yeah exactly
and then you might have something blip
every now and then maybe there's some AI
that got processed right or whatever
that doesn't necessarily mean that you
know and these caught up enough now in
in this type of workload where NR 5 3600
is kind of in my opinion in a position
where Intel's previous i5s were like
that 6600 okay or are like the one of
the 4000 series was the Cooper area that
and I think it's it's to a place where
when we used to say an i-5 is enough for
gaming now it's an r5 yeah okay man yeah
but they look of what quark county get
with our five versus you know you know
just two years ago 12 threads what used
to be an i-5 class part that would be
like four four core and that wasn't in
just three years ago that was an X
series part from Intel yeah and and yeah
now yeah the 6 and 12 right and now the
the games are actually using more than
four core for thread it's the extent
that you start seeing hits and frame
time performance so you'll get a bit of
a spike every now and then mm-hm if
you're playing with something like an
older i5 so the newer iPods do a bit
better but so I mean if we wanted to get
down as granular as core count right so
I guess if you have a program that
favors core count nothing this is your
primary workflow whether you're building
some sort of a work machine dual purpose
gaming slash work machine you have to
ask yourself what is the primary purpose
of that PC right if gaming a secondary
but you have programs that leverage core
count hmm at overclock then would you
say it's a fair statement that AMD is is
the proposition value the yes the better
value overall yes yeah yeah and I would
also I would break it down to like if
you're looking at building a PC first my
first question is are you using this PC
to make money right like is this for
real work right and if it's for real
work and you're making money on it then
you start looking at more expensive
processors there might actually be a
reason to buy those because if you're
doing something like rendering scenes
everyday and one's 20% faster and it's
bottle back in your workflow not what
you have said is is a serious kuna cost
loss
yeah now you can make more money yeah so
that's a
that's a big question to ask yourself if
the answer is no I'm just an enthusiast
I want a hack around with blender every
now and then I want to play around with
Unreal Engine and kind of learn it and
I'd like to play some games
it doesn't matter quite as much I think
yes I would agree value proposition in
general for a core count especially as
na Indies favor higher core count
doesn't always win everything but it
wins quite a lot of production workloads
some programs like premier that's why I
asked before this if you guys use
premier is we know for a fact that
premier favors core clock and memory
speed memory speed was pretty big for
premier because obviously it dumps
everything to memory right and it goes
off the memory that's why you see memory
slams during the render right right and
so what you tend to find is that
sometimes it may not necessarily be much
faster or any faster at all on Intel but
once you start bumping up the memory
speed you get off that base clock of
2133 or 2656 you start approaching 3,800
4000 then you see there's a gap and that
just comes down to the CPUs limitation
of how fast and how easily can you get
the memory out of the box you know with
the least amount of tuning until it's
nicely that's a good point of how easily
out of the box is a really good point
because the first gen rise and launch
not easy it's not easy no I think if you
could get 3000 or 3233 or you were ahead
yeah I think right now the if we kind of
let's I guess like break down the stack
for people one of them these biggest
competitors is AMD yeah because the
previous gen ships are really which is
why I preached I preached I mean I went
to church in my video telling people
look don't buy anything right now please
for the love of God you know there's
gonna be price slashing it so many
people didn't listen and still won out
and by now you can get what 2600 for
like 120 dollars yeah 2600 is like one
440 and 2600 ax is 160 that's insane
2700 is $200 and if you're a gamer you
get the Xbox pass with it you can play
the Xbox games on PC right so we were we
had a question coming of okay
why should I buy the r5 3600 over the
2700 because they're not to just they're
about the same in price and for the most
part the 3600 it's got a thread deficit
so if you're doing blender and stuff
yeah by the 2700 over
hit 24.0 or something probably one and
let it go the 3600 I would I could still
make an argument for it in gaming only
builds but the 2700 is is such a good
deal right now right for a part that
launched out like 300 plus an eight-core
16 threads I guess it gets the job done
at overclocks well yeah by well I mean
you can still usually get 4 gigs a good
for almost for sure I would say it's had
a lot of maturity in in terms of just
iOS bios support bios maturity software
supports mirror there was the the rest
of the bottle of destiny to not
launching on Zen - yeah and this is this
is the this is the bleeding edge
adoption period of any new piece of
hardware I mean we've seen it until have
some weird anomalies like that - but
it's but it's it's interesting though
because it's becoming harder I think
even as someone that works with this
stuff every day to try and really
pinpoint a use case where you're like oh
yeah you would want Intel for this or
yeah you'd want AMD for this yeah
there's a few places where I can I can
make a really firm recommendation like
that and then a lot of it does get muddy
yeah and the trouble is like I think for
a lot of viewers you start watching and
a reviewer is is like waffling between
the recommendations for our workload I
think as a viewer myself of other types
of content like other reviews for other
industries right you see it I was like
okay he's just trying to make sure he
doesn't piss off he doesn't piss up a
fanboy on one side or the other than a
year or whatever yeah but it's really I
mean it's just it's actually it's
getting difficult to make some
recommendation so where I would pinpoint
a recommendation is like if you say I'm
only running photoshop and photoshop i
make money i would probably based on the
puget test suite I would probably say an
Intel CEO yeah
price for fries but AMD comes ahead
obviously in things that are entirely
thread bound like blender where you have
tile based rendering you do maybe 16 by
16 tiles and it'll spawn as many tiles
as there are threads and just blow
through them a lot of people will
reasonably say well but I can use CUDA
to do rendering and that's completely a
fair statement on the CUDA side of
things pewter is
definitely useful to accelerate
something and something like blender
though or a tile-based renderer if you
have something that's you don't have a
GPU with enough GPU memory in it system
memory is easier to come by right and
especially now where you can get a $500
3900 X you throw some memory at it and
it comes out cheaper than like a Quadro
r-tx 5000-series yeah the significant
amount yeah so it might be slower but if
you run it's a memory capacity issues
that could then that's where the
discussion it's muddy rikes it comes all
the way back around ask you the
opportunity cost this time money for you
and what you're doing yeah and also
where else does that GPU maybe applies
where you can maybe argue purchasing
that at lower end CPU but yeah I think I
would break it down as like let's I
guess let's try and draw some it's hard
to draw these lines let's draw some the
ones that we can
okay so gaming performance let's go with
gaming first it's kind of easy it's
almost always gonna be better on Intel
simply because of the core clocks IPC is
pretty comparable now but yeah the clock
is gives us better average Max and even
like 1% lows but that's not true in all
games either but I think it's personally
my recommendation would be if you're
looking at just building a kick-ass
gaming machine I would be more inclined
to say get a 9700 K overclock that a
little bit there were 16 gigs of ram at
it and take that extra money and get a
better GPU yes you know that's that
would be my type of rake and the 97 hard
K is cheaper than it used it was like
365 I think when we got viewed the
competing name for the 37 was like the
price of the 8700 K when it came out so
you can see how everything's lit up with
the i9 but yeah so that goes yeah the
nice innit I I think it for a pure
gaming if you're spending that amount of
money like 300 ish 3 350 I guess let's
call it pure gaming 97 arcade is
probably going it is our recommendation
that's what we end up recommend right
for cheaper budget gaming enough to cut
you off on whatever you do right we are
not saying that an AMD based system at
that same price is not a good gaming
champion should let me go off-topic one
second here
I feel like there's a little bit of if
you feel like there's some hesitation
and making firm recommendations it's
specifically because of the response
that we get when we pick a side right
and it's it's you kind of have to tiptoe
around yeah the the types of comments
and try to preempt the comments by
addressing all the points that we
brought up so AMD is doing really well
the CPUs have really good use cases but
it's not the best at everything all the
time and that's okay
it's it's a lot more overlap than it
ever was in the past it used to be a lot
more cut and dry you need a good value
CPU AMD's where you go you're gonna get
80 ish percent of the Intel part right
at you know 50% of the price now there's
much more overlap in the products act on
both sides which is good for the
consumer because we're going to see
Intel have to respond you did it you did
a great piece about the kamek kamek
kamek Lake yes where we should comma
comically the comment Lake rumors and
just that it's completely false don't
buy into it some CPU will happen and I
will probably have 10 cores right but
the stuff you've seen so far is not real
it's not a leak it's not a slide it is
actually fabricated it is not made by
Intel Corporation so I guess if I'm
drawing lines you could feel free to to
branch off of this but I'm looking at
like 3600 r5 3600 for the $200 price
point and I'm looking at it's insane
what you can get for 200 bucks though
today yeah okay let's say three and a
half years ago before Rison launched
yeah you were still you were still
shopping FX CPUs you know seven years
after they were launched yeah after that
pure gaming I'm looking at 9700 K and
then not pure gaming maybe you do
streaming and gaming like we were saying
I kind of like the 3700 X there and the
3600 you can make it work but you do
have to do more tuning so if you're a
super budget wanna like start up your
streaming channel you don't have much
money you can make the 3600 work with
effort and like a fuss box can help with
that but the 3700 X is where it's easy
out of box yeah so 97 our gate 37 our X
have you unique use cases and then 9930
900 X is where it's it's a very it
dependent scenario but if there's
anything I think the takeaway from this
is the fact that you have compelling
choices on both sides of the fence which
was not the case
than just a few years ago yeah before
eyes and it really I mean in tall yeah
in tall was it right and and there was
no and there was no there was no
compelling reason to go with a dead
platform like FX which was still being
sold actively yeah and then if you
consider the proposition value of buying
an X for seventy board with the new the
new CPUs and just saying I don't need
PCI you for at all
there's too many scenarios there's too
many options here that that did to
dictate what the better part is you know
I really feel bad for though you know
thread ripper adopters oh driver / yeah
because I mean look how much faster a
3900 X is versus 1928 yeah we had
someone in our stream the other day who
was sad because the 3900 X when it was
stock was outperforming his thread upper
part yeah my goal with this video was
and all my videos cover these topics
always is to be able to try and give you
some sort of a hard recommendation of
like it's this than a if it's less than
B and the problem is you can't you can't
do that not not completely down up and
down a stack there yeah so like I think
the biggest thing to take away like
we've given some hard recommendations on
a few of the parts and and then like you
get to top 500 dollar price point area
and it becomes it depends and for that I
think just like separate yourself from
the noise from the noise from the
comments or from from the marketing and
really sit down and honestly ask
yourself what am I doing with this
computer right and then look at the
benchmarks and if you're like you know
I'm like gaming just skip that section
don't you look at it yeah and just look
at the stuff that matter the
productivity stuff yeah well I
appreciate you coming on the channel
today to try and hopefully answer some
questions hopefully I feel like we might
have introduced some more questions
maybe and maybe a little bit more
confusion but I mean I this is gonna
take time member right now we're still
in the period of which AMD through this
all up into the air and it has a quite
landed yet right there's still more
products coming there's still more
maturity we need with the BIOS we might
see some significant improvements across
the board with BIOS I don't know yet
it seems like there's some there's some
pretty hard limitations in in the CPU so
yeah and I would yeah and also you're
gonna see a lot of comments online as as
people figure out how the new platform
behaves the only ways to like get a
couple percent more performance out of
it we have one where we
we've been down the temperatures by a
reasonable amount and you can get more
performance out of it like 4% but also
at the same time don't get too caught up
in that and don't gamble a purchase on
the expectation of improvements right
this is just like focus on what you need
and buy it
and then don't feel any buyer's remorse
because it doesn't matter yeah the other
day if you're happy with the part who
cares that's really all there Steve now
holds the record I might I'm I might end
up with a cracked skull of you throw
that alright guys thanks for watching
Steve thanks romanika support absolutely
um I don't know exactly what we're doing
tomorrow we're on the same team are
against each other but either way gloves
are coming off your house same to you
