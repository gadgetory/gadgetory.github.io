half ago I was doing a video about how
the FX series processor although old was
a much better bargain than the Intel i3
73 50k overclocking dual-core chip well
if you also recall in that video I
killed it because I was overclocking it
and it died so I'm gonna go ahead and
visit that today and I figure out why it
died and hopefully fix it because in
this series of this this era now where
we're trying to do a lot more budget
oriented stuff FX is still very relevant
to the budget builder and I want a
working FX rig so we got to figure this
out the all new master liquid 120 and
240 l RGB coolers provide an easy and
reliable way to keep your processor nice
and cool they're all new dual chamber
pump and low resistance radiator offer a
higher transfer of heat for both Intel
and AMD CPUs while six preset lighting
effects in RGB ensure that the 120 and
240 L seamlessly match your color design
choice make it yours by following the
link in the description below so I'm
going to recommend you guys go and watch
that video before moving forward and
I'll have a card that pops out right
here but in a nutshell while I was doing
my overclocking and stuff and doing my
benchmark runs my Cinebench runs
comparing it to the i3 on a restart it
died like it just died in between one
reboot and to kind of show you what's
happening here will show you right now
make sure you get in tight on this NIC
you might not even get to see it it
happens so quickly when I push the power
button it just instantly trips watch for
in this case it's not even turning on so
this what yeah I know what I'm doing
oh crap it just drops gears now the last
time I tried using this it was at least
clicking on for like a split second but
yeah we're plugged in okay now the
reason why we're doing this is because I
actually have a spare FX CPU and board
now I was pretty convinced I killed the
CPU the audience was pretty convinced
it's a bad motherboard so at least I can
test this this was my dad's old
motherboard and CPU so at least it's
gonna get a little bit more use we're
actually keeping this in a display
because obviously this is a sentimental
piece to me so most people like I said
were telling me the motherboard was bad
so the first thing I'm gonna try is
swapping in this
CPU I don't think that that's gonna fix
it but that's at least where we're gonna
start so I can at least make sure this
power supply is working by using this
jumper that comes with a lot of water
cooling kits and stuff now all this does
as you can see is it jumpers together
two pins if you're using ketchup and
mustard cables it's a greet the green
wire and the black wire all that's doing
is jump ring those which is fooling the
motherboard into thinking you pushed the
power switch because that will at least
then tell me if we have power so when I
turn on the power switch on the mother
on the power supply
interesting so whatever is wrong is
tripping the power supply like
immediately I have a theory now if I
unplug the CPU power cable which my
hands do not fit in here very well so
all I did was unplug the EPS power this
is the the four pin slash eight pin or
the dual four pin this is what gives
your CPU power specifically the only two
colors on here are yellow and black
that's because it's giving 12 volt and
ground and that's it and nothing can't
have been a bad power supply all this
time we are plugged in right just to
make sure we've got good power here I
mean what am I gonna do I have to lose
now right I would love for it to not be
a bad motherboard or CPU obviously I
would hate for it I've been sitting here
idle all this time okay so obviously we
have power if my my power supply went
bad you bet I'm gonna contact EVGA and
be like hey give me a new one because I
bought this guy I bought it with my own
money guy that's such a terrible place
for the8 can't get my hands in there my
big fat pants oh wait
I'm trying plug PCIe into the CPU
that'll go well it's keyed it wouldn't
gone anyway get in your home this is
worse than trying to do it on a tank
Millie start
all right okay we're gonna try and power
it up now ah did you hear it instantly
click yeah they click back off yeah we
know it's not powers back but here's the
thing now if I unplug the e to the e PS
so we have now narrowed it down to
either CPU or the motherboard I
basically was banking on it being CPU
the audience however was like no those
problems that you're exhibiting are more
so in line with a bad motherboard
wouldn't be kind of cool if my dad's
motherboard lived on in our testbench
obviously I don't want to blow it up all
right I mean we already are I say weak I
already blew this one up it's always
that one standoff like unscrews with the
screw you know someday we'll clean up
this wiring issue huh like well actually
come up with a decent power distribution
distribution system not today so if we
end up getting the same result we'll
watch the month this fan will tell us
what's happening this fan starts to turn
and then stops and instantly we'll know
it there you go so you can actually hear
the the power breaker or the safety
system inside the power supply keeping
us from killing our stuff now we're
gonna go ahead and remove the cooler and
we are going to put in a new CPU in this
motherboard know we can take bets now
Nick do you think it's the CPU or you
think it's the motherboard I'm kind of
leaning that way too so if anything died
on this motherboard it's potentially VRM
maybe we'll do a Fidesz turn out to be a
bad motherboard will take off will take
off the heatsink and will inspect it and
we might see a fried component but
initially I don't see any chokes or
capacitors that are swollen or leaking
and as are we good to see if we if we
won or lost in terms of our bet because
we bet the same noise on same thing okay
so it looks like the internet was
probably right how about that I hate
when the Internet's right yeah hey I'm
on the Internet does that make me right
yeah all right so let's just swap
everything over to this board has rock
killer board fatality so this was my
dad's CPU so we're gonna go back with
this one this was the original CPU we
did our overclocked testing with it'll
be nice to have the FX system up and
running again though because I want to
do all kinds of
like bottleneck testing and content that
like applies to more people turn right
back off mmm did we kill both let's try
this again
man that would be if I killed CPU and
motherboard at all in one but it's
staying on for a little bit longer isn't
it hmm well that thing's being stubborn
you know what though it makes sense that
if we killed a vrm we could have
potentially also killed the CPU so I'm
just gonna swap my dad's back in there
so now we've got my dad's CPU my dad's
motherboard so it should work if it
doesn't Wow
so we killed not only the motherboard
with CPU - I can't really last time I
killed two components at will in one so
we were both right Internet I did kill
the CPU the motherboard was what killed
it - you guys were technically right
first so ruined you we're just gonna
we're gonna kind of cut this video real
quick and then we are gonna come back
with the rig reassembled in however I
decided to assemble it so we'll see you
guys in a minute all right so this is
the fractal design mesh if I see this is
the rig I put together for the FX build
this is a 10 60 just chilling in there
temporarily and as you can see we're in
the BIOS unfortunately what you guys
didn't see was I couldn't get it to boot
with my dad's CPU in there which I know
for a fact worked prior to doing this
video because we used it many times so I
think by putting this CPU in the other
motherboard killed it it has now gone to
the CPU heaven in this guy
so yeah I'm bummed about that his
motherboard still works at least I have
that what's in here right now in case
you're wondering is an FX 6100 which I
had laying around and haven't used in
years just to verify that it was a dead
CPU and so yeah in in the process of all
of this I've killed one motherboard and
two CPUs it powered on it's just the CPU
gave us no video it's now I've got to
get a new CPU for this we were running
in 8320 now I gotta get an 83 50 maybe
like at 80
seventy or something like that but we
got one more thing to do before we get
out of here I'm gonna shut this down
these fans are running full speed we've
got to take the heatsink off of the
other motherboard to see if we can see a
damaged component at least get something
educational out of this guess in
hindsight the way I should have tested
was by putting the bad CPU and the good
motherboard but how else would we have
known if this was a bad motherboard well
I guess if it working the other mother
was right anyway there's that let's take
these off on the surface it does not
look like anything popped in terms of
the vrm or the delivery we got a little
bit of thermal paste or a thermal tape
compound thermal pad and it's stuck to
it I don't see any bad components in
here you know everything looks fine
that's the crazy part so yeah now I got
to get a new CPU at least we'll have a
working FX rig once again so guys give
this video like if you feel any pity
towards me right now or give it a like
if you don't or whatever you know I
already care to be honest I'm I'm mad
I'm mad at this this thing all right I'm
gonna go guys thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next one
you
