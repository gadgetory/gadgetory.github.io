milk it happens between asleep you

hell up you see this nametag grandma

more desirable well you're in luck
because right now you can own your very
own J's two cents swag and immediately
be the cool kid on the block max out
your sex appeal by following the leap
down below with invidious new Archie X
series launching there's obviously been
a lot of controversy around that and
many people rightfully so believe that
the 10 series is perfectly fine no
reason to replace it to which I would
agree the ten series pasco cards are
extremely powerful which is why I
decided I want to give one away I was
gonna take a 10 atti throw it on the
table and be like hey you can win this
imagine there's Werner here you know we
don't have to imagine it I can actually
grab one here we go we'll grab this one
randomly chosen MSI gaming X I could
have been like you know what this is the
card you're gonna win
that's me telling you what you want
maybe you don't want this card I'm not
Apple I can't tell you what you want I
mean I can but I'd be wrong just like
Apple but but I digress that's besides
the point what I decided I'm going to do
is the winner who claims their prize
within the 48 hour window you have to
respond to my email can pick any
graphics card they want from the studio
that's not currently being utilized in a
build we will give you the winner a list
of graphics cards that are in here so if
you're an AMD fanboy and you're like hey
I want a Vega card guess what we've got
a Vega 64 right there we have also got
the where they call it frontier Edition
technically that's not no that's
frontier it's not blue it's just a
reference card but there's another
another of mega64
if that if that stick with me feel we're
doing an infomercial here if that's what
you want then you tell me that it's what
you want so you get to choose your prize
from our huge pool of graphics cards and
yes
we do still have one tight necks in one
of those boxes the thing is you got to
choose the box and you may get just the
box you may get it no we won't do it so
we will send the winner a list of
graphics cards that you can choose from
and you get to choose now the rules are
the same as any giveaway we've ever done
you must be subscribed on YouTube why
would I want to give you a graphics card
if you're just gonna take it and peace
out right I mean what good does that do
me that this is this is a two-way
relationship here it's give and take
actually I guess technically it's a
giveaway and a takeaway but whatever I
digress that's besides the point you
have 48 hours to respond to the email I
am going to be sending you from my
account and if you respond you get the
list of graphics cards and you get to
choose it is available anywhere in the
world where giveaways are not prohibited

involved with receiving this in Europe

costs associated you guys can find a
