the past year to get my hands on a lot
of different graphics cards for review
and it's usually quite easy and pretty
straightforward I mean you talk about
the specs you get touchy feely with it
of course you talk about its appearance
does it have a backplate BBG am looking
at you
finally you follow it all off with some
benchmark numbers and there you go a
pretty standard and straightforward
video card review but when the gigabyte
water force arrived in an actual
suitcase I was like what did I get
myself into
with the new Silencio performance
optimized fans the coolermaster neptune
240 m delivers the perfect balance of
noise and performance click the link in
the description to find out more I'll be
honest I really didn't know where to
start
in fact that when I was approached by
gigabyte I didn't even realize that this
thing was real I mean I've heard that
you know there were rumors about it and
now there's some photos I really didn't
know anything about it at all now the
packaging really does look like it came
straight from the luggage store because
that's what it is a piece of freaking
luggage but the guts are nice and padded
with soft foam enough soft foam to
actually make lioness blush and it's
going to keep things nice and secure
during shipping so I wouldn't be too
concerned about damage from the good old
folks over at UPS and FedEx the
components inside are also being nicely
secured with some nylon straps so things
are going to be bouncing around nearing
shipping so I feel they're pretty well
protected so that's good the only
downside is that mine came with a lot of
scratching on the case but that's
probably due to the fact that this is a
review unit and it's not actually a
retail sample at least I think now
installing this thing will take some
preparation so I highly highly recommend
reading the instructions maybe even a
few times prior to trying to install
this behemoth now I'm not going to spend
any time on how to install this thing
because gigabyte has already prepared an
installation video which you guys can
take a look at for more information but
one thing worth noting is that there is
a specific order to how this thing is
installed so if you're like me and you
like to toss away
the instructions you might want to go
and get those things out of the trash
I'm just saying now looking at the
graphics cards yeah I said cards there
are three gtx 980 s in this kit i was a
little surprised by the lack of back
plates now this is a bit disappointing
especially since earlier in the year I
gave gigabyte high praise for including
back plates on all of their GTX 970 980
wind force cards so I don't understand
why the sudden removal of the back plate
and to me it just seems like a step in
the wrong direction a little bit more
like towards EVGA I thought it might
have been due to the card clearance but
there's plenty of room for back plates
so I don't know when it comes to cooling
these bad boys each card has its own
pre-installed water block which also has
houses the water pump and ample length
of quarter inch flex tube or fep tubing
along with each card having their very
own dedicated 120 millimeter radiator it
really does seem like the AMD 295x2 is
inspired a little bit of this kit the
included 3-way SLI bridge looks pretty
nice with its all-black frame and blue
gigabyte logo but keep in mind that some
motherboards do not have standard PCI
spacing as this bridge does so if you
have a motherboard that actually pushes
the third card down an extra slot this
bridge is actually not going to be
working for you so you're going to be
forced to use the one that actually came
with your motherboard so you definitely
want to keep that in mind now the
radiator box is clearly the centerpiece
for this kit and it simply mounts on top
of your existing case with some
spring-loaded finger things keeping it
in place it's actually a lot like the
coolant CPU kit now it also features a
swing-away store for easy radiator fan
access and it also features soft rubber
feet to keep them from damaging your
desk or your PC you could technically
leave this separate on your desk if you
want it or maybe if you had a case it
didn't support top rounded or mounted
box thing like this or if you're using
an open-air test bench now it does
feature an all-metal design so there
won't be any risk of damaging the
components inside but one thing you must
keep in mind is that it does add a bit
of top heaviness to the case so once
it's mounted you want to be very careful
of moving it around so you don't tip the
damn thing over because that would make
for a very bad day now the radiators
simply snap in
place without the need for tools but
like I've said a few times now there are
specific spots where each radiator must
be installed so please set aside your
pride and consult the manual I promised
guys it'll only sting for a little while
and it's not like I'm asking you guys to
go ask for directions right right the
front of the red box also has an
integrated fan and pump controller where
you can monitor things like GPU
temperature or control the fans or a
target temp or even the pump speed and
it all communicates through a USB header
on the motherboard for this function to
work you have to make sure you have at
least one USB header available in your
system but not only does this serve as
kind of a control center but it also has
a door that swings open to allow easy
access to the stuff inside now remember
you still have to route the tubes and
cables into the case somehow and that is
actually managed through a five and a
quarter expansion bay in this little
like slide in thingy the last thing
worth mentioning before we install this
beast is the GPU support bar which is
included and offers an extra support to
keep the cards from sagging I don't know
if this is something I would actually
use because the cards really aren't that
heavy but I kind of feel like it looks a
little tacky and I mean being brutally
honest it looks terrible and if but if
you're a function over form kind of
person then you could install this on
your GPUs to support some extra weight
and give yourself a little extra peace
of mind knowing you're not going to
damage your motherboard PCI Express
slots now do have plenty to say about
this kit regarding its looks and whatnot
but I'll save that for the conclusion of
this review so really the only logical
thing left to do right now is to get
this bad boy installed and load up those
benchmarks transition time transition
now installing the water force really
isn't all that hard and it was pretty
straightforward and as long as you
actually follow the instructions and
install things in the right order you're
likely not going to have a hard time
putting it together at least
theoretically something's kind of a
really picky now for this build
I used my fractal design arc XL and I
decided to use this case instead of my
case labs test bench because I wanted to
use something that would more closely
resemble what the average consumer would
be using most people are not using case
labs test benches but one of the reasons
I use the arc XL is because of its sheer
size which I thought what's going to
make the extra long tubing seam well not
so long but I massively underestimated
the length of this tube I mean I get
that they're trying to make this thing
seem more compatible with many more
cases on the market but the length of
the tubing was just plain ridiculous and
for a while there it looked less like a
PC and more like a sentinel from the
matrix
in fact on Instagram some people said it
looked like the Borg anyway the only
thing I could really do to make the to
be more manageable was to basically just
tuck it away back here where the hard
drives would normally go and I wasn't
able to achieve anything even remotely
close to what they show in the manual
which has these really nice crisp
90-degree bends which make everything
look super tidy in fact I was left
easily with an extra foot at least a
foot in half of cable the tube to figure
out what to do with so GG the one thing
I initially thought was going to be a
nice bonus touch to this kit where these
kind of like comb things that clip over
the FTP tubes which is theoretically
supposed to help them stay nice and
orderly but after trying to bend those
excess tubes out of the way I quickly
learned that any time any sort of force
is actually placed against those clips
they just popped off and went flying all
around the case so really they turned
out to be useless and I just stopped
trying to even use them all together so
after finally getting everything
installed I managed to
halfway organized the tubes I'm going to
keep harping on these tubes because they
are ridiculously too long but I decide
to get that fancy GPU Jack thing a test
run and I quickly realized that with my
all-in-one cooler up top I was not able
to move the post closer to the middle of
the back of the cards as it recommends
in the manual
so I said had to install it more time
decide at kind of a 45 degree angle
which puts the weight at the end of
those little finger things that's
holding it up and then turn those are
now sagging because of the weight
leverage being at the end of these
plastic fingers now wouldn't have really
been an issue if they had been made of
metal so I'm not going to really bother
using that thing at all I mean not to
mention once the hydraulic post is fully
extended it doesn't really put a lot of
pressure on the top or the bottom of the
case and I can simply move it around
with very little force now perhaps
that's due to the fact that the arc XL
is really tall but once again the length
of the tubing tells me that they
anticipated the cases being used for
this kit we're going to be huge
so really it's too small for a big case
now get gigabyte an A for effort that's
about it now the radiator box also
features a digital fan controller for
managing fan speeds and even target
temperatures which you can set to let
the controller do what it needs to do to
reach those target temperatures it
automatically speed up and slow down the
fans based on the settings now there's
also a manual mode where you can
manually set the pumps and fan speeds
and speaking of fan speeds these will
actually go all the way up to 30 250 rpm
what's funny about that is the actual
max fan speed setting on the controller
is 3000 so I guess we're getting a
little bit extra for the money when it
comes to the fan controller now
unfortunately the fan controller does
look a little bit antiquated with a very
basic LCD screen and lack of touch
display given the price of this units I
would have hoped for something a little
bit more elegant when it comes to user
interface lastly the rad box fan
controller will not work unless the USB
header is plugged into the motherboard
now I get why I can't control the pumps
when it's not plugged in because the
pumps are actually getting their power
from the GPU fan header but I actually
plugged into the controller but why can
I not control the fans without the USB
plugged in
the fans are actually plugged into the
controller itself which has its own
power so this makes no sense to me in
fact if you don't have the fan
controller plugged into the USB slot on
the motherboard you're given nothing
more than a flashing prompt telling you
to plug it into the motherboard and all
the controls are locked until you do
that the plug in the header wasn't
enough then still wants you to install
OC guru - which for me was a complete
deal-breaker because I'm sorry to say it
is a terrible piece of software
I really prefer MSI Afterburner and
without that installed the fans will run
in about 2,000 rpm which are quite noisy
doing that right now you might actually
hear them so to quiet down the fans you
have to install OC guru - and that's
just terrible strong-arming people into
that software now one last thing worth
mentioning about the radiator boxes if
your case has its power and reset us in
USB ports on the top like the archaic
cell does and keep in mind that the
tubes and power cables routed through
the case in that five and a quarter
drive bay are going to likely cover up
those buttons and you know making
turning on the PC a bit of a hassle as
it has to because you have to force your
finger in there between the tubes to
turn on the PC yeah guys I know there's
a joke in there trust me I'm trying to
keep at least one video clean okay can
we just have one clean video alright
I've gone on long enough about some of
the things that I don't actually like
about the looks of this thing but this
is still a graphics card review so let's
go ahead and jump into those benchmarks
now I know most people are not using x99
based systems especially for gaming so I
decided to build out my 4790k for this
one there's a lot closer to what people
would be using in the real world than my
5820k overclocking of these cards was
really straightforward it was really
easy it's just like overclocking any
other graphics card on the market and it
actually features a twelve hundred
twenty eight megahertz base clock with a
1329 boost clock in fact that seems
extremely conservative and safe
considering one of the direct benefits
of water cooling a graphics card is
their ability to overclock them
balls-to-the-wall but not only that this
is gigabytes custom PCB design so I
figure why when they at least give this
thing a little extra oomph out of the
box setting it apart from the crowd
anyway after overclocking them I managed
to a respectable fifteen hundred and
thirty megahertz it's not exactly packed
meeting when it comes to overclocking
but still a two hundred megahertz bump
over the boost clock is really not that
bad at all now gigabyte recommends a
1200 watt power supply unit for this
thing but I managed to get by with even
my Rosewill 1000 watt tachyon platinum
power supply unit now given the
efficiency of the GPUs I really wasn't
too worried about not having enough
power but you have to make sure you have
at least six eight pin PCI Express power
connectors available though because the
custom PCB has dual eight pin power
connectors on the board now I happen to
actually not have dedicated 8 pin cables
I had the pigtail with two sets of
cables on there but it still didn't seem
to affect anything did have any
perceivable overclocking stability
issues and so far nothing's caught on
fire
yet now if you notice in the benchmark
slides I actually tested the
temperatures of the GPUs at 500 rpm
speed intervals on the fan controller I
was actually surprised at how well the
single thin 120 millimeter radiator was
cooling not only the GPU but also the
RAM and the vrm on these blocks because
they do have a heat pipe that goes from
the vrm to the block as well
now gigabyte advertises that this thing
is thirteen point one decibels quieter
than reference 3-way 980 s and forty
percent lower on thermals now I have no
way to actually measure the decibels but
I will say that the cooling performance
is actually very very good in fact with
the fans running at only a thousand rpm
which was actually quieter than the case
fans in this archaic cell the cards
never exceeded 50 degrees Celsius even
when playing battlefield 4 at 4k for
over a half hour that's actually quite
impressive now if you bump the speeds up
to a more reasonable 1,500 rpm then the
temps drop down into the 40s
and the noise is still not at issue in
fact that's how skunk works is in the
40s okay its conclusion time and I have
to say that I have spent a lot of time
pondering how to end this one and so far
it sounds an awful lot like I'm
nitpicking this thing to death allow me
to explain why sync costs $3,000
basically I reviewed this unit as I
would expect anyone to as if they had
spent $3,000 on this thing and how would
you feel about it now even though the
performance is really really good and
it's on par with standalone 3-way SLI
980 s I just don't really know how much
sense it makes I mean yeah it performs
really well but not better than other
3-way setups but I still can't get past
the overall ugly appearance of this
thing now I have to assume that gigabyte
has done market research on this and I
should assume that that research told
them that someone was interested in
buying this thing I'm still just not
sure who that is now I've tried to look
at this objectively by putting myself in
the shoes and position of someone who
may not be comfortable with buying their
own graphics cards tearing them apart
and water cooling their GPUs themselves
and building a custom water cooling loop
but believe it or not the 3-way 980 set
up in skunk works it's featuring custom
loop with three eky
Bloks EK back plate cylinder res custom
bit acrylic tube the cost of rigid tube
fittings custom sleeve power cables
adjustable speed defy pump with high
flow top nano fluid and still came in at
$400 less than this thing costs and
compared to the aesthetics the custom
loop looks fantastic and you can't say
that you can't water cool wind force
cards because EK now makes 970 and 980
wind force blocks now the other thing
I'm curious about is why they chose a
3-way config to be honest the 3-way
config is kind of like the black sheep
of the SLI family and most gamers only
have one card but the next common thing
being two cards very few gamers have
three cards know very very if you have
four cards and with poor SLI scaling
bumping up the cost of this unit to put
a third card in really seems like a
mistake now this should have been a
2-way set up in my opinion if you do
happen to fit that demographic of gamer
looking for prefilled pre-built 3-way
980 setup with a fear of water cooling
your own computer and a extra $3,000
burning a hole in your pocket then
perhaps this unit is for you now to be
unfair for me to say that just because
I'm not sold on it doesn't mean someone
wouldn't be and this isn't really off
the top of my head type of assumption
either if you go and look online at some
of the postings about this unit you'll
find that there seems to be a very
resounding why does this exist from
people who are actually looking at this
thing but I do think gigabyte is
actually onto something here because I
think they just missed the mark what
they should have done was simply offer a
single 980 120 millimeter radiator with
much much shorter tubing and let the
buyer mount it in a standard 120
millimeter fan slot in their case just
like the 295x2 and look how successful
that card is but I think if gigabyte
relaunched the water force as a single
card solution the buzz about it would
have been much more positive alright
guys that has been Jays 2 cents on the
water force 3 away 980 setup from
gigabyte what are your thoughts on this
would you actually buy this now I've
told you before that you as viewers
should take what we as reviewers say as
opinion and formulate your own opinion
based on the information we're
presenting you I'm really curious as to
how you guys feel about this unit so
sound off in the comments I'm pretty
sure gigabyte is going to be looking
everybody head on over to Twitter or
Facebook and tell me directly how you
guys feel about it there you can
actually find little pop-up here to tell
you where you go alright guys that's it
for today happy holidays and as always I
hope to see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
