you with the review of the munitia
billets nine millimeter headphones and
we're gonna find out whether or not
these deserve a spot in your ears so
stay tuned initio is a fairly new
company it's about three years old on
the market I had the opportunity of
meeting one of the employees at me
initio that was at the youch 24-hour
black ops 2 livestream I got a chance to
get hands-on with a few of these and I
went ahead and decided to do a review of
the billets because these are a very
mid-range headphone they compete with a
lot of the other companies out there
like beats by dre Skullcandy sony and
we're going to determine whether or not
these live up to the standard of
earphones in this competitive music and
gaming industry so we're gonna go ahead
and do an unboxing here I have taken off
the plastics leaving I've not broken the
seal yet on this so we're gonna get some
impressions together here on what the
packaging and presentation is like and
right off the bat I can tell you the
presentation is nice it's a nice
cardboard box here it's got this red you
know fabric here to use as a pullout and
look at that I don't know if there's any
other company in the market right now
that at least right off the bat gives
you a presentation like this you've got
one two three four five six different
inserts for the ear portion that goes
into your ear so if you've got small
ears big ears medium ears no ears you
can customize this to fits your
particular style and what's cool about
this is not only do you have you know
different styles here we have different
colors you've got black you've got red
you've got you know the mediums got it
looks like a singular color there
perhaps these are medium on here I
haven't checked it but you've also got
large you know this is really neat let's
go ahead and
pop this up here and see what's
underneath nice heavy gauge wire here
the construction of these are very very
impressive they're machine out of billet
aluminum hence the name billets but they
call these the 9 millimeter because they
are shaped like a 9-millimeter casing
here and the inserts or the rubber parts
that go on here that go into your ear
they call their hollow-point and it's
pretty neat because they've got some you
know color combination going on here
you've got this kind of a gray this this
particular one that I'm reviewing here
they call battle grey and it's got a red
let's see if we can pick that up and
inside the back here what would be the
primer of a bullet they've got some red
paint in there that gives a very nice
contrast but this aluminum color is very
neat let's go ahead and pop off one of
the hollow points here and see what the
headphone looks like so you've got a
nice mesh a very fine mesh filter over
the driver itself so this is going to
keep you know dirt and debris from
getting inside there which is gonna ruin
your headphones and this is a very very
high quality construction I'm very
impressed at least with the way these
feel inside the box here you've also got
a nice looks it's a hard pouch carrying
case it's got plenty of space here for
oh look at that forgot to mention they
also come with ear hooks so if you're
running on a treadmill you're jogging
and you're like me and no ear but on the
planet wants to stay in your ear you
simply take out the ear hook you snap it
on the butt end of the headphone here
and now you've got over the ear ear
hooks this is awesome because my ears
headphones don't want to stay inside my
ears and you know I work out on a
regular basis and I've tried so many
different brands and they're constantly
falling out of my ear so you can throw
these on when you need them and you know
take them off when you simply just want
to stick this in your ear listen to some
music that is a very neat feature I like
that a lot
inside the box here you've got a
you know ammunitiion technically a
business card here this is pretty neat
nice imprinted logo there for the
company
munitia Oh calm and then you've got your
manual and warranty here speaking of
warranty on the back of the box here
you've got some product information
we've got a 2-year limited warranty from
the manufacturer got six sets of the
silicon hollow points you got three in
black three in red and smoke frequency
range of the headphones you've got a
twenty Hertz to 20,000 Hertz frequency
response range that's a lot of base for
a an earbud and I've got to tell you
they sound very crisp and clear I was
using these to do some editing at the
yash livestream event because I forgot
my headphones so I had to borrow some
and guess what it was a me initio set
that I got to borrow and I was
immediately impressed the microphone on
this thing is a 50 Hertz to a 1600 Hertz
and the total weight is 22 grams what's
cool about the fact that they're metal
construction is they're solid and sturdy
but that 22 gram weight these don't feel
like they're gonna fall out of your ear
they're not you know they're not
extremely heavy the wire is very nice
and heavy yet it's very flexible so it
doesn't tangle up very easily on the
wire here let's go ahead and undo this
so right here coming out of your right
ear you've got you know you've got your
your mute switch and it does work on an
iPhone I went ahead and tested that
because as you know some of these
controls do not work on Apple product
you got the microphone right here on the
back side and farther down the wire here
you've got a nice metal Y splitter where
the you know right and left split off so
this isn't gonna tear or split on you
it's nice and sturdy and this is made
out of aluminum also one last thing I
want to point out here the actual jack
itself as you can see the
three-and-a-half millimeter is very thin
at the base so if you've got a case on
your iPhone like I do here on my iPhone
you can see where a lot of complaints
people have when it comes to the the
cases is the hole around the microphone
jack is too small so most microphones
don't fit in and if you look right here
this fits
no problem whatsoever it doesn't even
touch the case it fits perfectly in
there so I'm gonna go ahead and pull out
the earbuds I'm currently using right
now and these are Skullcandy 50 50 s
these are about a $50 headphone this is
plastic the drivers look very similar
when you take off the earbud piece but
look at how thin look how thin these
wires are and they're very flimsy
I did forget to point out is this is
simply a mute switch there is no volume
up or down on this control on the
minutiae OHS but look how easily this
tangles I did not tangle this up for the
point of this video I have these wrapped
up in a circle to fit inside these
Skullcandy case and this is the way it
came out and then it's a nightmare to
untangle it and then you can see right
here where the Y splitter is this is
rubber and this is my second set of
skull candies and I've had this wear out
before because if you're jogging or
running on a treadmill you know you tend
to get a little tend to get a little
overzealous you catch that with your arm
and you're gonna tear a thin wire like
this I mean these are just too thin
heavy gauge wire here doesn't tangle up
and look at how easily this just slides
apart because it's got kind of a I don't
want to say slippery but it's smooth
whereas the skull candies are rubberized
and they just they catch on each other
so hope you've enjoyed this review of
