we're gonna talk about Corsairs new AIO
cooler the H 150 I Pro RGB saw this
briefly at CES they had it in some
systems there we didn't really get very
hands-on with it I've actually had this
for a couple of weeks now I'm just now
getting around to it but I saved you
guys the pain of watching me unboxing at
least at least it's already over here
put together so we'll talk about what's
different what makes it pro and we'll
see how well it performs the new DG
seven series cases from EVGA off the PC
enthusiast more of what they love like
tempered glass side panels vertical GPU
mount integrated RGB control board DG
tuner and an awesome three year warranty
to learn more about the DG seven series
of cases from EVGA head to the link in
the description below so it's a pretty
basic run-of-the-mill AIO you got your
ASA Tech pump right here with its copper
baseplate much smaller pump design
though like overall it's it's very tiny
you've got your flexible tubing here
with its paracord sleeve which looks
really nice triple fan designs up to
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator looks like it's about a twenty
five mil thick rad so it's definitely a
slim rad making it fit in many more
applications the fan is probably what's
most different though with this series
of a IO versus the older H series these
are maglev bearing fans so not sleeve
marrying fluid bearing ball bearing they
are a maglev bearing so it's actually
riding on a field of magnetism making
them super cool and as you can see they
no way you can see that they actually
spin very very easily but they are
static pressure optimized perfect for
radiators of course they are PWM wired
so you can plug them into your
motherboard if you want unfortunately
the cable that comes off the pump to
plug into the fans is not detachable
unlike the older H series coolers so if
you decide not to use the wires coming
off the pump you want to control with
your motherboard or something then this
is still gonna be plugged into the pump
unfortunately this plug coming off the
pump right here appears to be power in
rpm circuit and then we have our receipt
of power none of this is detachable the
only thing that's actually detachable is
the USB cable that comes with it because
this is how you connect to Corsair link
to control things like pump speed RGB
color fan speed and all of that
unfortunately you have all these wires
coming off the pump
it takes what's a otherwise a pretty
basic and clean design and really
clutters it up with all these wires but
that's subjective I guess one thing I
want to point out though is a lot of
people tend to freak out at the idea of
aluminum radiators let me show you this
right here this is a copper base found
them pretty much all AIO coolers with an
aluminum rad so there's that but anyway
these are maintenance-free they're not
designed to be opened up and touched or
played with or drained in any way
whatsoever so in a nutshell that is that
let's talk about brackets and
compatibility here because unfortunately
this does not support thread Ripper out
of the box which i think is extremely
disappointing considering the fact that
this cooler launched a good five months
or so after thread Ripper they had
plenty of time to design a bracket
because these are just brackets that
connect to the bottom of the pump very
very easily they just slide them up line
them up and then lock it into place
that's it so if you want to switch it
over to the AMD bracket it is extremely
easy so all they had to do is come up
with a bracket design for thread Ripper
now they say that they're gonna be
incorporating a bracket in the future
and I believe you can send a way for a
bracket when it's ready if you're an
existing owner I just don't think that
plenty of time to get that ready but
that's just me so I mean it's going to
support all of your eleventh series
sockets 13 Series 2011 2060 6 a.m. to 3
for FM's
sockets all that stuff so it's basically
got backwards compatibility all the way
back to like the last 10 years starting
from rise n down so it does support rise
in though so the way they decided to
support AMD is by having this bracket
which uses the factory clip locations if
you guys have ever installed an AMD
cooler you know it's got two
spring-loaded clips so instead of coming
up with a pass-through backplate like
they did from mainstream Intel they
maintain the clips and then you have got
somewhere in here you've got this bag of
I'm not gonna take them out but you see
you got this bag of extra screws and
clips that way it just snaps down onto
the AMD cooler making it kind of a
one-piece solution to fit all AMD
sockets instead of will- tr4 instead of
having to have that slightly different
offset like it has for Rison guys enough
of that let's go ahead and install this
beast and that's
was capable of so this is corsair link
and you can see we have a lot of
information here on the screen we've got
our motherboard temperatures all the
temperature probes that are available to
Corsair link will show here of course
we've got our fan speeds pump speed all
the information you could possibly want
is here in its own graph on the Left
right here you can see this is
everything that's represented on the
right so we can set warnings for
different temperature settings on the
motherboard so we can set motherboard
warning temp CPU warning temps we got
multiple profiles here I've got set to
balance right now which is a pretty
quiet mode these fans right here are a
400 to 1600 rpm Maglev fans so we when
we said some max which is performance
they're speeding up slow it's got a very
smooth curve but you can see the
everything just kind of reset right here
on the recording to the RGB it was all
set to white but each profile has its
own color settings as well now obviously
I've got the radiator set out in the
open like this it's not in a case
because I want to see what the absolute
cooling capability of the unit itself is
so obviously your results may vary based
on what you're about to see depending on
the kind of case that you have it in but
by having it in the open air just like
this and now it's really starting to
blow means that we are only limiting the
cooler by the cooler zone ability to
cool if that makes sense so that's I
mean this isn't like a whole in depth on
how to use Corsair link this just has
all kinds of options and stuff here the
profile
and I'm gonna set this to balanced for
right now in this particular test
because that's the way it shipped out of
the box and I want to see how it
performs if we just plug it in as is to
see how well it actually performs okay
so funny thing I was actually running
prime95 the latest version I think it
dropped one 52018 so brand-new version
with my 8700 k I was running 4.7 all
core overclocked at 1.3 to 3 volts I
think it was about 20 minutes in the
system just is shut down it didn't trip
a breaker or anything it powered right
back on but I tribute that to possibly
overheating vrm because we are in an
open air test bench and the VRMs were
almost too hot to touch the the heat
sinks worse now I have this fan blowing
down on them just to be safe but if we
look here at 8a 64 now you can see it's
pretty damn consistent we didn't really
see a rise over time this has been
running for 22 minutes so we've got
about 45 minutes of stress testing that
has gone on on this so far so like I
said we did the stock clock so I went
straight to the 4.7 overclock on all
cores and if we take a look at the
statistics you can see these are the
temps we're running right now cores are
sitting in the 70s and 80s these are the
maximum temperatures ever achieved so
we're looking at upper 80s and the
highest and those are the peaks if we
look at this right here these are these
high peaks where it jumps up momentarily
and yeah so if we look at our averages
though looking pretty damn good the
average on the package was 68 point five
and down into the mid to low 70s
now these Simpson things are actually
not that bad considering the fact that
we were set to the balanced mode alright
not even on performance and balance mode
it was the RPMs on the fan we're sitting
oh you can see right here look at 660
rpm 714 rpm so this is kind of the worst
case scenario we move this to
performance mode then the fans
definitely start to ramp up you'll see
the lights turn off this is learning a
new profile the pump is just change to
the pump speeds up and this speeds up
based on temperatures but if we go back
over here to Corsair we look at the
fluid Tim because through the fluid temp
even under this load is 29.2 see
and we are still running right now on a
264 so yeah that's actually not to be
honest I know it's a trial version
support your devs Mikey expired I know
I'm a bad guy but anyway it's incredibly
flat so what you can see is we kind of
met our our max temperatures in like the
first I don't know 90 seconds and then
as you can see it maintained very very
good temperatures so we're about gaming
though let me go and stop this what I
want to show you too is how fast the
temperatures will drop back down once we
stop the test
so yeah it's incredibly it's incredibly
fast
I mean look we're already back down into
the 30s right here on our cores one
course sitting at 52 it's because it's
still running something on that
particular core this one will drop back
down eventually I kind of noticed this
with the 8,700 cake or three just likes
to say really warm when things are sort
of running but anyway you can see what
Corsair link check this out back into
the 30s very very quickly the package is
down to 52 and dropping quickly and look
at the fluid temp look how fast this
starts to drop see how that's just
dropping kind of a tenth of a C about
every second second and a half not bad
not bad for an AO and then with having
benchmark running you can see our
temperatures don't really move very much
at all you might notice one core sort of
bounce around same thing kind of happens
with games where the CPU is not under a
huge load in gaming you can see our GPU
obviously temperatures are going up
because the GPU is obviously being
stressed in this particular test so all
in all I mean the cooler is definitely
doing its job if they can keep an 80 700
K that's overclocked to four point seven
on all cores running about one point
three volts cool under the lowest not
lowest necessarily abut 650 ish rpm fan
speed pump at its lowest speed where
noise was sort of the bias rather than
cooling performance a managed to say
about 20 C underneath our TJ Max or our
thermal junction max on the CPU then I
think it's definitely doing a great job
the ML bearing fans are nice and quiet
as expected I've used some ml fans on
quite a few things anyway there it is
your results may vary
keep in mind open air test bench as well
as a
aftermarket thermal paste installed so
you might see a couple of see increase
depend
on your case airflow so that's something
to keep in mind but when you take into
account just the cooler and what it's
capable of doing in this open air
environment I think of course there has
done a good job at providing a CP or a
CPU cooler that can keep all CPUs with
the exception of third rep third third
repper thread Ripper cool until that
bracket comes out so there you go guys
the h1 50i
Pro RGB from Corsair links on where to
buy is down in the description below and
if you guys have any other coolers you
think I should check out make sure you
comment down below on what we should get
and we'll test it anyway we're gonna go
guys thanks for watching and as low as
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
