that last vlog we did we showed you just
how much static electricity we were able
to build up by wiggling our butts around
in these chairs
that's exactly we're gonna test today
with our test subjects
unfortunately this computer might die
today you know in hindsight was probably
a bad idea to bet the car I told you
never bet on Rhett never bet on red
didn't just say he's gonna help us out
where is he anyway I don't know all I
know is he said that we would know when
he was close how are we supposed to fit
in this I have actually an idea we can
do to be 12 yeah it's a nice car sure
that's what you're saying right now
now no it can't be quiet dude I got you
covered everything needs in the truck J
front of the car
what the heck am I supposed to do with
the mesh if I see mini dude it's like
the mesh if I see mini know what stuff
you can fit in there you'll get it
figured out
you know what I got an idea to show you
we have a fully working computer right
here this is a pentium g 4560 right yeah
45 60 we're gonna we're gonna shock it
we're gonna test it we're gonna have
multiple people here try it out we got
Nick back there and Brian back there hi
all right first things first we do have
it in a chassis the chassis is designed
to be little bit like a Faraday cage
supposed to help alleviate some of the
static so that's one the reasons why
don't have it sitting out flat and
trying to recreate what you might deal
with at home don't do this don't try
this is stupid there's no reason to kill
hardware like this if it does work but
what we're testing modern hardware is
supposed to be very very resilient when
it comes to ESD or electrics electronic
static dictation yes no seriously though
most modern motherboards and stuff have
ESD capacitors on there which are
designed to absorb any shock but here's
the thing things like USB ports and you
know audio jacks and stuff usually are
not protected so we're gonna test all of
that and the GTX 660 that is sitting on
here I'm pretty sure has no ESD
protection so I guess let's see what
happens remove the paper towels oh so I
found that sitting on this chair this is
the autonomous chair with a mesh back
and a cloth but obviously is the the
charge now you seem like kind of turning
and moving and stuff in your chair let's
test this get in here fill we're gonna
start by touching the back of the
graphics card you can see it's working
right there no there wasn't much the
hard part is actually getting the ESD if
it's not as dry as it was the other day
and I look really stupid all right and
to get this oh but it's still on it's
still working let's dress let's try that
again why are you making that face Nick
cuz this is the stupidest video I've
ever done
I actually touched a memory chip let's
try this one oh it's still going
processor heatsink this is the most
stupid thing I think I've ever done oh
why do I subject myself to this madness
okay it's still on still working USB
ports are usually the number one thing
that you can kill on a computer let's do
this come back here I'm gonna touch this
3.0 right there oh it arced like
all the way back here oh my god it's
like that far away though let's plug
this in still works well I'll be damned
anybody else want to try
oh but it works
alright so now we're gonna try usb on
the front we turn the lights out hoping
you guys can see the arc you can
obviously hear the click but man I like
how you like how you're just tracking me
during this motion I think I'm getting
all sexual with this chair
we're going for this one nothing haha
that plugin anything that's what oh that
makes what again it says a lot for the
anonymous build quality
now we're use the paperclip to see if we
can't like specifically point where we
want the electricity to go this is a lot
fret 270 pound fat-ass like me to do
Phil if you're editing this I don't
think we need a montage me actually she
do another whoa oh yeah
so if I switch this now cuz that hit the
port straight up it's still working
oh my god Nick you're up could I be a
better way I feel like this is a Star
Wars movie we're always waiting for the
secret weapon to charge primary ignition
Oh like look at where Jaitley now this
video probably seems really stupid and
like why are they doing this but not
just because we shocked Nick in a chair
the other day yes Dee is a significant
problem to electronics but things have
actually progressed as times gone on in
ESD protection but we experienced
something specifically with one of our
camera monitors where I shocked it and
it behaved strangely so I'm gonna go
ahead and demonstrate that for you right
now
again as I chart there's gotta be a
better way to charge up this is got a
BIOS on it and you see how all I did was
touch it hook happen to the screen all I
did was touch this monitor and that's
what happened as you guys can see it
actually takes quite a bit to kill
something with ESD so anyway thanks for
watching today's video guys if you hated
it you know what to do but if you liked
the fact that I was gyrating on the
chair for 10 minutes and shocking a
computer for the sake of viewership what
you hit that like button if you're new
around here subscribe and as always guys
we'll see you in the next one this was
the worst video I get ever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
