with a vlog I'm going to be working on
the test rig back there in preparation
for a video I'm doing for Friday
something with that over there
and I'm glad that I figured it out today
otherwise Friday's video would have been
screwed but if you follow me on social
media then you would already know what
the topic for today's video is so
there's obviously some incentive on why
you guys should be following on social
media but the pump has died in the test
rig only one month after using any fries
in it is that the reason why I died I
don't know we're going to find out this
is the any fries mixture with some
emerald green dye that I put in there
because I want to be a little darker I
don't think the die had anything to do
with my pump dying a little bit of a pun
there I guess but my lane DDC has died
so what I've got to do right now is I'm
going to swap it with another laying DDC
fortunately I've got a ton of these
pumps laying around but I want to show
you guys what's actually happening here
if you listen closely you'll actually
hear this pump start and stop three
times I don't know what it's doing but
it's just kind of looping through there
so obviously there's a short or
something is causing this to click off
and I don't know what the problem is as
we're going to open it up and find out
now I'm also not saying that the coolant
is what caused the problem but I'm kind
of wondering if maybe something here
might have caused this o ring there's an
o-ring that goes around right here that
protects the actual blade or the
impeller from the electronics this is
the o-ring right here it actually just
came out but I don't know if that's what
failed I could just be electronics that
failed it just could be a random failure
I don't know where we're at the whole
point of today's video but take a listen
but the first thing I have to do is
actually drain the loop before I can
even get in there so let's go ahead and
do that
okay
I think I'll also take the opportunity
to get rid of the tubing that kind of
died itself purplish red color here it's
still weird to me that dyed itself this
color after the green coolant was in it
this tubing never had red in it it only
had green so weird now the cool thing
about this being a DDC pump is I can
just assemble this without having to
take it off the side of the rig I just
flipped the rig on the side and have
access to it from the bottom now I'll be
honest when I say that I was pretty damn
frustrated when I turned on the system
today and it stopped me from getting the
work done that I had to do for a product
video that's coming out on Friday but at
least we can look at the bright side we
get to take stuff apart we get to figure
out what went wrong or try and figure it
out anyway and I get to make a video for
you guys where you can see that things
aren't always perfect things are never
perfect actually and when it comes to
water cooling yeah it's that much more
of a pain in the ass when something goes
wrong but I still enjoy it I'll still do
it I guess I just like punishment there
we go last screw so I can do this
one-handed
it's so easy and take off yeah feels dry
just dry in there full ring appears all
right pull the different blades on this
one than that one mo it's actually quite
different the o-ring looks fine so
alright at that point we definitely
can't not call this fluid related
interesting that there are two different
impeller designs though I mean
everything else about these pumps are
the same to take a look at them here you
can see this one's a PWM obviously it's
got the four prongs on there that are
soldered this one does not have anything
right there on the PWM side of it but
they are the same I could also just
replace them he's just sitting here with
a magnet these are magnetized so they
basically just hover and spin so I just
pulled that one out I could literally
swap them if I wanted and then that one
could go in there and then we're good
I'm not sure if there's any benefit to
this one over that one they want to go
with this one just to see what happens
so here's the o-ring right here
everything is perfectly fine with it
I'm very confident in saying that this
has obviously nothing to do with the
coolant the new pumps already in there
here's the thing let's go into this
let's power this on and let's see what
happens when I try and run I think we're
just going to see it kind of do little
just like little quick jumps of power
and nothing's actually happening and if
it works out of the case then it would
be weird if something just caused it to
randomly short let's check it you know
well it works just fine outside of the
casing well I'll be damned I'm glad that
it's not bad that is so weird
I don't know how it could have been
shorting huh so here's my theory
this is a typical cover you'd find on
one of the DDC is about any of the
custom tops or anything on them you can
see there's a part right here where the
wires have to pass through now when I
look closely at these I can see where it
looks like they've been smashed but it
doesn't look like any of the wires were
exposed but all it takes is just a tiny
tiny tiny bit of exposure like if you
can't even see with your eye it could
still be enough to cause a short now
when you push it in the plastic housing
right here
it doesn't actually kind of smush
against it like it does on the Alpha
cool housing so I think that that might
be it this one's got a little bit more
of a gap for the wires to go through and
I think over time it just eventually
created some sort of a short that way
but I'm happy to say that this pump does
indeed still work it's actually a really
good opportunity to explain to you why
you shouldn't run your pumps dry even
though you just saw me do it do as I say
not as I do now these guys actually have
a really nice bearing that's built in
right here on the motor so these are
actually floating I mean as I showed you
they're just magnetic sitting in there
floating on like a like a fluid bearing
if you will the fluid that goes in your
system is what actually causes these
things you have a gap between the actual
spinning impeller and the housing so
that's why you definitely want to run
them dry so I guess the question moving
forward now is whether or not the new
one is going to have any sort of a
problem with pinching I mean I could end
up using this plastic housing and
getting rid of
the heatsink one but the heatsink
actually gives some cooling aspect to
those electronics on the bottom of the
pump those can get really really hot so
I guess we just have to put it back
together now and see what happens so
yeah I'm going to put the other impeller
type in here I should even do this but I
want you guys to hear the sound this is
what that different impeller type
sounded like in here when it's running
dry yeah that's bad it's really bad well
I think the pinching thing I was talking
about is definitely what was wrong
because now the new ones doing it and I
even started to smell that little
familiar blue smoke smell you know I'm
talking about yeah so I might have just
smoked this pump literally it appears to
be it's this metal housing so I might
put the plastic one on the bottom go
ahead and remove this try and see if I
can salvage this if not we know the
other one's good right I mean that's a
good thing you guys have ever fried
anything electronic then you know that
smell so just as I thought this metal
piece right here is pinching on here you
look closely you can actually see where
it is squishing the wires and that's
what's causing us to have a short I'll
be honest I'm really happy that has
nothing to do with the antifreeze that
was in the system because I know a lot
of you are running antifreeze and I
really didn't think anything was going
to go wrong in this system I still would
say don't run glycol-based coolant with
PE TG rigid tubing in fact all of the
manufacturers of PE TG tubing say don't
use glycol-based coolants with them and
there is a lot of glycol in any freeze
for automobiles but this system has no
PE GG in it anywhere and it would have
been really weird if it somehow
dissolved a rubber o-ring which was part
of my concern
but that doesn't appear to be the case
at all so my assumptions were correct
when I thought that this might have been
causing a pinch and it was and
unfortunately it killed the replacement
pump and the original pump works fine
after being pinched which is funny maybe
it's because it killed the PWM or
something and the other pump I just have
no idea right let's take it apart and
look real quick there we go right there
hope to have I build you a smells magic
smoke if you've ever smelled it
oh man it's funny this little this
little bear
component right here you can see it up
close that little burned component right
there made this entire room just smell
so disgusting it even kind of puked all
over one of the coil packs right there
anyway guys time to get out of here I'm
gonna go ahead and finish off this video
by putting the system together and
playing with my new Rhino motorized
slider to give you some beautiful shots
of this it's a very pretty test bench
I like this test bench the Praxis web
bench it looks so damn good it's
interesting that when the problem turns
out to be making sure that you have a
nice snug fit between two parts that
make together I'm not talking about guys
and girls I'm talking about a pump
housing and the reservoir to make sure
you don't get a leak
well unfortunately in my case and ended
up causing me to uh to short out the
pump oh well guys enjoy this epic b-roll
and I will see you in the next one
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
