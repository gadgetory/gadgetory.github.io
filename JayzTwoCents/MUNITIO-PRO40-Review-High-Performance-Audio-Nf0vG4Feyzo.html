since your one-stop headquarters for all
things technical and geeky and computers
and just silliness but I've got a video
today that I've been wanting to bring
you for the past seven months the good
guys over at me initio sent me a set of
the munitia pro forties studio quality
headphones so without further ado let's
go ahead and roll the intro get into the
video and let's tell you guys all about
these bad boys right here now we're not
gonna call this an official unboxing
because if you know me and you've been
following me on all the social medias
the Facebook and the Twitter and the
twitch livestreams you've already seen
me wearing these and you know the Davies
came in I tore into these faster than a
fat kid realizing Twinkies was on sale
once again actually technically that was
me I'm referring to myself not calling
anybody else fat just me but anyway
these guys right here have been open but
we're gonna go ahead and for the sake of
you know authenticity we're gonna one
time we're gonna pretend that these have
not been opened so we're gonna go ahead
and put down the little retail tab
thingy we're gonna slide this open here
and the quality of this box this isn't
just like cardboard this is I don't know
what this is this is like really hard
the box to my head is really hard but
the the box is really tough I don't know
what they made this item but holy crap
this this is pretty cool we're gonna set
that right there when you open the box
this is what you're greeted with here a
nice heart pouch says munitia sound
precision MDR zero one spec mil grade
it's military grade yes a zipper pouch
here that says munitia Oh stitch tanned
embroidered right on into the it's kind
of like a web material it's kind of you
see that up close there
it's got a zipper pouch here open it
right on up and this is what you see in
side now I'm gonna be rolling some
close-ups and some hi footage
high-definition footage that you see
right here with this camera so you guys
can get an up-close and personal feel
look at this look at that oh my god
these these gold rings immediately they
just they just greet you like Peter at
the pearly gates if you're Christian I
guess and I don't know if anything else
to really use as a a reference here oh
my god there's dust on there we don't
want that these are them right here
right off the bat you might be noticing
that there's no cord coming out of these
no unfortunately these are not like
wireless or Bluetooth or anything like
that but that's because they do feature
if you look right here and especially in
the close-up up on the screen or at
about now they have a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack on the
headphone themselves so that makes means
that you can take off the cord and this
happens to be the cord right here it's
located inside this it's got kind of a a
little hidden secret pocket right there
and you're greeted right here with a
cable that's very similar to the
munition in√©s cable where these are
kevlar reinforced it is a kevlar braided
cable here it's it's fairly anti kink
but because it's not flat you know it is
possible to kink as you can see trying
to we always do the kink test and no
we're not talking about adult contents I
mean it's just so that's a whole
different kind of video all together
guys this right here you can just roll
em in then juggle them just drop them in
your lap
they almost fall out every time I mean
as you can see you had to get a little
tug but there you go it does have your
Apple branded iPod iPhone iPad music
control right here again it looks just
like diminish you nines unfortunately
this one is made out of plastic this is
not made out of aluminum just like the
nines are but it looks exactly the same
and you've got a built-in microphone on
here and unfortunately I'm not gonna be
able to do the microphone test in this
video but rest assured you can't it's
meant for cell phone so it's gonna be a
cell phone quality mic so don't expect
any things you know superb out of it but
they're gonna be able to hear you and
they're not gonna be like what-what-what
are you saying I can't understand you
but it's got some really cool branding
on it it's got pro forty on one side and
it's got me initio on the other cable
and when you're ready to use this you
just take it plug it right on into the
port and there you go you've got your
cable and easy way to remember left and
right cord goes on the left and there
you go so when it comes to fitment of
these things
the munitia pro forties they've got a
pretty good amount of adjustment on here
they've got a about an inch and a half
on either side so if you've got a tiny
head or a big head
keep your mind out of the gutter people
this is a family show here these will
fit just about any head in fact my four
year old daughter was wearing these the
other day and they fit perfectly
comfortable now one thing to keep in
mind here because this is a one size
fits all the band on here tends to be
kind of stiff so when you first wear
them when you're breaking them in
they're good they might feel like
they're squeezing down on your head a
little bit they're not too bad like
right now I I don't feel like I'm being
squeezed when I first got them it was
like they were kind of tight but you
know most headphones are that way
because they're gonna they're gonna
break in they don't want it you don't
want them loose you want them to fit
really nice
now the ear cups one of the most
important things with the exception of
sound when it comes to headphones
is Comfort now if you follow me over on
twitch.tv slash J's VFX to ays VFX you
will know that I've been wearing these
my last few live streams and we're
talking a couple of hours at a time and
absolutely no overheating no sweating
and this room can get pretty hot when
you've got the computers you know
running and rendering and all that stuff
so but what really helps with that is
the fact that you have real leather this
is leather it's very very soft and it's
definitely giving a nice elegant look
covering up you know on the inside of
the nice anodized gold ring right here
it's not real gold guys by the way but
you've got your 40 millimeter drivers in
there and they just look fantastic
now let's go ahead and talk about specs
here initio states that these can go
from 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz now I know
I'm not going to be able to let you guys
hear these because unfortunately I don't
have a way to like climb through your
screens stick them on your head say how
do you like them take them back and then
climb back through your monitor tube I'd
be kind of freaky actually that's
actually a terrifying thought what
you're able to do or what I was able to
do was I took I used to do a lot of base
tuning for automobiles and high
competition DB drag type cars and we
were talking 15 15 inch subwoofers in
one Escalade oh yeah we're talking about
a lot of bass but I did test these all
the way down to the 10 Hertz frequency
and there was no Distortion there was no
cracking there was barely any sound
coming that out of them but there
definitely was SPL which is sound
pressure level which means the woofers
the 40 millimeter drivers in these were
still going and still producing face
that you could feel and it almost gave
me an immediate nauseousness and what
does that mean 10 Hertz does make you
feel sick
these were reproducing 10 Hertz so I
don't know if they're just being a
little bit conservative with the 20
Hertz rating on the box
these reproduced 10 Hertz and I let a
few people listen to these put the
especially some of my bass fans or my
friends that are really into bass put
these down to 10 Hertz and they were
just the moment you know they
the sound they were like there's gonna
have to take my word for the way that
they sound because I know you can't hear
them but I can guarantee you as an
audiophile myself the highs are crisp
the mids are rich and what I mean by
that is if you've got a lot it depending
on the kind of music that you listen to
you if you have a lot of sound happening
you've got guitars and you've got you
know you've got bass guitars you've got
your lead guitars you've got piano
you've maybe have some acoustic in there
you've got your vocals the human vocal
range is definitely in that mid range
you've got all those sounds happening
and the drivers inside these earphones
are just able to separate that sound and
individually create and recreate the
sound that was recorded at the quality
at which the studio recorded it now
let's go ahead and get back a little bit
on track here about what else comes in
the package they also give you a nice
little carabiner here that is branded
munitia oh and one of the things you
know definitely keep in mind is this is
not you know a for rock climbing
carabiner it's you know it's just it's
where your keys or something I wouldn't
go and try and climb Mount Everest I
wouldn't even really try and climb you
know a tree with it with this and what
the hell am I having such a hard time
getting a little sip luck mmm so they
include a little carabiner here that is
branded munitia oh right on it and on
the back it even says actually not for
weight not load rearing so don't climb
with this basically and that's
everything you have in the pouch right
here but that's not that's not all
you're gonna find in the bottom there's
some stuff floating on there some
mystery stuff and this is not a manual
right here this is the pro 40 warranty
information card product description you
know basically it's like hey you bought
some headphones put them on your head
see there are three instructions when it
comes to listening to these put them on
your wall I guess hold them put them on
your head
plug in the cord - I'm not kidding that
that's right there you know some people
guys might need these instructions but
here they are they've also got some
troubleshooting information and then on
the back you've got all your warranty
stuff this is important guys these
headphones come with a 2-year product
guarantee so if anything goes wrong with
these and in two years of owning them
that you're gonna get product
replacement but you also get this card
right here that talks about accessories
that are available for your Proform
initio pro 40 earphones and I happen to
just drop the card but anyway I've kind
of got one of those accessories right
here and that is this this is a coil
cable now a lot of people who are into
high-end music and studio and all that
sort of stuff are gonna be interested in
this coil cable because you know if
you're like me this is this is good this
cable that that comes with it is good
for you know you're putting it in your
phone or the gym or something but I tend
to like a nice short cable and because I
use these with this microphone I am
going to I'm going to plug these in and
demonstrate right now the coil cable so
as you can see I just I switched the
cable plug these right on in put them on
my head and I'm gonna take this I'm
gonna oh that's a quarter inch plug oh
man if only you know munitia had thought
to you know maybe make this some sort of
a removable wait a minute they did look
at this you can unscrew this
three-and-a-half millimeter two quarter
inch adapter gold-plated as are the
connectors now I could plug this right
on into my Yeti and here we go now it's
recorded we've got sound playing and
I've got the coil cord as you can see
right here that's off the desk and this
is the way that I do my live streams now
I use this coil cable it's off the desk
and everybody's happy we're good to go
so with that I don't know what else
there really is to say about these I
mean they are absolutely gorgeous
they're comfortable they look good they
they didn't go flashy they didn't you
know
put a they didn't there the ring here is
made of metal the overall construction
you know of course is plastic but you
can see here they're very sturdy you've
got not only do you have your adjustment
up and down but you have your these do
kind of swivel on here so they're gonna
fit comfortably on your head whatever
shape your head is and they even make a
very stylish necklace if you're into
music and stuff you know cuz if you
early in the music that's what you do
you wear your headphones as a necklace
