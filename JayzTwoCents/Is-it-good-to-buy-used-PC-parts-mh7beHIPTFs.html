and today we're going to talk about a
topic that I've been asked to do a lot
of but I never really thought made for a
good video but because there's so many
requests for it
I decided we'll go ahead and do it
that's gonna be my opinion on purchasing
used hardware in order to try and get
better parts for cheaper to ultimately
get the most out of your money when it
comes to building your systems the new
z170 classified motherboard from EVGA
features eight phase PWM four-way SLI
support along with top notch components
to offer gamers and enthusiasts more of
what they want a badass motherboard with
no compromises click the link below to
learn more
building new computers is fun and it's
fun to have brand new off-the-shelf
parts and I'm not going to lie when I
say that getting that brand-new computer
smell or a new motherboard or new
graphics card for even that matter it's
fun to open it up and unbox it and it's
just it gives you a nice rush when it
comes to unboxing brand-new stuff and
this might actually surprise a lot of
people but until I started doing YouTube
and then the channel grew when I started
getting parts accumulating around here
for review that I can eventually build a
complete system out of I had never built
a completely brand-new out-of-the-box PC
without using something used within the
system I just never could afford that so
maybe this is a good video topic for me
to talk about because I have experience
with doing a lot of forum browsing and a
lot of online classified ads and buying
used parts and I think I have something
to offer to the discussion when it comes
to buying new or used I think very few
people in this world are lucky enough to
own brand new everything I mean when it
comes to cars or furniture or houses
computer parts TVs stereos I think a lot
of people spend time browsing on
Craigslist or forums trying to find the
best deal for lightly or gently used
product I mean if you were the kind of
person that needed new everything when
it comes to your dating prospects it
would be a very small ocean of fish to
choose from today we're going to
specifically talk about used graphics
cards but it really will apply to any
component inside your system now use
graphics cards Freaks a lot of people
out because everyone else are so easy to
overclock and people are very afraid
that overclocking is going to make the
longevity and lifespan of this card
really fall through the floor
where you're going to buy it and two
weeks later it's going to die on you I
don't know exactly how much life you
could really cut off of this thing and I
don't think there would be any
conclusive data and even a controlled
environment to tell you exactly how much
life you cut off of a graphics card by
overclocking it for either short period
of time or long periods of time but I
will tell you this that I did own an
Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8 6 gigahertz East
6300 CPU that I overclocked 23.4 2
gigahertz for an 80% overclock she's
like 79.5 on a roundup 80% overclocked
that I ran for seven years at that
overclock and that was not a turbo clock
it ran three point four to constantly
the moment the PC booted to the moment
the PC turned off there was no
throttling in there whatsoever no turbo
boost or turbo clock it just ran at
balls-to-the-wall the entire time seven
years or what ultimately ended up dying
was not the chip it was the motherboard
and died due to physical damage not to
any sort of degradation now that doesn't
mean that the graphics card is not going
to experience degradation it's going to
but chances are the graphics card itself
as long as it's overclocked through
stock bios of something you know like
through MSI Afterburner or precision or
OC guru or whatever app that you would
use usually the amount of life that
you're shaving off the bottom of the
card is going to really be negligible
when it comes to the fact that the card
will probably become obsolete and not be
able to run your favorite games at
graphics frame rates that you want
that's going to happen long before this
is going to die due to overclocking so
I'm personally of the mindset that
buying used product if you know where
it's coming from and you trust the buyer
it's not necessarily a bad thing now
there are some things that you can do to
remove some of the risk because when you
buy a used product there's risk involved
no matter what you can't get away from
that and you can't say that this card
dying two months after you got it as
long as it worked when you got it meant
that the buyer knew it was going to
break that's usually not the case now if
you're going to buy used products from a
forum make sure you check their feedback
also too if you're buying from a forum
make sure you look at how long they've
been on that forum a lot of people will
sign up on forums simply to sell their
stuff they have no posting history they
have
no trustworthiness they have no
established presence within that forum
that's someone that I would probably
stay away from if they say something
like oh it's also for sale on this forum
go and check their trustworthiness over
on that forum as well as any feedback
that they might have now Craigslist I
don't buy PC parts off of Craigslist
never have never will I have no idea
where it's come from there's no
documented history whatsoever and
there's no feedback system for
Craigslist also who knows it's stolen I
don't know it's a whole nother
conversation you really aren't going to
be able to know it's something stolen
until you get your hands on it and then
check the serial number with the vendor
half the time even they won't know
because a lot of people don't register
their stuff I kind of leads me into the
next section of mine used hardware is is
it still within warranty and is it
registered back in the day a lot of
companies did not transfer the warranty
which I thought was really shitty
amongst the manufacturers where that was
really a cop-out for them to be able to
say oh you're not the person you bought
it therefore we're not going to warranty
it what's it matter this is what your
warranty anticip that now where the item
is warranteed for a specific date from
purchase now if you don't have a
purchase receipt a lot of times they
will just automatically go back to the
release date of the product and if
you're within that one-year two-year
five-year whatever the release date a
lot of times they'll still honor it but
I would also stay away from any brands
that do not on to honor transferred
warranties for use products I honestly
think buying use is a good thing you can
quite honestly increase your performance
by lowering the amount of money you're
spending or at the very least get more
performance for the same amount if you
can buy components that are used and
that you trust
obviously CPUs motherboards and graphics
cards are going to be the most expensive
bulks of your system and you can get
some pretty good deals usually from very
trustworthy people on the forums so in
order to reduce the amount of risk of
you getting a bad piece of hardware when
buying used I would maybe ask the seller
these questions one did they buy it
newer used are you going to be the
second owner or third owner or even more
than that how many times has it traded
hints if they bought it new do they
still have the receipt from where for
where they bought it from if they have
the receipt that's like getting
receipts for work done on a cop buying a
used car the manufacturer can use that
as well to validate you know that the
thing was purchased legitimately does it
still have a warranty and is the
warranty transferable like we just
talked about
did they overclocked the card not that
it's going to really increase your risk
too much when it comes to whether or not
the card is potentially going to dial in
on you in the future you at least will
get some idea one of how far it over
clocks because often they'll tell you
yeah I got this overclock at this
voltage now I'm personally not turned
away by hardware that's been overclocked
in fact it often gives you an idea of
how far you can push the thing
especially if you were looking at
overclocking it yourself in fact back in
the day on hard form there was a guy who
sold and used I five 2500 K for more
than retail because he had proof through
prime95 instability testing screenshots
that the thing was stable at five
gigahertz at low voltage and people were
all over that so sometimes the overclock
ability is a selling point last but not
least ask them why they are selling it
hopefully they'll be honest hopefully
they're not trying to sell something
that's in stable has a terrible
overclock sometimes they'll just say I'm
just not using it or I upgraded my
system if they have proof of the upgrade
then you can believe them but sometimes
people will buy something find out it's
a terrible overclocker then rather than
do the shady method of returning it to
the store or RMA it which is really kind
of shady when you return something cuz
it doesn't overclock as far as you
wanted they'll just go and sell it use
take a loss on the forms and try again
and then you're stuck with something
that may not overclock well when you
were kind of hoping that that would be
the case now motherboard specifically
when buying used request a picture of
the socket if it's an AMD socket it's
not going to be a huge deal but if it's
Intel requests a picture of the socket
to make sure that there are no bent pins
bent pins on a socket is usually a death
sentence for an Intel motherboard but
buying used hardware is not necessarily
a bad thing in fact that's why scrapyard
wars over online aesthetic but I think
is so popular is because it really
touches base or hits home with a lot of
buyers who would be doing like the exact
same thing trying to source used
hardware to get a good deal now a couple
years ago I said I wanted to do like an
eBay build or see what I could come up
with for a set amount of money and buy
you stuff obviously scrapyard wars beat
me to that maybe I'll do this in the
future not as a comp
which is what scrapyard Wars is but I
just would set myself like let's say 700
bucks or something like that buy the
product off of forums kind of vlog where
I'm looking and how the sales are going
and then put the system together
benchmark it and then I don't know do
something with the system like give it
away or whatever
I'll probably end up doing something
like that in the future but for now if
you guys are looking at buying used
hardware just keep those tips in mind
that I just gave you and usually you'll
come out on top at the end the hardest
part is finding the right price some
people discount it only a little bit for
being used some people want to move the
product quickly because they need the
money to offset a new build and now some
you can sometimes find an amazing deal
for instance you can get a 780ti now for
about two hundred and twenty dollars on
forms a 780ti for two hundred twenty
bucks is going to beat anything new you
could get today and just smack it around
the ring like it's John Cena or some
 like that for that amount of money
there's nothing you could buy today for
220 that's new that's going to keep
paces with a 780ti period alright guys I
hope this videos helped you you guys
wanted my opinion on use product this is
it no fancy editing no transitions or
b-roll just kind of having a
conversation with you guys so it's the
weekend I make it outta here I got some
videos to get together we just found out
that a friend of ours is gone into labor
out in Arizona so I might be taking a
little leave of absence for a little bit
while we go visit a new family so anyway
guys time to get out of here
see you on social media and if not we'll
see you in the next video and as always
thanks for all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
