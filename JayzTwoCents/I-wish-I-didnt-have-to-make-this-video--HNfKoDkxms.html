is not a video that I want to make but
it's what I'm going to make because I
consider the core foundation of this
community as family and what do you do
when there's problems in the family you
let the family know
and unfortunately earlier this morning
my father passed away he had a youtube
channel I love you guys didn't know that
he started a YouTube channel because of
me he liked what I did and he wanted to
do with himself he loved to teach he
taught me everything I know about
presentation and he just was bored and
retired and want to give it a shot but
over the last couple of years I guess
those who have watched his channel know
that his health was deteriorating and
this his passing last night or this
morning was was sudden in the sense that
he didn't have any precursors leading up
to this to say that he was having some
sort of a health issue he pretty much
went to sleep and and died in his sleep
I'll try I'll put a link down below if
you guys want to watch any of his videos
not only did you do like HTML
programming guides which was really
interesting as a guy in his 70s talking
about programming but he talked a lot
about his life experiences and his
career in the military he was a military
man for over 20 years
travelled the world has been to every
ocean and every sea and who knows how
many countries and some really really
good stories and so he wanted to share
that because I did a video with him few
years back where we had a health scare
with him where we thought that he had
cancer but he was misdiagnosed and that
was a big oh that was a gold mine truck
but I had him on and I the point of that
video was to let you guys know that if
you you know have people in your life
that you care about let them know
because they could be gone in any moment
as obviously my family is dealing with
right now not only myself but my my wife
my sister his other siblings he has and
we have he has a total of four siblings
including myself the grandkids he was
very close to his family everyone was
very close with him we had a long
discussion with family last night we
spent hours and hours at the hospital
because they were trying they were
trying to save him because we were
actually watching my mom
something was wrong while he was
sleeping and then they tried to work on
him but it was kind of a lost cause
because he was just his body was
shutting down there was no stopping it
so we had to make the decision as a
family to take him off of life support
which is that's that's a that's a
mindfuck when when a doctor is looking
at you and saying what what do you want
to do here no one's ready for that no
one but one of the best things I got
from my dad was my work ethic
Jerry teases me for being a workaholic I
would say that's the thing I got most of
my dad so definitely not a bad trait I
mean I worked my ass off for my family
so my wife and my kids can have a better
life and if I died tomorrow I hope that
that's what people would say about me
and that's what I'd say about him
everything I am everything I my tech my
family my drive is because that's what I
saw in him when I was growing up so the
point of this video really was just to
share with what I consider an extension
of my family here that unfortunately the
patriarch of my family and my hero has
gone hopefully to a better place where
he's not in pain anymore
so what's next obviously my rising 3
video is postponed we were in the middle
of recording that yesterday and we plan
to finish it today obviously I'm not
going to the studio today
but I'm going to push forward and I'm
going to work that's what my dad would
have wanted I know people are going to
judge and say oh my god your dad just
passed away why are you going to go to
work so I've got an event this weekend
it's local fortunately not to get on any
planes or anything so if I decide to go
to this event and I'm just not mentally
there you get in the car and go home I'm
sure people will understand but that's
the kind of guy my dad was he was
especially being a military man and in
war you see something bad happened you
just have to keep going and that's my
mentality right now and the last thing
I'm my personality is not capable of
just sitting around the house and moping
I have to keep myself busy and games and
work is going to be it besides family
life obviously and so I'm going to go to
the events and if you guys think that
that was the wrong decision it doesn't
really matter it's my decision and
I'm gonna give it a shot Nick is going
with me so I'm not going to be alone
obviously and I'll be with other
colleagues who I care a lot about and
have a lot of respect for so I'll be
surrounding myself with a pretty good
support team or structure as well
especially people I only get to see a
couple times a year so I'm looking
forward to that cool part though is that
he's going to be getting military honors
that's going to be happening and so he
will be getting his his 21 gun salute
and all that stuff which is great which
is that's he told me once not that long
a father never talked about dying he
wasn't afraid to die he said he didn't
he told me once you know I don't want to
die but if I it's just my time it's my
time that's the way he was and and he
lived through some pretty bad stuff so
he once you he told me once you make it
through the ambushes and the stuff that
he dealt with in Vietnam especially when
he was doing Special Forces stuff with
the Marines and the Navy he was in the
Navy but he worked alongside the Marines
and he was escaped once you make it
through that everything else is easy he
just don't you're not afraid to die and
you just hope that by the time you got
Eve accomplished enough in life to where
you feel like you've completed something
and I hope that I live up to what he
would have would have wanted so
hopefully my kids will feel the same
about me when it's my time hopefully
that's long from now but yeah so again I
apologize guys for the delay and content
obviously I'm going to take a couple
days off from video content creation and
I know we'll see we'll see what's next
get back to work next week take the
weekend to just kind of recover and go
look at some some stuff at the same d
events so yeah anyway that's it don't
know what else to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
