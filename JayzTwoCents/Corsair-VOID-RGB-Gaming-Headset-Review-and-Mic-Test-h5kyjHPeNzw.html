below for more details
hey what's up guys J's $0.02 here and
the one and only coke and muggy anyway
we are gonna take a look today at the
corsair gaming void RGB special edition
headphones um this one's yellow but they
also come in black so so while he is
unboxing it I'll go ahead and tell you a
little bit about the specs so it's kind
of like a nun specking or something like
that it is that yours so it's got 50
millimeter drivers but a Dolby 7.1 they
call it genuine dealt Dolby 7.1
surrounds it's not true surround it is a
software surround considering there is
only 150 millimeter driver in each ear
kin as you can see it's very very yellow
so if you're not into yellow don't get
the yellow one they have a black one as
well it is Wireless it's 2.4 gigahertz
and you can keep it well you know
wireless and stuff so I'm go ahead and
show them the dongle show them your
dongle please check and I gotta check
out the dongle so the special edition
dongle is also yellow I don't know if
the black headset is all
got a yellow one but it's an extension
basically so this is the actual wireless
piece right here and you can stick that
into the back of your computer or head a
side of your laptop or whatever but
maybe your computer is far away from
where you sit you can use this thing
here that's in its hand that is not
showing that the camera very well there
the cameras up higher they go hey we'll
make a youtube right ahem eventually you
can plug this into back your computer
and extend you know where you put this
thing or put it up higher or something
and get better range now it does
advertise you can get either up to 40 or
up to 50 feet of range depending on
which part of the box you read actually
is court some contradicting information
on the box waking up to 40 or 50 feet of
range with this thing are you doing your
best Vanna White know you want the best
finna way show us your hand white it
needs a little sparkle like right up
here I don't know okay but other than
that this that's it there's not really
anything else in the box now as I said
they are wireless they do also come with
a sync cable somewhere seven bucks yeah
it also has a sync cable so that if you
you can charge a headset through this or
if your batteries are dead you can also
turn this into a USB headset using that
but because it is wireless that means it
is a USB interface only now that's going
to talk about comfort cuz comforts
important it's very important he's kind
of hogging him hogging it all anyway I
don't want to wear okay
reason why I don't want to wear them is
and this is the subjective part of the
review is the material is fiber or
fabric and fabric headphones tend to
make my head itch I know I'm pear
Leavitt fiber itchy head allergy or
something I don't know but it does have
memory foam in there kind of a well it's
not very dense memory foam so I'm
wondering how to hold up over time but
the headphone band as well as the ear
cups are memory foam and then the
special edition one has yellow inside of
there okay so why don't you tell us what
else you see mr. coconut monkey apart
from the yellow apart from the yellow I
know it's hard to look past all that
yellow but yeah I see the microphone
it's very sleek looking and they have
the tube int I have the power you have a
mute and the bottom size could be your
volume control yeah it's like I take a
rock
switch for volume up and volume down
when you get to full volume it'll beep
at you and then when it's all the way
off well it's all the way down so this
one but they are or RGB it's part of the
RGB family and as you can see the sale
and the little like it's not gonna be in
focus
oh the sale and the little logo
underneath there will changing colors
depending on you know whatever color you
select so you can you can hook this up
to your you know corsair link or
whatever software you're using for
corsair and you can control this with
other corsair RGB products so that
everything is kind of on the same page
and when it comes to colors and stuff
lots of adjustability in the band so if
you have a big fat head like i do we've
got probably about an inch of adjustment
on either side it looks about so about
two inches of total adjustment if you
got a small head then you put it all the
way down the microphone itself has what
they call their info mic so it's got
leds on it that kind of face you so that
if you look down their peripheral vision
where the mic is you can see there a red
LED if it's muted or kind of a green LED
if it's live so you kind of know what
the state of the mic is you have any
embarrassing you know man i just want
five more minutes to play don't you've
you've never said that have you mom okay
brackets i can neither confirm nor deny
alright so let's do this then it's not a
whole lot really to talk about it's
wireless headset special edition here is
yellow if the l isn't your thing we have
a black they have a wired version which
is white black and yellow so the three
colors to choose from on the wired
version but let's go ahead and do a I
guess a taste test here what we're both
going to play battlefield 4 we're going
to try it out we're going to see how we
feel about it and then we'll come back
and talk to you about it so it's time to
roll that what transition transition
you
yeah I do feel like as I turn I do feel
the difference of left and right
I can tell front and back but it like
you said I don't think it's as defined
as a real 7.1 headset would be because
that's always the challenge right for
simulated surround headsets is how do
you make it sound forward and backward I
did good oh you're coming behind us all
right yeah I don't feel like it takes a
link 5050 he did I don't feel like it
takes a lot to get an impression of
these um impressions are good they sound
like headphones and they go bang a boom
stuff no um they're comfortable the
sound is is uh it's good I feel like the
base is rumbly the highs are not as
crisp as I think I would like them to be
but then again it's a single 50
millimeter driver I guess we have to do
a mic test don't we that's the other
thing we promised all right so we're
gonna go ahead and do the microphone
test that I have promised and right now
you are hearing me on the lav mic not on
the headset but as you can see we are
recording with audacity behind me so
let's go ahead and switch over to that
that was a terrible snap damn it now I
can't snap with my right hand is that
weird okay so now we are talking here on
the void RGB headset from Corsair now I
already listened back to it a little bit
it's not the greatest sounding headset
but that's partly to do with the fact
that it's wireless and there's only so
much bandwidth they have that they can
communicate back and forth between the
computer over that wireless signal and
that tends to kind of hold true for a
lot of wireless headsets usually
headsets like this you're going to lose
out on microphone quality in lieu of
audio quality and that holds true for
every brand I've ever tested for
wireless headphones but this probably
sounds good enough for most people I
don't think it's good enough for say
like doing a YouTube channel or even you
know game commentary I wouldn't want to
listen to this it sounds a little bit
muffled makes a guy like me sound even
even more disappea than I'm already
lifting but other than that I mean it's
more than enough for gaming especially
for VoIP and and most of the times those
those audio signals are compressed
anyway to where this isn't going to
sound very
much different compared to how even a
high-end headphones or high-end
microphone would sound once it's been
compressed and sent over VoIP but if
you're going to do something like direct
recording like I am now or trying to use
them for like I said a gaming commentary
or something
there's better options out there for for
gaming mics well as you saw uh are kind
of big to wear around your neck by the
way as you saw bait or these as we try
to tell you they sound really good when
you're gaming the surround
although simulated is pretty realistic
oh yeah you you said you didn't have any
problems of telling where the back or
front well it's tricky for the back left
and right it's easy to tell it yeah
because left and rights just stereo but
that's always the hard part for headsets
that don't have a true you know 5.1 or
7.1 speaker system in there
where would have a bunch of speakers
placed forward or backwards of your main
part of your ear to actually give you a
physical surround but this doesn't have
that so it relies on software
interpolation or interpretation or
whatever the right word would be to
simulate forward and rear and so it's
harder to do that especially when the
driver is right over your main canal of
your ear your ear canal I definitely
wouldn't recommend this microphone for
voice overs or commentaries or youtubers
or heck even live streamers as far as
I'm concerned if you're just playing
games and using built-in VoIP or Skype
or stuff like that then it's more than
good enough but it does have a very AM
radio sound to it airline pilot think
like a airline pilot talking in making
our panel to such an and two or three
California hearsay and we're gonna ask
now that you could have on a seatbelt
Santa so stay in your seat around and
we'll go ahead and cut through and we
pick up trash will be picking a weight
Ontario the weather is currently 79 and
winds are out of the East at 10 pastoral
but again thanks for thanks a question
okay judge plate anyway I'm comfort wise
they're good they're not the best when
it comes to sound isolation quite a bit
of sound does come in it's I mean I've
had some headsets that having those the
blue the blue headsets right they're
actually these guy this guy right here
when this is on you don't hear crap I
mean look at the size of the cushions on
that and they're also really heavy but
we'll talk more about that later that's
I actual audio heads headphones not a
gaming headset so obviously the quality
there is gonna be a little different
but again to me the padding is that the
fabric is not very comfortable but
that's subjective I just I like
leatherette or leather or moraga hide or
whatever I just even suede I just don't
like this type of fabric and I'm going
to ask you now to tell us what you think
since that's why I have him here because
more than one opinion gives a little bit
of validity or basically says J you're
full of just shut up you've always
wanted tell me too haven't you
maybe my first impression of them was
that they're they're actually a sleek
design the yellow caught me off guard
just because I was expecting so much
yellow it's very Linus Lambeau or skunk
works I could go both ways
oh I like them a lot the super light the
fabric for me I liked unlike J because I
know I just don't
the leather sometimes when it gets
really hot and why when I play it just
starts a steak which is kind of gross
well you need to take more showers I do
take showers of more showers that's like
for a day didn't take four or five a day
if that's what it takes we don't you
know all that stanky leg there's no
water here Touche Touche guys do your
part yeah how about this if you were
walking through the store and you demoed
this would you buy them I probably would
not buy them I probably think that black
ones out of black ones yeah yeah well
they sent us a special edition once
because you know they kind of want to
show their special editions though
yellow is the official color of the
courser gaming line so that's why they
sent us the special edition ones well
let me ask you this if I gave you those
would you take them yeah okay well you
can have them because I don't want oh
well like I said they don't have the
right kind of ear cuffs for me the
microphone quality is not good enough
for what I do and I don't want yellow
you just paint it
yeah I don't up the paint hold up very
good though although pea paint this and
you eff it up it's still all on you yeah
anyway you can have them Thanks see we
don't say we don't do giveaways on this
channel it's race
what do you want to say before you die
here don't go play games you can play
games I wish I could please I forgot
what it's like to play games
alright guys we're gonna get out of here
Koga monk is gonna go play games and I'm
gonna probably go scratch my butt or
something
so girls alright guys we'll see maybe
that's how maybe that's half that orange
still tell me we'd like to take this
moment to talk to you guys all ashamed
Ruff's is Gor a Gallinas one wipe
Charlies two because they'd want to
clean heinous as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
