we're gonna start the stream I always
start coughing anybody else knows that
sake hey guys we're so maybe the same
kind of ketchup buffer a little bit and
yeah so a couple of announcements yes
I'm well aware that Nvidia has dropped
the GPP just goes to show what the power
of pressure can do in terms of companies
that make bad decisions second of all
yes I am doing a giveaway of a computer
and that wasn't part of last night's
video but I didn't put anywhere in like
the title or anything that it was a
giveaway it was only that was kind of
for those people that actually watched
the video and stayed to the very end
that got surprised with a giveaway so if
you guys have not watching this today's
video goes to video then you totally
missed out so yeah there's that what I
kind of want to start with oh and if you
guys want to link that videos in the
description of this video too but what I
want to do right now is I want to see in
free build if I can build the computer
that I built yesterday and just for the
heck of it and then we'll go back and
continue the career mode which is a lot
of fun I've not actually played this
game in about a month so one of the
reasons why I am live-streaming it and
stuff is because there's been some
changes they've like added SLI and a
bunch of other little things they do
have open loop and close loop water loop
additions coming later on I think I
don't know exactly when but that'll be
fun when we can start doing custom water
tubes and our water bends and and
whatnot of course I will be scrutinizing
its accuracy when they do that and I
forgot to tweet out that I'm actually
alive so let's see here we are live I
say something stupid right come inside
or I'll wish everyone to me happy May
4th everyone a may the fourth be with
you that's it
because I hate this metaphor to be with
you crap and it fourth the peso with it
serious I'll do it so I was also gonna
try and find some Becker music that good
streams III don't like streaming when
it's just me without background music
but then again I figured a lot of you
might be listening to your own music so
I don't want to step on top of your
listening preferences goes you know
music there's no way for me to put music
up there that everyone likes so we'll
just leave it like this we've already
got a thousand people in here not bad at
all alright let's get started here with
some PC building simulator so we need a
case don't we we do need
I got an Inc I gotta get a case dude
dude we need a case and we need a s340
and white do then have an s3 forty in
white that would be my luck wouldn't it
there we go
BAM so this was the chassis we used
which was an amazing chassis for 50 54
bucks I don't think you're gonna find a
better chassis for 50 dollar range than
the s3 forty simply because it's a black
interior it's got you know separation of
the PSU you're not gonna see your cables
and stuff yeah we could have saved a
little bit of money obviously by going
with a different case but I thought that
that was a sacrifice that wasn't really
worth making if you ask me also do this
shows a black fan side note in real life
the black and white version of the s340
has a black and white fan in the top in
the rear no front fans so that's
disappointing but oh yeah we need a
motherboard for the build yesterday we
used the be 350 tomahawk where is it I
know it's in this game because I've used
it before
where are you Oh Fitz this PC Oh if it's
not letting the tomahawk in no that's
gonna be a problem
because it does indeed fit in real life
I thought we had a tomahawk in this
build I guess I doesn't have to be the
exact same PC motherboard
well yeah I'm really cursed I could have
swore well the roof is making noises I
could have sworn that there was a
tomahawk in this game but if I'm wrong
then we'll go with something a little
bit more basic also why is it only
showing me there we go
dang I could have swore it had more
options for Rison in here I'm assuming
he's been prevailed yes I'm at rebuild
right now I'm just trying to kind of
sort of recreate the build that I did
and yesterday's video so what level are
you I'm level 11 and still don't got
enough money mostly because I'm him
target 3 d score
I think I'm level 10 I think level yeah
I know I'm level tens I have the extra
work benches and stuff I don't have a
lot of I think I'd like 11 or $12,000
something that this game is truly more
about money management than it is about
building computers if you know the truth
in my opinion anyway let's see how about
this x3 70s heat games up there what the
white all of that looks cool B 350 I
can't be the only be 350 people where
they have in here maybe I just haven't
gone far enough
picked them her Tony bill Jay I do love
the generic more Tony stuff that's in
here then I guess we'll go with the
gaming 5 because that at least is white
and sort of and I don't want to do an
intel build cuz it's not an Intel build
in real life so I guess we'll go with
this one it'll match the white theme
obviously right we need a CPU and we
need a 1700
I am that yeah make sure we have a
little flap and we gotta close it and
don't forget our thermal paste you know
what happens when we do that don't we
and then cooling do they even have the
Wraiths cooler in here I don't think
they do the cryo rate c7 is gonna be
sort of the closer match because the
Wraith cooler in real life has the play
Camaro simulator I require the mullet
necessary for Camaro simulator the
cravaack c1 we'll just do the c7 I guess
see already it's impossible to build a
perfect match because it doesn't have
the motherboard or the cooler I think
it's really weird to me though that it
doesn't mean that they don't have the
right in color
oh the cables automatic I forgot have it
what am i doing hey I still think the
controls in this game are a little weird
for another truth if you're with me on
that no I think the controls are still
very strange okay so I'm Mike we plugged
in let's do some case fans on here we've
got to go with RGB of course actually
I'm only choosing these cuz leader or
not this looks similar to how it does in
real life cuz it's the black fan with
the white fins on the build we did
yesterday I'm also not sure if they even
have the same GPU that we used I don't
think they do so a 1070 TI that titanium
might be the closest in terms of
aesthetics can you tell MSI really
funded this game I think I think the
developers got their money at at MSI
holy it's like a bajillion MSI
cards and then like a couple of EVGA
cards and stuff
yeah okay so we can't make a perfect
match obviously so we'll stick in that
titanium card only because it's close
enough I guess oops
mmm Oh memory too so I went with some
pretty basic memory in this bill because
I in the in the real build I went with
the ballistics from crucial because it
was the cheapest but a DFL motivator the
Shaun Titan XL 8 gigabytes that's that's
really funny I guess we'll do the 2 4
gigabyte sticks if that's what we did in
real life
that one there we go and then graphics
card like that did to you I mean look at
this they have like every iteration of
the msi card like all the other side
gaming cards Emma so Messiah Misamis
Imus Imus Imus I was high and then Aris
are gigabyte and then like a couple EVGA
s and then just all of the chaton
geforce gtx 970 using like a vega 56
innovative 64 but remember guys they're
dealing with licensing right i mean this
stuff has to be licensed so yeah they
can't just throw in anything they want
is it said that this game doesn't
support overclocked overlocking what's
over locking no seriously the
overclocking is coming they say so yeah
well since i can't make a perfect match
to the one i did in real life I might as
well at least just go all out on this
one what do you think we should do oh
come on a white PSU but I kind of want
to throw to graphics cards in here now
so now I need the big boy I need speed
like the supernova 1,000 likes wasn't
here last time so obviously EVGA has
gotten on board with some of the PSU
stuff or maybe I just had my mock date
yeah I don't know don't know yeah we're
gonna go ahead and just go SLI because
Yolo
yo lo now we need more cooling obviously
so we'll go with some more of these
Corsair V there we go let's go looking
to intake to exhaust it's fairly
balanced airflow might as well take the
cryo rig off now go with a big cooler
because why not I was hoping to see some
like not to us stuff in here but not yet
I guess you get the raging tech the cry
rig the m9 a and then some of the more
Arctic freezer stuff so I guess we'll go
with the I guess one of the big ones not
showing up because of the height
restriction huh h5 universal cravaack h7
won't go with the quad alumina because
it's RGB there we go
not a bad looking build I you say so
myself did you guys catch a video we did
where we actually animated like the
cables and stuff plugging in and how we
did it very easy build simulator like
all your fans are in take a good point
everything is intake I can't rotate on
though it's like not something you can
do so I guess that's a bug on their end
front filter front panel there we go and
then we need obviously storage we got no
storage we need lots of room for our
adult activities so we'll put in 8
terabytes of storage for all of our
extracurricular activities and then
we'll just guess haven't got any
name-brand SSDs onboard yet have they
and 250 is still the biggest you get oh
that's hideous
when I do I didn't do that there so yeah
I guess that's a fully outfitted s340
right there isn't it
I do believe we would probably be
cooking this piece yeah that's probably
not the greatest cooling solution given
the amount of hardware in here 2 7 8 10
70s our tests ovt is to intake fans to
more intake fans on the top because you
know and that's what it looks like bad
the cool thing about this game slash
simulator those you can kind of get a a
fairly good idea of what Sim will look
like when it's done and there's all the
LEDs obviously and I guess we need to do
an OS don't we there we go
that boot time though we're
bootstrapping and formatting and
installing core libraries installing
drivers installing marketing IDs oh it's
Microsoft that's right
writing boot sector booting would it be
nice OS has actually installed that past
that would be pretty cool they had more
music in here yet Alex no there are no
AIO is yet they will be doing yeah hey
Jay you're missing the 500 gigabyte SSD
yeah I suspect there's a lot of parts I
have not unlocked yet obviously so I
need to continue my career so we'll do
that yeah the music is terrible but oh
well
okay career mode no one exit the game
main menu career continued there we go
so we're gonna leave off I don't even
remember what work job jobs I was
working on yes oh so I'm level nine I've
got eleven thousand dollars it's not
terrible it's not bad wish my guy would
walk faster though it's okay though this
guy wants a bus a bespoke PC build that
can do 3513 fire strike score for $1400
no oh this guy already started his work
didn't I can I trust you to build me a
decent computer do you think you can get
dead stick bush flight simulator
recommended spec running you've got to
get it done entirely by 322 that's nine
days Barbara you are extremely demanding
Barbara but you've got a lot of money so
we'll do your build this is a can you
fix my PC diagnose and fix
I love these emails man they sound so
accurate compared to how things really
go in real life like the emails and
stuff that we get my PC is broken
whatever is broken you'll need to have a
look at to work out what's happened when
I hit the power I smell burning how much
one on the horn chief of the CPUs just
expired so it's probably that lol in
transit and that one's also in chimes
okay so I was already accepting all
before I do that I might as well at
least start her build because we have to
build her a computer so anyway no words
I have what do I currently have on hand
I have a 960 a 750 a 280 and 980ti so
that'll get the job done in terms of
graphics for her 1970s yeah we're in a
pretty good spot because I have a lot of
parts I would need to build her system I
don't need a broken CPU what happened to
buy anything so about a z170 and a 6700
K holy hell I could probably build her
computer and this is all the RAM I could
probably build this computer without
even having to I'll have to buy as a
power supply yeah all right so I just a
buy a power supply that'll work so we
probably get away like a 500 watt oh
it's a 980 I we better get like a 600
watt just to be safe and then I'll just
go ahead and next day that because I got
to buy anything else to put together her
computer and I know that it's gonna be
able to do the specs my work so that's
that's a trick not a trick that's just
business
a lot of people went with this game will
Oh case yeah you're right there's a lot
of people with this game that will just
take the parts that they get if it's a
replace apart or upgraded part they'll
just sell it and take the cash sell it
to cash but you get such little amounts
for it that you'll find that the parts
that you get off of these these upgrade
builds are more than enough to be able
to get you through like the next work
that you need to do so that helps and
yeah I do need a case but I got nine
days to do her computer so I got plenty
of time we'll do this because I'm
probably not to order parts anyway to
fix these so I'll just do it then PC can
boot to OS diagnose fix obviously these
are both
diagnosed species is it irony that they
have the same case different color
common factor here oh yeah letters there
okay
diagnose and fix run 3d mark so I guess
we'll do our teardown or we'll just plug
everything in back not I really need to
get the cable upgrades where it just
automatically plugs everything in
because this is so annoying
but I'm cheap and I don't feel like
spending the money a blue screen clock
watchdog timeouts I shut down to prevent
damage to your computer this first thing
around this error screen started
computer to screening as well as steps
blah blah Wow okay so see you bump the
wrong button and now look it unplugged
everything so I gotta plug all of this
back in imagine in real life if you
touched your computer all your plugs
just came flying out that would be
pretty terrible if you ask me
it's like finding the right angle to be
able to take this stuff apart huh
alright so start by checking the CPU and
stuff
so that me 700k in there mm-hmm
only one solution format see check the
CPU grease here's the problem every time
you take the CPU off the thermal paste
is like automatically missing but you
guys are suggesting to try that I get to
do that but that's not what would really
happen in real life you wouldn't
necessarily get a blue screen like that
saying you know your thermal paste isn't
like your thermal paste isn't gonna make
your PC just blue screen and stay there
like that it's gonna thermally shut down
if there's an ends up being a problem
that's okay I think we know already
that's this yeah simple enough
okay like how smart you guys are but in
real life that wouldn't happen it
wouldn't just sit there at a blue screen
on boot-up it would work perfectly fine
until it got too hot and then in my blue
screen and then it might hard lock or
not turn out at all so now I gotta run
through the marcona Oh was there any on
there cool okay we'll let that run now
we'll go to the other one
I'm sad that they fixed that bug where
you could just like kind of tap out and
it would finish the test but I mean I
guess that's fair right I mean you can't
really complain that you have to
actually go through the test
no CPU found okay a lot seems directed
to the point where is my plug it's a
risin why doesn't make all the bad CPU
always Verizon 1600 I guess I'll just
put mine in there which was the one I
was gonna use for the other build so now
I might just go with a different
platform all together oh no way I was
gonna do the z170 on that one wasn't I
yes I was
see and this is why we keep our parts
people is why we don't sell our parts
oops
which one was theirs this one was that
one I did it again click the wrong
button so then it just completely just
undoes everything come on it's so
annoying after I finish this build I
finished this day's work then I will
look at the chat and follow up you guys
see what you guys are saying about Jay
your dome you're so dumb
it works what do you know easy money
free money well it cost me was resources
she's perfectly fine with me I got a
system like the PCs that are going out I
walk all the way by the door PCs that
are coming in I want by this door that
way I'm easily able to keep track of
everything okay so she got a three mark
score or he/she would ever get a forty
to eighty six and what were their specs
that's not showing the high specs of it
that way I can kind of get an idea of
like oh this Hardware will get this
score that way I know when I need in the
future do I guess really run would have
told me right yeah my current specs derp
okay so I have a 7700 K&amp;amp;R X 480 Wow how
do I give me 4200 with an R X 480 you
know you can put a gtx 980 or something
to do the 3d mark test get the score and
then change GPU with 5000 GP and ship it
and it won't reset the score when did
that start any time I changed the part
it always made me redo that part of the
test again that's something I don't
realize
so 480 and a 7700 K would get me a 4200
seems high because I've could there were
some builds I had like a 980 a 980 TI in
there that we're only getting in the
3000 s but whatever I died breasts oh
those are done okay I need to buy a case
I thought I had a case in here though
what case should I go with the most
expensive case in here as a cosmos huh
masterbox s340 a silverstone NZXT what
case you guys think I should use in that
and Barbara's build the only I had to
buy was a case so I mean either way it's
just straight-up profit as rx 580 a good
GPU it's plenty good for its a rise
inside JCCC since 20 have done nothing
but praise rise then the rage in text
case is kind of cool have they fixed the
cosmos yet what was wrong with it
nobody's giving me suggestions on a case
so the most expensive one cheapest one
silverstone NZXT white NZXT h 700 i is
there any 709 here h 440 I don't see any
CH 700 I know that H 440s um s340 black
and red I've done so many s 340 builds
in this I'll do an H for 40 how about
that red black and red will do that and
then
I don't think I need anything else you
know the thing I probably waste the most
money on Oh got to collect I think the
thing I waste the most money on is quite
honestly shipping costs truth rig is
broken sounds like again emails I get
okay could you make some repairs
you'll need to diagnose what's wrong
with it it just crashes randomly
sometimes I get a blue screen sometimes
it just freezes do you think you could
do that all by 3:23 it's nine days 500
bucks I always take the repair jobs my
friend said do you work with computers
could you build me a new PC I saw a PC
build online that benchmarked 41:56 can
you hit that with seventeen hundred and
thirty five bucks so that last one was a
480 and a 7700 K and it hit 4200 I guess
we can try see now I do need to buy more
stuff because I have to do parts for
them don't I let's see what the system
adds up to okay what do I currently have
that's more important right so do I have
a 480 no I don't have a 970 but I don't
recall where they stack up the 480
versus 970 so they put 970 pretty low on
here 480 as ranked pretty high it looks
like there's 570 there's 470 so where's
a 480 why is the 480 not on here
okay
that's weird
anyway the four ad is gonna benchmark
higher than a 970 there's that you have
a 980 I have a 980 TI right here but
that's for a different build fine some
of them how much are four V's really for
ease and bring anything up just by 964
gigabyte and it's super good yes it's
okay because if it gets the job done
they don't super good as far as I'm
concerned 1060 1060 1060 how about this
will do just sending 570 1060
yeah the 480 is not on here but that
last computer bill had a 480 do you know
when the GPU mining is over yep there's
a date I think it's July 14th 2019 all
mining will be over sometimes you get
comments are like these emails to anyway
rx 574 gig all right 578 gig Wow what's
with the youtube link in the description
doesn't work for me
really it doesn't work let me see
I just clicked it and it works just fine
so on your internet your Internet's
broken that's what it is your internet
it's forever broken
um well shoot this is just bugging me
now part so I'm gonna go with on this
fine we'll do a GTX v 7d yeah I guess
haven't unlocked the 480 but I could've
swore I did okay how about 8 gig CPU
processor will go with 7700 6600 7605
so go go 6700 K we need a z170 we'll do
the more Tony mtech memory I think I
have plenty of memory but just in case
we can go super cheap like again with
the more Tony value supreme that's 40
bucks I just can't do that though it's
so ugly I'll pay the extra money for the
better heat spreader I'm like that in
real life - I will straight-up sacrifice
because of the price of or the the looks
of memory so I'll buy two of these we
need storage that is not very important
because yeah well you just go to 500
gigabytes great power supply we will go
with a 500 ish so we're still 550
that'll do it needs a case this is when
it gets the cheap ones right super cheap
case
Wow so the fact that the s340 white on
here is costing 80 bucks and I got it
for 55 at micro Center it wasn't on sale
or anything where is a super cheap cases
in this book all right we'll do a green
case our green one what the hell not and
then we'll go a basic cooler house that
will go with the cry rig m9i
storage okay so we could build the
system for 1,200 and he's paying how
much 1735 and he wants a score of 41 56
you sound bored and tired you okay it's
called me playing a game maybe I should
be super excited and animated all the
time and tell everyone how great and fun
this game that's not me you should know
that by now Jake you can use your own
music with last update yeah but I am
streaming on youtube there's a thing
called copyright Jay please make a video
in good cases for under 100 bucks maybe
we'll do a roundup when does a post
Malone built gonna be done when it's
done it will be done that's when it's
done all right I think we can I think
uh man 4156 you know what I don't I
don't think I want to do that
nope I'm not doing that one where I'm
not convinced this build will be able to
give me that score but I mean what the
hell right I have the parts I know I'll
need the parts at some point so might as
well try it you can use music from your
channel from the channel no copyright
backgrounds like I said you guys can
play your own music if you want music
I don't play music that way you can run
your own that makes sense right
a Saltine my man I told you guys want to
do salty Khan and all we're going to
talk about is how shitty salty Khan is
it's wearing too salty Khan look my
bucks the parts arrived in the other
parts and that's the ends Xth for 40 red
that's the Silverstone ok so we're gonna
do this is the first build that we start
this is Barbara's build right there and
be Bill Barbara Bell BAM that's hers now
let's build this one real quick oh this
is one's supposed to play the dead stick
that recommended specs I'm pretty sure
we're going to exceed the recommended
specs but let's take a look I guess why
the hell not
recommended is it 16 gigs of RAM eight
gigs of VRAM 30 gigabytes of storage an
Intel Core i7 7700 K and a gtx 1070 so
let's see what happens because I don't
even like I don't even have those parts
yet like those parts are not even
unlocked yet for me right there's no I
don't have a 10 and a 10 series unlocked
other than 1060 so let's just see what
happens
J real questions cravaack c7 per Corsair
or coarser H 550 on i7 4790 the age 50
doesn't have very much thermal capacity
I just probably take the cry Ric c7 for
simplicity hey J try to scan the client
sometimes you can put it in high-end
graphics cards around the bench yet so
one already said that but every time I I
took the card out and swapped it and
made me run the bench again let's see
8600 K or 2600 K that's a silly question
8600 k all day long 980 and sli there's
no cost effectiveness in doing that in
this game my pc can't even run itself
salty con is salty yeah sure is
k motherboards mtech on this one
it's probably not gonna work because my
god I really need to get the upgrade so
it just automatically installed
everything itself this is annoying
imagine you do that in real life right
you just you just have an upgrade to
where it will install everything on its
own for you
I can real-life you to go here's my
parts and then they just all go by
themselves that would be amazing
this PC is not gonna it's not gonna pass
these requirements
so I'll just least see where we end up
because then at least then I can use it
for the future right
wait you just need to be like
daisy-chained
that's weird
what is this
it's really strange oh no oh that okay
that's what it was I was like why is it
plugging all this into the motherboard
right there I just remembered it has its
thing on the back okay uh graphics cards
980ti
in real life is equivalent to a 1070 so
you would think this would be good
enough yeah
Harris supply was like why do I have not
the power supply but that's why I've
installed it yet I'm not sure I
understand the reason why companies have
started going with the bracket that you
attach to the power supply that you then
screw into the case well I guess it
makes sense because then you can slide
it into the back okay there's that
because I've noticed a lot of companies
we're just doing that now I've always
kind of wondered it made that much of a
difference but I guess it does it makes
it easier to slide it out of the case do
all your cable management like plug
everything in and then slide it in the
case does that make sense all I had to
do was use critical thinking it's okay
though critical thinking sounds
dangerous cuz it's critical
we don't like to do dangerous things
around here we have liability insurance
for that
alright splode all this crap in make
sure it's plugged into a USB 2.0 for
maximum back compatibility because some
peripherals you know don't like USB 2.0
and then we need our storage we'll put
our 120 gig in there there we go
plug in our SATA power and SATA
connector there there now turns on so
that's a good time what am i doing I'm
just mashing buttons okay install jaysis
is what headphones are you using also is
that an 8020 20 if so what USB interface
is using these are audio technica m50x
--is really good studio monitor and then
this is not at 20:20 it's a 2035 and it
is plugged into análisis USB multi mix
super cheap like $40.00 mixer that i've
been using now for like four years it's
never end it's never died so oh no ram
huh okay well yeah there's that Ram is
important mmmmmm I need 16 gigs right
it's 2400 that's 2400 let's do it
I don't see why computers need
I don't see why computers need memory
memory is totally overrated
absolutely overrated and the only thing
really lighting up in our case now is
the logos and the RAM so over dude a
little overdone I also make some money
off this diagnose and fix
it's another NZXT case jeez it's like
it's like the BLB headquarters that's
what this is opinions on liquid metal
corrosive that's my opinion
Jas side better my 7800 X or my friend
7700 K for gaming editing and working I
would say the 7800 X if you're running
quad channel memory it's a little bit of
an improvement but that's install will
it run I doubt it's gonna work but hey
if not I'm taking all the parts back and
I'm trashing her build trashing her
you're a little sticky note best cooling
solution for 49 30 K a good one
look at that it wants more vram yeah
it's being very specific it's being very
specific on it has to be this GPU like
not something equivalent so alright
sorry Barbara I am taking back all of my
parts oh god it's gonna take a while
give me my parts because this game is
dumb in the sense that it doesn't care
about equivalent hardware it's like it
has to be this specific could you
imagine that if game developers like the
game wouldn't load or work because
you're not running a specific piece of
hardware then ethics really gets called
into question because then companies
like Nvidia or AMD let's just say Nvidia
probably would then demand that or pay
money to these manufacturers to demand
that this but their Hardware be what's
minimum respect you know oh you want to
play god of war you gotta have a 980ti
or better I mean that would that would
really call in a lot of question how did
you pay for the rise in CPU and that
money I paid for it with money I mean
why not understanding the question
properly
okay give me my power supply because I
can't even fulfill
I cannot even fulfill this build because
I don't have the proper parts oh Jesus
you Kimmy I think once you attach a
sticky note to it yep
once you attach a sticky note to it like
I don't think you can undo it can you
like it's always gonna be her case now
she engine the game is there there's
there a way for me to like no longer
have this build be hers yeah see I like
I don't I don't want this case to
forever be like hers now there's no way
to take that off Jay do a vid a power VR
graphics card the first loser in the
graphics card battle I don't get it but
okay cancel the job from the computer
good call
let's see what happens here no quit okay
so now is it mine
yeah you are brilliant you're brilliant
she got the bad news okay that's the
diagnosing fix
that's a build a computer that can do a
41:56 the one I just built probably
would have gotten the job done for that
score so let's do that and then we can
go ahead and take replace see if you
replace hard drive complete by the end
of the day okay so now we'll do this
and there we go so I'll put it all back
together again which is really kind of
dumb because I could have just put it in
the cabinet that way huh um will do the
mtech and I guess we'll see 9 HDI is is
a little bit stronger than a 480 quite a
bit actually in real life it is but who
knows how realistic their standings are
6700 K isn't enough well the games
demanded a 7700 K and that's what
started a little discussion there about
you know what if companies were able to
demand that you can't play our game
unless you're running this exact
hardware or greater like they're
recommended right you can you can of
course try and play a game with the
wrong not wrong but underpowered specs
just you're gonna have a very shitty
gaming experience
but what if manufacturers were able to
actually say no you have to be running
this exact set up or better you know
then what that just brings so many
ethics into question cuz then like I was
saying companies like Nvidia would for
sure they would for sure pay money to
the developers to be like nope you've
got to have a 1070 or better like you
know that's gonna happen absolutely a
hundred percent I tried a 578 keep my
980ti there's a 480 did it
by 50-watt would be plenty
oh yeah I would screw it down to the
little thingy there to doing those look
like zinc screws alright last we got you
here storage yes storage
I plug in all the wires
so how are you guys doing today it takes
a special group of people like myself to
want to play a game about building
computers on a computer or to watch a
guy building computers on a computer who
makes his living building computers in
making videos about building computers
it's like a weird just a weird paradox
hey Jade you here the Nvidia is ended
the GPP Oh Matthew I'm gonna strangle
you nope didn't hear tell me about it
tell me all about it I have not heard
about it tell me everything
J I accessed the game files and found a
Quad SLI bridge and water cooling
components well I know you
you might be thinking you're you're the
detective but they've admitted they have
openly shown the road map of what's
coming and Quad SLI and custom water
cooling parts is right there on their
website so it's it's not really all that
surprising no II don't really run I want
3d mark
thank you John even Brad specific ultra
graphics settings only available on ROG
GPUs yeah I mean that would start a
whole new business model unlock ultra
settings by installing an nvidia gtx
1070 or greater like a settings are tied
to the GPU so unless you're running a
certain GPU the settings don't even like
available well Joe if you couldn't even
run them why would you even want to well
you know there's people that like to
take screenshots and do stuff like that
so you could crank up the settings and
take an amazing screenshot super sharp
super tack doesn't mean you're playing
it at that resolution yeah I could think
of all kinds of reasons why I would want
to do that
all right fingers crossed on the score
on that one I'm going to meanwhile try
to fix it this one this is the one that
he said like blue screens and does all
kinds of weird stuff it shuts off this
one I ended up being a thermal paste
issue to error no CPU found okay well I
think we just found our could you does
anybody else realize the irony of it
giving us a video signal to say no CPU
found I mean you're not getting a video
display if the CPU isn't working so
that's a bummer in terms of realism
every time it does that no CPU found no
memory found it's like what come on guys
you could have think you could have
figured out a more creative way to do
that what CPUs is this bad a core i3
6100 I'm not putting a 6700 K in there
hell no we need a 6000 series
you call them W's there we go we need to
filter keep like ya know this guy like
Derek Adair Peter Pan 6100 t I could put
a Pentium in there a seller on to put a
seller on in there never notice they'd
never notice do it
seller on before I buy it let's see how
we score it over here three thousand
eight hundred and eighty-one bullpucky
that is straight up bull bull scheisse
okay let's let's see what happens we put
in the 980ti a 480 was able to give a
4200 house a 570 not gonna even give me
a 4,000 that's just straight-up bull
Puckey stupid game alright see how much
the score comes up with this I feel like
this game puts a heavy emphasis on CPU
performance in 3dmark anyone here that's
ever played around 3d mark knows that
it's heavily GPU biased obviously yes
the CPU does affect the combined score
but not as much as like a big GPU would
okay now while this test is running I'm
waiting I can chat with you guys so I
need help before I blow my system
850-watt psu enough for two 1080s in SLI
you are on the low side there sir
you are also not upgrading the bios
without a cpu rend that well you can
with asus bios flashback actually you
can upgrade bios on an asus motherboard
more recent boards with aces with BIOS
flash back without ram or a cpu
installed good Navin J good and dog J
would you consider a video about
balancing a your CPU and GPU at various
budgets for the best cost to performance
I'm not sure if that really means to be
honest you can use the rise in 1616
hundred or better to beat a seventy
seven hundred K jday Nvidia is
responding to the backlash and the
program accordions our blog yep I read
the blog everyone's read the blog it's
not news of course there are K 70 or
HyperX alloy elite I've not used a hyper
X alloy so I don't know but it's
probably all gonna feel like a cherry
switch in the end can you please make an
asus or a sink and bios install tutorial
please I am too dumb mmm doesn't sound
like a very entertaining video I saw you
at Camaro Canberra it was fun as hell
did not say hi though I should have said
hi that's why we were there my friend
wanted me to ask if SLI 1080p is
pointless at this very moment
depends on what resolution you're
running I mean you know you can do 144
Hertz 4k panels now so you're gonna need
it for that oh look at that we just like
smash that score 47 65 so yeah okay cool
no this guy is done I can get paid time
to get paid
so if you guys saw that video where we
we were fixing my friend's computer and
we played it we pretended like it was PC
builds simulator like we even did a
little outline around the PC components
and plugged in the cables and stuff when
I walked away and all the cables just
unplugged from the computer we were
making fun of this see how everything
fell out so that's what we're making fun
of all right so that's cool and you guys
will see it we got here won't we
and then yeah so we can get paid from
Tim can't we oh I guess it it probably
helps if I actually assign the build to
it so I'm gonna have to run it again
aren't I I really need that third
workbench no house cooking a monkey have
you talked recently we talk all the time
in spec we're supposed to go get Korean
barbeque time why do people think that
suddenly he and I aren't friends anymore
I don't know what what what kind of
relationships you guys had but man they
must suck if you think that the
relationships are based upon work yeah
and I don't envy that concept to be
quite honest oh okay let's do this maybe
if I put this in here and I put this
here and then I take this and put it
here there we go now I got to run it
again of course we know it hits the
score that sucks
so I've gotta order the CPU for this guy
the repair while this runs its test
again watch would be a different score
now even though it's the same computer
okay so now I got away again J why
didn't you go to LS fest because it was
all the way in Vegas and I've got this
thing called work and family and stuff
to do lots of us have working
relationships and not much time for
anything else
fair enough but working relationships is
if they're all your relationships are
based on working relationships then I am
sorry you got to click the computer
itself to assign the build assignments
you already built yeah I already did it
J capacitor fell off my motherboard do
you think it would be safe to use it or
should I buy a new mobile well you can
try resolder
the capacitor but I think the capacitor
is very needed components
it's obviously balancing out power to
something so yeah I told you at the
beginning to put the sticky note you
know Chris you were right all along
buddy how do you like the new Lee and
Lee case I don't know which one you're
talking about they should really is a
tech tuber simulator as a DLC for this
maybe or maybe maybe they're already
working on that mm-hmm hey JD ever trek
or drive a new lease I can't fit in a
Lotus are you kidding oh man do more
live stream I'm live streaming now
doesn't that count as do more live
stream I would have thought why he don't
buy the tools like Auto connected thick
cables why he don't do things that
people do tell him to do because I'm
saving my money dirt dirt dirt dirt
okay leave by door go get paid again
Lilian lead to Bauer case I haven't seen
it I don't think I've seen it I like to
Bauer though he's cool I've met him a
few times
let's get paid J turbo the Z no I'm not
turning the Z don't be dumb
okay need repairs replace CPU already
that one oh now we've unlocked the 1060
gaming VR VR changes everything
hmm it's time for me to upgrade my PC I
need this PC to hit at least 2017
benchmarks do you think you'd do all
that by 319 that's four days you can try
kinds of the parts we already have I
guess um actually this case doesn't even
need to be here this was the one I
bought for that bill better he just gave
the guy so I might as well hang on to
this now is a staircase shout out please
no David Rodriguez I will not shout you
out I cannot be summoned David Rodriguez
air will end this day good work you know
I feel like this is an accurate
representation of my life because
there's nothing that's in between
leaving work and coming back to work I
left work and I was immediately expected
to return to work this game is my life
okay and I'm Rebecca twerk let's do this
this is a fixed computer oh I forgot to
buy that CPU or oops I am either way I
guess it is now I'm probably I need to
buy more parts I'm gonna need more parts
okay this one is a replaced CPU replace
hard drive red parts an orange case for
me absolute blast me everything is
expected to be completely themed
color-coordinated we have a G 4600 I
should just just jam there we go ooh
that I put a G 3950 in this place
because you know backwards-compatibility
I guess
do-do-do-do-do yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna
go ahead and fix this for him but a
white one in here okay that looks even
worse doesn't it dude mm-hmm that's what
what the red one back in there at least
it matches the GPU right I mean there is
that um replace the hard drive okay fine
this guy knows everything sprawl on his
computer why can he do it himself
I have this philosophy if the person
knows enough about the computer to know
what's wrong with it they know enough
about it to fix it and I'm all about
people fixing their own stuff you know
so that's kind of what I based my
channel on every now and then I get
these comments it's like gee nothing you
do is that hard anybody can do it it's
like yeah that's kind of the point of my
channel I'd try and teach people like
you can do this so thank you for
validating my entire purpose you're
trying to burn me but then all you did
was validate me that's cool
okay so it's going knock up our cables I
think I'm definitely gonna buy the cable
speed thing upgrade before the next
workbench because yes because we are
done hashtag Jesu tickle I thought that
my wife made me that shirt because I
have the oh well I think I have the only
one existence I think I should I think
Nick might have one too I think she made
him one I also have one that says but I
digress
my wife maybe those though because yeah
we are working on some new shirt designs
though cuz the one I have is gonna be
discontinued so if you haven't currently
bought the design that we have now and
you guys like it then you know what you
gotta do otherwise this way for the new
one well the mechanic could tell you the
same if you go and say you blew up the
engine let me okay me let me put this
out there then if you take the computer
to somebody who told you what's wrong
with it why didn't you just have them
fix it
why'd you take it back from that person
and take it to someone else to tell them
what's wrong with it to fix it
I can I can have this argument all day
long this is my life you can't I don't
think you can win this argument so this
guy needs an upgrade he wants to hit
2070
what are we hitting now let's see to be
like potato PC
yo J shout-out to my wife Melissa sup
Melissa your husband or boyfriend or I
guess husband right wife wants me to say
hi to you so hi again haha
you just got to wonder what that means
Tony let's see will it run there we go
the Duke says because he or she is lazy
and it'll pay to save them a hassle if
you're going the lazy route you're still
wrong because they already took it to
one person to get it diagnosed they then
with you the work to take it or send it
to someone else to fix it if they were
truly lazy they just would have left it
where it was and had them fix it rather
than having to do more work to get it
fixed by someone else so the lazy
argument doesn't hold up either we have
currently got in here 8 gigabytes of RAM
2 gigabytes of vram it's a 79 all we
need is a GPU it's a 950 in there I
don't even need to test it we just need
a bigger GPU and I have one of those I
got a GPU a few of them and some in the
game and we're about to offload some
GPUs though we have too many new gen
stuff we need to make room for that when
it's time to go so yeah but I'm not
gonna be selling them online or you know
any of that so sorry guys let's try 970
the little baby a little bitty Shawn
gamer version
that should be good enough this guy
still needs a CPU in there doesn't he
not buddies it's a seminary okay
like I said just gonna order this now
screw it
it's gotta wait for this end now J you
have lots of GPU on shelf just grab one
off the shelf yeah I know right J do I
need these two plastic tabs that were
next to my CPU on my mobo I took them
off why should I keep them for
installing certain types of coolers down
the road I'm going to assume you're
talking about AMD hang on to them we
we've lost most of ours that we've taken
off and then there's some times we need
them back on so yeah keep them hang on
to them J would you recommend getting a
C 700 P or the 1/2 X I currently use
well the C 700p I've got one are here at
the Cosmo 700 amazing case not cheap but
that curved tempered glass and all that
it's a beautiful case it's gonna look
way better than 1/2 X obviously J will
you ever do a mini ITX build in the sky
reach s4 mini I know that sounds very
specific oh my god it's like you're
right here like lol feels weird I don't
I don't get it what did I do
do you have too many Rison 7 16
gigabytes of RAM and 7 750 watt power
supply I do it but you know what's funny
is um for the longest time people pegged
me and was just like you're such a fit
you're such a intel fanboy into a fanboy
blah blah blah and I'm gonna try a
lesser power supply so you can hit that
score
you know fanboy fanboy now people tell
me I'm just an AMD fanboy and if they
haven't been able to notice I followed
the value the value is where is where I
follow and so wherever that is is where
I'm always going to recommend we have
way more rise in CPUs in the studio than
I have Intel see
use and because AMD is actually giving
like a lot of review samples to do
builds and stuff with and I'm I am
really enjoying what Rison brings to the
table Irish my 8400 worked though
if you guys recall my 8400 we tried to
use in my daughter's build was bad did
not work and I think that would've been
a great budget CPU but it didn't work so
best mobo for Rison well you have to you
have to be a little bit more specific
now because now we have X 470 and X 370
so if you're talking original Rison be
350 might be the best board for you if
you don't need all the x3 70 features
you're such a value fanboy yep there's
that just tell them you're a tech fanboy
I do but that doesn't hold water because
they're just they're just complaining
fanboys like their families about
complaining you know do you have a key
wire block has aluminum blocks without
getting the fluid kits they told me they
were gonna be selling them in like
individually but I think they're all in
kits right now I found a bug that they
now patched I had eight hundred and
seventy-five thousand dollars by buying
and selling used rides and CPUs on PC
Bay and reselling them it was awesome
okay did they take your money away too
how do I really feel about the i-9
seventy nine hundred X that would that
would mean that you're indicating I
didn't give my real feelings about the
CPU which at which point I take great
offense to that my D frame bill has a 70
100 X in it and it gets the job done it
doesn't feel any faster or any different
than my 69 50 X it shouldn't it's a
forty PCIe Lane uh yeah it's like five
point short it's a ten core sixteen
thread CPU I mean what do we expect
oh that we did it I didn't even have to
give them a good a good GPU okay so I
guess I don't understand what the point
of your question is
it's ten core twenty thread CPU that
definitely gets the job done
doo-doo-doo-doo okay so these are all
done right yep okay bad day
no I just responding with some of the
crazy questions we get cheese come on
guys it's like my real inbox I'm telling
you new bits are available
um Corsair Dominator platinum me already
got those wait you PC wanted he wants to
score 4624 for 1990 rejects now I've got
a hyper four-foot okay they're giving me
like more variations of the same card in
case I already have which is annoying
it's time for my upgrade my PC I'm
hoping you'll be able to benchmark
around 41 58 could you get that done by
321 450 bucks
see here's the thing with this they
might have a good PC that only needs a
GPU and then we can hit it and make very
little profit because 4150 eight score
means we're looking at like 980 in up
territory or they could have a ship PC
and then we lose money because there's
no way that that's enough money to hit
that score so I'm gonna reject it again
that's cuz this is now risk management
Lou this this guy wants to score
five thousand four hundred and eight
with sixteen hundred dollars and he
wants me to build it from scratch get
out of here
this guy wants a score four thousand
three hundred and sixty six with four
hundred forty bucks get out of here
they're gonna keep giving me these these
I need a new computer reckon but at
least this one has has legs alright
fifteen hundred and fifty dollars and it
only wants a score of twenty three
twenty five so we don't need a lot of we
don't need a lot of hardware for that
wait did you fire Nick did you fire Nick
no I did not fire Nick we will accept
that one diagnose and fix we will accept
that one okay so I need parts to a hat
fifteen fifty
I definitely have good enough hearts got
another 970 1550 we don't need this I'm
gonna need a CPU the G through 39 30 I
don't think is gonna be good enough you
try it I got play a memory I do need
more storage okay so
I need storage at least start there
we'll see what happens I'll just buy the
1 terabyte by two of them those have one
on hand we'll do that tomorrow
he is CPUs coming tomorrow ok cool
and the day go to work
story of my life none of them say which
version of 3dmark they want the score is
on I guess I just assume it's fire
scratch look at this this guy spent a
ton on this case he's got this this
crappy of GPU in there alright what is
wrong with this guy's computer
that's it I can't stand it no more
we're buying the upgrades you can't do
this anymore
auto-connect tools $1,000 okay
BAM what else we got here
Auto standoff tubes tools 4,000 and
quick cable tools 3,000 quick screw tool
is mm audio screw all screws screw
themselves automatically it just sounds
so wrong mm okay
tap a screw for it to screw itself J by
the faster screw in the game I am I'm
just laughing at it because it sounds so
funny there I'll just do those two for
now thank you
way that
I thought these are supposed to be like
Otto whatever figure it out later
no CP found as always oops that's me
what we got what's the fuses I hope my
paint table was a mess but I was oh
that's right then
1600 X I got just one now this is where
I like to get a little bit of it become
a little bit of a cheapskate where I
will just straight-up be like I'm
totally gonna put in a 1200 and it
counts you know what I mean
then we're still being on his CP or me
it mows we'll fix that one now get paid
I guess CPU
yeah we go no ma'am
oh wait cuz I put it again if you do it
in the wrong order like that put the
thermal paste put the thermal paste on
before you close a little lid you can't
close the lid which i think is hilarious
cuz it's not like it interferes in any
way whatever that one I'm if that was
the one who came in with or not doesn't
really matter
let's make four thousand six hundred
people watching this right now it's
credit crazy fast me we've got more
people watching me play computer game PC
simulator than we do in tick tock that's
a bit crazy Oh 5,000 pew cheese that
just refreshed it why are so many people
watch me play video game it's cuz y'all
want to be like you don't know what
you're doing do you sir yeah you can't
fool us we all know that Phil Nick do
all the work there we go Oh
okay oh whatever yeah I just skip today
but I didn't want to skip do you plan to
make a $2,000 build and may have 2018
I'm new to pcs and I consider your word
the gospel first of all you should never
consider one person's word gospel second
of all I do not have any plans for doing
a two thousand dollar build this month
I've got too many other things going on
this month already
okay leave by door I left it by the door
I mean I didn't
we'll be waiting for over here CP right
that's what I thought
Jesus LG's emails I I guess I never
bought this did I nope it also helps
when I go and actually collect the money
he once scored 23 25 that's one I have
to build that to diagnose and fix
upgrades for my PC he must be able play
player unknowns battle ground minimum
specs
he's only got 265 bucks no money
replacement board replaced graphics card
for 695 bucks yeah we can do that I'm
sure what the heck not he doesn't I wish
we knew what parts they were like when
we were starting this though you know
what I mean Jay what case would you
recommend for an overkill custom loop
umm do something like case labs or do it
like a murder box or something like that
if your time I'll overkill I'm gonna you
some overkill suggestions well indeed
really man get a life Jay I have no life
that's why I played video games good
work okay
I think being paid to play a video games
a pretty damn good life if I do say so
myself yeah you're the guy here watching
me let's think about that for a second
here
and you're prolly just being sarcastic
and salty like me so in which case you
and I another life would probably be
BFFs
okay
why can't we install our cooler
what am I missing here oh there we go
jiae's to post Malone was post Malone
like water Malone yeah the screws
definitely do move faster now that's
cool okay so this is done
oops now we could take this one which is
a diagnose and fix we're gonna go get
paid for his computer
okay so that's a whiteboard build help
repairs needed replace motherboard
please graphic card Oh guess what I just
got diagnosed and fix for 600 sure so we
can now take this guy's D keynote and
just go like that we can take that case
I had already bought and there we go oh
look at this this guy's got SLI people
one of them bad
yeah one of those are clearly bad so
let's go ahead and see um weird okay
well we know the mother works bad so
there's that so we got to tear it all
down how much was this guy paying again
it's a financial mate oh he better have
a lot of money with the name financial
mate
he's got six hundred and ninety five
bucks we need a we need a motherboard
and a graphics card well let's see we
got here those are four seventy gaming
X's oh I got one
well you know question is which one is
bad right watch be a rising build again
oh it is it's norris board yeah that's
right in there we go so we need a new
motherboard for rise in unplug all this
crap
this game if you haven't played it yet
it's early access technically right now
I think it's still considered early
access it's not a lotta things like 20
bucks 30 bucks on my debt on the servers
you might look at this and go is this
really this is just really pathetic
you're sitting here playing a game about
building computers but yet you get
totally addicted to it because one all
of us have the same thing in common at
this point right we we like to build
computers and watch people build
computers and tinker with them that's
our hobby so a game that lets you just
kind of do this endlessly but sort of
problem-solve at the same time slash be
fiscally riskily smart fuel fiscals are
the right words financially smart
because you can easily just lose money
in this game like for a while there Nick
and I were the same level and I had like
twelve or thirteen thousand dollars and
he had like two thousand dollars and I
basically at that point was just like
there's your contrast between good and
bad buying decisions and that's where
the game I think for me is fun it's
really money management simulator more
than it is PC bones and later how real
is it well considering I can't just
point at a screw in real life and have
it unscrew itself makes it pretty damn
unrealistic in terms of the way the
parts all go together and stuff I mean
yes that's realistic so I don't I don't
know what else you would kind of be
expecting but okay
x3 70 gaining 5 and then I already have
the GPU that we need
oh no wait I have a 579 a 470 okay so I
need to buy a 470 as well
don't die yes yes I do
I mean a 478 and x-37 another board or
even a be 350 whatever so gosh cards for
70 oh this is an 8 year 6g
it's 4G
and what's the difference between these
Oh course b12 1812 42 yes I care about
whether or not they'd match okay this is
a 1218 alright cool so we save a little
bit of money there and then the
motherboard it was just go straight down
to a m4
um fine I will do this one like you
should do it in real life replace it
with the same parts you're taking out
I'm hardly making any money on this once
we factor in shipping because yes I want
it next day five ten I'm only making one
hundred and eighty five dollars on this
okay I guess one hundred and eighty five
dollars for what realistically an hour's
worth of work it's not a problem we need
to start this build too though sir that
yes because I'm at probably buy parts
for this might as well do that
well yeah thing about this Silverstone
case I like the vents on top they look
really cool this kind of reminds me of
some of the earlier like alien weird
designs like back in like the early mid
to to mid 2008 Lee weird designs I'm not
sure how I feel about this Silverstone
case though but that's just me it's all
top mounted stuff to you I just you got
take the top off and see it's like a
inverted it all comes out the top like
that
what CPU would you get for a $500 gaming
PC I used one yeah because it goes
inverted like that all right let's see
what we can build right here
mother bird okay we'll do the z1
what's really stupid is when you have to
change a motherboard in this game it
makes you change the standoffs too even
if it's the same form factor got a sixty
seven hundred KS so overkill that's
ridiculously overkill I'm not gonna do
that no I am gonna put this nine sixty
in there though cuz it might be enough
to get the score we need and the green
matches so I mean shoot why not I mean
if we can build it and it matches okay
why not I don't I don't think there's a
single person here okay there would be a
person here that would disagree with me
just for this they can disagree but I
think most people would agree like if
you can make it all match and still fit
within like your needs why the heck not
right
gosh I don't want to put 16 gigs of RAM
in here though I guess we could try the
more Tony see what happens if I do but I
just do four gigs it's not gonna be
enough I just wanna see like if I can
get rid of that stuff I was already got
it why not just a weird case 100%
disagree but is because you because you
just want to be that guy that's why you
just want to be that guy can't blame you
to be honest I truly cannot blame you
but I wouldn't want to be with me either
all right so we need a cpu for this Oh
lake sky lake with AI v i3 i3 6300 I'll
try that but we only need to hit like
2000 something is it 2325 we can totally
do that with GPU so is that what did i
do i maximized it Add to Cart why do I
have two of those
there we go and you never buy the parts
I needed for that I think I did see
remember I told you guys I said the
thing I waste most money on is shipping
there they are cool because I'll just be
like oh I need this and then I'll go and
I order it and then I'll be like oh I
need this now go and I order it so I'm
like double up doubling up on shipping
which is so non cost-effective but yeah
let's take care of this guy real quick
mm you know this
there we go
okay well with my cursor there we go
6,300 to the rescue
oops I'm trying I just dried a bit
thermal paste on the socket oh we've all
seen those pictures right okay I can't
be the only one let's try to do that in
the game
okay it's arranged is kind of neat I
guess and then I needed storage in here
don't I yes let's put one tire right
screw it it's overkill for what we need
it for but whatever cables should be
plugged in on Matthew right no I guess
not
well
so much for the cable is automatically
plugging themselves in huh
I just keep redoing the SATA over and
over and then the fans like to
daisy-chain
yeah okay turn on my beauty oh look at
that let's go look in the front of it
okay cool
I think everybody rep this up I'm going
for an hour and a half at this Wow the
case wasn't inverted it would be a great
case I get the idea for the inverted
case it's just you know the natural
convection of heat right the rising of
heat
mic muted no no it's not J they plug
themselves in when you press the power
on are you serious of the test that no
question just wanted to say thank you
for all that you do first time you in
life what have been watched Tech Talk
haha thank you sir
oh boy this may not hit the 2,000
whatever that we need but we'll see who
makes that green case where can I get it
is the Silverstone case that can fix
this one while we're waiting can't I go
okay scarred
7d 7d I almost asked why is there no SLI
bridge because you've done this YJ oh it
helps we have a CPU in there huh there's
a little lever hard to see dark need
flashlights in this game the yellow
cooler man whoops and the memory so put
on the first one
and let me go why is it not turning on
now still is it I did all that I
replaced the motherboard I replaced the
graphics card and everything and it
doesn't want to boot up so weird
missing cables oh well there you go see
it doesn't automatically do it like you
said you died you lied to me I thought
we were friends
it's ok I'll remember that one day he'll
ask a question and I'll be like that's
that guy that said that the cables would
automatically just plug themselves in
and then they didn't I remember that
wasn't just GPU cables guys it was all
the cables none of them are plugged in
because I made the mistake of listening
to the to the commenter that said
they'll automatically plug themselves in
when you turn it on right all right so
this was the last one I was gonna do
know about it you want to do I'll build
that scratch PC first that's wood and
then I'm gonna end the stream email oops
there we go
new parts available another h4 forty
case because that's what I was missing
more aged 440 cases we needed a 23 25
when we get 22 4800
come on come on oh I I guess we'll
see if eight gigs of ram brings it up
that little bit I don't think it will
but we'll see this is when overclocking
would be nice because we could have
overclocked our stuff a little bit and
gotten that score so I'm just gonna go
ahead and throw in
let's throw in one of these there we go
so these back here plug in automatically
so this is what he's talking about now
when I hit power they automatically plug
in okay so he's right he's absolutely
right
I just didn't pay the four thousand
dollars have all the other ones plug
themselves in that's a lot of money
would you not let that go now I don't
think the memory is gonna help it that
much whatever Oh randomized overclocking
would be fun would be a fun mechanic
what about your promised custom loop
ghost s1 build they were supposed to
send me a white one or a silver one with
the top hat I need the extra top hat and
they never did another valid reason why
I don't get involved with Kickstarter's
and why I probably won't anymore cuz
here's what happens you get a company
like like Loki and they hit you up in
like November right and then they say
hey J we got this great case blah blah
blah and then they mentioned Kickstarter
or GoFundMe or whatever and I'm just
like nope not interested I don't get
involved with anything that the customer
cannot go out and buy right now that's a
hard no policy of mine and I bent on
that because I saw the pictures and I
was like wow this looks really good so
contact me when you guys get your your
engineering samples of stuff done so
fast forward to like February or
whenever that was I did that June or
January February and I think I did the
actual case review in December I think
it was and that did a little build in
like February or whatever it was and
then I and then they contact me and say
hey J we got this new thing coming out
we'd love for you to talk about and it's
like whoa you never fulfilled the
promise from the first one which was
supposed to get me the actual finished
version which has minor changes to it
the one I have is not the exact
representation of like what's out there
but my video shares how helped help them
meet their demand their their goal of
their hundreds of thousands of dollars
whatever money they collected on there
so there was a there was a huge push in
sale
that they got you know from obviously
exposures through channels like mine and
whoever else willing to talk about them
on the and that was a non-paid thing
obviously there was I don't charge
reviews there was no money that
exchanged tans in any way I just
received their their sample case which
again not a hundred percent indicative
of the the final version J the black
top-hat would look sick on a silver case
yeah probably but there anodizing super
thin so the anodizing was already like
wearing off the case just from hannah
lized and handling it because it's not a
super thick layer of anodizing like it
didn't penetrate very deep into the
metal so we had been asking for the for
the new case so that we could do the
review but point of the case in point is
they didn't keep up there into the
bargain and then they wanted me to now
start pushing and reviewing new products
of theirs so that they can repeat the
cycle of getting their product in front
of a million and a half people and then
keeping or getting all of the the sales
from it and then not fulfilling their
bargain again with me so ya know at that
point I'm just like no more
Kickstarter's if your product is not
done and ready to go to shelves then I
am NOT interested in working with you so
there's that's why you guys haven't seen
that's why you guys haven't seen the the
loke thing and had we do over here 22:35
right number is wrong order
22:35 okay so maybe I'll change the GPU
then I think I'm have a choice Danna
sucks because the green looks so good oh
well who cares so I get it case in point
yeah but I mean you guys got to agree
that's a little up don't you
think a company breaks its promises
because whatever they they just they
don't follow through with and they have
the nerve to ask you to review a new
product of theirs when they haven't
fulfilled the original agreement I think
that's just like no absolutely not come
on
there is so much more that goes on
behind the scenes than most people have
even like a slight clue about so that's
why it's hilarious you'll try and make
their assumptions about why this is this
or that is that it's it's quite comical
but what are you gonna do right there we
go I'll put this back together because
now I know it's gonna it's going to I
know it's gonna pass now
in complete case yeah
I know the little brackets are missing
there we go that's what it was there we
go so now you gotta wait for this to go
again
sup J what's up Matthew any plans to be
a guest on Kyle stack attack series
Kyle's minh asked me to be on I just
don't have I haven't had time to take a
evening to go over there Kyle does a lot
of that crap in the evening I in the
evening do you have family obligations
so yeah I mean I'm usually out of the
studio by about 4 o'clock Tuesdays and
Thursdays or longer days because of Tech
Talk and then Tuesdays I'll be here
pretty late just because I don't have
any obligations in the evening so I'm
able to get more done but when like they
want to do it in the evening and it's
like sorry can't you know family comes
first regardless of being guests on
shows or whatever how do you get to the
IO in that case it doesn't doesn't the
top cover just block it no if you look
in the back right here you can see
there's an opening right there see and
that's how it is in real life so that's
how you get to it hey look at that we
did it
3016 all right leave by door when Zappos
Malone video you guys can go ahead and
ridicule the people asking for post
Malone for me I don't even have the
energy to do it anymore
woah look how dirty this case is holy
hell
looks like Knicks build yeah all right
guys that's where we're going and though
speaking of obligations I got things to
do this afternoon it's Friday looking
forward the weekend
my youngest or my oldest daughter has a
she's sparring today because she does
you know her martial arts stuff so she's
sparring today she has a black belt
training tomorrow and then she has her
black belt test coming up in June so
we're pretty excited for that if you
guys remember when she started not too
long ago she's already progressed and
- now her black belt testing which she
should be finished by November really
excited really proud of her but anyway
guys I'm gonna go thanks for hanging out
for about an hour and 45 minutes because
like this gaming streams then yeah I
appreciate you guys coming and hanging
out so I'm gonna go thanks for watching
and as always I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
