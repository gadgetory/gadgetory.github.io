me to do a follow-up on the view fluid
which we've been trying now for how long
we had this over a month right well over
month I'll do this it's a couple months
once again gin this so we've been
testing it out obviously this was the
first system we put it in right here
check out that video the guys haven't
seen it already it's where I show it for
the first time we're also been running
it back here in the thread Ripper build
and this is the newest build you guys
saw me do the no talking just building
that was actually a giveaway system for
one lucky winner that EVGA had a
competition back on their anniversary
but it's running in there as well but
now we're gonna take apart our blocks
we're gonna see how well this is
actually held up today's video is
sponsored by ez skins if you're like me
and you're harder to your devices will
it be your cell phone your tablet heck
even your console ez skins has got you
covered regardless of your device as a
matter if you're talking about a 1+5
every time an iPhone Samsung and LG but
they also sent me over here an iPhone 8
plus which has a skin pre-applied and I
think Nick's gonna like this one just
check this out
we've got camo that's pretty awesome
actually
so we've got a full covered device right
here the face we've got to do the
obligatory removal the plastic check it
out look at that look at camel skin that
looks pretty awesome you guys want to
keep your device's protective whether it
be an iPhone a Samsung and LG your
PlayStation 4 your Xbox one your tablet
go and check out easy skins you can find
the link in the description below now to
be fair if the color doesn't look as
vibrant as it did before that's because
these tubes and this reservoir and stuff
was stained it was already stained from
the orange fluid we ran back we had the
Mayhem's orange in here it actually
stained the ptg even the acrylic but I'm
not too concerned about that I want to
see what happened with the blocks also
too I wanted to kind of show the new
panels that we've been using on here
because if you remember I also talked
about air flow on this especially for
water-cooled like this when you have a
front rad not a very good case for air
flow and the reason being is it only had
these tiny little vents to blow air out
the top and it came brought an air
through the sides right here on the
front and that's it but obviously these
panels have been modified they have some
mesh on here and they've also obviously
got some cutouts these are from mod
mods you guys had to find a link to
check these out down the description
below they sent these over for us to try
out they definitely helped temperatures
unfortunately the e bulb just it's not
the best when it comes to airflow but
this definitely helps not only that it
gives a really good aesthetic to it too
so yeah the one check them out this is
the part that always gets a little bit
messy and this is why you will always
find drain systems built into my loops
because man it's just why make it harder
on yourself right you know what who
needs all that who needs that nonsense
now one thing I like to do - that way
you don't have your hose flopping all
around as I like to take the tube and
insert it in the little hole right here
and it kind of force it in there you can
hear it doesn't want to go you just
gotta push harder are you okay over
there now it will just go down like that
and you're not gonna have it
pop out on you then we just turn our
valve now it's not gonna get all of the
fluid out right there's still gonna be
some fluid stuck in that radiator and
stuff but what I care about right now is
at least getting it apart enough to get
GPU out and CPU block out kind of sounds
like me after I have tacos let me take a
look at that in a second alright now
it's light okay so we're all torn apart
I'm gonna start with a CPU block here
well I guess it's important to remember
this system has run multiple fluids this
was probably not the most cared for
components to be honest no blasphemous
do as I say not as I do
I am your tech Daddy did man you'd think
I would know better by now than just to
turn a block over what I just took it
out of the system right I just blew
right in there don't you know with my
alcohol good to have your isopropyl
alcohol on hand
like I say this was not the most cared
for and I'm not proud now proud of that
you can live through my mistakes it's
probably a good thing we took the system
apart when we did look at this our block
cracked see that see you stress cracks
that's scary to say the least yeah this
block is done
yes but if you look down here at the
copper though do that because shady that
is remember this one looked like this is
the one that was all like looked like
fiber because there was so much gunk in
it yeah this looks like yeah look at
that
that's like cleaned they're not claiming
that this is going to clean your your
blocks they just made a statement to me
at PDX when they were showing me some
picture is that this is something that
they had experienced where like things
were actually getting cleaned this did
not look like this when I put this
together this shininess of all the micro
fins because of the previous fluids that
were used in here you you can see man if
you if you look in the fittings right
here you can see how it's all like kind
of dried and crusty
that's resident residue from the
previous fluids that was in the block
when I started this and I cleaned it out
as best I could with a razor blade and a
brush but it did not have this shine to
it
unfortunately though unfortunately this
block is done you can still see like
some of the gunk that was in the block
see it all built up around here that's
gross
so the fact that clean the middle is
impressive but yeah sadly this block is
done it's lived its life it's time to go
off to block heaven because of those
cracks now it doesn't go all the way
through I can't feel it with my nail
right here and it's not cracked through
on this side so it's in the middle like
it's in between that make sense if you
look through the side you can actually
see the cracks like the depth of the
cracks so it's in the middle of the
acrylic it doesn't make it to the extent
like to the exterior or interior but
once the cracks start once you start
crack you know it's hard to get off so
so I've heard because it's a clear block
we can kind of see what's going on in
there but you can still see some of that
orange gunk I was talking about in there
these definitely need a deep deep
cleaning or these need to be soaked all
right here we go you ready actually that
doesn't look half bad look the gunk and
stuff I was seeing let me turn this over
this block is still pretty good the gunk
I was seeing is stuck to here like that
so if you look through there you can see
it but if I look I can just let me just
wipe this dry Wow shiny that is all
right I mean I hate to be like oh my god
this this stuff is cleaning your blocks
but I mean obviously the they're not
gonna go out and say this cleans your
stuff but with this this is impressive
in my opinion do you remember this this
block right remember how like tarnished
it started to look how it was changing
color yeah that I've never seen a fluid
actually clean a block before I've only
seen fluids and I'm going back guys I'm
going back a decade I'm going back to
like fluid XP days and an early fessor
and all that stuff I've not seen a fluid
ever actually clean metal before a
cleaned bare copper where to go a clean
bare copper and now it's cleaned nickel
plating I think what we're gonna have to
do honestly is my workstation PC
upstairs will run this one I'd say for
like six months and then tear it apart
and see what it looks like because
that's never seen fluid before so if you
want to talk about the different fluids
that this block has seen and why this is
impressive to me this block right here
this was one of the original cards in
skunk works when I went 3-way Titans in
on the Titan XP or not xp for the Titan
X Maxwell cards this saw mayhem is
pastel this is seen Mayhem's x1 this has
seen Mayhem's x t1 in blue and then this
is now seen the primo chill view and
this is what it looks like it did not
look this good when we first put it in
there in fact you can still see some of
the discoloration if you look in the
corner you get the lighting just right
if you look right here on the edge you
see some of the discoloration you can
see some other discoloration right there
and you can see some of it right there
that is what the whole block looked like
when I first took these apart and then
upgraded with the 1080s
and skunkworks but you can see now where
the main flow is look how shiny that is
how it's actually started to clean right
a little bit discoloration right there
but that's actually not part of the flow
you know flow plane it goes in there and
goes out spreads and goes back
previously when I was using like the
nanofluids the o-rings had a really kind
of a hard crunchy feel to them because
of this again dis
you know whatever that residue is it's
in the fittings would also make its way
to the o-rings but the o-ring now you
can look at it looks hydrated right you
can still see a little bit of the
remnants of what I was talking about on
the inside of the Ring right there do
you see that kind of a powdery look
right that's the nanofluids always left
this kind of a powder buildup in the
loops but where it's actually been
touching now the other side of it with
the new fluid actually is shiny and
hydrated okay yeah same thing where a
lot of what looked like it was stuck to
the block is it was actually stuck to
backside of backside of the moon no
stuck to the actual acrylic right here I
am very happy with what I'm seeing right
here they didn't ask me to do this video
you guys did so that's why I'm doing it
and let me just tell you right now I am
highly impressed with what I'm seeing
right here the block the block I mean
it's got a little bit of residue on
there that we can clean up it's still
left over from the previous fluids but
man we clean this polish this up it will
look good as new I'm not I'm just wiping
it with a dry paper towel too and this
is this is what we're getting I mean I
think it's impressive that we have a
fluid now that's actually giving us
positive results right here and I'm not
seeing any negative in any of the
systems we're running this in again I've
been using it upstairs - am i editing
rig all along no temperature issues no
gunking as you can see is happening so I
don't expect it happened up there with
brand new parts but yeah I mean that we
in the water cooling industry the fluid
is obviously the most important part and
not only does it do give you these
positive results like this it looks cool
- definitely worth checking out again
pretty much ill did not ask me to do
this video this is purely a response to
the community asking me tear your blocks
apart and let us see what the insides
look like because well I think it's a
very valid thing to ask for but it is
apparently available on the market now
it's on their website you can see it
pre-orders have already started shipping
and yeah I'm impressed with what I'm
seeing here look at the o-ring on this
one and then we'll go ahead and wrap
this video up the lid you see you see
how hydrated this oh he looks you see
how soft this is I'm not kidding
there has been blocks I've taken apart
after running nanofluids that were just
the o-rings were crunchy and really
started to make me
worried about reusing them but that's a
pretty hydrated overhang right there and
it's not shiny just cuz it's wet it's
shiny because the rubber I mean the
rubbers is hydrated right I mean do you
see that Nick that's not wet right
that's just shiny rubber yeah all right
honestly though I think it's a good idea
that we get Nick's feet wet with rigid
tubing and stuff he's gonna need a
computer now obviously for upstairs
so maybe what we'll do when we come back
from the Thanksgiving holiday is we'll
have Nick build his first rigid tubed PC
you've got a rigid - PC but I built it
for you yeah I think I think we need you
to do it okay
makes you guys hit like you want to see
Nick his first time doing high-end
custom water cooing to his own stuff so
all right guys we're gonna go thanks for
watching I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
