youtubers you're watching Jays two cents
and what I have here is the galaxy s3
energy power case by tilt Jays two cents
was fortunate enough to get to attend
the consumer electronics show in las
vegas's last january when i was there i
discovered this company called tilt this
is one of my favorite companies from the
show they have this really young hip
vibe they're a new company a lot of what
they do is funded through Kickstarter
and they were kind enough to send me
some products for review and what we're
doing today is reviewing the energy case
for the galaxy s3 this battery case here
has an 1800 milliamp battery in it it
has a kickstand that pops out here and
it's got some really neat features here
that I want to go over on the back of
the package right here you can see
you've got four LEDs here that show you
how much battery charges on the battery
it's got an 1800 milliamp it's very thin
design and it does have a micro USB plug
on the bottom here which is the same as
the proprietary plug on the galaxy s3
shouldn't say proprietary because it's
actually pretty common it does come with
a limited 1-year warranty it has details
inside the box and you can get more
information about tilt by visiting their
website wwlp.com so let's go ahead and
open up the package here I like the
colors of the box it's a very neat to
kind of a hot red not quite pink but
it's not red either it's like kind of a
very neon color here and it's got this
bit of a bezel when you open up the box
here it's a it's got a lot of tape on it
I've already opened up this case and
used it otherwise how could it have a
review this is not an unboxing but it is
a full review of this case now when it
comes to the thickness here the case
says it adds six millimeters of depth to
the thickness of the galaxy s3 now the
galaxy s3 already comes in i believe at
eight millimeters thin so if you add six
millimeters too that you're looking at
about 14 millimeters of thickness here
right on the inside of the battery case
here you can see it's got the model
number it's got a 5 volt 500 milliamp
output
and it's an 1800 milliamp battery and it
is branded made in China along with just
about every other piece of electronics
and the world it's got a little bit of a
direction right here just to let you
know that to start charging you have to
hold this power button for two seconds
it's got a plastic film here covering
the piano finish here on the button but
you can see on the bottom it does have
the a hole here for the microphone it
does have the micro USB charger here on
the bottom as well as the micro USB
charger port that plugs in to the phone
itself and here is the power button for
the case we'll get more into that once
we put this on the phone on the back
here you have a kickstand that pops out
that way you can prop it up the back is
a really nice it's like an ABS plastic
it's got a piano finish here which is
very shiny and polished cutouts here for
your camera speaker LED as well as a
quetta on the top for your microphone
jack and your ambient mic right there
noise cancelling mic to install this on
your phone you've got a pop off this
bezel here it's kind of a bumper type
bezel you slide your phone right into
the case lining up the port on the
bottom and then you simply snap this
ring right back over the top of your
phone installation takes only a few
seconds it's really easy there's nothing
to incredibly difficult about it the fit
is really good it's really tight it
doesn't wobble around it doesn't move
whatsoever even if you try and the
buttons are easily accessible even
though the phone has kind of a contour
to it and the case is very squared the
buttons are still pretty easy to push
with minimal effort power buttons on the
side home button is unchanged and then
you've got your charger port right here
on the bottom on the top though you are
going to be have to be mindful of your
headphone jack because some headphone
jacks may not fit because the depth is
increased now what makes this battery
case a little bit different than some of
the others on the market is you have to
turn it on to start charging your phone
if you push the battery button down
there on the bottom you'll see here you
get an LED indicator of what the battery
charge is like now there are four LEDs
green LEDs that will light up I'm
getting a single flashing LED because
this battery case has already been
pretty much depleted
for the sake of this review I did a full
charge and a full depletion of this
battery in a real-world situation to see
exactly how much extra battery life you
get now as mentioned at the start of
this review the battery included inside
of the tilt energy case is an 1800
milliamp battery now the stock battery
inside the galaxy s3 is a 2,100 milliamp
battery so it's a little bit smaller
than the battery that comes inside the
phone already when doing my real-world
test I watched videos on netflix to my
battery was down to about fifty percent
and I switched on the battery case which
was at a full 1800 milliamp charge now
the recharge rate of the battery case to
the galaxy s3 was about 1% of the
battery per minute so it wasn't too long
for the phone to be recharged back to a
hundred percent I did manage to get the
phone from fifty percent back to a
hundred percent unfortunately the
eighteen hundred milliamps inside of
this battery was completely depleted by
the end of that so if you use your
galaxy less than fifty percent of its
battery life depending on what your
profile is like on your phone what
you're doing what your brightness
settings are like you may not get a full
charge out of this if you're less than
fifty percent but then again your
mileage may vary because battery life on
cell phones is entirely dependent on
what you're doing with your phone I
happen to be doing some pretty strenuous
testing with it with having the
brightness at one hundred percent the
screen stuck on and a video playing
while recharging so you may be able to
get more recharging out of this battery
if you weren't doing stressful tasks at
the same time now one of the things I
want to mention is the bottom of the
case which is where the battery is
located did tend to get really warm I
wouldn't say it was uncomfortably warm
it may not have been very comfortable in
your pocket if you're going to be
recharging your phone on the go using
this case I recommend leaving it out of
your pocket so it can get proper
ventilation one thing that's important
to know though is that you can charge
both of these batteries at the same time
if you plugged in the included micro USB
plug at the bottom of the case or use
any micro USB charger for that matter it
will simultaneously charge both the
phone and the battery case so there's no
need to remove the phone if you decide
to use the battery case full time now
showed you the packaging I've showed you
what comes in the box and have told you
about how the recharge works let's go
ahead and talk about some of the pros
and cons I see with this case
right off the bat if you like the sleek
thin style of the galaxy s3 you're not
going to like the added size and weight
by having this case on the phone but on
the flip side this isn't necessarily a
case that's intended to be used
full-time this is the kind of case you
want to use if you're going to be away
from a charger for an extended period of
time or you're going to be traveling or
you just need extra power in case of
emergency this is a perfect case for you
the thickness is not too bad six
millimeters added to the size of the
phone on an already extremely thin phone
is not that big of a deal there is a bit
of an added weight though because there
is a battery obviously built into this
case things I do like I do like the
kickstand it is spring loaded as you can
see right there this is made of metal
not plastic so it's not going to break
on you very easily keeps it at just the
right angle so that your viewing angle
on that is about perfect it does only
kickstand though in the landscape
position it's not you can't really use
it in the portrait position as you can
see it wants to roll over on you the
cutout for the back with the camera and
the LED is nice and wide you're not
going to get your reflections back into
your camera lens from the LED it is
black around the side so you're not
going to get any reflection issues once
again when it comes to removing the case
there is a slot down here on the bottom
left corner as a gap it's designed for
you to be able to put a coin in and and
twist it if trying to take the case off
with your fingers it's doable and it's
not too hard as you can see right there
but you got to stick your finger nail in
there and and push pretty hard one thing
I am not too happy about the when it
comes to the design of this case is the
fact that they went with this very
polished piano finish and as you can see
by looking at that right there just by
handling it for this video it's already
very smudged it's got you know skin oils
on there it's very the shininess is nice
but if you're a clean freak that really
kind of bothers me I wish they would
have went maybe with a rubberized
material may be a matte
kind of this type of material this is
just like a raw ABS ton classic it's not
polished at all on the back side that
would have been nice and then on the
back here you have this nice beveled
tilt logo on the back lastly I do wish
they went with a little bit larger
battery in this case but I think part of
it is they want to keep the size and the
weight down which I completely agree
with the case itself is not very heavy
at all so there you have it guys the
galaxy s3 tilt energy battery case for
the galaxy s3 adding five hours whoa
back up bro adding five hours of talk
time and keeping you have charged on the
go now as mentioned right now this is
only shown as available for galaxy s3
and in the future the iphone 5 if you
don't have either of those two phones
don't fret because next time i'm going
to be reviewing the tylt powerplant
which is a portable battery pack that
has a micro USB charger as well as a USB
slot allowing you to charge any kind of
smartphone or tablet that uses a USB
port so you want to tune in for that
