and I built the smallest PC I have ever
built
not just in history of my channel but
the history we ever building pcs this is
the Loki ghost s1 case I did a video on
this you guys can go and check it out
learn a little bit more about this case
it's really neat the way it pulls apart
and you can get to all sides of the
build and then you put the case back
together around it but it has got some
pretty powerful parts in there we're
gonna talk about why I built this we'll
talk about performance and acoustics but
before we do that we've got to pay some
bills you know in hindsight was probably
a bad idea to bet the car I told you
never bet on red never bet on red didn't
just say he's gonna help us out where is
he anyway I don't know all I know is he
said that we would know what he was
close
how are we supposed to fit in this I
have actually an idea we can do what's a
v12 yeah it's a nice car sir that's what
you're saying right now
now no it can't be quiet dude I got you
covered
everything needs in the truck J front of
the car
what the heck am I supposed to do with a
mesh if I see mini dude it's like the
mesh if I see mini no it's tough you can
fit in there
you'll get it figured out
you know what I got an idea now the Loki
goes to s1 can be a small s 7.1 liters
if that tells you just how tiny it is
now it'll be bigger than that because I
had the top hat on here and obviously we
water-cooled this although with an AI oh
now I know I promised you guys a custom
water-cooled version of this we will be
doing that but I have another case
coming in silver which is what I wanted
to build in and so once they're ready
and we see we received that then I will
be doing a custom cooled loop or a
custom rigid two tubing loop whatever I
decide to do I don't know we'll figure
it out
but before we talk about anything else
with this version when we go ahead and
see the build which obviously is
everybody's favorite part
and it was right about here where I
realized that this cooler unfortunately
is not going to work the Celsius s 24
does not have rotatable fittings on the
pump and they point straight up so
unfortunately with the extremely small
size of this case I could not get the
side panel closed or slid back on so I
grabbed an NZXT cooler which had
rotatable fittings and that fortunately
got me going once again
now two major components changed on this
build from start to finish
obviously the cooler which we already
talked about but I had to take out the
ten atti and put in a ten eighty because
I used a 500 watt Silverstone gold rated
SFX power supply which unfortunately was
not enough to keep the ten atti running
even at stock speeds I was getting hard
shutdowns because of too much power draw
and unfortunately it just wasn't enough
some games would crash some would it so
perfect example of why you need to test
your stability with various games and
testing Suites because just one
benchmark is never gonna give you the
whole story so I had to replace it with
a 1080 which was kind of disappointing
because I wanted to go with just some of
the most high-end hardware you could get
especially at this form factor so a 1080
is in there which means my ultimate 4k
gaming / portable rig is now an ultimate
1440p gaming rig which is so great I was
gonna gain at 4k anyway I just wanted to
do it because why not so I've got a 1080
founders card in there now but now I've
got a new video to make because I have
tested the 1080 TI with a 500 watt power
supply and overclocked it with no
problems on a full ATX power supply so I
have to wonder now if there's a variance
in quality or at least drivability with
a 500 wide SFX versus a 500 watt ATX now
we got something to test in the future
and the power supply has plenty of
cooling because right where the vent is
for the power supply is the exhaust fan
so it's pulling air out of it and it's
getting plenty of airflow so yeah
there's that and that the opening for
the power supply is right next to the
CPU cooler which is on the other side of
the case so it gets fresh air through
the sides of this case now speaking of
ventilation and cooling there's no
problem whatsoever keeping the CPU and
the GPU cool both the CPU and the GPU
pull fresh air from the sides of the
case which are perforated and have very
good airflow and there's no air filters
anywhere in this case our dust filters
so you're gonna probably have to worry
about keeping it dust free but when it
looks this good I mean that's a trade
off that's probably worth making at
least I made it I'm okay with that now I
chose AMD risin 7 1800 x because Asus
actually makes an X 370 ITX
Strix motherboards I was able to have
overclock ability very robust build
quality of the motherboard plenty of fan
headers and stuff an m2 slot or socket
built on to the motherboard and I could
overclock the CPU if I wanted no didn't
overclock the cores all I did was sync
all cores so any of the factory turbo
clocks is being applied to all the cores
so technically that's a small overclock
but I did overclock the memory the 16
gigabytes of flare X from g.skill which
is a rise in certified memory to 3400
megahertz so I wanted to speed up that
infinity fabric which obviously rise in
games more from memory speed increase
then straight up core speed so I left
the corazon Factory synched the course
and then overclock the memory which is
being giving me some pretty good results
when it comes to temperatures no problem
whatsoever especially with the NZXT
kraken X 52 I think it is it's the 100
or the 240 millimeter version and it
kept my CPU at a max temperature of 62 C
with all of my testing including things
like sin invention 3d mark and fire
strike and CPU tests no problem
whatsoever with temperatures now my 1080
on the other hand is running a bit warm
even with my aggressive fan curve I'm
still reaching about 74 75 C I don't
think something is right in there so I'm
gonna be doing a video in the future
where I talk about troubleshooting some
of the temperature fluctuations and
issues I'm having with this card and I
know I did one in the past but this is
this is going to be applicable to the
new Nvidia founders cooler and I'm not
trying to upgrade that cooler by
maintaining all the founders Edition
appearance so that's gonna be a fun
video we'll talk about that in the
future so again it's a video out of
necessity because it's something I
learned with this card after switching
it when the 1080 TI unfortunately wasn't
able to be powered by this power supply
now you're probably thinking Jay I want
you to get a 600 watt SFX power supply
then you'll be fine the problem is the
higher the wattage of SFX power supplied
the longer they get so in order for me
to have room for the modular cables as
well as the excess cables that are in
this case I didn't want to go with a
longer power supply so that's why I'm
just sticking with the 500 and stuck in
the GTX 1080 but in terms of gaming
though it performs exactly as you would
expect a GTX 1080 to perform I did a
small overclock on it just 50 megahertz
to overclock the Rambo 3
50 megahertz and temperatures stay in
the mid to low 70s which is acceptable a
little bit noisy though because I had to
ramp up the fan curve a build like this
for me specifically was first and
foremost performance and portability
with a KU sticks second so cooling in
this is actually very good but at the
sacrifice of acoustics but it's not
intrusive that doesn't sound terrible so
it's something I can obviously deal with
but I built this case or this build
specifically because after going to CES
for five years and building big pieces
and taking them with me going I don't
want to edit on a laptop I want to have
a very powerful editing rig so I'll
build a desktop and then wheel it all
into the hotel room set it up and wheel
it out and as i'm tired of that guys I'm
tired of that so I wanted a shuttle PC
that was as powerful as any desktop I
could build and have it be extremely
portable I initially wanted it to be a
carry-on item I wanted to be able to
carry it in a small suitcase on the
plane with me because I don't trust the
airlines to not just throw this thing
around and kick it around like a soccer
ball or a football depending on what
part of the country or the world you're
from I guess anyone else would call it
football but whatever I digress I just
didn't want to trust the airlines the
problem is because once I want to cool
it though the chances of it being a
carry-on went out the window because TSA
does not allow me to carry on this
somebody with liquid in it like this so
unfortunately now I've got to get myself
like a Pelican case and cut out the foam
and make it as padded as possible so
that this doesn't get beat up but the
build quality of this case and just how
robust everything is and the fact that
it's an AI oh I think it could handle
the flights no problem at least if I got
somewhere and it was busted well then
whatever you guys can say I told you so
but while gaming temperatures stayed
well in check has no problem playing
games at 1440p even the most demanding
games even games that aren't that
demanding but require you know high
refresh rates like racing games shooters
rise of the Tomb Raider Metro last light
games that are typically pretty
demanding no problems whatsoever this
computer takes it chews it up spits it
out and ask for more which is exactly
what I wanted anyway guys I'm gonna go
thanks for watching if you have any
suggestions on future content you'd like
to see make sure you guys sound off in
the comments below or hit me up on
Twitter I'm at Jay's two cents if you're
new around here once you hit that
subscribe button and then hit the little
bell you guys can't trust YouTube to
send you
so at least if you guys are subscribed
you might actually get a notification
but whatever the case may be guys I'll
see you in the next one thanks for
