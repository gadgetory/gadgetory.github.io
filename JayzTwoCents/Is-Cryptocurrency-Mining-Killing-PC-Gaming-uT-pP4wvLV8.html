finished our CES coverage just came back
from that so a huge thank you to all of
you who viewed those videos and
supported but with some to go back some
regular content before we do that here
I've been kind of struggling with where
to go forward especially in 2018 because
in the last five years I've been doing
this we have seen some pretty
interesting historical movements in the
PC and specifically the GPU market and
that being the rise of cryptocurrency
and when I keep finding myself coming
back to in the back of my mind is is
this is this new thing causing a
disruption and a decline of PC gaming as
a whole the all new master liquid 120
and 240 l RGB coolers provide an easy
and reliable way to keep your processor
nice and cool they're all new dual
chamber pump and low resistance radiator
offer a higher transfer of heat for both
Intel and AMD CPUs while six preset
lighting effects an RGB ensure that the
120 and 240 L seamlessly match your
color design choice make it yours by
following the link in the description
below now this video is probably going
to rub a few people the wrong way
especially if you are following me and
you are a cryptocurrency miner yourself
and you've probably even cashed in if
you've been in long enough so of course
the profits are going to outweigh any of
the negatives if you happen to be on
that side of the coin but let's try and
look at it from the perspective of the
average consumer the guy who has been
saving up his money all summer long or
he has been working overtime hours to
try and afford that new GPU and suddenly
they're unavailable or the ones that are
available are two to three times the
cost that they launched at specifically
because of cryptocurrency mining in the
way it leverages GPU power and the ROI
you can get now we've seen a huge rise
in decline and rise in decline over the
last several years of cryptocurrency but
as they keep getting higher and higher
in value whether it be blockchain or
aetherium or Bitcoin specifically that
had reached I think at one point $19,000
per coin when everyone thought 500 and
600 dollars per coin was astronomical
what happens is you get all these people
running out wanting to
passion no pun intended on the entire
craze of cryptocurrency and as much as
people swear that it's a fad and it's
not going anywhere
the more mainstream retailers and online
eat Taylor's and other legitimate
outlets and retail stores start
accepting cryptocurrency the more its
accepted plate in more places the more
people are doing it which is putting a
larger strain on specifically the GPU
community now that's what leads me to
say that this is causing a huge decline
in terms of PC gaming growth now sure
we're not moving backwards necessarily
an amount of PC gamers are but there is
a decline in growth figures if that
makes sense we're not growing at this
rate as we used to a back in 2012 I
think was 2012 I did a video titled
is PC gaming dying and people were
calling me out left and right saying I
was I was disconnected and I was not in
tune with what was going on a PC gaming
because steam figures show that PC
gaming he was at an all-time high I feel
like right now what we are experiencing
is a is just a huge strain on the market
that I don't think can continue let's
try and look at this at a couple of
different perspectives here
you're a GPU manufacturer and people
live we got some AMD GPUs here in some
NVIDIA GPUs here no but I got right here
is a GTX 480 this was one of the most
sought after cards in all of
cryptocurrency mining you know era this
this card right here had the best ROI or
return on investment where the costs to
performance on this in terms of hash
performance was through the roof and so
what people were doing was buying these
up left and right and what you guys saw
was this more than doubled in price same
thing happening with five 70s and five
80s here it is right here
and it's happening all over again with
GTX 10 70s we got one right here
if you can't gather I'm sitting on a
goldmine of GPUs but I refuse to do
cryptocurrency mining it's something I
don't want any part of and I feel like
it is causing damage to a community that
I care an awful lot about but let's look
at it from a couple of perspectives here
let's say you are the manufacturer of
the GPUs and a lot of folks are very
upset with the manufacturers saying that
they're setting pricing and this and
that but I can tell you that
manufacturers have reached out to me and
said they have no control over the
pricing we'll go ahead and leave the
whole Vega Fiasco out of it because we
do know Andy did indeed have
roll over a lot of that but but for the
most part the manufacturers the the
individual the EVGA s and the gigabytes
and the sapphires
they're not out there studying the
astronomical pricing retailers are
because of the simple economic supply
and demand model if you have things that
are in demand and you don't have supply
price goes up it is a capitalist market
that's exactly how free market and free
capitalism is designed to work
unfortunately if you're the guy that's
out there trying to save up for a two
hundred dollar graphics card that's the
best you can afford but now a two
hundred graphics card at one dollar
graphics card cost six hundred dollars
what do you do and I don't think many
people would disagree with me when I say
that this is causing a strain in the PC
market just take a trip to Fry's Micro
Center hell even Best Buy and you'll see
what I'm talking about in terms of
pricing now I don't know what we can do
about this I honestly don't know what
the answer is because what's happening
now is all the people that have used
graphics cards are selling them
obviously for a huge profit as well I
mean if you bought a gtx 1070 or a 1070
TI when they launched it retail let's
say 399 dollars for this guy and you can
turn around and sell it for $700 you'd
be kind of a fool not to
but that perpetuates the problem and we
have a perpetual cycle here of cost and
a bubble that is building and when it
bursts gamers will win unfortunately who
knows what that's going to do the
economic side of things on a crypto
currency and the people who have
invested huge amounts of money and even
property and other collateral in that
market I don't know what the answer is
but I'm concerned I just wanted to make
this video to start a discussion because
I'm concerned about how far this can go
the GPU manufacturers cannot manufacture
them fast enough
you see these you see these pictures in
these videos of guys who have rigs with
10 15 20 GPUs per rig and these special
cryptocurrency mining cabinets and
they've just got the GPUs as far as the
eye can see you've see guys who buy up
20 30 graphics cards at a time when
sometimes manufacturers only have 50 or
100 to sell and you have one or two guys
that buy up all of them what do you do I
this video exists because of the amount
of people I get writing me emails and
asking me to buy graphics cards from me
at retail price because they simply
can't afford buying it somewhere
unfortunately guys
carts you see here has nothing has no
impact on the market whatsoever so even
if I sold them at retail it makes no
difference to things I might make a
difference to you because you got at a
decent price but I use them to make my
videos obviously which is another reason
why I don't mind on these cards I'm
concerned so I don't know what the
solution is I'm really kind of reaching
out to you guys this how far you think
this is gonna go where do you think it's
gonna end up in the next couple of years
because the last two years alone in
terms of cryptocurrency mining and what
has happened to the industry I think is
a negative now this is probably making
companies like Nvidia super happy though
and the reason why I say that is I'm
NVIDIA has got this idea that GPUs are
the future GPUs are going to be the new
CPU CPUs er are not gonna be able to
keep up with where the GPU performance
is going over time and I think that's I
think that's accurate to a degree but
all of the all of the power that in the
compute power that has been pulled out
of graphics cards has definitely been
impressive over the last couple of years
that's definitely been a an exponential
increase in power but I mean it's not
new to use graphics cards to leverage
compute loads I mean something that's
been going on in terms of professional
work environments people that are doing
professional CAD and stuff like that you
know you got double precision and all
that stuff that's been leveraged but
those cards were those cards were
designed for that and it cost thousands
of dollars the problem is you've got
these two hundred dollar gaming cards
that are being sold for two and three
times the cost because they it's like
the one thing that's used for
cryptocurrency mining gaming graphics
cards were able just to pump out at an
astronomical rate causing people to go
out and just buy them up so at the end
of this video I don't really know what
the answer is I don't really know if
there was even a point to making this
video other than I feel a little bit
better by even talking about this and
bringing it up and saying personally I
am NOT a fan of cryptocurrency and what
it is doing to the industry I'm not a
fan of what it's doing to PC gaming as a
whole and as someone who saw at PC
gaming when I was three that's now 33
years ago I don't even know like I don't
even know how I feel about it any time
someone asked me if I'm if I'm
interested in doing cryptocurrency I
almost get a little bit salty at just
the tone of the whole idea of
cryptocurrency and what it's doing
because I can't think about the
potential profits and all that all I
think about is what's happening as a
whole other community
I care a ton about and I want to do
budget based videos I even thought about
going out and taking $500 again going
out and seeing what you can buy for
right now twenty or twenty eighteen for
five hundred bucks and even at micro
Center I don't feel it's very doable
considering the costs of ddr4
specifically as all the new platforms of
ddr4 and then what's happening with GPU
pricing it's just I don't even know I
don't even know where this is gonna go
and how far it can go
so although I had to do guys with spark
a discussion down below if you are for
or against cryptocurrency cite your
reasons as to why because I'm really
kind of curious as to the insight of how
far people think we can we can handle
this how long can we do this and have an
industry not just collapse on itself I
mean the collapse is probably going to
end up being cryptocurrency itself but
then again there's a ton of people that
are convinced that is the future of
currency without big banks and gold
backing and all that stuff so anyway
that's it just a rambling head video I
wanted to get that out I feel a lot
better now not really I don't feel any
better at all anyway guys sound off down
below and let me know what you think
thanks for watching I'll see you in the
next one
