or listening to Jays two cents this is
my channel I just tweeted out that I
fixed the stuttering problem on my
Battlefield 4 and I thought that maybe
this was common knowledge but based on
the amount of people who immediately
told me how do you do it how do you fix
it how do you fix battlefield 4 help me
help me you must tell me the ways I
decided it it warranted this late night
emergency video well I guess it's not
really that late it's only 1142 p.m. but
when you're old like I am that's pretty
damn late so anyway we'll go ahead and
get my ugly face off the screen here and
what you need to do open up your Windows
Explorer somehow some way there it is
and you're going to go to wherever
you've installed your battlefield now
that's up to you I don't know where you
install it I installed it on my third
hard drive here bf4 and you're going to
navigate to the battlefield 4 directory
when you open that up you're going to
see a bunch of folders and a bunch of
files and you want to open up underscore
installer now you're going to open up
the DirectX folder and you're going to
open up the reddest folder you're going
to sort by alphabetical order and you're
going to scroll down to the DS where
you're going to see DirectX setup
because you see here's what happened
dice in all of their infinite wisdom
especially for teaming up with EA and
probably some of the stupidest things
they could have ever done in the past
but I digress they forgot to install
directx with the installer for battle
film so they don't have optimized
DirectX drivers built into the game
because the game has its own DirectX
that communicates with your DirectX 11
or 11 point 2 or whatever you got and
they forgot to install it those bastards
so anyway double-click the DirectX setup
accept the agreement hit next hit next
and watch the green initializing and
installing bar of Awesomeness move all
the way across the screen and when it
does you can open up battlefield 4 and
bask in the glory that is stutter free
operation
frame rates if you are like me you were
getting high frame rates with really bad
stuttering and this fixes that so there
you go if you know someone playing
Battlefield 4 and they're complaining
about horrible stuttering even though
they get great frame rates show them
this video and you can guy you and both
you guys can laugh together at just how
stupid dies really is so there you go
guys hit that subscribe button if this
video helped you hopefully you're
already subscribed and I'm gonna get on
out of here but remember when you hit
that subscribe button you save a kitten
in third world countries for being eaten
by zombie babies good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
