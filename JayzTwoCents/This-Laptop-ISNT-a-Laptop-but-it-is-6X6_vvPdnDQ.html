has something fun and exciting to show
and they are definitely a heavy hitter
when it comes to notebooks and kind of
come up with some some crazy designs but
before we talk about that we have to
talk about our sponsor and that being
corsair and the new corsair 1i 140 i
116i 180 high performance desktops learn
more by clicking the link in description
below
this right here is what's being called
the Asus mothership and so here's the
thing with laptops if you're a
professional that's on the go you might
be used to working through or out of a
laptop all the time what kind of sucks
is dealing with the whole docking and if
you're gonna do if you're gonna be a Mac
user or whatever you can deal with the
dock and then you know it hooks up to a
monitor and all that sort of stuff and
then when you're done you improve it
plug a dongle or a thunderbolt or a talk
or whatever I know if you go or there's
the kind of the lesser desirable
situation which is where I find myself
with having this big giant powerful
desktop and then I've got to go
somewhere like CES right then grab
another laptop that has to then be
Windows updated and Driver updated and
software update and all these things I
mean I've used it in several weeks or
whatever and then here you are having to
deal with all that before you leave and
an unfamiliar type of setup well that's
sort of the use case scenario that the
asus mothership is designed to sort of
tackle now this is a desktop replacement
that we've seen some big giant heavy
laptops and usually all that means when
they say desktop replacement is we took
em high-end mobile and or maybe desktop
components shove them into a case put a
screen on it and then call it a desktop
replacement and then really the thing
that makes it like a desktop is the fact
that nearly weighs as much as one but it
still has a lot of drawbacks to a laptop
now what we've got right here is the
reason why they call it the mothership
is why don't I'm just gonna assume it's
got this kind of a convertible aspect to
it and I'm gonna try and do this without
having it go horribly wrong because I've
never tried to convert this but this is
a convertible so the first thing we're
gonna go ahead and do here is open up
I'm upside down already push it down and
this is going to activate this sort of a
hinge that pops out just like that so
now we've got what just converted into
basically a
monitor we can now flip down this guy
right here which now has our keyboard
and now we have a fully functional what
could act like sighs like a desktop but
this guy can also detach and turn into
its own keyboard and trackpad now making
it more of a I guess sort of like a dock
scenario here now in terms of specs it
is featuring Intel I 9 and a fully
fledged r-tx 2080 desktop GPU in this
and then in terms of the storage
configuration so they actually take an
8x from the CPU and split that into two
four X's and they've got one four X
coming from the chipset so you can have
three m2 on PCI Express that can also be
rated in raid 0 480 701 M about 2
storage just getting bigger and bigger
no longer do you really have to
sacrifice the amount of capacity that
can hook up to this then of course the
USB type-c and Thunderbolt you can add
on additional storage and devices not
only that it's got really good sound it
has 4 watt speakers on this that are
definitely gonna fill a room what one of
my biggest complaints with thin laptops
is there is no excuse to have terrible
audio ever since I purchased my
Microsoft Surface that I use as my
on-the-go kind of a little work notebook
type deal the sound that comes out of
that would fill a studio let alone a
small room so ever since hearing those
speakers I've been telling brands you
have no excuse to have terrible town and
if then form-factor laptop now it comes
in at about 10 pounds so it's it still
requires a little bit of heft when you
go to pick it up but the idea here is
that it's a zero compromises desktop
replacement that can go with you and
convert into these various use scenarios
that allow you to well like I said non
compromise so tell me what you guys
think I asked them specifically I said
you guys find a lot of people requesting
this sort of a desktop replacement you
know computer and the answer was like oh
yeah all the time so yeah this is what
Asus is showing the Asus mothership like
I said sound off in the comments below
and how you guys feel about this and of
course thanks for watching our CES
coverage is brought to you by Corsair
like I said in the new Corsair 1 so
