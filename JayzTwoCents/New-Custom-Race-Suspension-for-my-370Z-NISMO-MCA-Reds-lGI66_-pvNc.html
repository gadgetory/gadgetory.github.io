how you doing how you doing oh my god
yeah
you sure yeah I can't really used it the
wild stuff it's working
so you guys might recall last year I did
a video where I installed some NCA
coilovers and some control arms and
stuff in this car
well we've since stepped it up because
we're getting better we spent two oh my
god
look at all the rubber that came off my
tire at the change you know I heard it
was a soft compound but holy hell you
made spaghetti
well proof in the pudding I've been
driving the car bit harder so it's time
for a better better than Street
performance suspension which is exactly
what we're putting in now we're sticking
with MCAS just we're going with a little
bit stiffer spring a little bit
different valving specifically for this
car specifically for the set up
specifically for the rubber that I am
using we also going to be doing some SPL
upper control arms on the front because
one of the problems I have is I don't
have enough camber in the front on this
car so I'm getting a lot of rollover and
although this might eat you
thirty-sevens is not what I track on I
track on grand lights I was getting too
much to roll over because I'm wearing a
275 up front on a 40 series tire in an
18-inch wheel not the 1935 like I have
right here so we were getting a lot of
camber wear on the outside on the track
so we need to fix that here's the stop
control arm here we have to either cut
or shorten this bolt right here find a
shorter bolt this is the power steering
reservoir mount this will impact with
the new control arm if I don't go to
remove the brake line from the shock
right here okay remove the shock there's
also the ABS lines on this side right
here the Beast is pushing in right so
these will just pop right off I have to
undo the three bolts up on top of the
shock mounts reduce the lower mount and
yeah I mean the shocks come out really
really easy it's gonna be ow
hurting your hand
once I take the shock out then I'm gonna
have to undo this bolt right here
because this is where the ball joint for
the upper mount connects to the control
arm right here or this arm spindler and
then I've got a new that bolt and this
bolt these guys have never been taken
off before so I think it's gonna be
they're gonna be tight but fortunately
once the shock is out I have lots of
room and leverage to get my breaker bar
in here you know what they say work
smarter not harder well I think quieter
I did start to try and do it by hand
because my daughter's sleeping no but
that sucks up the the z34 though is the
lower shock bolt and the sway bar bolt
r1 it's one piece so that's why on this
side open-ended wrench in here keep it
from turning
but now getting this out can sometimes
be a pain in the ass because when the
suspension is drooping all the way the
sway bar is under a bit of a load so
getting this out is sometimes a pain in
the butt but that's why we also have
mallets and things yeah that's gonna be
a bit of a pain the ass to get it all
the way out cuz you can see it puts a
lot of stress right here on the sway bar
end link oh I hit my finger against them
caliper I like to be able to feel my
nuts okay take it to the top shock mount
you have to remove the strut tower bar
so these three bolts are here normally
would hold the entire weight of the
suspension assembly when it's in droop
but what I do is I put a jack underneath
the control arm and jacked it up a
little bit to push against the spring
that way it's not all just hanging down
that way went and do these now I might
be putting extra stress on these threads
as it's unthreading because you don't
want to do that
shade-tree backyard mechanic tree
mechana tree so the whole assembly can't
come down far enough cuz this bolt and
the sway bar is still supporting it so I
really want to get the sway bar free
entirely can't get that bolt not enough
to get the shocks out smashed my finger
it's bleeding under there nick is all
like EU blood so and then at the back of
the car jacked up so I can't get my
drill under your head take off the
bottom plate because I'm gonna remove
the skid pan and just remove the sway
bar cuz it's easy to remove and then
once the sway bars out then it makes a
come out no problem it's just I didn't
have to do this last time I'm just gonna
I'm no matter I'm going to strike the
term it'll be pretty easy from my
dictionary you're kind of waiting for
that what I thought was gonna fall on
your face and just like that get this
guy out of here because now this is
spent none of the spring and there they
went like it stretched out because it's
not under any load anymore hey yeah
so the idea here is is I have a
technique I like to do to try and match
all these links up because I need it to
at least be good enough to drive to the
alignment shop yeah because I mean we do
need to obviously adjust camber and
stuff
so we got support under this right I
just wanna find right where it takes the
weight like that that's easier - this is
caster adjustment you guys have ever
wondered now that you can see camber
this guy moves in and out for camber
adjustment like this moves forward in
fact that's caster adjustment
literally the only thing holding this
thing together now is the lower ball
joint all right
these are definitely lighter than the
SPL this one those times where SPL is
gave me the wrong room there's a left
and right oh that's how you do them so
that's why we have to cut that bowl
because as you can see that bolt you can
see that bolt will impact on the arm and
they make sure to work of it here's a
stock arm and it's sloppy rubber
bushings which are all about quiet and
comfort and all that this there's
nothing quite uncomfortable about this
car anymore so another piece of out
of the park
these are SPL spherical bushings these
are solid
there is no plan than whatsoever
basically they are bearing like a
bearing bushing you got these inserts
that go in there
so the only lighter it's a little extra
weight gain here with this story of my
life but you can see right now like if I
mounted it exactly as it is I'd probably
be like negative 5 camber so I think I'm
gonna lengthen this out a little bit so
just in camera this is pretty simple you
gotta loosen up these nuts these nuts
you know loosen these guys up because
these are locking down the adjustable
collar or not calling but the adjustable
threading because trust me you don't
want this coming loose on you while
you're driving so it's actually three
points it locks here here and there's a
collar to keep this from turning because
remember there's it's like sleeved and
it goes in and out like equally so it's
not just sliding along the rail this
part also moves in and out but most of
the adjustments done
here with this main beefy piece so what
I'm gonna do is I got to loosen up all
the collars that way we can actually
turn it
then we take a 12 millimeter wrench and
we can adjust it that way and it looks
like that's also how the camber is gonna
be a or the caster is gonna be adjusted
so I'm gonna make sure I count the
threads and keep it the same on both
sides
because since I just did one side right
now you can see this part pivoted over
watch why should I tighten it back up
see the way it pivots so if you only had
just one side that's how you get your
caster figured I might as well put the
shot back in here while I've got the
spindle arm and all that I'm
disconnected because it makes it a lot
easier to get this guy I've been there a
few hours lit yeah yes we got this for
at least three and a half hours almost
four hours I guess we got one corner
done but we fixed one bolt that was semi
stripped we fixed it you got a arms
install arms adjusted both shocks
adjusted to our baseline hopefully the
other side will go faster keywords
hopefully guys we're gonna see how long
it's gonna take me to do this corner now
that we've got all the prep work done
yeah so anyway start the stopwatch or
whatever stopwatch yeah it's got a bunch
of stopwatch it's going all right
uh yeah tell me how far in are we but we
at 23 minutes and 53 seconds in well
would you look at that that's when the
shock is in the lower bolt is in it's
not torque down I think torqued yet but
everything's in place way better than I
could say for the other side thank you
but the other side like I said we had a
lot of things we had to kind of like
overcome and overcoming them on the
other side meant we overcame them on
this side so we didn't have to deal with
this stubborn the other side the future
the other side the control arm bolt up
here or the control arm stud didn't want
to go in to the top of the spindle arm
you run out how much I tried to spread
it apart like a butt crack ended up I
ended up getting it eventually though
that sucked but anyway this is
everything's in right now
would you look at that sway bar still
hanging down down here though I was
about to say that sway bar still
swinging the other site still has to be
torn off to the sway bar swings so it's
doing this job a bar is swaying
that's what's wait where's do this way
yeah all right time to tighten it all up
and then move to the rear the rear that
would be faster than the rear is three
bolts 25 minutes the rear is three bolts
okay betters you passed it in 25 yeah we
haven't toured this all down well then
we'll go to the back of the car and
we'll see what's up
see Justin styled sway by which puts
them at 85 26 I think I'm just laying
here now because I'm dying
well the rear should be a lot in fact
the rear is kind of a lot of work for a
1000 kilogram I will tell you there's
only 1000 kilogram difference between
these Springs and these Springs but the
valving is a little bit different but
there's only three bolts get this off to
at the top see out there right there and
then wondering er where's the last one
down here the shock base and yes I just
held up in my hands so uh but now I can
basically tell you about the rear there
in the back of the car
oh here we go
call dad when you're ready with the
usual torque specs of good in tights
German German specs on JVM car you're
lost on you the I'm done half day 2
minutes 30 seconds okay remember I was
telling you on the front on those
control arms how they were real stiff
the hind joints the spherical bushings
they wear in over time see that see how
easy that is to rotate yeah because the
spherical there as well so yeah just
takes time for those two to get in there
so we do the other side then we'll let
it down and we'll see how it sits they
say that these these shocks and springs
don't have to settle
I mean it's that's pretty much it
something looks really do except drop or
down see where it sits drive around the
block see where it settles because again
I still think suspension settles but
whatever and then make some adjustments
to the coilovers so with that said we'll
do all that will come back in this video
so this is where it's at the rear has
like this massive gap in the front it's
like massively tucked camera trust me
it's way too low especially for track so
yeah we are going to bring the back down
about an inch and the front up about an
inch
right now it's got that muscle car like
70s muscle car rate going on okay so we
actually raised the front versus where
it was before we change the suspension
but definitely raised it a lot from
where it was when we first put it on as
you can see I know some of you guys are
like hello flesh but no no that's not
what we're about here this is about
clearance and proper alignment and stuff
setup for the track because I'm running
a 275 square so for track
a little bit extra height will help
Claire we're also to get the camber
adjust it now because it's higher the
camber is is less apparent now there is
a specific track camber that I run but I
gotta get that all taken care of now
there's someone else I can handle that
and then the rear we brought the rear
down like I said we were gonna do so
that's where it sits I think it was
pretty good
my my one one of a kind te thirty-sevens
so guys we're gonna go this took all day
way longer than I wanted it to I beat
the out of myself
pretty sure I damaged this knuckle like
the bone I smashed the out of that
sacrifice to the car guides right
alright see you the next one Nick any
final thoughts not really I'm really
waiting right now tell if only they
could see your face right now
it's it's blank you know buddy what
