think most people are getting a little
bit burnt out on the whole coverage of
GTX 1080 and although it is a fantastic
card that gets only better with a DIN
card manufacturers like MSI gigabyte
EVGA most people can't afford a $600
graphics card that is a pretty high
premium regardless of the value of the
card so when it comes to value just like
the GTX 970 everyone wants to know more
about the gtx 1070 and that's exactly
what we're going to talk about today the
mastercase 5 and mastercase 5 pro from
Coolermaster combines modularity with
creativity giving you the freedom to
build it your way make it yours by
clicking the link down in the
description now this video really
doesn't need to be that long in fact the
1070 here is just a shaved down version
of the GTX 1080
instead of 20 560 CUDA cores found here
in the 1080 it's got nineteen hundred
and twenty it's kind of funny the amount
of jokes have been going around about
1920 and 1080 it's like some weird
number I want it makes me wonder if they
actually intentionally shave down the
numbers so that they worked out that way
but regardless I digress
6.5 teraflops of compute power in this
little guy right here yeah 256-bit
memory bus eight gigabytes of gddr5 it's
not the gddr5 X but gddr5 1500 and six
megahertz base clock 1683 megahertz
boost clock running on the same GP 104
pascal 16 nanometer FinFET core that we
saw on the GTX 1080 so it is quite
literally just a shaved down version now
just like the 970 and the 980 when those
launched back in September of 2014 all
of the hype was around the value of the
GTX 970 and that really hasn't changed
when it comes to the gtx 1070 either now
the MSRP is three hundred and seventy
nine dollars for the add-in card pricing
and the founders Edition which I'm
holding here coming in at four hundred
and forty nine which as you've seen with
GTX 1080
you are going to see the board partner
cards coming in
obviously cheaper than founders I would
expect sweet spots to be right around
$399 now although that is more expensive
than you were seeing with the GTX 970
the amount of performance that you're
getting on this is pretty damn insane
so rather than sit here and show you any
more unnecessary b-roll that really
serves as nothing more than a way to
cover up my face so you guys don't throw
up while watching this review let's go
ahead and get right in to the benchmark
numbers
so what you're seeing right here is a
one-hour looping benchmark of heaven
running with extreme tessellation 1440p
8 X multi sampling and everything pushed
as high as it would go and what we were
looking for here was to see how GPU
boost responded to the 1070 in normal
conditions some people got mad that I
turned the air conditioner off in my
1080 test so the room was actually just
as it would be day to day I was editing
over there on skunkworks this went for
an hour air conditioner was on normal
thing to ambient temp in this room
because of the temperature of the GPU
rose to about 79 degrees Fahrenheit
almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit was pretty
warm in this room this these were the
results and the reason why I'm showing
this is obviously everyone was talking
about GTX 1080 and was it thermal
throttling now let's talk about this for
a minute here
I think a lot of people forget on what
GPU boost really is now the only clocks
you are guaranteed to get with an Nvidia
card is the base clock not the idle
clock if you 140 megahertz whatever it
is but the base clock being what it
ramps up to when it sees a 3d load and
in this case that being 1500 and six
megahertz it's actually represented
right here in green as the minimum value
that's the clock you're guaranteed to
get anything above that is GPU boost
working by dynamically monitoring things
like power limit and temperature limit
to see hey do we have more Headroom here
are we just sitting here you know
floating downstream or can we actually
you know turn this bitch up and get some
more power so we went all the way up to
1835 when the card was cool before we
actually saw us bumping against the
upper limit of the temperature limit
once we hit the temperature limit of 82
which is the way it ships out of the box
and you're going to hit 82 or the
reference cooler I guarantee it we saw
the core clock come all the way back
down to 1721 now that's a great number
and the reason why I say that is the
boost clock on this card is sixteen
hundred and eighty-three so we are what
forty eight megahertz faster than the
boost clock while bumped up against the
temperature limit although people will
argue eight and twos too hot the fan
wasn't running fast enough the fact that
it was still able to achieve a faster
than boost clock while at the
temperature limit to me is actually
pretty impressive now if we were to see
this core clock come back down below
the 1506 mark then we would see what's
known as thermal throttling where it's
actually trying to save itself from
dying because it's getting too hot so
even if it came down below the booze
clock but was faster than the base clock
GPU boost is still a benefit and it's
actually working other reason why I
mentioned this has nothing to do with
defending Nvidia it's just I feel like
since the 600 series when we first saw
GPU boost one launch
a lot of people have actually forgotten
how GPU boost works and just because the
frequency is dynamically controlling
itself doesn't mean it's thermal
throttling but anything above the base
clock within the boost range is actually
considered GPU boost which is just
dynamic self overclocking and a lot of
people seem to have forgotten that so
that's why I went ahead and showed this
I did an hour-long test here's the graph
make of it as you will and that's pretty
much all she wrote about that the 1070
with the reference cooler which is
notorious obviously for being the
hottest coolers on the market actually
did a really good job at keeping the
core clocks exactly where they needed to
be for a great gaming experience all
right with all that said what happens
when you actually push the limits of the
card especially with the reference
cooler on their core voltage is at plus
100 millivolts we've got a power limit
of 112 percent which is where they that
one thing to note this is 112 where the
1/8 or the 1080 was 120 and we're doing
a plus 175 on the core and a plus 500 on
the memory so I want to see exactly how
well this thing will perform obviously
on the first test I showed you guys we
hit 80 to see with everything out of the
box so pushing up voltage and frequency
is obviously going to increase the
temperature so to combat that I'm
actually going to set the fan at I'm
gonna set it at 90 I'm sure my lab mics
picking it up let's go ahead and see
what our frequency is jumping up to and
then we'll do a little bit of live
gaming here to see how the 1070 does
with doom I don't have a benchmark suite
setup with doom because it cloud saves
and it's really hard to actually get a
consistent test going and do and does
have a built-in benchmark or anything
like that so I figured live gameplay
would be the best way to do it all right
so we're sitting here at two thousand
and fifty megahertz jumping down to 2025
so it is dynamically controlling a
little bit fan at 90 percent GPU is at
170 or 107 percent load but on
overclocking I achieved in
we're between 2050 megahertz and 1987
megahertz which is pretty damn
impressive for the 1070 considering it
starts at 1500 and seven so we saw over
500 megahertz overclock that is that's
pretty concerti percent right there
that's a 30 percent overclock that's a
pretty big deal but again even though
this is not gddr5 X it's just g5 is
they're calling it now good I guess GDR
is too hard to say plus 500 on the
memory so again 11,000 effective on the
memory that's actually a pretty big deal
so what we're going to do now is I'm
going to go ahead here I'm going to load
up doom and it will just do some live
gameplay and then we'll come back with
some final BOTS so we're running 4k
again I want to do 4k testing here
vertical sync is off you can see the
fraps counter there I'll have to tell
you what the OSD is showing that's just
way too small to see anti-aliasing I've
set to SMA a fortunately in 4k you don't
need a lot of post-processing when it
comes to anti-aliasing so on the events
tab here I'm just going to go with the
ultra preset I'm not going to do the
nightmare settings because I've maybe
will test it just to see what happens
but for the initial test here we're
going to do ultra but what we're looking
for here is to see how the FPS does in
4k here obviously with a gtx 1070 so
right off the bat you can see we're
sitting here about the 50 FPS mark sorry
about there being no sound I have no
speakers hooked up even though they're
sitting right there I found a secret Wow
I've been looking for this thing Wow
I almost walked off into the world I'm
so bad at this game oh hello
keys
whoops
you know it's interesting is even though
the FPS is below 60 I'm not feeling it
too much it doesn't feel terrible
well we went all the way down to the 30s
here on this scene core clock is sitting
at nineteen seventy four 22 2012 1987
whoo double barrel this was like the
awesome gun in the original doom in the
double-barrel shotgun
everyone loved some double barrel action
alright so I'm going to go back down to
1440p
Wow you can see the FPS obviously jumped
up quite a bit oh geez what is this guy
oh hell that guy's huge so this was that
gameplay you just saw all of the testing
there this is about twenty minutes worth
you can see right here we stayed well
over two thousand pretty much through
all of it drop down to the high 1900s
1974 1949 looks like 1949 was the lowest
it hit for just a moment there but yeah
it stays really consistent and our max
temperature we achieved was 77 right
there towards the end 77 so yeah that's
not too bad considering it's a under
$400 card from the board partner so it's
going to get you 4k performance most
people don't have $700 to spend on a
graphics card like the GT X 1080 but
that's why the 70 series cards and the
gtx 1070 is a fantastic value like I
said this card the Founders card is four
hundred and forty nine dollars expect to
see them under $400 when the board
partners launch and you're going to get
an amazing gaming card like you just saw
capable of 4k gaming fairly stutter free
yeah it went anywhere between 35 to 55
but that 35 was only for a moment I
didn't I'm an FPS snob and I didn't
perceive any sort of stuttering or
terrible gameplay but most people also
aren't gaming at 4k 1440p is only really
starting to become affordable and as you
saw we achieved well over 60 FPS at
1440p with ultra presets in doom so
that's a very very I think that's great
for the gaming community more gamers are
going to be able to start experiencing
better settings in their games without
having to literally take out a mortgage
to afford any of these gaming components
now obviously when the board partner
cards come out we're going to see better
thermals better noise and hopefully
better clocks although I'm telling you
now the founders cards I have
overclocked very well I don't think
they're cherry picked by Nvidia I think
they're just I think they just perform
very well but obviously we're now
starting to see custom boards available
here for the 1080 and we will see those
for the 1070 giving us better thermals
better acoustics and hopefully better
overclocking so you're going to see this
guy here very soon this is the 1080
gaming x 8g when putting this thing
through its paces and seeing exactly how
it performs it has an extra power
connector so we're going to see does
that extra power connector actually get
you better performance what you guys
have to wait for the next video to see
that anyway guys thanks for watching as
always I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
