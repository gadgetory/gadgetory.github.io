be able to get away from Vega
conversation whether it be the pricing
scandal that everyone's calling it
whether or not there's back-end deals
and it really costs more than the MSRP
the fact that's being marked up
everywhere because of supply and demand
and everyone's been waiting for the
custom cards to come out because even
though they've updated the cooler and it
looks cool this is the special edition
one it is still a reference style cooler
which means they get pretty damn hot
about 85 see but we've actually got the
world's first custom PCB card right here
the Asus Vega almost needed again rx
Vega 64 I'm always gonna call it Vega RX
64 I don't know why but we're gonna talk
about this card we're gonna put it
through the paces we're gonna see
exactly what the difference is between
that guy that that guy and this guy

synergy by using the link found in the
description below now before we actually
unbox this I've got a special edition
unboxing for you guys are you ready my
boxing skills suck and I'm really hoping
I don't break this barely even fits on
the table you know that I should don't
make that face
nick is already anticipating like bad
things to happen oh yeah what could it
be
it's the newest GPU on the market
The BFG 64 I'm waiting for this why do
you look disappointed that nothing's
broken yet I think there's been some
budget cuts at YouTube because last time
I got this it was printed on like
parchment paper now it's just like
regular old printer paper you're bigger
than Vancouver fat joke you're bigger
than Venice you're even bigger than lost
baked 1 million subscribers maybe you've
imagined that day for a long time or
maybe you'd never thought you'd grow so
big I get it I see
the love handles thing right anyway it
looks silver but it's gold it's gold
look at that I find glare there we go
who that dude congratulations for
surpassing 1 million some scrap doors
all right can you take this please
before I break it for real so bonus
unboxing over let's take a look at the
Strix card now I'm gonna go ahead and TL
DR too long didn't read they basically
say this card is only about 2% to 7%
faster than the reference card for a
couple of reasons one the AMD's version
of GPU boost right if it's got
temperature overhead if it's got power
delivery overhead then it's gonna self
overclock itself a little bit farther
but when it comes to the actual
performance right you gain some
performance over time because it didn't
some thermal throttle when it hits the
temperature max like you get on the
reference cards but it also just comes
down 100% to the silicon lottery so the
point of today's video is going to be
how much of that lottery did we win
today now I mean there's always the the
idea of do we get prebend cards right as
reviewers do we get the best of the best
I I instantly don't know the answer that
I hope they're sending us something they
call off the palette that's going to
retail and we are just playing the
lottery game like everyone else but here
it is you guys can see it is indeed a
custom card you can see that the PCB is
much bigger right if we compare it to
the reference card Lou that is a much
bigger PCB which is kind of funny
because if you look at the size of the
card and this right here is actually the
core this is the core the HBM module
it's got all the memory on there so you
can kind of see the
size of it so just like the reference
card it's got two eight pin power
connectors on there but of course it's
got a few extra features right it's got
its RGB connect on there so it can use
Asus Ora tube you can plug RGB LED
strips into this and control it off the
the graphics card and the built-in
software you also have fan headers on
the back so that you can actually speed
up system fans with the graphics card
load the problem is fans are awfully are
often running off of PWM which has to do
with CPU load and when the GPU gets hot
and you guys know in games the CPUs
don't get nearly as hot as a GPU they
don't load up as much the fans may not
ramp up enough which means as this is
blowing heat into your case you need the
case actually expel the heat so as the
graphics card speeds up what you're
going to notice is that your fans in
your case could speed up as well if you
plug them into that but then of course
you have more cables coming off the back
no this is that's the thing when it
comes to overclocking though is more
power does not always mean better
performance things like Pascal sometimes
you can get higher clocks at stock
voltage or even under bolting slightly
versus giving it more power so it comes
down to all kinds of things all kinds of
factors and who knows what we're gonna
get today so rather than sit here and
talk about it I'm going to install it
and we'll see exactly what we got out of
it
all right I've spent about the last
three days tweaking and overclocking in
this car talking to a soos on the phone
text message and stuff because I don't
feel like we're getting as much
overclocking performance out of this as
we would have hoped for a custom PCB now
let me explain the limited edition card
right here overclocked pretty decently
in fact I did a video about that that
you guys can go and check out but
remember these are the exact same cores
inside and the only thing that the
custom manufacturers really have a
chance to play with here is gonna be
things like power delivery cooling and
of course acoustics based on their
cooling designs they're not changing
anything to do with the core the memory
or any of that stuff that is still being
supplied by AMD so we're definitely
gonna be dealing with silicon lottery
here and unfortunately it seems like the
card I have is kind of a loser
and that's why you're not seeing any
slides here comparing it to the limited
edition card because this card was
indeed boosting or turbo clocking up
higher based on conditions then even my
Strix card is that's why I'm saying I
think we have a silicon lottery loser
here now let's go ahead and kind of
demonstrate that I am using the driver
seventeen point eight point two because
ace is confirmed with me after some of
the findings that I had and they've
verified on their end that there is
indeed some sort of weird bug happening
with seventeen point nine points to
where the card is not overclocking or
pushing itself nearly as far as it
should but with that said it's going
take a look here so if we go to the OC
button right there
it basically allows you or allows itself
to just push everything kind of farther
right so it's got this little triangle
here that shows the different modes
obviously this is giving a bias towards
performance where coolness and silences
and it's important to give us all the
performance so we're gonna go ahead and
just load up here heaven benchmark with
everything sort of maxed out on that
we're going with 1440p settings we're
going with anti-aliasing an eight X so
we really just want to push the card as
hard as we possibly can that's got what
they anti-aliasing at 8 X 2 it means
we're also gonna be testing out that
memory cache I mean the massive amounts
of memory in terms of memory speed at
least on this card and we're gonna let
this go here for a few seconds because I
want to see what its gonna sort of boost
up to in fact I already know because
I've already done this test for the last
three days but yeah so what's gonna
happen here is it's going
go up to its max frequency and then
based on temperature is just like GPU
boost 3.0 I guess at based on
temperatures to a power target power
limit how much we have left over it's
gonna start to kind of find its
equilibrium and then that's where it's
just gonna hover let's look at how far
it went here it looks like we went up to
approximately fifteen hundred and fifty
three megahertz but then we sort of
dropped down to fifteen forty fifteen
twenty six fifteen twenty-five fifty
twenty seven fifteen fourteen fifteen
ten right so you could see it was just
kind of doing this over time what I
experienced over the last couple of days
over extended periods of testing was
that the card was dropping all the way
down into the mid-1400s which meant that
that's why this card was actually
beating the Strix and all the game
testing I was doing because this card
although still a reference style fan for
whatever reason even at eighty four C
was still staying at a higher frequency
than the Strix card is the Strix card
just Falls it just Falls fast and I
don't know what the problem is there now
if I go ahead and just come in to the
professional mode right here we can
start playing with things and you could
see the frequencies that you were just
seeing was while it was attempting to
hit sixteen hundred and thirty megahertz
because that's the target
that's the where we want to see the car
to go and it wasn't getting anywhere
close to that was a 1554 was the highest
or 15:53 was the highest we got so that
is extremely unfortunate what I also
find kind of interesting is they show a
voltage slider here which probably works
when it comes to under volting right can
we under built this and have it apply
and that's the apply yes we can't under
Bolton have it apply we can't over volt
right we try and go above 1200 it won't
allow us so what I'm gonna try right now
is I'm gonna go ahead and just try
bringing this back down to the stock
voltage of 1100 because what we've seen
in the past and and other channels have
shown is that under volting this card
can sometimes lead to not only
comparable you know frequency settings
but much lower power draw so I'm just
gonna test that and leave it at 16:30
but also too we go into professional
mode you take it out of OSI mode the
power target goes back to 100% when we
want to push the power target as far as
possible because custom
our custom cooling whom also take
advantage of that so we are going to go
ahead and bump our power target all the
way back up to a hundred and fifty
percent we're gonna apply this now what
we've done we've told it to under volt
and give us more power limit which is
interesting but let's just see what
happens here so the first thing I'm
noticing here with the lesser voltage is
we are not crashing obviously and we are
experiencing less acoustics because of
the fact or lower acoustics because the
fans are not really even ramping up in
fact the first test I did it only took
about 15 seconds before the fans started
to speed up but what we're experiencing
here is that the fans just really are
running nice and slow so what we
experienced now was we went up to
fifteen eighty three like that we went
up thirty megahertz by under volting the
card and allowing more power limit so
what if I put it back to twelve hundred
because we're back up to twelve hundred
we're still at the sixteen thirty target
and we've got one hundred and fifty
percent power limit still applied to the
card let's see if we get the same
fifteen eighty three or four goes back
to fifteen fifty three that will start
to tell us if we are power limited on
this card which I'm assuming we are
that's an assumption anyway and then
what we'll be able to start testing is
how much frequency we can give it so we
went to fifteen fifty six so as you guys
can see we are definitely having power
limit problems with Vega adding more
voltage to the card obviously it doesn't
do anything and and and other channels
have already explored that and shows
that to be true let's see what happens
if we start trying to tell the card to
go to like seventeen hundred what
happens then and we got a crash like
immediately we crashed and this is what
I've been experiencing was anytime I try
to apply any more like frequency to it
above and beyond like where it's going
on its own I'm dealing with these
crashes here so now what I'm gonna test
is putting the voltage back up to the
plus 1200 let's try let's try at eleven
fifty actually let's see if giving it
just a little bit more voltage will
yield different results
nope exact same results alright so I
went to 1660 on the cord and going back
up to 1200 on the voltage but guys I've
spent like I said the last several days
playing around this I already know what
the result is going to be yeah so memory
overclocking though let's go like plus
150 on that in fact I'm gonna put that
back down to 1630 like I said I already
know I already know that this card is
not an overclocker so we were running a
little bit here the fans are blasting
because I told them to
I wanted the fans to blast so let's see
what we got
so again we went up to 15 53 that's as
far as we got with 1553 so we're back to
1100 on the voltage in 1640 on the core
and we remember we're still plus 150 on
the memory but again this is this is
such superficial minimal changes that
we're seeing over like I said we could
get with the limited edition card this
still overclocked farther this guy was
able to achieve like about 1700 before
it started crashing and that's what asus
was telling me their card was able to
achieve when we were on the phone and
talking and testing which leads me to
believe that this is just simply a
silicon lottery Luss now kudos to aces
for sending me a retail sample because
my goal here is to give you guys a
retail experience we went up to 1595
again so out-of-the-box setting at 1200
voltage almost seems like a bad thing at
least for this card I mean could come
down to ASA quality as well so what if I
now try just 1650 okay we're at 1650 I
just want to get that 1600 number but I
don't seem to be able to get 1600 out of
this it just seems to crash well it's a
good sign we didn't immediately crash we
still got only 1595 and it dropped back
down to like 1560 1580 let's try one
more tick
so we're trying just one more takeout
it's a 1660 who's where it's at I think
it's gonna crash not immediately that's
a good sign
okay so we got 1603 on that one
sometimes we need to overclocking and
incrementally increase it slowly you can
get better results than just like moving
the slider instantly but this is where
we had crashed last time and there goes
so hey you guys have it now I tried all
of this that you guys are seeing also
with the built in AMD Radeon software
and was getting the exact same results
so unfortunately guys this is my
experience with the Strix card retail
experience it does not perform any
better than a limited edition card out
of the box in fact it performed a little
bit lower but now I know why right
because if I move the slider on the
voltage down we got better core speed
which brought it up to at least where
this was coming out of the box so what
you were seeing were the exact same
results which is I mean qu6 and of
thermals are what this card is designed
for at least that's what was
communicated to me don't expect a
necessarily better core performance out
of it they're the exact same core is
being sent over by AMD so it's a 100%
lottery it's not like there's a bidding
process that the manufacturer can do on
their own end so it's what it is guys
there you go first look here at the AMD
Strix rx Vegas 64 a little disappointed
but hey you can't win them all thanks
for watching guys oh and also too if you
want merch remember links down below
thanks for watching guys I'll see you
