why today we're taking a look at the Z
390 dark we're gonna talk about the
sexiness that is the Z 390 dark from
EVGA but before that we need to thank
our sponsor that is Corsair and brought
to you by their new high performance
desktops learn more about the Corsair 1
PC in the description below ok so the Z
390 dark another collaboration obviously
between EVGA and the vents kingpin this
is an overclocking board you know okay
so EVGA has had the classified series
but the dark is something they brought
back we've obviously seen it with the XT
99 dark that's what we've been using
with our 79 80 XC and our 99 ATX II
motherboard but mainstream obviously
with there being more cores and more
threads and multi-threaded you know
monsters that are coming out on both AMD
and Intel obviously this is EB J's Intel
design for overclocking up like 90 100 K
9700 K or any ninth gen mainstream
processor now you might notice this has
got an extremely robust vrm or digital
power delivery for the CPU but it's
rotated in a very awkward position it's
got this huge cut out right here for
ninety-degree power cables 24 pin and of
course to a pin ups and the RAM is
sitting up here at the top and what they
found was this allowed for one a very
clean design in terms of power but
you're not splitting the power separate
from each other so normally you'd have
the 24 pin over here and the 8 pin
summer up here and then you'd have
memory over here and you have these
weird cross you know motherboards
falling over you have this weird cross
traces on top of each other or going
around
routing weird pads around the board they
basically said if we rotate this 90
degrees we can make you much cleaner
design a much shorter design for both
memory power and power power and power
power plugs power delivery those two
powers and they found that this was
better for overclocking so we haven't
actually tested this we hope to do
something with this in the near future
but it's got a very over built vrm so
how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 15
I can't count 16 phase power I don't
know what that split between memory and
CPU but it's got a lot and look at all
of them diodes look at that it's got so
many doodads that you're guaranteed to
get a good
but it isn't incredibly over-designed in
a good way motherboard 10 layer PCB you
know high content gold pins 16 phase
power now a lot of people might look at
this and go why are there only two RAM
slots well obviously if you've if you've
never dealt with overclocking when you
have a lot of RAM sticks that puts more
stress on the memory controller which
can limit your overclocks on your cpu so
it's just one slot per channel meaning
that this is obviously designed for
motherboard
overclocking rather than Mayo straight
up like desktop workstation solutions
with high amounts of RAM so you can do
288 sticks or even to 16 years sticks
and have 32 gigs of ram in this but as
you can see right here 2 m dot 2 slots
right next to each other in between the
PCI Express 16 X 4 X and other 16x it's
really well thought out so I do want to
get my hands on this and do some testing
with this we never really pushed the
1900 K at all in terms of overclocking
so we get our hands on one of these
maybe we'll do some ln2 on that as well
we've got three BIOS on this motherboard
so if we break a BIOS we've got a couple
to back us up so guys tell me what you
think of the Z 390 dark it's been a
while since we've seen the dark name and
obviously with the latest Intel launches
EVGA has brought back that lineup but I
just felt that this motherboard was
worth climbing into bed with they know
yeah I probably climb into bed with any
motherboard cuz I'm just that much of a
tech nerd by digressed guys thanks for
watching today's video at CES 2019 and a
huge thanks to Coursera for sponsoring
our trip check out the Corsair 1 desktop
PC in the link in description below tuck
this guy in here there we go little
fella we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
