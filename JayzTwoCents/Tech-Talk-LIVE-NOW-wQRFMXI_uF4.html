can you can you guys see me what's going
on guys js2 since i don't have a guest
today we were gonna have a very well
it's a very special some people may know
who he is some people may not have so
we're gonna just hold off on that until
I don't know next week maybe we'll see
he has a very busy schedule it's not
boogie if you guys are thinking boogie
so we'll see what we can do so sista
it's dead thank God it's dead for now
and a lot of people might have really
wondered what's the big deal about sis
but I understand the way it's worded is
that for our safety and stuff to protect
us against international hackers that
might try and bring cyber terrorism
amongst the United States so I don't
understand the problem well um here's a
problem with sista is it was it was a
document that was written up very
vaguely which the government really
likes to do and in fact I want to put my
headphones on here because I want to be
able to hear sorry and so what the
government does is they try and scare
you into thinking oh my god if I don't
give the government this power to spy on
us digitally
our country is going to come to a
screeching halt so what happens is then
they come up with this vague wording
that says okay well in the name of
cybersecurity we are again going to
allow major companies like Google and
Yahoo and Bing and all of your ISPs and
any Internet traffic that you go to
including from your phone or your tablet
to your devices or whatever to turn over
your information to the US government
should you be suspected of being some
sort of a cyber terrorism terrorist and
the problem in the wording and the
reason why the Senate shot down sista
was because the wording was so vague
that there was no protection really the
proposed to be protection turned out to
be nothing more than invasion of privacy
so I agree with wanting to protect us
against cyber terrorism because you know
Korea North Korea has been cyber
attacked Iran Iraq all of those
countries have been attacked cyber Lee
cyber Lee anyway that's a word it might
be a word like the adult industry but
anyway so I agree that there needs to be
something there but the problem is the
Internet has no jurisdiction the
Internet has no international boundaries
and it just was really ugly so I for one
am happy that sis before now has been
shot down to protect our privacy it's
going to take a lot of time and a lot of
effort a lot of work for the government
any government whether it be you know
NATO or whatever to determine what's
considered legal and illegal in privacy
and whatnot so anyway you're just
joining we were talking about the fact
that sistah was shot down by the US
Senate as a being difficult or not
difficult but invasion of privacy that
there was it was to vaguely worded to
protect our privacy so go ahead and hold
tight here guys let me go ahead and
tweet out that I am currently live here
on the interwebs bringing you some of
your favorite tech talk stuff from your
geek your resident tech geek guy yep
I am live come hang out now talk about
whatever you want doesn't you have to be
tech related today I'm just in a good
mood so I'm going to talk about whatever
you want tech related non tech related
the draw my life that draw your life
video cards which always seems to be the
case we talked about video cards and a
little bit later in this live stream I'm
gonna do something special I'm gonna
take a survey and we're gonna determine
if i'm addicted to something or not
looking to be gonna be food it could be
games could it be adult content what's
jay's to sense addicted to chances are
weird day to do the same thing anyway
refreshing the stream here we have 23 of
you in here which is good but the
problem is that about half way through
the stream we're gonna get like 50 all
in here and then people are gonna be
like what'd I miss come on tell me yay
and then I end up having to repeat and I
say guys go back and watch the replay
but i'm pretty happy because a lot of
the replays are getting anywhere between
five hundred to a thousand views
depending on you know what the content
is and you guys know what the content of
these live streams is it to me getting
on here for an hour trying to see an
entertaining by myself answering your
questions without making you guys leave
or unsubscribe that's harder than you
may think that's really hard and if you
guys have been following me on twitch
you know i'm doing a one hundred-percent
live let's play a bioshock infinite
amazing game absolutely amazing game and
when that is over i am going to be doing
my next live let's play will probably be
tomb raider hear good things about that
game boogie himself highly recommends it
i will never be the live streaming
warcraft and if i do if i ever get back
in the warcraft and i start live
streaming again i will live stream herb
picking for like 10 hours I've done it
ah that's why I don't play wow anymore
because I was that guy that was like
Mustafar I'm herbs must farm herbs I'm a
druid I can instant platform must worm
farming herbs friends come in what are
you doing primaris wanna play no want to
go the bar no bring me something what
are you doing farming herbs why have to
make potions for what my raid at the
farm so that's why I don't play warcraft
anymore because my soul belong to
blizzard for nearly six years straight
and if any of you play warcraft right
now besides those in here that we
already know play warcraft all of y'all
see on the other side that's all I'm
gonna say you guys know the routine if
you want to ask me two questions do it
on Twitter do it on Facebook take your
chances on youtube because they don't
always come not always sometimes i do
sometimes they don't and if we want the
the comments to make it over here
sometimes you have to spam and then
people don't like that and they mark you
as spam and i don't see it so so what it
is what it is so if you guys have
questions start asking them now now wait
a little bit of a backlog of questions
and i don't have to go and search for
them and stuff because that's really
really annoying and i see some new faces
here see one thing you guys have to know
about me is I have a photographic memory
and I have a freaky freaky photographic
memory like I remember things that I
should probably not remember some things
you know they say can't be unseen yeah I
I see them in HD I can't unsee some
stuff huh anyway ask your questions now
I'll get to them I promise I I will do
my best um been hanging out and talking
with boogie a lot lately and we're going
to be getting him back on the livestream
hopefully in here in the next few weeks
might end up on his channel as well so I
know we all love and know our favorite
big guy and we're gonna all hang out
together so uh one of the forms I go to
has some interesting news they have a
like I just a whole technology blog news
section that's kind of where I go for a
lot of my topics and and some of this
stuff has just been
like the polish Prime Minister gives
brock obama which or two as a present
why is that news but what I found really
interesting is that there was a poll
conducted of what the best laptop you
could possibly buy for Windows is if you
use windows as your operating system
what is the best laptop you can buy and
do you guys know what the answer that
pole is if anyone knows the answer to
that pole put it in the chat I would
love to see if you guys actually know
this and I know this because I do it
myself to be able to play or use windows
in the best environment you possibly can
so I'm waiting to see if any of those
comments roll in and then i'll go ahead
and and answer that but this this is a
real poll and i can tell you right now
second place is like a
five-hundred-dollar acer and I had an
acer laptop i love my laptop it was
pretty awesome now i have a toshiba and
an HP probook why i have like two or
three laptops is beyond me but that's
what I have because I'm addicted to
technology and you guys know it ah yes
teku 175 got it it was the 2012 macbook
pro and i'll have people were going in
macbook that's no operating teaching for
a macintosh right for iOS a boot camp
dual boot for some reason the hardware
even though it's intel-based it's the
same stuff that goes in your computer in
my computer just seems to operate much
better on a Mac platform I wonder if
some of that has to do with the type of
ram that macbook pros use because they
there is when you upgrade the RAM in
your macbook because i have a macbook or
my wife does actually i sold mine then
everyone now and then i use hers and
it's pink but anyway the ram in there is
a little bit different I mean it's still
ddr3 and and but it's just the way it's
registered is a little bit different the
way the operating of the motherboard is
arranged just it's slightly different
that's why when you go to upgrade ram
and a macbook pro if you go to like
Newegg there is like Mac certified ram
I'm just thinking it has to do with
something with that so anyway people are
asking me about video cards what else is
new i'm going to change the title of
this to graphic talk with jay tues geez
actually we might get a lot of views
if I named it graphic talk with Jays two
cents hmm Jay's two sets reads Fifty
Shades of Grey I can't get weird cannon
yeah anyway I maybe I'll do that one day
je reads Fifty Shades of Grey so I've
seen some tweets coming in let's say we
got here uh Jacob warden says if I had a
choice between the galaxy s4 in the s3
what would I pick up and why or what
would you pick and why you're due for an
upgrade well I mean I have you guys have
seen it i have my galaxy right here and
i have my iphone right here i carry two
because you know I got 14 I got one for
my business and then one for my business
so I haven't used the galaxy s4 yet I'm
trusting reviews like John for lakers
and phoneDog and all those guys like you
guys all right now because I don't have
one and it just barely became available
and they're backward and all that fun
stuff I don't know I'm trying really
hard I've been spamming my my real life
friends and on facebook and what not
saying if any of you guys get an s4
you're coming over for like five hours
and you're gonna let me borrow it we're
gonna I'm gonna play your phone and I'm
gonna make love to it and then I'm going
to turn determine whether or not I'm
satisfied at the end of it that's that's
how i do my reviews guys I make love to
all the stuff I review and then I do the
review I see just how i feel afterwards
if i want more than it passes the review
and i'm kind of i want to start you know
I'm I've get companies now that have
been contacting me about doing reviews
and stuff which is cool because I'm
finding myself in that level now but I
there's a had this idea been toying
around in my head and I probably won't
do it because I think it would make
people afraid to send me things but if
any of you guys watch the channel Ashens
a sh e NS is a british guy he does like
not really spoof reviews he just does a
lot of like knockoff reviews like the
weird stuff he just he'll just review
like weird stuff and he's hilarious I
kind of want to start doing some reviews
like that but I'm kind of thinking now
because I'm starting to people are
starting to realize that when I don't
like something i'll run it over with the
Durango
I'm kind of thinking now I want to have
a little review series to see does it
get the tire or not we're gonna take a
ran into a review of my fan remote
control we're gonna determine whether or
not this stays on the desk or it gets
the tire I kind of want to do that I
think it would be fun but then again
nobody's gonna want to send me anything
is are gonna be afraid if I don't like
their product I'm gonna run it over and
who wants that but anyway ah Jonathan
Voss wants to know if i play minecraft
absolutely not I do not play minecraft
uh however um I do have a friend last
night that offered to buy me minecraft
however holy Jim Carrey's in here
all right sorry um I had a friend
offered to buy it for me last night I
respectfully declined because I don't
want to take a game I don't take money
or anything out of anyone's pocket
especially when I know that this guy is
he's young and he doesn't have a lot of
money doesn't have a job so I don't want
him to buy me the game because I I know
for a fact I wouldn't have the time to
play and he would want me to play it
with him and it's not like it's a viewer
i don't know i mean i know the guy i
just wouldn't take his money because i
would feel bad taking his money in this
game and not be able to play it that
just doesn't seem right or fair so let's
go and check out some of the youtube
comments here um what's the most i have
ever paid for a laptop well that would
be my macbook pro and that was a little
over two thousand dollars I look back
now and I'm not sorry I really did like
my macbook I I took it everywhere I put
that thing through hell I it's been on
so many plane flights it's been with me
in so many hotels I played Warcraft on
it for a couple of years and it played
Warcraft just fine it wasn't a
powerhouse gaming machine you get I mean
I really liked it so uh Jim Carrey says
yo mama been hiding her master
masturbatory portage I'm assuming he's
referring to the guy who found Fifty
Shades of Grey in his basement maybe it
wasn't his mom's you can't judge and you
can't assume that's profiling Jim care
that is profiling bull moose vsx he has
a different style of citta satire than
UJ who are we talking about I already
forgot what if I said in this dream
we're like 17 minutes into it not just
here blab that bad I have no idea what
I've said so anyway my eyes look like
they've seen things my eyes cannot unsee
the things they have seen I fall asleep
at night sometimes and I wake up
screaming because my wife just kneed me
in the crotch while rolling over no
seriously because of the fact that is
just some things in life you wish you
could unsee you wish you could partition
and format that part of your brain which
you can't Gerard w98 and I'm hoping that
doesn't mean you're still on Windows 98
so anybody got a fix for coil wine on
7870 gigahertz other than hot glue nail
polish remover an RMA nope and even
those fixes aren't guaranteed because
coil wine happens inside the capacitor
you can't do anything about it it's a
copper coil that's why it's called coil
wine and as electricity goes through it
it gets excited and it vibrates at a
different frequency as the load changes
and it starts vibrating and bouncing off
the sides of the little metal case that
it's him you get then what's called coil
wine and you can't do anything about it
so what they did was they made solid
capacitors that are already filled in
there with like a almost like a hot glue
type of rubber that keeps it from moving
so the problem is some of the capacitors
are advertised as solid capacitor and
there's been people on YouTube that have
done reviews on these things that they
say hey look this says solid capacitor
design but it's whining so on my camera
they'll crack open no cut open one of
the capacitors I'll cut it off and break
it open nothing nothing in there just a
coil nothing blocking it so that's the
problem they these somebody's
manufacturers are advertising solid coil
Japanese coils or capacitors but they're
not so you never really know I guess but
it's been companies though like sapphire
and like diamond and usually AMD brands
that are doing it you know he'd get coil
one on nvidia cards for the most
so whatever and if you guys missed last
week I did a pretty epic minesweeper
live stream yep if you guys were in that
mine stream that mine stream epic
sweeper if you were in that live stream
last week where I did mine crap ARB Mike
I haven't been drinking I promise but I
kind of wish I was right now oh if you
guys were in that mine sweeper live
stream would you guys think of that that
was fun and I remember it took what it
took my took my four-year-old daughter
coming in here and helping me for me to
finally beat it uneasy and she was
getting the hang of it too I think you
guys saw like she was starting to
actually get the get the concept of the
game so anyway derp Adele's dad says Jay
if you could get technological implants
to change your body's performance in any
way what would you get and why oh that's
a good question so if I could like make
myself only part of myself Bionic right
is that we're talking about here like
you save technological implant I'm gonna
assume Bionic then right like the time
like the Million Dollar Man but with
inflation now it's like the seventeen
point six million dollar man but what I
get in why oh gosh want to think about
that one see I know you and I know where
your mind is going but I don't need an
implant or to be Bionic I think maybe
gosh I really don't know I I don't know
if I can say I I I don't know I really
don't god estrella needs a new memory
chip hmm my memories just fine the
things like I forget I choose to forget
it's where my wife says I have selective
memory and where was I no I'm just
kidding gotcha uh mophead says Jay what
do you think of hackintosh you're
contemplating on building one for a
video editing photo editing etc I've
never tried it I've thought about it
I've just I guess because I fooled
around on iOS Allah enough to where I
didn't I kind of lost its appeal in
Lester to me so I just came back to
windows and the programs i'm using or
just fine on windows platform so I never
really needed it spoke a VX what are my
thoughts on ivy bridge cpus they're a
little hotter than sandy bridge because
they changed the way the heat spreader
works there about ten percent faster
than sandy bridge there are dead they're
a dead end platform if you go to ivy
bridge today you can't you have no
upgrade paths in the future because
they're moving away from that socket
again and ironically they're going back
to the 2011 socket which was an old
socket because then tells until I didn't
give me water dammit it's not stuck um
anytime Intel's moved forward into a new
platform they've always made a new
socket and with that you know they just
kept progressing forward and forward and
forward Kyle Evans you know yeah lga775
and we had 2011 1186 and I LED 55 and
they just kept moving forward and they
never went backwards but the problem is
now they went to 1155 alem 56 and now
they're going back to 2011 I the only
reason I can think that they're doing
that is Haswell is going to be bringing
more a consumer level affordable six
core and eight physical core processor
so I think they're going to come out
with an eight-core processor a physical
eight-core processor and their six core
extreme series is going to be you know
it's going to advanced far enough to
where it's cheaper and affordable so
they needed a larger socket so that's
where they went back to 2011 because if
you've compared 2011 to 1155 it is like
it is huge it's like this is 1155 and
this is like 2011 its massive it's got
two latches to hold it down because of
that ah Flynn Graham wigan says mine
stream pics sweeper
mainstreaming sweeper was awesome yes it
was oh goodness refresh comments for the
love of God okay uh Gerard says thanks
for response it was really quickly oh
you know what guys I have a lot of stuff
I want to do video wise and I took a
little break there it really slowed down
on the content I was putting out because
I had to kind of I had to I had to play
family man a little more because I was
really neglecting some things and I was
smart enough to recognize it before it
became damaging so I backed off a little
bit and you know what they say leavin
want more that's what all you guys want
you guys want more JS to sense your kind
of retarded for wanting more anyway I
see the word penis and why is all the
word penis I've like a whole wall of
text ICPs 79-54 gaming yeah the 7950 is
were gaming this absolutely a beast 600
other pc gaming a gaming pc build it's
not going to be beast for 700 600 bucks
but it's going to be a computer that's
for sure sergeant roosters j what about
the new AMD richland AP use I've always
I have always recommended am DAPs over
anything in tell their APU technology is
really good and you can always crossfire
the APU with you know their lower end
line of graphics cards which gives you
the pretty decent performance so
everything's moving so quickly again
thought is check Twitter here real quick
I don't see anything on facebook most
people don't go to facebook to post
their comments which is it is good I
guess oh you know I got one I bond luque
says hey Jay can you make any
recommendations for a cheap build for
video editing well do you understand
even a cheap build can do can edit video
but the question is how long do you want
to take to render that video
so the amount of money you put in is
going to directly affect how long it
takes for that video to be rendered so
at any computer you build can render a
video just how long is going to take
I've rendered video on my my athlon dual
core at work it took like an hour to do
it I think an eight-minute video but I
did it Flynn's happy being retarded well
I'm happy for you and if I have
subscribers that are silly because they
want to watch me than hey we've been
there we've done that we're gonna oh ok
he said whatever best Beast ok best 600
all our gaming build pc 600 bucks get
yourself an AMD 4300 cpu if you can the
cheapest am3 socket motherboard that you
can find or an through + motherboard
itself 8 gigabytes of ram which still
the fastest a hard drive that you can
get in there a 7200 RPM 64 megabyte cash
probably something around 500 gigs or
less won't be able to afford more than
that cheap case make sure it's got fans
on it graphics card that you can afford
something like maybe a 77 70 or even a
7750 about the best you can be able to
do for 600 bucks and the operating
system you're on your own because
there's no money left over what's my
facebook name JS two cents you can go
find my my facebook youtube page there
850 600 k or the 8 10 50 100 cable
that's pretty self-explanatory the 810
the 5800 k is their top-of-the-line apu
it's going to be better estrella has to
run to the store get me something to
drink while you're there give me some
purple drank yeah do some of that stuff
Griff tosses you may have missed this
earlier but my thoughts on the Radeon
7990 it's got crossfire built-in I would
if you could afford it i would go with
something like the asus you know there's
i remember what it's called god I'm
drawing a blank right now I've got to
concede sometimes with Ares the Ares go
with Ares yes do i do liquid cooling
absolutely go to my channel look at my
computer setup video and you'll see my
water cooling there it's
it has been upgraded a little bit since
then in fact I have a camera inside my
computer that i sometimes use when I'm
doing my livestreams like for gaming and
stuff and it's kind of funny see there's
the camera right there from inside my
computer and you can see some of my
water cooling right there yep because
I'm why people have asked me why do you
have a camera in your computer you
didn't mean yes and it's like why not
god that's epic why not have a computer
camera inside my computer there it is
see you can see some of the tubes right
there and you can see my water reservoir
and you can see my triple radiator fan
and my water cooled gtx680 right there
put that over my face and you can see
that I've got an asus republic of gamers
a motherboard and that's my pump that
goes off to the left a little bit there
and then in the below this camera right
next to it actually is another radiator
at that bottom so yes do I water cool
absolutely I am a big advocate of water
going Jessica Gleeson says my draw my
life was awesome I wish I could you know
I'll talk about that if you guys haven't
seen my draw my life and it's not your
thing no worries if you do like it uh
thank you boogie and I talked about it a
bit today because you know I had watched
history all my life a while back and you
watch mine today and it's pretty funny
when and I'm gonna apologize here for
some foul language because I tried I try
to beat not be that youtuber that cusses
all the time but it slips out from now
and then but boogies exact words to me
today when he watched it was man
the women in your life suck and he's all
oh well of course except for your wife
you know it yeah yeah you're right I
wish I could say that getting to the
point to where I am today has been
awesome but it hasn't been naturally um
you know like anybody else I don't I
don't tell anyone that my life's been
harder there's and I don't want anyone
to tell me their life has been harder
than mine everybody's life is their life
our problems are completely
perspective you know my problem is my
problem and it may not be as bad as
someone else's but the bottom line is
it's mine and I don't put any one else's
problems or discount them because I
think mine are harder so there's been
people that they've had much harder
life's in mind and you know granted my
childhood I felt like was you know
nearly destroyed because of this this
group of kids and I was talking to my
wife about it 515 in the morning the day
after I put that vid because I put the
video of it like 10 I think was like 10
at night something like that maybe 1030
couldn't really sleep that night because
I was worried about the comments and the
likes and dislikes and the reviews of it
and you know how many people were gonna
be like Oh boohoo you had a hard life
you were bullied ugh man up blah blah
blah you know that's that's the typical
response people give so I didn't sleep
very well and I woke up early the next
morning like two hours where I to get up
for work and my wife was awake too and
we just she watched it that morning and
you know we laid in bed and she watched
it and I just kind of like laid there
and you know I mean she cried she knew
all that stuff we've talked about it a
lot she knew yes she's the girl the
woman who cheated on me 13 times
something i didn't put in there and i'll
give you guys just a little bit of extra
because you can only fit so much in the
video it's only 16 minutes and i hope
you guys don't mind me talking about
that and getting off the text subject
for a few minutes here not only not only
did she cheat on me with 13 different
people some of those people were at the
same time so let's just put it that way
and it just got it just got WAY WAY WAY
deeper than i expected it to and and it
was like that was just extremely like
devastating but my wife knew this person
and they were in choir together in
school and they were in classes together
and they weren't like friends but they
had interacted a lot and so when my wife
learned um about my ex she
you know she was like oh you got to be
kidding me and she at that point was
like wow okay the problems that I've
been seeing like because I mean let's
face it I've had problems I had trust
issues and all that she's like okay it
makes perfect sense so anyway I just
thought I'd give you guys a little bit
of a little bit deeper in there because
I have a soft spot for you people who
show up to my live streams and the
people on Twitter and all that because
you guys take the extra step to get to
know me so ocasio says let's be positive
and let's talk hardware you love me I
love you more let's say Jim Carrey wants
to know how much did it cost to make a
basic gaming pc if you were on a small
budget I would say if you have to buy an
operating system i would say six hundred
dollars i think would be the least i
would go if i want because you're on
you're on the technology edge right now
everything right now is it's on the end
of its cycle and this year new stuff is
going to be coming out so my advice to
you would be to wait if you can what is
it now it's what we're going to may if
you can try and wait three more months
you're going to start seeing more
hardware coming out by these companies
by AMD intel nvidia which is going to
make the current more expensive hardware
today get cheaper so you can build a
better computer for 600 bucks in three
months and you can today so i would
recommend that you you wait three months
if you can and put aside about 600 bucks
someone here killer night k98 killer is
saying he built a 450 dollar pc last
weekend with a one terabyte barracuda FX
4100 eight gigs a CX 500 and a sapphire
7770 and the cam in the computer is
pretty epic well there you go 450 bucks
he did that a newer used I don't know
for those prices i would kind of think
used but if you got it new more power to
you he's he's saying at least 400 with
me I still think 600 but that's just me
so Timmy k Timmy Timmy Timmy to my hope
is singing your name right first time
when my livestreams you're really
enjoying keep it up hey thanks you know
I i I've been doing this now for a
couple of months and I'm trying to make
it a bit more regular but the problem is
I don't have a regular schedule
so do the best I can the Miss Jays two
cents right now mrs. JC since whatever
the mrs appropriateness is is she's out
getting her hair did she's getting there
her hair did and so grandma the the one
that got ran over by the reindeer is out
there watching my kid and I'm in here
talking y'all and when I'm done here I'm
gonna make my uncle make myself some
supper and I'll watch a little TV with
my daughter when I get going down give
her a bath and then after I get done
scrubbing in bubbles I'll put her in her
her jammies put her in bed and I'm gonna
come back in here I'm playing me some by
sharks yep well I'm talking like this I
have absolutely no idea I never lived in
the south you saw my video i was i was
born up in newton that that's a suburb
of Boston you know it's a little bit a
little bit west and salad with southwest
to Boston there and then one day when I
hopped in the car and drove out here to
California and they don't talk like this
in California that's for sure in fact if
I I'll go talk like this neighbor Eileen
I'm I likely get shot I mean they're
fixing the hanging from a tree I don't
know I do have a cousin that lives in
charlotte north carolina right there on
the ocean he's got a little house a
little bench on there and a swing and
he'll sit there and he'll calm and you
Bill hey Jay what you doing I'll be like
oh nothing I'm just playing computer
games no I'm just I'm just sitting here
smoking my pot looking at the ocean
hearing them waves crash on the beach is
so serene y'all's to fly out here one
day and you know come visit me ma'am and
play some golf or something maybe go
shoot some quail I don't know it's a
pretty good hiking up in here but you
know we got the ocean and I'm like yeah
but but because why would I want to
watch the sunrise over the ocean when I
can watch it set over my ocean he's like
well damn it I'm just looking for a
reason you know what
he's a lot of really chaps my hot and
you hung up the phone so anyway uh I
should do tech talk on Saturday or
whatever yeah when you have a kid and a
life and when you I'm helping a friend
tomorrow build a fence and when he asks
me if I can help build a fence and I
look at my life and I say am i available
tomorrow and then she's like let me look
and they shall we ran a little butch vig
yep you're free from 11 to four or seven
to nine but other than that Owen Sunday
um you got about a two-hour window
between three and five but I would I
wouldn't I wouldn't cut it that close
because we couldn't have having company
come a little bit early so I would just
go ahead and leave sunday out so yeah
anyway there that's why I don't do these
live streams on weekends and I would
love to because I did a live stream the
other earlier in the week I took some
time off from work and I did an earlier
in the day stream and for it
specifically I did like 1030 for my
european asian and australian fans and
that was a fun live streaming that you
guys got really interactive because you
guys were excited yeah live stream when
we get the watch and it's like one in
like three months I'm gonna apologize
for that guy's by then I have no control
over my schedule uh sorry the pro gamer
1027 wants to know if I speak Spanish
considering a live in Southern
California would think I should but I
don't I don't speak Spanish at all sorry
tammie kay do you think the line between
laptop gaming and desktop gaming gaming
is getting thinner um nope yeah
hardware-wise yeah price-wise it still
economically makes no sense to buy a
gaming laptop and less which is ironic i
say that because i have a
three-thousand-dollar laptop review on
my channel unless you you travel a lot
or your you just have no place to set up
shop then I don't recommend a gaming
laptop the hardware the hardware is not
as good as what happened here my music
oh there we go the the hardware like the
680 m is not equal to a 680 graphics
card for your desktop a 680 m is more
like a 660 version up a desktop it's
just not the same and they cost so much
more I just don't believe it Sanchez
kids 49 have I played don't starve I
haven't but if it's that awesome maybe
i'll check it out Oh Castillo said can I
get your personal opinion on the new
asus p9x79 e WS just ordered yours
yesterday it was 500 is that a laptop it
obviously if I don't know what the
numbers mean I probably can't get much
of an opinion on it I'm sorry but if
it's p9x79 I know what x 79 days and I
know what the p9 is its are you talking
about motherboard if you talk about the
motherboard the the asus x79 platforms
and the their outstanding in fact i
would but if i'm going into i would buy
one in a heartbeat the problem is i
still like the looks of them tammie kay
has an m17x r4 an inn and you know that
for for what you spent you haven't got
much better for the price you would have
gotten much better for the price had you
got a pretty decent oh you got a decent
deal yeah i had alienware and i'm not a
big fan of alien where is the m17x is
that's alienware right spoke a viet says
you're looking for a great graphics card
you know they're probably going with
nvidia and need to know whether to get
the 660 ti or the 670 what do you think
you're building the pc in the middle of
june go with the 670 the 670 does
outperform the 660 ti and depending on
which TI you get it's only on 50 or 60
bucks more so i would get that the
Joseph 94 wants to know do I think they
will ever water cool laptop that's
already out it's already been done it's
just it's not practical because of you
need radiator space you need surface
area and to make it work and to keep it
all internal it's just the technology is
not there
it you take away a lot from the water
cooling and you add more to the weight
and density of the laptop it just
doesn't make sense xlp 48 says you think
a really good gaming laptop its weight I
think a really good gaming laptop for
its price for a gaming laptop is the
lenovo y500 and i was looking at the
lenovo stuff over at CES in January I've
got some really good stuff German Caesar
is it worth purchasing in 1866 megahertz
8 gigabyte memory if you already have 8
gigabytes of 1333 megan's you have an
8350 here's what you need to understand
about that ramp you're going to pop that
1866 megahertz in your AMD motherboard
and you're going to go to the bios and
you're going to look at it and it's
going to show that it's running at 1333
and you're going to go i have to make
any sense i don't understand you have to
overclock to get to those speeds those
speeds are the XMP profile which in most
cases you we have to overclock to get to
those speeds so so the common question I
get asked is hey I bought this speed ram
but it's only showing this but you don't
understand and yeah it's a little more
complicated than just putting it in
Australia's back she says I'm back sorry
they were out of purple drank so I got
red drink also got you a sammich what
kind of sammich I don't eat bread I want
to look that gift horse in the mouth
feel weird yet there ok a CEO 23 jay
says saw your anger video the gtx titan
do you really hate it that much i will
explain this again the gtx titan is
really the gtx 680 the 680 we were
promised last year we were promised
gk110 graphics unit GPU in the 680 and
March comes around and they ship out the
first review you models of the gtx 680
and they open it up people like linus
tech tips and motherboards org and all
those guys they take it and the first
thing they do is they say yay we got new
graphics card do you think they throw it
in the computer in bench market know
they take it apart and they examine you
know what model capacitors
using what's the GP at its use what's
the cooling method and you'll tear it
apart before they even plug it ever plug
it into a computer and what does it say
right on the top of the graphics unit
inside on top of the GPU heat spreader
it says gk104 the gk104 was the 660 Ti
GPU that was promised back in like
November when they gave the road map of
the GPU die set up and the way it was
the roadmap to come out so what do they
do they go into the bios and they open
up the bios and they unlock it because
the bios is locked and they unlock it
and they they look at the code for the
bios and guess what the gtx 680 the very
one I have sitting in my computer right
now is labeled in the bios in multiple
different references of the code 660 Ti
so what did Nvidia do they took their
reference models and the review samples
the ones that aren't branded with like
MSI or gigabyte or any of that it just
says Nvidia on it it's green and black
they sent that out and what they had
done is they rebranded the 660 Ti
because it was supposed to come out
before the 680 but the 680 came out
first for Nvidia's Kepler line and they
rebranded it the 680 shipped it out and
thought nobody would notice and so all
of these reviewers were going this is
really strange why does it show 660ti in
the bios why is it gk104 was supposed to
be gk110 well in video just kind of like
didn't really answer it and then the 680
then the 680 benchmarks were just
blowing away AMD at the time because the
7970 wasn't the gigahertz edition and it
wasn't a great card so what happened was
Nvidia realized AMD or Nvidia realized
that their 660ti was spanking the 7970
which was only like 800 and some egerton
remember it could barely over talk to a
thousand so they went hey let's save
some money and let's go ahead and extend
our roadmap and let's take the gk110
chip and let's go ahead and kind of like
stockpile it because at the time they
had publicly said there was a shortage
of gk110 GPUs because they're also used
as the gk110 who was also used in
servers as a server processor so major
server manufacturers like barracuda and
Lenovo and all those guys were
buying them up by like the huge huge
quantities so companies like Nvidia
couldn't get their hands on on that
particular GPU they wanted so they took
the few that they had in a stockpile
them and once the demand went down and
just kept buying them as stockpiling
them the meanwhile we're over here
sitting here all excited okay fine our
682 gk104 and a lot of people went to
weigh you know what gk110 maybe it
wasn't necessary because the 104 is so
powerful well if you fast-forward and
I'm apologize you guys have already
heard this story but when someone asks I
have to explain that video AMD put out
some teaser photos of what nvidia
thought was the 8000 series graphics
card like the 8790 and the 88 90 and all
of that stuff and they Nvidia was three
months late to the party because Nvidia
or AMD 7970 debuted January in the
Nvidia 680 came out March twenty seconds
so over three months later Nvidia lost a
lot of money a lot of investors had a
lot of explaining to do to their
investors on why they were three months
late to the 28 nanometer GPU process
graphics cards and why they were losing
money to a AMD it was the first time AMV
pulled ahead of nvidia in like five
years so AMD AMD put up those photos
making and this was around November
making a nvidia think that they were
coming out with a new graphics card and
even guys look linus tech tips were
putting videos out about these photos
and those photos even showed a dual GPU
graphics card well Nvidia got a little
bit antsy and they thought it was a
thousand and remembering what happened
last year they didn't want to beat that
but late to the show again so what they
did was they went ahead and they put out
a press release and I remember the image
because I got sent one as well it was a
black background and it was the like a
close-up like like it let's say my hand
is a graphics card is that close to the
camera like that and you could see the
little fan and it was all like barely
visible like a silhouette and the text
just said it's coming and everyone's
going wow oka the 700 series a 700
series so AMD puts out that press route
that little notice that says hey guys
it's coming
and AMD has and there's no pun intended
by the way over there so in a nvidia is
known for once i send out those teasers
inside of a month they start sending out
the keynote invites to all the tech
blogs and so what does AMD do like the
same week they announced to their
investors that they are not going to be
coming out with 8000 series until
quarter 3 of this year so they made
nvidia show their hand early nvidia had
no choice but to go forward with it and
so they debuted what people thought was
going to be the 700 series and they come
out with this bucking titan and here is
why i'm so mad about the titan it's
gk110 it's got an eighth of an 8-pin and
a six pin power connector it's got a
384-bit memory bus it's six gigabytes of
ram the evolutionary jump between the
480 or the the 282 the 480 to the 580
was incrementally the same like it was
all in the same platform 384 memory bus
a one gig one-and-a-half gig to gig
right and then I think they the
aftermarket ones for the five 80s were 3
1.5 and 3 and those were all about
thirty-five to forty percent faster than
the predecessors well a 680 comes out
it's a 256 memory bus it is a gk104 and
it's two gigabytes of RAM and it was
about fifteen to twenty percent
incrementally better than the 580 the G
key the Titan fit a gap between the 580
to the 680 as to what it should have
been so the 680 falls in between that's
why I'm pissed about the 680 in the
Titan guys is because the Titan is the
680 it is the card that was intended to
be five hundred dollars at launch it was
the card that they stuck back on the
shelf and made a lot of the guys like us
realize that we blew our money on a
mid-range card that they rebranded as a
higher at high-end cart the reason why
it's a thousand dollars is because they
decided to only manufacture a thousand
of them to save their gk110 inventory
because AMD told them and made them come
out with the card early because I wanted
to be AMD to a party that
wasn't even what it wasn't even
scheduled so Nvidia just like got
trolled by AMD and in the process made
us realize that everything we thought
last year about the 660 ti really being
what the 680 is was right that's why i
hate to tighten to tighten that's why I
the thousand dollar price tag is nothing
more than just a big like slap in the
face to us neo high-end hardware
enthusiast so that's why I'm pissed
about it so now they come out with the
700 m the 700 series roadmap and the 700
series is the m-series right now is for
graphics cards for the laptops and
that's the way they always do it they
always come out with the m-series first
and if history and incremental
improvements mean anything with nvidia
and they've been pretty consistent over
the last five or six years it's looking
like the 700 series is going to fall in
between the 680 in the titan they are
now going to specifically slow down the
780 to be slower than the titan because
the titan is their flagship they only
made a thousand of them and now they are
going to throttle the 700 series so that
the seminary of serious fits in line
it's also why the titan didn't have a
name other than titan because i didn't
want it to fall in line with a series
that way they could keep the price high
as a new series comes out I should do a
video on this I really should do a video
explaining this and doing a diagram for
the slow people out there that would
guarantee didn't come into that video
and be like oh you should take the titan
because you can't afford it because
you're stupid and you have no money and
what they don't realize this of course i
could afford it i could go buy one
tomorrow if i wanted but the thing is
i'm not going to pay a thousand dollars
for a five-hundred-dollar graphics card
it is what it is and when the 700 series
comes out the 6 80's can the 680 is
going to probably drop a couple of
hundred bucks down to about 300 i'm
gonna throw a second one in my computer
screw the 700 series i don't even care
anymore anyway bears that's why i was
mad in that titan video now you know you
won't like me when i'm mad cuz i cry
okay I'm Way behind on the questions now
because I put me into like a bit of a
rant hui fam we actually hu why i
believe is we write isn't we because my
guy works for us his name's joey anyway
not to be a fanboy but seven 970 still
whoops at 684 being 152 100 cheaper I
love AMD but that's not true at 1080p
resolution it's not true 1600 p and 1440
it pulls ahead by about five percent
simply because of the fact that it has
higher gr am available to it five
percent is not whipping I'm sorry I
build these computers all the time i
play with the hardware and every time i
build a computer I benchmark the
out of it it's not true the 680 is not
being worked on by the 7970 not a 1080p
which is the most common resolution
people run see people forget in these
benchmarks it's all resolution based if
you take the 680 and dumb it down to
like 720p and then you take a card like
the 660 of the 650 and run it at 720p
they're gonna look a lot similar
graphics wise it 728 680 is not gonna
pull that far ahead people are gonna go
well then what about if 680 because the
650 is just good put it at 1080p put it
at 1200 and then watch that gap grow the
same tour that sort of thing is what's
happening between 7970 and the 680 both
cards are great don't get me wrong and
the opengl is becoming a hell of a lot
more utilized with programs which is
good and with the fact that AMD is going
to be what's in the new ps4 AMD's only
gonna become more mainstream and
depending on AMD comes out with i might
ditch the 680 all together and get a new
series A&amp;amp;B who knows at this point I
don't even know huh sanchez kid 49 wants
to know if I'm mad bro no I'm not
wearing my you mad bro shirt today and
I'm not mad but anyway why does a
straight says why do people think they
need to call me leave me alone let you
watch the livestream yes you need to put
that on your voice message should be
like hello you've met you've called
Astraea
I can't come to the phone right now
because i'm watching Jace to census live
stream and then afterwards they playing
bioshock and i'll be moderating for him
and it's gonna be great maybe you'll do
some minesweeper maybe it's cute little
girl will come in again but i can't come
to the phone right now goodbye that's
what you should say seriously Richard
Torah says you bought a gtx 680 1201
megahert top for 435 excellent deal and
that twelve hundred megahertz you could
probably easily hit 13 I'm hitting 1306
in my reference model guard so all right
there's 75 you in here now and it's six
minutes to the end of the stream why do
you guys wait so long to come in here
gosh maybe I'll go an extra 15 like I
always do um but I had something a
little special i wanted to do here js2
sense is gonna take a survey and here's
what the survey is are you guys ready it
is an Internet addiction test and I've
never taken one of these so I've decided
that I want to take this internet
addiction test live on this live stream
and I've not done it before and so we're
going to take it together i'm going to
read the questions out loud and i'm
going to tell you the choices and i'm
going to choose the answers that best
fit me and we're going to find out is
jay's two cents addicted to the Internet
I don't know maybe I am maybe I'm not I
guess it depends on the definition of
addiction doesn't it anyway here we go
um hold on a second all right how do you
know if you're already addicted to the
rapidly tumbling toward trouble with
that English okay anyway to assess the
level of addiction answer the following
questions using the scale one rarely to
occasionally three frequently for often
or five always there we go question
number one how often do you find that
you stay online longer than you intended
rarely occasionally frequently often
always or does not apply I would say I
nearly always see online longer than I
intended
question number two how often do you
neglect household chores to spend more
time online rarely occasionally
frequently often always or doesn't apply
how often do I neglect house often I
won't say always but I would definitely
say often question number three how
often do you prefer the excitement of
the Internet to intimacy with your
partner whole is miss Geist two
cents watching okay this may have been a
bad idea huh sure i'm reading this right

of the internet to intimacy with your
partner hmm god I'm gonna say rarely

five how often do others in your life
complain to you about the amount of time
you spend online that's my daughter that
question huh how often do others in your
life complain that you to you about the
amount of time you spend online I'm
gonna say occasionally because I've been
pretty good lately about cutting back
and I know you guys have noticed
question 7 how often do you check your
email before some okay fine always but
I've got my phone and everything with

I work in IT is a fair is that seriously
is that fair okay 8 how often does your
job performance or productivity suffer
because of the internet that's just a
trick question I work an IT I spend all

put always because you're living that
life I'm gonna put occasionally 11 how
often do you find yourself anticipating
when you will go online and get always
just be honest I plan my day I haven't

we're gonna be battlefield it's gonna be
great and you can't make me I have
really had that conversation number 12
how often do you fear that life without
the internet will be boring empty and
joyless well depends is always online
drm gonna become a real thing
occasionally occasionally and i cease
i'm kind of glancing over at your
questions here guys I'm not really
watching them at the moment the live
stream is technically over at this point
so we'll talk about anything you guys
want when I'm doing this test whether it
be my bullying story whatever I don't
really care
a good mood today can't bring me down I
don't know who sung a song about can't
bring me down but you can screw you 13
how often do you stop yell or act
annoyed if someone bothers you while
you're online hmm frequently 14 how
often do you lose sleep due to lick
always fair it's gonna make me feel
stupid at the end 15 how often do you
feel preoccupied with the internet went
offline or fantasize about being online
it's like you're at school through the
whistles online right now you know
what'd be cool suppose online right now
when I'm online I'm gonna think about
what I want to think about when I'm
offline oh yeah that's how I see that
question I'm gonna say raley's when I'm
off flying I kind of enjoy it 16 how
often do you find yourself saying just a
few more minutes when online often sure
17 how often do you try to cut down the
amount of time that you spend on the
line and fail

online never because i have my own
internet room see see if the door shut
its private time and you all don't be
stupid and dirty 19 how often do you
choose to spend more time online than
going out with others in fair not fair
stupid frequently if I'm being honest
sir 20 how often do you feel depressed
nughty or nervous when you're offline
which goes away once you were back
online I'm gonna say rarely I don't like
fix over the internet or anything let's
calculate my score shall we my score is
a 53 good after you've answered all the
questions add the numbers you selected
for each response to obtain a final
score the higher your score the greater
level of addiction and the problems your
internet usage causes here's a general
scale to help you measure your score 20
to 49 you are an average online user you
may surf the web a bit too long at times
but you have control over your usage
5279 which happens to be the bracket I'm
in you are experiencing occasional or
frequent problems because of the
internet you should consider their full
impact on your life i have i've met all
of you guys because of it in my life is
amazing so screw you stupid net
addiction calm 80 to 100 your internet
usage is causing significant problems in
your life you should evaluate the impact
of the internet on your life and address
these problems with dr. Phil directly
and it's caused by your internet say
about dr. Phil they actually say Oprah
after you have identified the category
that fits your total score look back at
those questions for which you score to
four or five did you realize that this
was a significant problem for you for
example if you answered for often to
question number two regarding your
neglect of household chores were you
aware of just how often or how dirty the
laundry was piling up or how empty the
refrigerator gets say you answered five
always to question number fourteen about
loss of sleep due to late night logins
that's me have you ever stopped to think
about how hard it was to become to drag
yourself out of bed in the morning you
feel exhausted at work has this pattern
begun to take its toll on your body and
overall health screw you anyway that was
Jay's two cents neck net addiction test
and you know what guys yeah that's true
you know what though sometimes I log out
very very late like it'll be like eleven
o'clock and i'm going okay i'll make it
the bed early i'm gonna divide by
midnight tonight we get bit early all
right and then I crawl in bed and look
at the clock I'm like trying to my eyes
are so burning from being online i'm
like and then the clock will say to 45
and my food anyway Oh casio 23 says what
do you think about Linus's intelligence
in his channel kind of question is that
and what I mean by that is someone's
gonna tell Linus if I say something bad
about him oh I like Linus I I got to see
him when I was at CES Jesus I mean he's
a cool guy I think he has a bit of an
advantage over anybody else in the tech
world because he has like 1800 videos
but that's because he works for NCIX and
he has access to a whole warehouse of
parts and he can just put up a video
whenever he wants fact he does like two
or three a day sometimes I think it's
very smart he knows this stuff I don't I
personally don't find him very
entertaining though I kind of find him
kind of bland that's my honest opinion
so Raquel says if you weren't on the
internet you wouldn't have been able to
take that quiz hey good points yes
alright um gosh I know what you guys are
saying alright guys open forum question
time ask me anything you want and even
if it's a troll question you
I get a troll answer and then you'll
feel stupid and you will have wished you
never asked me a retarded question or
maybe that's what you wanted you thought
in the end you made me feel retarded but
I have quite the experience of dealing
with trolls and I guarantee you you
can't troll a troll no matter how hard
you try it's true all right Sanchez kid
49 wants to know who is the youtuber you
watch most I have quite a few youtubers
that I watch very regularly I really
really like obviously boogie2988 I never
miss anything from boogie that's the
truth and that and you know I i met him
beacon became friends of him because of
his channel and and whatnot so but i
never miss him I never miss a video from
Boogie and in many many cases that have
the the honor of seeing the videos
before anyone else does and helping him
edit them and come up with ideas I do
you guys may be surprised to find out
there are some videos up there that had
been very very successful that I've
given him input and helped with so I
feel like I'm like a little bit of a
part of some of the goodness that comes
out his channel not a lot just a little
bit with that little bit his old a lot
to a guy like me all right um I also
watch nigahiga I love that guy I really
like watching um you know I used to
watch Shaytards an awful lot because
I've kind of I've always thought that he
was such a good dad that I wanted to
really model myself after him I haven't
watched them nearly as much as I used to
because I honestly feel like the
shaytards have become entirely too
corporate and to commercial I understand
you know when they moved to California
and they started maker studios and
became friends with Cass Angie and all
that crap that you know they started
taking big like deals and doing
commercials and you know and then they
went on Anderson Cooper and they just
became too I don't know advertised I
guess it lost its realism to me so
anyway don't watch singularity computers
yes I do watch singularity
computers and I watch a lot of his water
cooling stuff i really like i really
like singularity he makes some really
awesome stuff in fact that that radiator
box he gave away recently I wanted to
build one of those for myself as a holy
crap that is awesome so I wanted to
build me one of those radiator boxes
that was pretty awesome bull moose wants
to know do you fap when your wife is
holding out on you um see that would
have to imply that my wife holds out on
me but my wife and I have a very healthy
relationship so I'm gonna say I'm sorry
to disappoint you but I don't have to do
any of that so there you go Adam boker
wants a shout out there you go Adam ogre
how I said your name right boker yeah I
you know I really get your guys's names
really really badly messed up sometimes
and I apologize for that but I still
love you guys a lot um ed de at a
cheetah says is you and boogie if you
I'm assuming me it if you and boogie
were superheroes who would be the
sidekick oh god I would totally be his
sidekick that guy guys boogie is so much
smarter and like wiser than I am you
guys don't know just how much I like
lean on him when I'm having a bad day
and you know vice versa so there's times
where he'll lean on me and he knows I
can handle it yeah he's quickly in
closely becoming a very close friend of
mine so anyway the Joseph 94 says shout

conclusion of Bioshock somebody a friend
of mine who's been watching has said
that I'm about three quarters of the way
done with the game so between like maybe
a two-thirds and three-quarters so
that's exciting i want to see the end
because everyone keeps talking about the
end Noah has no cost sub everyone keeps
talking about the end of bioshock and i
want to see it in fact boogie the other
day with it go are you have the end of
your biochar guys is still really for my
Dawgs crazy I don't want to talk to you
about it so badly they're not gonna ruin
it for you so now unfinished game cuz i
wanna know what's awesome but
unfortunately sometimes when people put
that kind of bug in your ear about a an
ending it really makes you think that it
makes you hope that you're not
disappointed by it because maybe it
won't be that same for me la crosse 1124

Twitter right now because we're
following on Twitter page to be really
good productive and a lot of people ask
me what why is it JS VFX over there
instead of JS too sensible because I was
doing the twitch thing before i started
youtube so in fact who wants to hear as
some of you guys may have heard the
story already about how i started
youtube but i've never really gone into
depth about it should i do a video on
that maybe I'll do that I was about to
ask you guys who wants to know and I
would tell you guys the in-depth story
right now but I think maybe it's
something I'll hold off for the next
couple of days until i hit the ten
thousand mark which should be so looking
like it's going to be in three days so
we'll see Oh cries say oh i thought you
said that tech talk was going to be on

nobody watching me and it would be sad

whole new draw my life about the fact

white board nothing driven nothing drawn
I just be sitting there staring at it
and then you would slowly see like tears
like falling and dripping on it but
