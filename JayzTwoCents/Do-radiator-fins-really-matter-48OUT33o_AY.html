cents here and we're gonna talk today
about a topic that I've touched on quite
a bit in the past but I've never
actually done a dedicated video to it
and I think that it deserves one because
when it comes to selecting the
components for your water cooling loop
each individual component has its own
set of parameters that can make things
much more complicated as it is for
instance if you wanted a three hundred
and sixty millimeter radiator you're
kind of like okay cool I got three
hundred and sixty millimeters and what
the space I can deal with it got three
fan slots but then you guys start
looking at the thickness of the radiator
and then a more importantly the FB I and
the radiator so what the heck does fpi
mean and how do you accommodate that and
work it into your systems well it's
going to talk about that today
whether you're looking for a pump
reservoir custom GPU block or a complete
loop in a box alpha cools wide range of
products can make your next water
cooling adventure an easy one click the
link in the description for more details
so in my hands right here I have two
pretty similar SPECT radiators in that
they are both 240 millimeter radiators
betweens you can put two 120 millimeter
fans on either side or both sides if you
want
they both are 30 millimeters thick which
means on the surface they're gonna seem
very very similar in cooling capacity
they have also both got 12 rows of
coolant flow going on in here so what
makes these two radiators so different
well it really comes down to the FBI or
the fins per inch
now radiators have one job in one job
only that is to absorb the heat out of
the coolant moving through those rows
and moving that heat into the atmosphere
or exchanging that heat it's happening
through the movement of water the fins
and the rows are absorbing that heat and
then the fans are pushing air through
they're transferring that heat from the
water to the air and then out to
wherever the cooling situation is in
your room because remember that heat
leaves the case and goes into the room
if you don't have room ventilation then
your rooms just gonna get hotter and
hotter and hotter I think you guys have
noticed that but these two radiators are
also very different in the fact that
they have two different numbers of fpi
as well as different types of fins so
that's what we're gonna focus on today
now the Alpha cool next those st 30
right here is an 8 FBI
radiator now what that means is that in
one inch of space per row there are
going to be eight fins on here that are
gonna be touching each one of these rows
and transferring the heat into the
atmosphere like I said now over here on
the nemesis GTS a 240 radiator this is a
sixteen fpi but not only is it sixteen
fins it's also a split fin design so
what the heck does that freakin mean
these are the things that start to
confuse a lot of newbie builders when it
comes to water cooling selection because
you're really gonna be wondering to
yourself do I need a FB i-- do I need
sixteen FB i-- to really twenty FBI
because i mean there are twenty and
greater FBI radiators out there in fact
the swift tech extreme is a twenty fpi
radiator so you have just really start
asking yourself what do you need in your
system what are you cooling now on the
surface both of these radiators will
perform very very similar if you are
cooling things like just a cpu in fact
you might see very little if any
difference in temperatures whatsoever
now the difference that FBI plays is the
amount of capacity that the radiator is
going to be able to dissipate because
what these fins are actually doing is
adding surface area to the radiator now
not only can you get more surface area
for cooling by having a longer radiator
but also by having more fins crammed
into that radiator so what that means is
this Nemesis GTS with that sixteen fpi
split fin design is going to be able to
handle a greater load generally then 1/8
FBI standards fin would be right here
with the neck so SST 30 now you can kind
of see - as I hold them up right here in
front of the monitor how easy it is to
see through this radiator you can see
just how wide those fins are if I hold
the GTS up here you're still gonna be
able to see through it but you notice
how you can't really see quite as much
through there you can kind of get an
idea of just how close together those
fins are now there's gonna be trade-offs
to this that means if you're running
smaller cases you can run fans that have
greater fpi and are gonna allow you to
be able to get better cooling if you're
adding multiple components to it if
you're just going with a standard CPU
and you're not adding a GPU or multiple
GPUs or even doing a lot of overclocking
then you can get away with a low fpi
radiator some of them are even
advertised as sub 8 fin which means less
than 8 fins they don't actually say how
much you can measure that yourself an
account for it pretty easily
I've seen some go as low as 6 but you're
not going to see much difference because
the overall amount of TDP that this
radiator can dissipate is going to be
greater than the load being put on it if
that makes sense so what that means is
regarding of the regardless of the fpi
the cooling capacity of both these
radiators would be greater than cooling
something like your average 6700 K or
something of that nature because the
amount of Watts having to be cooled in
heat is less than the radiator can
handle now where it starts to matter is
when you start to add more and more
components like you have here with
skunkworks three of these Titan X's is
being cooled by one of these radiators
in a 560 millimeter equivalent which is
for 140 millimeter fans as well as a 280
version of this and it puts a lot of
heat into the room now one of the things
that FBI really comes into play is noise
not just the amount of cooling that you
can do with the radiator in the amount
of headroom that you have in terms of
TDP but what's going to be happening
here is you are gonna have more fins
which is gonna mean you need higher
static pressure and higher rpm fans to
push the air through it especially if
you start to get thicker and thicker
radiators lower fpi radiators are
perfect for those that are looking for a
much quieter solution don't need nearly
as much Headroom for overclocking or
water cooling you could easily cool a
CPU and a GPU off of a single 360
millimeter you know st 30 or even st 45
and have no problems whatsoever in the
optical language the esti number is
referring to the thickness you got st
30s to 45 st 60 and sta TR like the
monster red which is freakin huge but
what that means is I can put a slower
speed fan on this radiator and have
plenty of air moving through it versus
putting a slower speed fan on this
radiator and I would have a lot less
efficiency in the amount of cooling
because having all these fins won't do
any good if I'm not properly pushing air
through the damn thing so what that
means is more noise because as the air
is going through these fins there's
gonna be more turbulence that
err which is gonna be wanting to go off
at an angle if you guys have ever seen
the way that smoke blows through a fan
it doesn't blow straight up it blows out
at an angle at the same degree at which
the deflection of the fins are against
the air so air goes through the fan and
comes sideways out of it usually or
diagonal but these fins are going to
reach straighten that air back out as it
goes through the radiator so that's
gonna create some sort of noise
turbulence these right here having a
wider set fin means that there's going
to be more room in there for that air to
make that turn and it's not gonna be
bouncing as much off the walls of the
fins or creating that very choppy air
noise that you can get with radiators
now that's a common misconception a lot
of people have with water cooling is
that it is dead silent well it can be it
can be dead silent but that means that
you're gonna have to run as big of a
surface area as you can at the lowest
fpi that you can so that you can get
away with very slow speed fans but you
need a lot of them split fin designs are
actually not about getting more fpi in
that space it's more about the
durability of the fins because they're
not as long and they're not going to be
as fragile or have as much opportunity
to get something down in there and smash
them so they're actually a lot stronger
I would definitely recommend a split fin
radiator if you can swing one they tend
to be a little bit more expensive
they're more expensive to produce and
manufacture because there's extra
tooling and manufacturing going in there
but at the same time I do like the
structural rigidity you get with the
core the rows and the fins on there but
when it comes to cooling you're
generally not going to notice a whole
lot of a difference between these two
and still it until you start reaching
the thermal limits of the radiator so
the recommendation is still to always
get the biggest radiator that you can
fit in terms of number of fans you've
got a case that's got three 120
millimeter exhaust fans on the top and
you can fit the distance you need before
you hit the motherboard or the drive
cages to fit a 360 up there by all means
do it same thing with the front of the
case if you're putting a front mounted
rad on there and you've got room for a
240 or even a 280 do it because having
more surface area means like I said you
can make it quieter by slowing down the
fans and keeping things much more
acoustically pleasing if you will that's
one of the reasons why you don't really
hear
Dunc works in my videos even though I'm
sitting right next to it and not just
because I have a lav mic but because of
the fact that I'm running massive
radiators surface area with fans that
are only running at 50% so it keeps
things nice and quiet not to mention it
helps a lot with dust and stuff you're
not getting as much forced dust in there
that is one thing to also keep in mind -
when it comes to high fpi density
radiators is the fact that there's a
smaller space in there which makes it
easier for dust to collect so you're
gonna definitely want to keep these
things as clean as possible now one last
thing I want to address is I've seen
some people refer to fpi as kind of a
linear number meaning this thing having
16 and this thing having 8 means this
can cool twice as much that's not true
whatsoever it's just a different design
when it comes to physics in the way that
the air and the heat is transferring or
exchanging the heat out of the radiator
into the air it's not a linear curve by
any means it tends to taper off quite a
bit as fpi increases rather than getting
steeper it tends to taper off quite a
bit where it's not going to give you
that linear 8 fpi is half of 16 it just
doesn't work that way anyway guys I hope
this videos helped you I know it's more
of a just a talking head video I'm still
preparing for some builds that I'm gonna
be doing I'm still dealing with
unpacking a lot of stuff and it seems
like every time I get the shop arranged
how I want it something comes along that
makes me have to move things around or
take up space and it's just taking me
longer to get that going but I hope this
videos at least helped you guys
understand
one additional stat when it comes to
radiators and how to shop when it comes
to building your custom loops again I
still highly rely on you guys to help me
understand what cut Opik content you
guys want to see especially when it
comes to the niche topic of water
cooling so let me know what you guys
want me to do and things like Twitter
comments or Facebook messages or just
the comments here on this video anyway
time to go what radiators are you guys
using did I miss something do you think
there was something important here I
should have mentioned that I neglected
to do I wouldn't be surprised if that
was the case I neglect to do things all
the time gets me in trouble with the
wife - with the amount of things that I
accidently neglect to do and that's not
a sexual joke I guess you could sort of
take it that way but it wasn't intended
to be
all right I'm gonna get out of here
before I put my foot any farther in my
mouth and with that thanks for watching
guys and I will see you in the next
