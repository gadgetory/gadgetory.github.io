I'm finally going to get to bring you a
video that you've been asking for and
I've been wanting to bring you for a
long time together we're going to build
a water cooling loop for less than $200
so don't go anywhere
when it comes to water cooling loops
that can definitely range anywhere from
a hundred bucks up to a thousand dollars
depending on the parts that you choose
and because there's so many parts in
between there a lot of people get very
confused on how to build their very
first water cooling loop so together
today I'm going to show you all the
basics and I do mean basics on how to
build an inexpensive budget custom water
cooling loop for your CPU now when it
comes to building a custom water loop
that can range all over the place in
price and people always ask me why you
should build a custom water cooling loop
hey the sun's going away people always
ask me why you should build a custom
water cooling loop compared to going
with like an H 100 I or an H ATI or
cracking or something like that it
really comes down to future
customization the sealed kits are good
they don't get me wrong I'm not dogging
on the the sealed kits at all in fact
we've got a JD sitting or Nhat I sitting
right here in this very expensive very
compact build that we did in a previous
video but the reason why I certainly
advocate building your own custom loop
is it gives you customization options in
the future if you want to add a graphics
card to your loop you can't do that if
you go with an all-in-one unit like
behind me but you can certainly expand
upon an upgrade your system over time if
you go with a custom loop so that's what
we're focusing on today when it comes to
building your custom loop that are some
parts are going to be required and we're
talking basic parts remember this video
here is all about building a custom loop
for your CPU AMD or Intel for less than
two hundred dollars now when it comes to
putting together your system there are
some basic parts you're going to need
and remember this is a basic build and
buy basic I mean we're keeping it under
two hundred dollars which is a very
cheap custom loop first things first
you're going to need some tubing and
right here we have the master clear it
is a red tubing and it is 1/2 inch inner
diameter I perfect I prefer 1/2 inch
inner diameter but you can go 3/8 seven
sixteenths there's all sorts of sizes
when it comes to size they're not going
to perform any differently it's just
generally as you add more blocks and
components to your system you should go
with a larger inner diameter that we
have better flow that's the only thing
is flow has nothing to do with
temperatures now for the pump in this
build we chose the fobia DC 12 260 pump
it is a 12-volt pump it's got a three
pin header don't put this on your mother
by the way guys I I mean you could like
chant it's just better to hook it up to
a molex adapter yeah but it's got plenty
of flow it's got more than enough power
to power this entire loop push the fluid
no problem in fact you could even use
this with a graphics card or even
multiple blocks and not have any
problems whatsoever it is a non variable
speed pump but it is very powerful
you're going to need a water block
through CPU obviously it's the whole
point we're doing this build and for
this build we are using the race storm
this is a a acetal and copper block
right here it is by excess PC it's a
great block I used it in my AMD build
and we're going to be using it in this
AMD build that we're going to be using
as a test for this entire loop right
here so you're gonna need a water block
you're going to need obviously a
radiator because the radiator is what
makes everything cool we are using the
excess PC e x 240 I believe is a teeny X
240 it is the part number
that's a thin 30 millimeter radiator
it's got plenty of airflow I mean you
can see right through it so you can see
my face so you can use low-speed fans
you're going to need a way to hold all
of your fluid and for that we chose to
go with the Swift Tec MC I only remember
the part number but it is their micro
res v2 it's not the flashiest looking
reservoir out there but it's cheap I
mean you can get these for 25 bucks
brand-new then it comes with all the
hardware obviously to mount it and it's
got multiple port options and it's very
anti turbulent with this little shelf in
here I highly recommend this reservoir
if you're on a budget you're going to
need some fans obviously for your
radiator fans are one of those things
where noise is certainly the number one
issue when it comes to fan and then on
top of that you've got static pressure
and you want to make sure you can get
the air through your fans now what I
have right here are yeat loon medium
speed fans these are the D 12 SM 12 so
this is the medium speed fan right here
which is absolutely water coolers if you
ask any form any water cooling expert
they'll probably tell you for the best
bang for the buck fan yeat loons are
where you want to go and you can get
these fans for four dollars on various
water cooling sites and parts
sites I've sleeved these myself that way
they don't look as bad they do come with
bare wires
these are sleeved already and we're
going to be using these fans because of
their amazing performance to sound ratio
for four bucks you can't go wrong
Gate lune fans definitely consider those
okay you're obviously going to need some
fluid for this build we are just using
simple distilled water tap water is no
good
purified drinking water is no good you
want distilled water it's a process that
gets rid of all of the impurities and
all the minerals inside of the fluid and
this is the best thing that you can go
with for your system and when you're
doing distilled water you have to have a
way to stop the growth so you're going
to want to go with some sort of an anti
algae additive this is just PT nuke two
drops of it is all you're going to need
for the entire loop you could pretreat
the water I wouldn't recommend it just
add it to your system after it's all put
together and bleeding people are going
to ask what about colored fluids or what
about like the Nano fluid behind you
fluids are one of those things that have
been debated for as long as I've been
water cooling which is easily ten years
and distilled water is always one of the
best performing fluids that you can
possibly put in but because it doesn't
have any anti corrosives in it
if you start mixing metals like copper
and nickel and brass and aluminum
depending on the part you go if you
could start to see corrosion issues so
when you go with a pre-mixed fluid from
the various companies that are out there
typically they have some sort of an anti
corrosive additive put into them now
distilled water over time has never
shown to actually corrode the metals but
there are people that would argue that
if you want to take an extra step in
precaution you can get what's called a
kill coil it's basically just a piece of
pure silver that you can coil up or
inside of in place inside of a tube or
you can put it in the bottom of your
reservoir in fact you can see we have
these different plugs in here they even
sell kill coils that are on the threaded
plugs you can use it to plug this at the
same time the silver is on the inside
I've never ever used to kill coil with
any of my distilled water loops and I've
never had a problem you could go with an
advanced fluid like I have back here in
my system which is the Mayhem's nano
fluid it's not required it's just one of
those things I've actually
testing out for the first time myself
I'm very impressed with this fluid but
for the basic build like this distilled
water and PT nuke some sort of an anti
algae mixture is all you need now last
but not least you're gonna need some
sort of tools obviously and for that I
just got my basic multi-tool which
you've seen in some my other videos
different Phillips and flathead
screwdrivers and nut drivers on it and
then I use actual tubing cutter for my
builds because I do water cooling built
all the time so it's just easier to use
that to cut but you could use a pair of
large scissors or a razor blade when
you're cutting thin wall tubing like
this it's not a problem to use scissors
but if you do use thicker 3/4 inch wall
tubing or something you'll find that
razor blades and scissors just can't
really get through it as well which is
why I prefer the cutters these are
cobalt got these at Home Depot for about
I think 10 bucks maybe 15 at the most so
even then it's not that expensive and we
may have more uses for you in the future
who knows a couple of things accessories
that I would say are going to come in
handy zip ties for this build we're not
using compression fittings we are going
to be using barbed fittings you're going
to want to have two fittings for every
single component that you have because
every component has an in and an out so
however many components you have
radiator block reservoir pump that's for
you're going to have two four six eight
of fittings that are necessary and
because we're keeping things on the
cheap we are going to simply be a fixing
our tube to the barbs by just using zip
ties hey may look a little ghetto but
again guys this is the basic water
cooling build here okay so now we've
gone over the parts let's go ahead and
turn around and let's get the system
prepped and ready to accept the new
parts and so we're going to take off the
stock cooler I'm going to take off the
upper fan that's in this case behind me
and for those of you that are wondering
what we're using here for our video it
is an AMD athlon x4 with a GTX 460 we're
not water cooling the card only the CPU
and we are putting this in a h8 Cooler
Master HAF 922
airflow case so when it comes to getting
your system prepped and ready to go
you're going to want to remove anything
from the case that could potentially be
in the way
or that you wouldn't want to
accidentally get damaged and as always
when you're working with computers you
are going to be even when you're doing
water cooling you are going to be
working with a somewhat static
environment so you want to make sure
that you discharge yourself and take the
same kind of precautions that you would
working in building a computer when
handling any of the parts so to get this
computer ready to go I'm going to remove
the graphics card I'm going to remove
any of the cabling out of the way that
may be in the way I'm going to remove
the top fan because that's where our
radiator is going to go and I'm going to
remove our cooler from our graphic from
our motherboard but we're going to leave
the socket in place we're then going to
cool off cool off yeah we're going to
definitely cool off this baby we are
going to clean off the processor here
with 75% or greater isopropyl alcohol we
are using 91% here with a lint-free
paper towel and clean it off with a
microfiber at the NC of a nice perfectly
clean finish on the top of the processor
so we'll go ahead and do that and then
we'll come back afterwards and show you
what comes next okay on this field
because we are going AMD we're going to
have to go ahead and also remove the
stock socket retainer here for the AMD
you're going to have to consult your
block and your motherboard depending on
the chipset and what you're going with
specifically for your parts to see
whether or not you do or don't have to
do this so definitely consult the manual
that comes with your CPU block and
follow those instructions not
necessarily mine okay so now that we've
got the system ready to go I've removed
the top fan for the radiator we have
room for that and I've removed the AMD
socket and the stock cooler from that
and this is why I want to point out that
it's very important to use quality
thermal compound most of the time the
thermal compound that comes with your
CPU blocks your water cooling kit are
going to be perfectly fine but as an
option you may want to choose to use a
thermal compound that you like for this
build I'm going to be using two NIC TX
for the socket thermal paste or the CPU
thermal paste that came on the stop
cooler over time turned into this and as
you can see that is a very very nasty
it this is what this is why CPUs cook
themselves in overheat over time the
thermal compound breaks down and no
longer does its job in fact that's one
of the reasons why we're water cooling
this PC now because this thing has been
getting extremely hot and for the sake
of this video we're now putting water
cooling in here so that you guys can
learn how to do it so now that we've got
all that ready to go the next thing you
want to do is you want to install your
CPU block onto your CPU use your thermal
compound use the method that's
comfortable to you and then we will come
back and show you what's next okay now
we've got the CPU block installed per
the manufacturer installation
recommendations definitely consult your
manual make sure you're installing that
right you'll want to take any chances
with your CPU socket now most water
blocks will have marked on them an inlet
and an outlet it's very important that
you keep that in mind when you're
positioning your block because you want
to make sure that it's on the optimal
side however you're going to run this
loop so next thing we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and prep our
radiator we're going to get our fans
mounted to that we're going to get the
radiator mounted up on the top now the
most common question people ask when it
comes to radiator installation and when
it comes to the fans is whether or not
they should go in a pool configuration
which is where the fan pulls the air
through the radiator and exhausted or if
they should go in a push configuration
where the fan goes under the radiator
and pushes air through it there's really
not been any seriously conclusive
evidence that either one is better than
the other the most optimal would
obviously be a push pool which is where
you have a fan on either side of the
radiator kind of like this pushing air
and pulling air at the same time on the
different fans the spots on the fan for
the radiator but in a basic build like
this we're not going to do that
I personally in low thin and low fin
count radiators like this one here which
is optimized for slower speed fans I
prefer a push configuration that way the
fan has as much air available to it and
the air only has one way to go which is
through the radiator so because you're
dealing with a lower speed fan I prefer
a push configuration so we're going to
be setting up these fans
here to push the air through the
radiator like this and that the radiator
is then going to get mounted to the top
of the case like so so we're going to
fans on the bottom pushing air through
the top now you also want to keep in
mind which is going to be most
convenient on which end to have the barb
pump you can install the radiator like
this with the barbs in the back or you
can install the radiator the other way
with the barbs in the front depending on
what's most convenient so you're going
to have to kind of plan ahead a little
bit on the routing for your tubing and
determine which is going to be best for
you
just a little tech tip when it comes to
installing the fans onto your radiator
you want to make sure that you use the
included hardware with your radiator if
you bought the radiator new it's going
to come with the specific screws
intended for your radiator if you take
screws that are too long say these guys
right here they can potentially push all
the way through the fan and all the way
down into the radiator tubes some of the
rows and the radiators which is the
passages that the fluid flow flows
through it's hard to say that the fluid
flows through may line up perfectly with
those screws and if you puncture that
your radiator is toast so you want to
make sure that you use the right screw
that you don't that it comes with the
radiator if you have to buy a hardware
home depot you definitely want to make
sure that you measure and get the right
screws that way you don't puncture your
radiator it's a little tech tip for you
be very careful that you don't screw the
radiator the fan too far down into the
radiator and let your screws are the
proper length very important okay so now
that we've got the radiator together we
got the fans mounted you want to kind of
keep the cabling nice and orderly we
mounted the fans on the side that the
cables come out the back that way
they're easily tucked away and they're
not going to be in the way making your
build look tacky so now that we've got
things ready to go let's go ahead and
mount it to the top of the case and then
from there we'll start planning where
we're going to put our tubing and our
pump we'll get this thing up and running
in no time okay we're back we've got the
radiator mounted on the top we've got
the CPU block installed on the CPU here
the next thing we want to do is get the
rest of our parts ready to go and you
want to install your fittings on top of
your other parts or in your other parts
that's going to include reservoir pump
and that's pretty much it what's left on
these now a point I want to make when it
comes to installing the fittings on your
various parts most of the parts you'll
be dealing with the top of this block
this pump this reservoir they're all
plastic so it's really important that
you don't over tighten when it comes to
installing a metal barb onto a plastic
piece it's really easy to strip out the
threads and once you do that you just
ruin your day what you want to do is you
want to tighten these down hand tight
until you can't get the
any tighter and then if what I typically
do is I take a wrench and I'll turn it
just maybe an eight turn more now if
you're dealing with the metal part you
can type it down a little bit more it's
going to be one of those topics it's a
little bit debated on how tight you
should do it some people say hand tight
only and nothing more I agree with that
statement only for good measure
I do about another eighth of a turn more
with the wrench and if never once
stripped any sort of thread I've never
had any problems so it's going to get
the rest of our parts ready to go and
what we're going to do now is we're
going to start getting our parts
positioned on where we think will have
the most optimal flow and pattern here
inside of our system it's going to be a
little bit unique in this case this case
is not as water cooling friendly as many
others on the market if you're dealing
with a small case it's going to be
really tight and because of the limited
mounting options of this pump I'm
probably going to end up going to sided
tape which may sound really ghetto but
I've done it myself for years and had no
problems whatsoever but when it comes to
the order of parts since we're now going
to be planning our system is you need to
make sure that you have the outlet of
your reservoir directly feeding the
inlet of the pump and that the reservoir
at least level wise is higher than the
pump that way gravity can feed into the
pump when you're priming your system
we'll talk more about that when it comes
time to fill your system and bleed it
but make sure that you have your pump
being fed directly by the reservoir and
that the reservoir is a little bit
higher than the pump it's very very
important ok I'm back now and it's
starting to get dark because it took me
so long to figure out how I wanted to
run this so I've gone ahead and mounted
my reservoir and my pump because those
are the two as I mentioned in the
previous segment that have the most
important correlation with each other so
what I've come up with here is I've got
the pump or the reservoir mounted to the
drive cage and I've got the pump mounted
to the floor directly below the
reservoir so you can see we've got a
short little piece of tubing feeding it
and we barely made this fit because we
have the PCI Express cables here for our
GTX 460 and we've got to make a fairly
decent loop out of the pump into the
radiator in fact we're going to into the
radiator over here so it's going to be a
long piece of tube which isn't quite I
deal but unfortunately the half 922 is
not as friendly as I would like it to be
plus because we're on the cheap we're
not using any 45 or 90 degree elbow
fittings because that makes the easily
double the cost of this bill so now
we're going to do is I'm going to kind
of plan out where I'm going to route my
tubing when you get my tubing cut
measure twice cut once because once you
cut it you can't make it longer again
I'm going to I uh
hose up we're gonna we're need some hose
up in here keep your mind clean there
guys and you're going to pull out your
hose again keep your mind clean and
we're going to get this thing plumbed up
and then I'll show you how we came up
with the path that we have and hopefully
it won't look ridiculous but it's
definitely going to get the job done
okay now one quick tip I want to show
you here when you're using a thin wall
tubing like this it's really easy to get
a kink if it's if you can't really see
that too well this tube right here is
pinched completely shut because of how
tight of a bend that is but it's not
only because it's a tight Bend it's also
because the tubing is too long so if you
get a kink like that you can slowly
start trimming off the end of the tube
and then you'll notice that that kink
will start becoming a little bit less
and less each time you can also kind of
do a little bit of a just a little bit
of eyeballing on there and eventually
you'll get it so that once it's in there
it's not kinking at all in fact we're
almost there now so got a little bit of
a kink but we'll get we'll get that
squared away okay so here's our order
we've got reservoir to pump and one
thing that's very important is that you
actually have the reservoir feeding the
inlet of the pump every pump has an
inlet and an outlet and it does matter
so make sure you consult your pumps
manual to find out which Inlet and
outlet which ports are Inlet and outlet
so we're going from reservoir to pump
from pump into the radiator out of the
radiator into the CPU block and out of
the CPU block back into the reservoir
now it's not the cleanest loop but it
gets the job done and this is a when you
go with a budget system like this it's
definitely going to be about function
over form so it it really doesn't look
so bad in person um you can
to see on the camera there it's it's a
little bit blood wicking and intestine
II but it gets the job done so the next
thing we're going to do now is we're
going to simply zip tie off each one of
these barbs right on the point where it
meets the tube and then we are going to
come back we're going to start filling
it up and performing our leak test okay
so everything's now plumbed up and all
of the connections have been zip tie
fitted nothing is going to go anywhere
so now when it comes to filling your
loop you're going to fill in using your
reservoir obviously hopefully your
reservoir has an inlet on the top and
you're going to fill this lower or you
fill this reservoir as far up as it will
go and then you're going to slightly
lean the case around to get some of that
fluid to move around into the pump and
into into here and then you're going to
cycle the pump on and on for only a few
seconds at a time just so that it pulls
the fluid in once the fluid goes down
into the pump you want to turn it off
before it runs dry and rinse and repeat
that process now it's very important
that you don't run your pump dry running
it dry is definitely the worst thing you
can do for it the fluid actually works
as a as a lubricant for the bearing it's
a floating bearing in there which means
the lubricant moves around the bearing
and it causes it to never touch the side
of the housing or the motor housing so
if you run it dry it's just grinding
against the housing and it will destroy
a pump in no time flat so we're going to
do now is we're going to go ahead and
get the system bled we're going to fill
the reservoir as far as we can cycle the
pump on and off and by cycling the pump
you're going to want to use either a
second power supply or you can unhook
the 24-pin power supply in your plug
here and then you can jumper the green
and black wire on your 24 pin make sure
it is not plugged into your motherboard
and then you can jumper these two pins
cycle your power supply on and off that
way you can run your pump without
killing your system in the meantime now
as you start to fill your system you're
going to want to make sure that you
don't fill it too fast because you are
dealing with a closed loop it's pretty
much sealed once you start to fill it
with water here it may not flow down
into the reservoir as fast as you're
pouring it you don't want to have it
leak inside of your system also once you
start to fill up down
during the water level starts to rise we
have water right here in the tube you
want to just kind of preliminarily check
preliminary lemon airily I don't even
know if that's a word you want to make
sure that none of these fittings are
leaking right here first off so that's
kind of your first process of doing the
leak check it's as you're pouring you're
going to be keeping an eye out for
anything that may be leaking okay so now
that we've got the reservoir as full as
it will go in fact we've actually backed
up slightly into the funnel it's a good
thing my funnel makes the seal as I push
it down in there this is the part we're
going to jump on our power supply and
we're going to start cycling the pump
until it pulls that fluid down starts
making flow and then we're going to turn
it off refill it and rinse and repeat
see as fast as I turned on that pump it
pulled almost all of that fluid down in
there that's kind of the drawback of
having a small reservoir like this but
unfortunately it's just the part we're
using so we need to make sure that we
don't run it dries it to be fast on the
switch
okay we're going to start getting to the
point now to where it's going to start
making a complete loop because up until
now every time it's pulled in the fluid
it's never come back out into the
reservoir which means we still have more
air than fluid in the system but now
we're getting to the point to where it's
going to start making a complete flow
which is where we're going to want to
start doing our leak testing and then
making sure that we keep the reservoir
topped off as the air works its way out
of the system as you can see now like I
said we've reached that part where we're
getting a complete flow going the water
is very aerated for two reasons one the
water level is low and two there's a lot
of air in the system and an error is
going to take time to work its way out
it's going to get trapped up here in the
radiator it's going to get trapped some
of these tubes so now is where we want
to top it off to where the water level
is at least higher than the return line
and then we're going to just let it run
for a while turning it on and off and on
and off making sure that we can get the
air to move out of the places that its
trapped but as you can see the pump is
quieting down we've got a lot less
aeration going on there but all of these
little bubbles that you see churning
around here in the corner those are a
sign that we still have air in the
system so we're going to let this go for
a while we're going to turn it off we're
going to turn it back on and every time
we do you're going to notice that we get
more air bubbles now one other thing
that you can do to help promote movement
of air inside the system it's just to
kind of slowly tilt it along on its
edges like this and every time you do
you'll usually see more bubbles working
their way out of the system I don't tilt
too far especially if you have your
reservoir open because if you do you're
going to find that you're going to leak
water all over the place and now that
we've got the system filled and it's
running and we're letting it bleed this
is where we're going to start doing our
leak test and to do that we're going to
put paper towels around all of our
components that have a fitting that way
we can check to see if we're getting any
sort of leakage from any of these
fittings
now one last trick that you can do to
help promote the movement of air inside
of your system is if you have thin wall
tubing like this is you can pinch it a
few times and every time you do you'll
notice this is semi-transparent tubing
so I can see the fluid moving through
here and I can also see where we have
some of the air trapped now when it
comes to leak testing a lot of the
experts will tell you that they
recommend leak testing anywhere from 12
to 24 hours
I definitely recommend that if you're
new to water cooling and you have never
dealt with it before I would leave all
of your components unplugged leave your
paper towels and leave the PSU or the
power supply unit jumpered like this
with the pump running for at least 24
hours prior to putting all of your
components back to power because I'm not
going to do that I'm going to do
probably 20 minutes at best because I've
done so many systems and I'm so
confident in my ability to water cool
but and the fact that we already have no
leaks leaks tend to not really form over
time unless you have a degradation of
part or an o-ring fail or something like
that which is no amount of leak testing
with fine if something's going to fail
anyway so I definitely recommend if
you're new perform a good long leak test
if you're an experienced builder chances
are that you're just watching this video
for fun and we'll want to let this thing
run for a while and make sure that we
have no leaks now over time the water
fluid is going to start to drop because
we are still replacing air with fluid so
you want to just keep an eye on the
water level and you'll want to refill
that as necessary but before you close
your reservoir back up you want to leave
at least a little bit of space for air
to move to that way the air has a place
to go and replace itself with fluid so
leave a little bit of air gap at the top
don't fill all the way to the brim okay
so now that you performed all of your
leak testing your system is running
there's no leaks you're happy with it
the last thing you want to do is you
want to add two drops of your anti
fungal anti algae your PT nuke whatever
you want to call it to your water
cooling loop and we're talking just two
drops is all it's needed this is very
strong stuff and you can add this right
into your reservoir and then this will
add this will protect your system from
there being any sort of algae growth
at all overtime okay just one last point
I'd like to make now before we finish up
is the tubing right here that runs in
front of the graphics card I made sure
that it was a little bit longer than
necessary because we want to make sure
that if you have to access your graphics
card and get it out of there that you
can do so without the tubing blocking it
in so we have plenty of slack on here
that way we can get the graphics card
out if we need to do that okay so that's
it now if you follow this tutorial you
would have built your very first water
cooling system for your CPU this is
everything done behind me as you can see
we added a red light it really doesn't
look too bad and the tubing doesn't
really look at it place on this AMD
athlon x4 at stock spades right now our
core under load and this is load 25
degrees Celsius we are running prime95
right now and 25 degrees Celsius under
22 degrees on the CPU socket 25 on the
core now this is a stock speeds but what
does this mean if when you run this type
of cooling option you get a lot more
Headroom to do cool things with your
computer overclocking and stress testing
and better performance in gaming so now
we're going to overclock this thing
we're going to end this video hopefully
you guys found this easy
we ran overclock this see exactly what
we can get out of it see how much
temperature Headroom we have this thing
is running so cool it's actually
surpassing what I thought it would
perform as very simple loop didn't cost
a lot I hope you found this video very
helpful now if you're not a beginner and
you already know the basics of water
cooling but you were hoping to learn a
little bit more about doing advanced
water cooling techniques and multiple
radiators stronger pumps bigger
reservoirs and how to plumb everything
to look very very cool and streamlined
and flashy and all that cool stuff and
you have a lot more budget to spend to
do that then you're definitely gonna
want to stay tuned for next week when I
show you how to build an advanced water
cooling system with multiple radiators
and high end luxury parts for water
