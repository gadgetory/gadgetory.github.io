restart it everyone nobody can say late
because we started early we did I still
show for 58 year by the atomic clock
that I'm seeking off oh oh well I guess
my computer is accurate - it also says
for 58 you just hit 459 8 atomic clocks
a 459 yes it does Wow
both synchronized to some kind of atomic
based clock Wow well you know I got
rolling intro do it roll that intro it's
already going welcome to church job talk
about technology Wow what I had to roll
the black screen for a little while just
to let all that commentary go I have a
little clock here since I can't see it
like like when you say kick it off the
inter I just hit the stop why I know
exactly when to stop I have a wedgie
it's 11 seconds long for the intro and
and you were about three seconds late
because I clicked it and then yeah and
and then your little thing you move over
wait you got a couple minutes after the
stream tonight I should show you how to
set up the plugin for obs so that you
can stream the entire composited scene
as a web cam through Skype to me that
way I can see everything live in real
time oh I supposed to update OBS it's
still stuck on fullscreen and all that
stuff so I haven't updated anything
alright start over it's still broken
like it won't it won't pop out of
fullscreen it's always in fullscreen
weirdest problems that I've never heard
of Oh I fixed it what was it you tried
to fix it like really a half an hour
last week I hit f11 I fixed it it's not
good now how does somebody so dumb it
looks so pretty you know I just I'll
never understand it
oh you know this this doesn't just
happen okay I you have to work towards
this a lot a lot of work I bet what's up
everyone welcome to tech sock number 156
we have done 156 of these shows Jerry
was around for about 135 of them and Wow
156 there's probably a lot of hours here
that could have been spent on more
productive tasks I think almost
definitely almost definitely because
they run at least an hour and a half
sometimes two hours II figure we've
probably got 300
50 minutes no wait 353.50 times 60 what
does that do the maths dude I don't want
to here let me pull up my calculator so
I got one what am I doing here
I don't know laughter I was gonna say
okay 156 episodes that 303 how about
okay we turn 12 okay that's a lot hours
divided by 24 hold on let's see how many
days that is see you literally 13 days
yeah no unstop just wasted time you wait
13 days there's like better things that
we could have done yeah I 107 agree on
that so guys we have got actually some
topics today that we're gonna talk about
we're of course are gonna dabble in some
car talk like we always like to do for
the most part Tech Talk is just where we
hang out weekly and just talk with you
guys and talk with each other and and
tech sort of takes a backseat even
though it's in the name it's sort of an
oxymoron but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and
weed up this stream of quick Jerry if
you want to go ahead and kick it off
with one of your topics there I'm doing
the same all right well so I just
tweeted out my cuz I was like way ahead
of you on that we're gonna talk about
big corns because corn corn so otherwise
known as bitcoins Bitcoin the bitcoins
are tanking you know everybody's doing
their same thing that they do about
every month or two I bet coin tanks are
like oh my god cryptocurrencies over oh
my god GCU prices are finally coming
back to normal they're not they're not
guys nothing has changed nothing's ended
I can tell you exactly why bitcoin tank
there's actually two major reasons why
bitcoin and aetherium and pretty much
any other any other crypto currency in
existence kind of took a dive and the
main reason is because one of the
trustees behind mount GOx remember the
big wall SG down yes well they call them
exchanges but technically you're right
it would be a wallet they call
themselves exchanges but we're gonna
talk about why that's actually
inaccurate I remember that one moving
forward but mount Docs was the biggest
like crypto currency wallet in existence
back in the day anyways they had some
hacking they had some stuff anyways they
fell well that's one of the trustees of
the company still held held like four
was it four hundred bitcoins or four
thousand bitcoins I don't know the exact
400 destabilise
no no it wasn't four hundred I think was
four thousand it was it was four was at
4 million let me here let me pull up my
link I've got a link somewhere here
there we go oh it's four hundred million
dollars or the Bitcoin oh geez so four
hundred million bitcoins owes it was uh
it was thirty five thousand eight
hundred and forty-one BTC that was
exchanged
that's that that could definitely
destabilize yes specially when its
stability is based on its rarity right
right and the thing is you got to think
about with Bitcoin anytime a coin is
paid out to wallet that wallet can get
orphan there's a lot of wallets early on
from people that mine the majority the
bitcoins that are just in landfills or
crashed hard drives and shit that's not
recoverable on and that scarcity drives
up the cost of Bitcoin well it's not
very scarcity more than thirty five
thousand eight hundred and forty one
bitcoins just flood back into the market
they haven't been touched in an eon but
it still didn't drop nearly as far as
like when okay so remember when you
first started talking about bitcoin and
stuff like four hundred bucks was a huge
deal six hundred bucks oh my god seven
hundred ollars oh my god it's still like
nine thousand dollars
it's still nine thousand it's just
everybody's worried because at its peak
it was at twenty so in one month it lost
half of its value but if you look at the
trend over time for Bitcoin this
actually isn't even that bad like think
about it there was times when it was
three hundred and something the coin it
dropped down under $100 that's way more
than 50% yeah if you look at it
percentage-wise right so so anyways
these coins that he sold destabilized it
and dropped the currency it's not a big
deal though because the currency is
self-balancing basically what's gonna
happen is people are gonna start
exchanging a theory and back and forth
into the network and Polster America
what do you do I'm saying it's okay my
waist is right here what do you do I
have a highway I on the way down JS two
cents media is falling apart guys
falling apart and and and the more
ridiculous our employees get the better
the videos are I know right that sounds
like dude nobody wants to watch like
shit that's professional
oh no it's professional shenanigans
that's true alright so Jay what is the
second thing that destabilized Bitcoin
Bitcoin you're good
Bitcoin itself is to stabilize the
second thing that destabilized when the
the se did you read any that did you
read the link that oh the link I sent
you is 404 was it yeah no no that was
the Washington State one so oh that's
right so so what the second thing was
the SEC the Security and Exchange
Commission stepped in and said that now
all Bitcoin exchanges that includes a
coin base and anything like it
has to now register as an exchange cuz
they've been calling themselves an
exchange the word register scares
everybody it does and that's that's
another reason why the currency is going
down as people are panicking and selling
their Bitcoin because they think that as
soon as the sec steps in and starts
regulating cryptocurrency it's no longer
that's awesome big decentralized thing
that made it cool in the first place and
it's gonna die wasn't there it wasn't
there another meltdown when china was
talking about banning in or whatever
that was more recent that one yeah i
don't know what the state of that one is
but i know the latest asian country
that's causing some shenanigans is south
korea now is taxing all the exchanges oh
like not only not only do they're like
we just want the exchanges to register
which ultimately they'll have to pay
taxes and report earnings and all those
things which some of the exchanges are
already doing like coinbase
already does that like coinbase was
already hedging their bets and being
like oh we're running billions of
dollars through here we better report it
to the government they're already
putting things in place to stop anti lon
you know anti money laundering and drug
buys and stuff like that coinbase is
doing a lot of stuff to keep the
government happy because that's what all
exchange is doing it with which i have
to sort of agree with because there's a
there's the bitcoin has really propelled
the black market mmm-hmm
drug sales even human trafficking a lot
of stuff just has been completely funded
through Bitcoin because of it's
untraceable nature right right and I'm
gonna actually completely agree with you
on that I think that and this gonna be
short term guys the drop in Bitcoin I'm
confident it's gonna bounce right back
people are just afraid and when they get
afraid they get out from underneath it
right well then they can buy just and
just in real quick guys remember
bitcoins not the one that's actually
causing your GPU problem it's the theory
so exact Bitcoin Bitcoin can be mined on
a six aetherium Raven coin is it is Doge
as dough Jason a sector not optical
heads Doge still a thing
yeah there's dude there's 9000 over 9000
cryptocurrencies today now most of them
are considered shit coins which means
they're not even fractions of a penny
worth anything on the exchange but just
keep mine there's nine thousand coins
out there what you guys are looking at
as far as GPU prices increasing are the
coins that are GPU my noble GPU mine
Apple coins are the ones that you want
to worry about if you're if you're on
the whole mission to get your GPU prices
down because those are the guys that are
going to be buying up the GPUs for the
GP mine double coins and those coins are
designed from the ground up to only be
my noble on the GPU and the reason that
they did that is so that the Chinese
doesn't just create a huge ASIC market
and corner the entire mic in it and end
up owning the coin but the Chinese also
developed the GPUs well here's here's
the interesting the interesting fact is
the Asics that were created in China
they were selling them for like pennies
on the dollar domestically to like their
end their own minds of building their
own minds and then they were selling
Asics hit the brakes but Green Bay and
Chet says where's your evidence about
crime increasing with Bitcoin common
sense common sense is this very pair no
no if he wants tangible evidence I can
give it to you it's called Silk Road
they're up the number seven right now a
Silk Road uses only Bitcoin that is the
only thing that they deal in is Bitcoin
and they are an illicit drug trade they
say they've been directly attributed to
opiate increase and opium opium
specifically so anybody at or in a
Bitcoin can go buy like oxycodone and
just get a ship to their house or
fentanyl or whatever I mean it's it's a
big problem it really is a big problem
the other thing is if you go on the the
dark web the dark web as we like to call
it otherwise known as tor you find all
kinds of fucked-up shit that you can buy
with Bitcoin you can you can pay there's
there's actually a hitman exchanger you
can pay Bitcoin for somebody to go kill
somebody yeah so so if you're if you
want proof just go do a search on tor go
go poke around in their black
helicopters will inevitably circle your
house and kill you and your family but
you know at least you've evidently
looking for there you go now they're
gonna be first-hand experience yeah but
basically any any any currency that is
not traceable is going to be used for
illicit activity it's just going to be
it's gonna be used for money laundering
right because the whole idea with money
laundering is you take a large
centralized piece of trackable currency
and you break it up and distribute it to
a lot of small parties in exchange for
untraceable currency Silk Road is run by
the government's pretty much I actually
wouldn't you know this is the conspiracy
theorist of me but I would not be the
slightest bit surprised if the
government isn't directly responsible
for at least a couple of the things that
are transacting in crypto coin hmm like
could you imagine like if you were a
government you were trying to find
agents and spies in other countries and
you wanted like turn a double agent
everything you wouldn't want anything
tracked back to you as you paying them
right so it kind of makes three to use
no currency or some untraceable currency
to compensate them that wouldn't raise
any red flags el Pepito says no cranky
Jay today hey the show just started
you wait you okay just wait I'm not used
to being in this kind of a good mood
anyways I was gonna I was gonna hell I I
have had I I've had a Starbucks I've had
two monsters and another coffee
Jesus son I feel like I'm falling behind
do you know why I needed all this
caffeine because I took a muscle relaxer
last night which I was still in my
system this morning last night too so I
feel your pain so so my back pain and
stuff keeps me up at night so I took a
flexor all of course I I knocked out and
then I woke up this morning took my
daughter to school came back home went
back to sleep for an hour woke up came
here and on the way drank a coffee and
then during shooting today drink two
monsters and then drink another coffee
right before the show and I'm still
feeling like that episode of The
Simpsons where Homer drink or ate all
the pet pills but then he counteracted
it with sleeping pills so I kind of feel
like that right now we're like half of
me is awake and half of Me's asleep so
I'm really kind of in this spiral that I
don't really understand so you know what
my best advice to say guys is just go
with it
just go with it just go with it we both
took Flexer all yesterday and I know
exactly what you're talking about it's
about by my estimate flexural lasts
about 18 hours yeah it really lingers
lasting drugged out of anything that
I've taken is is the longest like
effective drug you wake up just as
relaxed and you feel heavier than you
did like you wake up in the same state
you basically went to sleep it's weird
yeah trying to kill my kidney only if I
did this every day then I would be
killing that I'm actually surprised you
took a flexor all cuz you're usually
like you you won't even take tylenol
that tells you how obsessed I will see
the thing is it allows me to be able to
actually sleep and so that's why I
that's why I had it but yeah I'm
extremely sensitive to it so I think if
I took flex are all like every day I'd
be kind of screwed yeah I take it twice
a week and I usually cut the pill in
half which doesn't stop how long it
lasts it just stops how drowsy it makes
you during that time
but it's still terrible like like I
would say they like though the latest
I'll take it is it's like 6 6 p.m.
because if you take any time after that
the whole next they sleep until like
1:00 or 2:00 p.m. it's weird you'll go
to sleep to sleep 14 hours and not even
realize it
someone said take a lacs could you
imagine it's like yeah if you you switch
my Flex for all with pills that are
laxatives that look the same take it
before bed all loosens up your sphincter
and the other one just has everything
coming out like liquid oh you take it
away take it before bed wake up in a
brown stain yeah
drug talk with JC's into morning you
wake up when there's just like it you
don't like the crime scene outlines of
people but it's just brown oh you only
get that you're on Tech Talk folks there
anything else you want to finish up on
your topic there so anyways I guess I'll
just end with don't worry bitcoins gonna
come back up a theory I'm just follows
Bitcoin to the two currencies yes sure a
lot how many people in this audience are
worried it won't come back up I'm just
saying I'm curious over in chat guys do
you think if you think bitcoin is
finally dying and it's going away
forever and it's not worth buying or
whatever I don't remember guys bitcoin
is not the one destroying your GPU
market yes Bitcoin has nothing to do
with your GPU market if anything else
Bitcoin is actually helping you guys
because a Bitcoin didn't exist more
people would be mining atheria but a
theory wouldn't exist without Bitcoin
that's true so anyway there's so many
crypto coins guys that's like if you're
interested in cryptocurrency and you
don't want to do a mainstream coin like
let's say you just have like a shitty
little CPU or something you want to mine
a coin that could potentially be worth
millions someday go for it go pick a
random shit coin and just mind the hell
out of it because you'll get like a
hundred thousand of them in a week and
even if it goes up to like two cents a
coin your you've made a tidy profit so
so what you do you want them to push one
if they're worried and two if they don't
give a shit no no push one if they're
not worried oh I think now I'm confused
I forgot I said oh yeah worry dude right
now push one if you are legit worried
that it won't come back up push two if
you want it to die there so is that yeah
so one of my topics we just which over
to Apple here another topic that
probably equally is hated by my my
audience here because we really I phone
and I have an iPhone and we're both
considered tech guys but I also have an
axon I also have an axon or axe
however you say it accion Android phone
but I use it mostly as a logger for my
car and I also have a lg j6 it still has
a sticker on it it's actually I'm like a
Chyna company or something like I tell
you a pretty good brand actually pretty
solid phones really okay I really like
it that's a LTE phone so a lot of threes
in there Wow okay so Apple if you guys
are aware remember they've built a new
like headquarters a while back now as a
super like spaceship you lookingglass
building and it's really it's really
pretty and stuff I guess apparently
there's been an influx of 911 calls
being called out to one Apple way or
whatever whatever it may be of the
article here the art no this map went up
away so this is actually via TechCrunch
you guys can find the article up there
it's apples glass walls result in 911
so what's essentially happening here is
Apple has these glass interior walls a
very clean transparent curved glass
walls and apparently there's been a
issue happening there where people
continue to continually run into them
causing facial and bodily injury so
there is actually there's actually a
transcript here more than 9 1 1 calls
it's quite hilarious onl back story -
apparently workers had been putting up
sticky notes on the walls so they could
like be aware like hey there's a wall
here right like maybe where there's a
turn in the hallway or something like a
depth perception aide right so think I'd
like it's like another version of this
those carnival funhouse with full of
mirrors so you don't know exactly which
one's the real one
all right kind of a thing but only it's
all glass walls so looking at internal
pictures right now oh my god yeah oh
it's all glass it's like I was like a
clear maze yeah
so people employees were actually
putting sticky notes and stuff up on the
walls to get your attention like hey
there's a wall here well the janitors
and the cleaning staff has been ordered
to take them down every time they find
one because apples like know that did
that the tracks from the interior design
of the building so apparently here is a
this took place on January 2nd so it's a
dispatcher and then the colors for the
dispatcher answer is medical emergency
185 what are you reporting in the caller
says this is Apple security reporting a
medical injury this
Badger says okay what's the address of
the emergency now trying to get the
addresses I think funnier than the
actual reason why they're calling the
caller says just a moment and then he
comes back and said you hear a person in
the background
near the caller if you could let them
know Apple Parkway so the caller says
Apple Parkway dispatcher says what's the
address
caller says Apple Parkway one Apple
Parkway dispatcher can you repeat that
to make sure I have it correct caller 1
Apple Parkway dispatcher where
specifically should they go caller says
Transit Center five a dispatcher Transit
Center is at any specific area at Apple
caller it's off 10th Avenue caller is
that right at one Apple Parkway though
caller it's going to be gate 5a off of
10th Avenue dispatcher so the address
you gave me at one Apple Parkway is that
exactly where we're going
caller yes dispatcher dot dot so tell me
what exactly happened or exactly what
happened to caller we haven't we had an
individual who ran into a glass wall
pain and they hit their head they have a
small cut on their head and they are
bleeding slightly disoriented we have
on-site security with them now
dispatcher are you with the patient now
caller no I am not with the patient we
are trying to have a security unit call
in right now so I can connect you over
dispatcher how old is the patient caller
late 20s dispatcher is the patient male
or female caller male dispatcher is he
awake caller yes he is conscious
dispatcher is he breathing caller that
we do not know yes yes he's conscious
and breathing
I like how they didn't know for a while
they're like they're talking with the
guy right yeah dispatcher let me go
ahead and I'm a-goin update the
paramedics when did this happen caller
it happened around five minutes ago
around 12:05 dispatcher is there any
serious bleeding caller yes from the
head dispatcher is he completely alert
caller yes dispatcher Arjan one moment
the paramedics I'll have some
instructions for you okay I'm sending
the paramedics to help you now just stay
on the line and we'll tell you what
exactly to do next you can just refer to
revert this to your security do not move
him unless he is in danger and do not
splint any injuries from now on do let
not let them have anything to eat or
drink it might make them sick so they
basically are going into a hole like how
to
control the bleeding and stuff so I
imagine the one inside Apple must be
millennial hell to begin with right so
so a lot of these like I've got a
boo-boo I need to go see the doctor
right
apparently this person was running now
we were we were kind of discussing this
internally like how in the heck how the
heck does this does this happen like how
fast were you going so now I can
basically knock yourself stupid by
running into the glass wow I've worked I
have walked into a many a glass pant
shell gas station is notorious for
having big sliding clear glass doors
right next that slide into clear glass
walls and I have walked square into the
wall thinking it was the door before I
didn't knock myself stupid the the wall
rattled nicely and I got a I got a bit
of a standing ovation for him went
around me but I never knocked myself
down and started bleeding so Brian and
Nick and I and Phil we were discussing
this and we were thinking this guy must
have been like late to a meeting he's
got his face buried in his phone and
he's like power walking or running
through the building into a glass wall
well looking at the picture of the
actual building well first of all all
they needed to tell the dispatcher is
the building that looks like an arc
reactor from space I mean literally it's
the I'm sure it's the only building
within you know I don't know ten
thousand miles that looks like that yeah
so what the building is the inside of it
the whole inside of the donut it's glass
it's all glass on every floor in all of
the the hallways for the offices go
straight out to that glass
they call it their spaceship campus yeah
so like literally I could see people
coming out of their office looking down
at their phone and just walking down the
hallway and just misjudging the distance
they've traveled and just go bunk right
into the glass yeah that's it so if you
guys do this if you guys just do a
search right now for you know Apple
building interior whatever you'll see it
it's a it was a fucking even though
staircases are glass yeah no no I'm
gonna go out of the limb here and say I
like the building like I I think that
they probably should have addressed you
know something as simple as having you
know a crystal clear glass pane that's
curved even if you're running down the
outside hallway how many people do you
think of like just clipped their
shoulder into it
I feel like this building has a built in
Darwin meter hello did we lose Jerry
I think we lost Jerry pretty Oh
are you back there you are me there you
are
no you're not back yet I can see you you
can't see me you're all frozen dude yeah
I know I'm I'm still sending up the date
of the daters hey hang up and call me
back why why no I couldn't literally you
just came back he came back with hang up
and call me back cuz I was like wow I
thought you were just fucking with me
again oh now I'm seeing it on the live
stream it's like it must have been like
an internet because according to Skype
we still have good quality quality
quality whoo we got great so oh yeah
what I said I didn't hear your response
was I feel like the building has a built
in Darwin meter
oh you're gone again see apples apples
ddossing Jerry that's what's happening
Apple apples ddossing Jerry mmm what
sitting here yeah Jerry's stuck again
well there goes that one oh yeah yeah
oh hi is it working now I think so yeah
I think we just got a bum route through
the internet cuz I could still hear you
just fine I could see the live stream
just fine
maybe our internet connection bumped
into that glass wall it must no way up
California Apple mustard is talking
about it like I said for the third time
now building Darwin meter there yep I
heard everything you said I just
couldn't respond like when we were
talking about this before the show we
had to imagine that there's like there's
probably these these smudgy forehead
marks on the glass like here and there
like every time there's a turn like in
the hallway there was probably a like
think about you leaned your head on the
car window if you look at the car window
later you're like yeah there's like a
grease stain imagine the grease stains
inside the building that would actually
be pretty funny as you drink a rockstar
and your internet goes kaput again just
use discord lull I don't know it's just
court have good video now video calling
if it was
I don't know I've used it can you see me
at all you know it's funny how you can
hear me that whole time but you
completely like cut out yeah and I hear
you I see the stream just fine I've got
enough I'm not no loss of quality
anywhere even Skype says it's still good
I just think it's the route between us
it must be but it's not my connection
haven't dropped a single frame drop
frames 0 buddy zero yeah no I know it's
not over here because I'm watching the
YouTube stream just fine so it's got to
be something in the Skype connection so
here's the tech part of Tech Talk guys
prepared shit so I'm gonna go ahead and
segue into my next my next topic here
only because it's sort of semi related
because apparently this article appeared
right next to the one about to talk
about yeah so Stanford and this one is
courtesy of Mercury News and it's
probably I think it's been in several
different news outlets by the way but
Stanford students are protesting outside
of Apple stores because they are upset
that Apple is not doing more other way
this is the Stanford students against
addictive devices or the SSA ad or the
sad they are protesting outside infinite
loop headquarters in Cupertino and at
the Apple Store in Palo Alto holding
picket signs and handing leaflets to
Apple employees walking around because
they are mad that Apple is not doing
more to curb device addiction I have to
say I agree here with the whole device
addiction thing and like how we have to
be protected from ourselves Jake as
common sense doesn't exist anymore what
are your thought is nothing common about
common sense that's for sure he says he
says it started out some nm Rita and I
am reading this directly from the
article by the way guys this is again
courtesy of Mercury News com it started
out as something they did for their
class on ethics encoding but the four
seniors went beyond the classroom to try
and get Apple it takes a smartphone it
ways it's only for people out there
anyway this to try and catch Apple it
takes smartphone addiction seriously and
offer solutions to curb addiction such
as an essential mode that allows iPhone
users to only place calls texts and take
photos so basically I want to turn into
a featureless phone especially I don't
know just means you can just turn the
fucker off like it's still something you
can enable and disable so how does that
solve it you can also put down a
cigarette you can also put down the beer
and you can also put down the crack pipe
but if you're addicted then that does
really changing it you have to be sort
of intervened or have some sort of a
intervention which is what they want
Apple to do so they want Apple to sell
you the device but then intervene
between you using it pops up on your
phone it's like we have detected that
you have done 350 social media posts
today so we're gonna go ahead and
disable that feature for three hours go
hang out with your family oh man could
you imagine the counter protests fuck oh
my god it's gonna be a lot more than the
four people at Stanford trying to get
out of doing their homework especially
in social situations we find that like
when you're around the dinner table or
when you're just chilling with your
friends now that's true go to any
restaurant and look around and how many
people are sitting there on your phone
guilty as charged
a lot yeah I am guilty as charged my
wife right here like I don't even know
why it's just with me I just always have
mine with me because you know if I need
to be getting a hold of by my wife or
something for emergency situation I'd
I'm that guy that always has my phone
readily available but I mean as instance
access to porn cuz got incognito mode in
a good 4G connection I mean I need okay
incognito for that just let it fly I'm
ashamed of what I watch i watch when you
accidentally push the thing where you
link it to the receiver in the other
room and it pops up on the hole yeah I
almost air played one to the upstairs
room oh you got frozen again anyway here
I'll be back here in a second he says
people are just always perpetually on
their phones and they just don't want to
participate in social situations
Jerry's frozen again my goodness what is
up with this connection I hear your
audio again hope it's gone again they're
in my Scott Steve's and Chad says that
reminds me my battery's dead oh geez
let's try this again there we go
hi Skype is dumb Skype is dumb yeah I've
got a perfect ping time so it's just
Skype so what I thought was funny though
like I said was is my so the new
receiver have upstairs at Pioneer elite
yeah yeah it has airplay and I didn't
know that and one day I was like messing
around my phone and I was like why isn't
it playing what the hell then I realized
it was playing upstairs like abort abort
abort
everybody was home yeah luckily nobody
was home I was sitting on the shitter
and the
to him and I had my new TV as the
airplay thing built into it and so I
went down and I had the in-ear
headphones things on I went down to link
it and I clicked the wrong thing because
I'd like three things in the menu ID my
receiver the TV there and I'm like why
am I not hearing audio through this
thing and then I take off the head take
the earpiece out of my ear and I can
faintly hear it and I'm like oh shit
it's coming yep and my youngest my
youngest daughter - who she's got like
one of our old iPhone 6s that has like
some of the kids apps and stuff on there
and every now and then she'll be
watching like YouTube kids or something
and then she'll get all mad like it's
not working and then I hear it like
blasting upstairs in the upstairs living
room so I need to go into that receiver
and disable Apple play it's dangerous
that is a very smart move as a matter of
fact I probably should do the same cuz
all it takes is one like little misstep
and then Sam's asking me a bunch of
questions I don't have answers yeah
they're upstairs playing in the loft and
suddenly there's 65 pitches of Wang
exactly well son you see there is the
short stick and the long stick
figuratively speaking of course
it froze again Jerry only fit certain
holes and will your mom um this call oh
my god we're only half hour into the
show and Skype is screwing with us
oh yeah let's uh I mean let me try
connecting to you I mean they made me do
this hold on sorry guys eventually we'll
get something better than this row
eventually we'll get something better
than Skype for this yeah we've all I'm
gonna stay in this for like a hundred
episodes I know we did we did briefly
use discord but the video and it was
garbage back then hold on oh my god this
is getting great so they're going into
justification about why they want the
why they're protesting oh do tell our
intention is to be friendly with apple
says Divya Hans Gupta - business insider
that's an Indian last name I could I
know I knew the Gupta but I don't how to
say the first name did give young Divya
Huns
any we're reaching out to them to say
you know you guys can help out with this
issue and this isn't just an Apple issue
but amongst Silicon Valley companies
Apple is in the best position to address
it the students told Business Insider
the
Apple employees at infinite loop were
very responsive and positive during
their protests outside company
headquarters last weekend giving tips on
how and when the best time to approach
Apple many of the employees actually
missed their light crossing the
intersection to talk to us and chat with
us some employees were in a car and put
their hatchet on and said that our font
was too small in our posters that's like
the guys standing on the freeway
off-ramp asking for like money or food
but he's like a whole paragraph written
out yeah you're seeing that and I'm
being myself probably nobody could read
that driving by oh yeah it's like maybe
possible maybe get to the point a little
quicker but anyway yeah and then you get
the dumb fucks that'll like actually
slow down so they can read it and then
everybody's doing like 25 on the freeway
but basically the SSA ad believes Apple
needs to take more action the grass
recommends turning the iPhone screen
display into a grey display what's to an
iPhone screen display into a grey
display go to Settings General
accessibility display accommodations and
turn on color filters into grayscale
what how does that's of what to make you
sad make it a little look oh that must
be your play on the word sad like that
so it's like Seattle sky on your phone
probably jeez okay those guys are dumb
they win the Darwin Award in the glass
okay so here's the thing all right it's
another example of someone just trying
to push off push off their personal
beliefs on a society but here's if
you're a if they're at dinner with
someone and and they're just the other
person sitting there on their phone not
one to talk to you
maybe you're boring maybe they don't
want to talk to you maybe Twitter is
just way better than what you have to
offer at that time I don't know but my
wife and I have a permit to standing
rules we're out on date night phones
away phones in pocket if it comes out
the other person grabs it and every now
and then I break that rule and I pull it
out in the wife reaches for my phone I
slap her hands they don't touch but I
want to soundbite to that so I can
rearrange it a little bit like everyone
Saul the wife looks at me and then I
pull it out that happens to mange and
Jerry would you ever guys ever go in pka
again if you were invited I was invited
plenty of times but they I just don't
have four hours to dedicate and I don't
want to pop onto the show for a short
amount of time and I've just got too
much going on so that's that doesn't
really like me they just everybody just
thinks I'm like a wings or redemption
like reruns so
just like me then fun things and they
still add it they're still at it I
didn't even know that PKA was still a
thing to be honest it is but they don't
mean they don't get hardly any
viewership I think they just do it do it
more just just for fun just just as a
reason to like get together and talk
about stuff I don't I don't I mean I
think the show gets like maybe eighty
thousand years sixty thousand eighty
thousand a week what I'm sorry I was
look at my phone I'm trying to go into
the accessible and into the except I'm
trying to go to the settings that they
Mary are you sure you gonna actually try
to turn it gray and see if that like
helps your addiction to social media oh
I already closed their article yeah I
wanted to see what exactly the gray
screen was that they're talking about
see General accessibility blind mode or
something I don't know you Siri oh yeah
any of the color blind
serious turned off on my phone entry
increased contrast switch controls touch
I don't know
it's guys are dumb oh there's no update
don't do it EDM anyway I don't know I
don't know what's become a Microsoft
with the whole update thing seriously
like every week there's a new update
rests finger to open what does that mean
it sounds like a sex move whatever so Oh
Jerry froze again I think we're I think
the show's gonna end earlier we can't
you hear me yeah the show's gonna aim
early at this rate yeah yeah yeah there
you are your video is that the
connection completely drops out between
us and then comes back it's really
strange the weird thing is I'm at know
you gone again actually dream I I guess
you're you know what I can do hold on
hold on
I don't know what he's doing guys
I have no idea I heard a crash I heard
I'm gonna do the thing jakey I heard a
clatter takes over there looking at
Craigslist looking for car parts
you don't even know you don't know what
you're doing okay yeah Jerry's still
stuck tried discord live on Street it's
a little bit late for me to try and set
up a discord capture now in the middle
of the stream don't you think
Jesus J you should probably set up your
stream this way do this now do it now
are you screaming no absolutely not
time to test this cord no it's not time
to just test this court I just said that
hello what'd you do did you change your
aggregation
I did okay maybe one of your maybe one
of the aggregates are dropping off yeah
so well no well it's not because I was
still getting a perfect ping even when I
was dropping out to you and I still had
perfect stream off of YouTube so I'm
thinking it was just Skype was taking a
path that was broken so now I'm routing
through Portland Oregon to see if that
helps
hey Jay where's skunkworks is still at
home I have to bring it back to the
studio I brought the other computer home
but haven't hooked it up yet I'm sorry I
just loved a lot of time to play games
at home alright can you hear me okay now
so far I could hear you fine before but
then it drops off suddenly so what to
see well we'll see what happens now cuz
now now I'm actually routed through a
completely different game way so it's
not even in my state anymore well let me
I'm gonna do a just quick test hold on
standby yep
I am now being rerouted three Amazon and
the call got sharper to you like your
camera looks way sharper than did before
yeah I think I think it was just
something about that path through
through my ISP just was not working with
Skype for some reason yeah
well as I'm monitoring my connection I
said I've not dropped a single frame so
we're good Oh minus T running against
Google right now so that I can see you
know when there's a dropout if there's a
DDoS or anything like that no stay it
stayed consistent in 90 milliseconds for
the whole thing stupid no nothing
questioned what software is being used
for the side-by-side skyping this is
discord it's just window captures and
stuff no no this court I'm sorry it's
got OBS that's it yeah there you go it's
like the old ass version OBS cuz he will
you won't upgrade Jessie gray house says
what would it take to get J vs. Linus
boxing match for charity
barnacles can be the sexy ring girl
um imagine Linus would try and wear me
down with movement but I think I would
move a lot faster and have more
endurance and he would expect so I'd
just be like once once there's once
there's a grab it's kind of all over
is he a black belt yeah but it depends
on what what I think what martial art
depends on what weight that black belt
has true like if it's Krav Maga you
probably should read that it's like I've
got a black belt in Taekwondo it means
you're a great kicker but you lack a
grapple grappling and and punching but
if you're like I've got a blue belt in
jujitsu I would still probably like back
off a little bit you know what I mean
Raziel yeah Brazilians you just do some
badass stuff also you know a lot of
people underestimate judo Jiu knows a
lot of grabs that a lot of grappling and
holding yeah J smash you never hear
about it anymore like you know anybody
that does judo anymore like it so it's
like an old ass martial art but J trying
to trash-talk know this Jade trying to
predict it's not trash no trash talk
J more body mass you think do you think
I have more body mass than Linus your
calls going to shoot again dude is it
doing again yeah hold on here Oh see I'm
gonna ping the googles standby yep still
getting perfect ping time to drop
packets Jerry is delayed yeah he did
freeze for a second there and then it
caught up so he was moving in like 5x
yeah something's up escape Jay versus -
at badminton oh gosh that would be like
I would get murdered I'd watch that
lioness travels with his badminton gear
and hell yeah and he'll find like a bat
if there's a badminton place nearby he
will travel with his gear and he'll go
play badminton no joke Sully is that
like a Canadian thing like I don't know
of anybody that plays badminton like
professionally I don't think it's even a
Canadian thing I think even Canadians
think it's weird it'll be sponsored by
Dyson speaking of that watch our next
video everyone news laughing the
unboxing match yeah Jerry froze again I
think we're I think we're gonna cut this
off at six days so 6:30 I don't feel
like fighting with this for a whole hour
and a half yeah I agree
stupidest guy Oh Oh hold on I did get I
did get a couple spikes on Ping time but
they're not dramatic they're like a
hundred Ms
so a big guy my two businesses are black
belts at something or another Chicago
Edwards the pre-sequel revengeance okay
yeah Jerry's frozen again I can't carry
show by myself I don't want to talk that
much what's my favorite what my favorite
color is color I don't know what that
means
I just just around again where where did
it go now now I'm going through Seattle
okay it's weird though the pink the pink
times are not going above like I had one
packet that went to 100 so that's like
nowhere even enough to affect call
quality Jay volunteering to take on a
Taekwondo black belt
no absolutely not I know Taekwondo black
belts have some of the hardest kicks in
the world
my daughter is second junior black she
actually has her first black belt test
in July so I'm not ignorant to what
black or Taekwondo masters can do
nothing ignorant Taekwondo is pretty
pretty good striking I mean if you got
somebody really limber and really quick
and keep their distance on you they can
do some damage kicking mirror Taekwondo
a literally stands for like punching and
kicking but there's very little punching
it's mostly kicks well it's about reach
right it's about not letting people get
close to you mm-hmm
they don't have a lot of they don't have
a lot of they don't have a lot of
distance increasing moves like the push
kick and things like that but a lot of
it is just straight up speed kicks major
arcing kicks like you know obviously
round houses and yeah acts kitna XK XK
so knock you out you get kicked in the
forehead with the heel um no but a lot
of a lot of like tornado kicks and and
back kicks and stuff like a lot of
spinning moves too there's a lot of
generated power that's why that's why
the best fighters in the world the best
fighters in the world will always have
like high Dan levels of Taekwondo just
because there's no better way to learn
kicking yeah yeah well have you ever
watched like UFC I mean largely the
people that dominated you
see where the bigger guys that could
take a lot more abuse and we're much
better grappling just because of their
mass and their strength yeah but but
they tire quickly that's the thing is
right the bigger you are the faster you
tires so if you can be a wiry little
bastard that can run somebody into the
ground before they can get you then you
know you got an edge Taekwondo is only
for show it's technically a sport it's
considered an Olympic sport too it's
about you know kicking the other
opponents targets and stuff yeah have
you ever heard of a Hapkido of course
Hapkido was one of the arts I wanted to
learn because I loved the idea that it
was a defensive art designed to use the
energy of your opponent against them I
love hockey oh it was like it's a kid
right I did two years of Hapkido and the
reason I did it was because it was a lot
of knees a lot of elbows and a lot of
grabbing and grappling and like so the
heavier you are if you were doing it
properly you could totally use it to
your advantage
right it's a it's a it's a purely
defensive art it's an offensive defense
and it's all about redirecting the
energy coming at you which is some of it
was like great like um shit Steven
Steven Seagal was one of the yes super
like high masters in Hapkido yeah like a
lot of the moves were just be yeah you'd
like you said using people's energy
against them like if they're running at
you or they're charging or they're
leaning their weight into you basically
taking advantage of that pulling them
into you mm-hmm grabbing them and
redirecting them like one of the things
that was I don't know if that we called
him we didn't call him sensei we called
him something else
uh but guy that taught us when we were a
kid he'd do this thing where he'd be
like you run at me as hard as you can
and he'd do this thing where he just
basically sidestep just ever so slightly
and he'd just reach out and grab you by
the shirt and just basically make you do
a faceplant yeah like if you had any
energy running forward like whatsoever
at all he could basically just add to
that just a little bit and faceplant you
and then he'd just be right on top of
you maybe like gosh yeah let's move on
to Car Talk though because reading some
of the chat regarding the martial arts
suddenly there's an awful lot of
armchair masters in the chat suddenly
everyone's a fucking black belt and
whatever BS are they they held and yeah
it's it's kind of sad it's like AMD
versus Nvidia only now suddenly
everybody's a fucking Jackie Chan so I
only did it because it was free that's
all these ideas because my parents
reported growing up and they had a
friend that taught it and I only did it
for two years because after that I just
I I don't like
I'm not a guy that likes pain I like I
like doing shit I like doing
snowboarding and stuff like that but I
don't like things that are intentionally
painful martial arts is intentionally
painful you know why my daughter does
Taekwondo but because that was the thing
that could control her hyperactivity
without medicine that's actually pretty
cool today and I could totally see that
like forcing her to focus on something
and becoming good at something that's a
lot a putting out a lot of energy
absolutely and so it was one of those
things about her learning when those
things about her learning self self
discipline focus and it allowed her to
control her ADHD which she was diagnosed
ADHD with impulse disorder and my wife
and I refused to medicate so we wanted
to redirect and it's worked out very
very well in the two years you've been
doing actually doing it two years this
month and so regardless of whether or
not it's a it's a self defense of art or
it's an offense or a self defense art or
an offensive art or a sport or an
expedition it doesn't our expedition you
know me um yeah what's the word I'm
looking for here were they doing a
demonstration whatever
exhibition exhibition doesn't matter cuz
the point for her was allowing her to
control herself without medication and
it works so yeah and I grown up we
couldn't afford medication so my parents
would just make me go outside and ride
my dirt bike an almost kill myself every
day yeah so that worked out pretty well
too if you guys if you guys want to see
me put my put my money where my mouth is
there's two videos on the internet where
you can see me just get the everliving
shit kicked out of me one is Arnie stick
fighting and the other one is uh it's
Jude oh yeah well and she was like a
third year sighs she's like 53's she's
like 53 years old mother of three and
she weighed maybe a hundred pounds
soaking wet and she fucked me up pretty
good now great did we have rules no
eye-gouging no hair-pulling and she
broke out those rules you also were
afraid to really grab on her because you
didn't want to like grab boob and stuff
towards the end I started getting pretty
desperate I mean cuz you could see
whether your tits and her ass because I
was like I am NOT losing I am NOT losing
you still lost because she eventually
SpiderMonkey DUP to your neck and that's
where it ended yes you got she gets she
gets me in a leg bar and when I tap out
she doesn't respect it no yeah and your
neck was going she makes me scream she
makes me she makes me literally scream
for my life so if you don't watch that
video that videos on you do you ever go
find it though cuz I'm gonna link it for
you guys have to
have to go find ya 100 pounds 100 pound
53 year old woman did fight Jerry and
made Jerry scream yep and then I went
toe to toe with a guy so what a
third-degree black belt and Arnie stick
fighting and I told him not to go easy
on me luckily he ignored that and still
pretty went easy on me but he still
lacerated my leg in my arm pretty good
because I thought it was good to do it
in shorts and a t-shirt well yeah and
those were those are just a lot of like
quick strikes to like the wrists and
stuff things like just make it like hurt
for you to even function yeah and the
sticks they the funny thing is you look
at them they don't look like they cut
because they're just basically circular
like bamboo poles yeah but the way that
you strike with it the way the edge
connects with you at the tip of it oh
fuck man it's like a knife yeah yes I
watch that he was hitting your shoulder
your elbow your wrist it was all about
hitting your joints yeah he was way
quicker to me because all the training
he gave me before we did the fight like
we now know about halfway through and I
just started swinging it like a baseball
bat and then he just like desam it's
kind of like when you watch someone new
to sparring right during the warm-ups
and targets and dummy kicking and
punching it's like everything looks all
textbook and then once you're sparring
is just like like haymakers and whaling
and am I connected with him once and you
could tell when I connect with them
because that's the second when he ups it
like three more notches it says fuck
this yeah just and I didn't want to stop
they stopped it I wasn't the one that
stopped it somebody else stopped it cuz
I I was my adrenaline was flowing I
didn't feel shit until afterwards when I
was like why is my leg on fire life and
a life and a Mustang or life and a
Mustang I think it's an a like naturally
aspirated I think it's a little yeah
well pun there life and a Mustang says J
race Jerry one day would be cool come to
Florida for demo drag race
Jerry's STI versus might my Nissan would
be a good little race in in a straight
line I think that would be that would be
a decent drag race because I'd have you
off the line but you'd make up the
distance if you're doing a half mile
race we're doing a half mile then yeah
but I think in the quarter mile I don't
have enough I don't have enough track to
drive around you yeah cuz my car doesn't
because you're you're n/a you're gonna
have you're way more aerodynamic that's
the biggest problem with the STI is once
you get up to about 110 hundred and 20
miles an hour that would drag increase
the problem is I'm only doing like 108
in the quarter so I don't have enough
track to do it right
my car does zero to 60 in like 4.8 and
the quarter mile is like a 12-9 at 108
yeah I think stock STI is a four six
zero to 60 and - Stage two so it's
probably about three nine or four flat
if I if I do a proper launch which again
is tricky to do but I did a proper
launch and I hooked up I can I could do
it and probably just a touch under four
but then you got the aerodynamics to
keep carrying you so I I start running
up here your bug I write your bug Eyre
blob I you know it's it's a hawk mine
would be the blah blah okay you have a
blob I of the oh five right yeah well
I'm hearing myself feedback in your
microphone so sorry close the it's like
the most non aerodynamic version of that
STI that was made yeah and it was the
year that they did the taller hood scoop
like the hood scoop has like a whole
nother stage where you can see they
basically just grafted more on to it
yeah so it's the tallest of all the hood
scoops which gives you great airflow
through the intercooler but it's also
creates a massive amount of drag Colin's
Jim uses how is the pre-much of you
holding it in your new rig holding up
asking because I have problems of mine I
don't have you in my D frame rig I took
that out when I was trying to get the
air out of the system because so many
people have said they were having
problems with airs we have had a couple
systems here show problems with it like
falling out to be fair one of those
systems I was a brand new radiator that
I did not clean firsthand so I don't
know how much I had to do with Flex the
assist the the thread Ripper system
though that's still going perfectly fine
but that's using the primo chilled
radiators so I would have noticed wait
what do you know the effect doesn't go
anymore okay that's swirlies yeah that
so that doesn't go it just really just
was like looks like a clear blue fluid
now not a trend you know when it was
specular what are you want to call it
so yeah the thread were persistent no
with the silver in it it still looks as
good as day one and that system has only
been using the primo Cho radiators so I
feel like there's a metallurgy or
something but there's been a lot of hit
and miss with a lot of folks using it so
for that reason I've stopped using it
they keep saying they're changing the
formulas and I'm getting to the point
where I'm just like you know what screw
all of these show fluids screw all of
these it's really sparkly blah blah blah
you know it's it's like enough is enough
just need a fluid that's not gonna clog
up your shit and won't have problems so
and I had a phone call with Prima chill
actually where I basically tell him the
same thing I was like guys you know this
is not sure in the independent testing
and stuff it it works well but then and
then what happens is oh I saw the Skype
sounds on hold on I forgot to turn off
the Skype sounds I show you oppression
and said that out loud because now
everyone's gonna dang it
I can't I don't know where my skype
window is so I think you guys get what
I'm saying though well he's mind
addictiveness Jerry is getting stuck so
it's one of those things where once it
came out public so many people started
to mute all sound there we go
so there were so many different test
cases suddenly like so you can test it
in-house have like 10 systems running 20
systems running whatever and then you
get it out with thousands of people
using it suddenly all of the problems
start to show up and I'm kind of sick of
the the constant battle with different
cool 'its and things it sucks
are there any fluids designed for
long-term use yeah XT 1x1 distilled
water anything non opaque like if it's
clear it's probably gonna have a lot
much better longevity than something
that's opaque or sparkly please use
discord video has improved 10/10 yeah I
said we will try discord next time there
he goes
yeah I said we'll try discord next time
but I just haven't had time to like set
anything up here yeah you back yep all
right it feels weird talking about
myself I've never run the show anymore
but like just me so it's weird so is the
view bed hey I can't answer that
question because the problem is here's
the thing there's so many different
types of metals there's so many
different radiators there's different
copper alloys there's different
permeations is the right word right
different variations of card where that
can all interact differently what what
did you clean your radiators with you
know did you do a proper
cleaning job did you check the pH
balance there's so many things that as a
builder you're responsible for that
could lead to the failing of a fluid so
that's why I can't answer that because
you may make the problem happen if that
makes sense and how many people actually
like flush their fluid and stuff
honestly our system I never did it I
don't think I would just guess maybe one
or two people out of every ten actually
take the time to clean the radiators the
radiators in my Dee frame took me two
days to clean by using the process that
I use including the Blitz Pro cleaning
and then actually letting it sit in
there for the 12 hours and shaking and
agitating it heating it up draining it
and then doing like the five gallons of
distilled water flush and then running
the part to through it and then five
more gallons to flush water through it
and checking the pH I don't think most
people do that now I bet you nobody
other than you has ever checked the pH
of their cooling fluid um
I think anyone who has a blitz pro kit
did because it comes with a kit does it
really yeah okay that's kind of funny
yeah so but the thing is pH can change
obviously over time sure
so yeah it's one of the things time
Jerry out of chat well could you want me
to time you where the woman time you had
a chat URI what are you doing I'm just
typing things everyone so well I haven't
typed anything bad I took like hahaha
and loll like I need to be timed out for
that because we warned you bro Diggs
what about 52 year old woman yeah well
that was a couple years ago but 53 year
old woman kicked yours oh yes she fucked
me up I mean I'd we we we agreed on the
rules ahead of time and I I mean I will
say that I did go easy on her but she
did legit wear me out like at the end I
was so tired I couldn't really do
anything and she still have lots of gas
on the tank so she just wore me down
old 2500 Kay and Chet says hey Jay I
love your builds you're an artist at
what you do I'm waiting on my water
cooling parts now can't wait till
they're here well thank you for that
compliment and take your time with your
with your build
make sure dot u dot your T's and cross
your eyes I recommend Home Depot for all
your tubing needs and all your fitting
needs we're doing that video still come
to see if it's all Home Depot fittings
and stuff or you can even do like are
you gonna do like an aquarium pump and
shit or like not an aquarium pump what
is it the like the pond pumps that you
have for like waterfall features
I was thinking about it but some of
those are actually pretty expensive and
still overkill you can get a very cheap
12-volt pump that doesn't have like the
terminal on it you would have to like
yeah put my own molex on there but you
can get one like for like 10 bucks 12
bucks on Amazon I'm just gonna go that
route yeah let me ask you a question
would you ever be interested no in a
very come on a very light collaboration
of potentially 3d printing and impeller
design for a pump to see if you can
increase its efficiency with a 3d
printed and Peller none of the pumps I
use have a non metal impeller so oh no I
mean don't they well are they fully
metal or is it just have a metal insert
so that the magnetism can spin it it's a
metal it's a the outside is metal not
the inside and it's all one piece oh
okay I didn't know that the only pump
that I ever had for my computer had a
plastic impeller that had a metal piece
in it so it could rotate it
I think the DD C's might be no there has
to be metal otherwise it can't spin
yeah I'm trying to think of like how you
would 3d print a pump like but without a
shaft right because the shaft inevitably
no matter what their use my shaft is
always lead you know damn thing I was
born with it they just I can always leak
it for free your pump no Harbor Freight
water pump is how you destroy your
computer in 15 seconds
J when do you think Nvidia spelled wrong
by the way it's going to launch there
there is spelled wrong new cards I think
they're gonna probably not launch it
into like June that's my guess you make
up RAM or not see Jesus you can't say
not see Jesus cross oh my god what water
cooler would you recommend for an MSI rx
580 armor that's a shitty whatever it is
I'd recommend whatever one fits on it
whatever it is dude so so J what do I
need some new ammunition to tell people
when they're like should I get Intel or
Rison in a multi GPU system that they're
using for gaming I'm having a hard time
figuring out like how to say AMD's for
poor people anymore because technically
the rise ins have more CPU have more
available CPU lanes on the lower end
processors and they are technically
cheaper so like why why would you tell
somebody building like a high-end gaming
rig to go Intel versus Rison or
I don't know it's kind of funny like
when I did my when I did the ghost build
which went up yesterday I got a lot of
comments like why rise in and not Intel
why Verizon on it not Intel well because
Intel doesn't offer a CPU option for me
outside ok so yes I know as rock makes
next 299 ITX you also give up features
he also gave up two channels of memory
which is one of the whole reasons for
having X 299 to do dual channel would
just be dumb so Intel doesn't make a
mainstream I TX processor with as many
cores and as many logical processors as
AMD does and the 1,800 X is like 80
bucks cheaper than a 8700 K so the 1,800
X was the logical choice
no no pun intended because 8 cores 16
threads ddr4 overclocked ability all the
PCIe lanes although it doesn't matter a
90 X only one slot anyway yeah although
no I was running m2 so that takes up
PCIe lanes as well but they really came
down a price to performance again a $300
CPU you can get then 1800 X now for 300
bucks it launched at 500 it now costs
300 so it's like like in my in my system
that I have built right here and my
crazy build puget did for me we what
they Intel because quite frankly Adobe
products favor the Intel processors and
the hyper threading and everything like
that that's the only reason we went with
Intel because it does have bottlenecks
like for instance I have three nvme
drives and they're capable of 3.5 gigas
second read/write and two of them are
capped at 2.5 just because a lack of CP
lack of the CPU Lane and you are using a
79 40 X which is the 14 core which is
one that does not have the gimped lanes
I think you only have what 44 lanes I
think so yeah and how many does right
Rison has more than that though don't
they I don't recall what it is on
mainstream remember you're running to
16x cards as well that are running 15 X
each now you're absolutely right so
that's gonna eat up a lot of lay so you
think that I'd still run into the same
problem on horizon then I think you I
think you could dump those down to Gen 2
by 8 and game or PCI aliens get your
speed back on your on your drives but
that's just me oh you know what I didn't
even think about that because
realistically I'm not so I'm not
saturating the 16x with those cards like
not even coming close right now
no and Jeff and jenni
a loss dropping down to eight wouldn't
ya Jen to eight X I think you'd get near
the cap of that but you I think you
would open up lanes back to you and you
get full let's try that tonight cuz I if
even even if let's say hypothetically
even if I lost like two frames a second
or something in a game whatever right if
it was negligible I would way rather
have the throughput on those two other
drives yeah like an extra Giga second
that's a lot that's a hell of a lot of
throughput you're probably you'd
probably use that more than your actual
you know card performance I tend to
agree especially even in the video
editing space thinking about that yeah I
would I would use the bandwidth from the
storage like especially if I was loading
like projects with a lot of layers and
stuff like that yeah I'd use that a lot
I did a video showing how Adobe didn't
care what GPU was in the computer as
long as it had a GPU I tested it with
AMD cards I test it with Nvidia cards I
went all the way back to a GTX 580 and
showed that it the render times were all
within one second of each other with any
GPU plugged into the system the amount
of load on the GPU varied between like
5% and maybe 25% but the render times
we're all within one second of each
other no matter what graphics card went
in whether it be a waiting - those are
like h.264 because they dramatically
changes depending on what codec URI is
h.264 UQ YouTube 4k preset yeah cuz like
for instance on this computer if I
render h.264 it only uses like 10% of
the GPU when I when I have the GPU load
opened in task manager right however if
I put it on the blue the blue ray codec
was at each 265 the new one it maxes it
out at 100% in the render times like a
quarter well why would you do that well
I can't because of the files like
massively ginormous and YouTube doesn't
know what it is and yes the sound not
only that last time I updated it or
uploaded in HD at 265 it went up and
then YouTube gave me an error at a
hundred percent yeah see you were lucky
you see you got an error i actually
succeeded an upload this was a year ago
when I did this I uploaded the h.265 and
it worked but there was no audio and I
went looked online and they're like oh
yeah it's like itch they don't even
support transcoding that so we're
surprised you even got video yeah so but
but if they fix that that would be
awesome that would solve all my problems
because they h.265 codec uses one
hundred of all my CP
and uses almost all of the GPU but h.264
there's just no it's been around for so
long
nobody's created an updated version of
that codec that you that heavily utilize
the GPUs gamers Nexus has a video in
which they saw the limit of eight lanes
only with the Titan V yeah so Titan V
was probably fast enough to be the only
one that could actually saturate all
eight lanes so I would try that go gen
two by eight that's a good idea I'm
gonna try that and if that actually
works that that that's a neat solution I
bet your page it would love to love to
hear that I mean by default if you leave
it on auto the motherboard is gonna just
be like oh yeah these are generally gen
three cards go gen 3 by 16 on both but
you're not gonna really gain anything so
and to do that I just go into the BIOS
basically and just take it out of auto
go into the BIOS into the PCIe settings
ok it might be it might be under
integration integrate I think it seen it
I think I've seen it in there and like
you're right it was on auto for
everything like every PCI slot you set
on it so let's make it gen to reboot and
then if you go and look at your piece of
whatever PCIe devices are plugged in
then it should say gen gen to 8x and
then because those lanes would be
available the nvme drive should just
pick them up automatically if I leave
them on auto right each motherboard is
probably different but it should I'm
gonna try that because man if that works
that would be it depends on the
motherboard honestly because technically
it's still considered a PCIe device and
like I think I'm I ran page board it
actually shows me MDOT to where I can
select the gen speed on that as well so
it depends on the motherboard like my
rampage board I believe has a setting
where I could change MDOT - yeah it's
good it's got the the gigabyte X 299 rs7
yes I have the gigabyte bio structure
sucks to begin with so good luck on that
one it's it's it's very Windows II they
gigabyte has very solid hardware they
just always are lacking in their BIOS
and software integration
I like their nav ability X the system
right now has 2 2 terabyte Samsung Evo
960s and then a one terabyte Evo 960 as
mice is my scratch drive basically yeah
and the only one that's getting full
performance right now is my C Drive we
have that configured in that slot so
that that's getting all the bandwidth
but the other two I mean they're losing
a gig a gigabyte a second throughput
that's huge so that third of the wacky
Burton chat says
you strictly a roadie or would you
dabble into mountain biking one I'm
strictly on nothing at the moment if you
can't tell by the man boobs right here I
just haven't had a chance to ride lately
it's the weather actually we finally got
a little bit of a winter here in
California it's been like the 40s and
50s yeah I know it's not a winner for
most of the places but for us it is it's
been everywhere
yeah so the weather finally turned in
March we were getting what's considered
our typical winter and I don't have
winter riding gear fleece lining or
anything like that and I tried riding in
the cold in mice like my sweatpants and
my hoodie and that was bad like the air
gets trapped in there and makes you cold
but I don't mountain bike only because
of past experiences when I was a
teenager and stuff I have that hold my
beer syndrome and I tend to try things I
don't have the skill to do and then I
always end up in the ER so well I do
that on the street you remember when I
fucked up your bike like getting tangled
up in the middle of in the middle of
traffic yeah by going ass over teakettle
and in the middle of the intersection in
front of all the cars those slow-motion
wreck I've ever had oh shit oh shit oh
shit and then I hear flop flop crash
flat fleshy sound them and then I hear
the sound of the bike metal hitting the
ground yeah I still have a scar from
that toes my bike the side of the frames
all scratched up yeah I still I still I
still have a scar from that that never
actually healed there's still a dent in
my shin from that my bike still looks
exactly like it did after the crash oh
my god well hey you fix it up I'll come
down and record again adds an aluminum
frame it's okay to get scratched now if
my carbon frame had taken that hit I
would have been a bit upset well next
time next time you come up this way
because I still want you to come up and
help me with the sound treatment of this
room because it's fucking it sucks but
next time you come up let's grab the red
power bikes and go do iron horse it's
just a big it's a nice easy incline
eleven hundred foot climate over like
six miles six or eight miles and it's
just all just scenery like you don't see
anything but just like animals and
terrain is love the battery holds out
because I don't want to then suddenly
have to crank that big ass bike up that
incline
no no the beauty of this ride is you
just ride until the battery goes dead
then you turn around cuz it's all
downhill okay it used to be a train
track they just they just tore up the
train track so it's a perfect grade all
the way up and then when you run out of
battery because I usually go up we made
it 11 miles last time we went before the
battery died and we just turned around
and coasted the whole thing all the way
back yeah so yeah no I
we do it if my 300-pound ass can do it
you you'll do it like no problem you'll
probably go ten times the distance
because you'll actually pedal a little
rubber bracket says barnacle is when
you're gonna do a Dyson vacuum review I
have like three of them I'm surprised I
haven't already tell you guys what
sucked about that Dyson thing and the
reason why you guys like probably saw a
non-stop stream of it and by the way I
saw someone out there like including a
list of all the youtubers who did a
Dyson review and why their unsub amande
they included me in that list and why
are you talking about it and do a Dyson
review what's going on with that I don't
understand like why would you end up
somebody for doing a Dyson review well I
think okay so I think people were just
mad because their entire inbox for the
entire day day before yesterday was
nothing but Dyson reviews because here's
what Dyson did typically when there's an
embargo lifts or campaign there is just
a what I call a shotgun blast of video
so you guys have all seen this when a
when new graphics card launches perfect
example 6 a.m. boom all 12 of your
favorite tech youtubers put up the same
content right the same graphics card
with you not me except you but I said
favorite Jerry happy way anyway so you
guys have seen these shotgun approach
where it's just one big random blast of
here's all the content Dyson did a
staggered review where every hour
throughout the day two more videos word
really so there was a 6 a.m. to one out
7 a.m. to one out 8 a.m. to one out 9
and they had like a ton of people on
this list it was hitting Instagram it
was hitting Facebook it was hitting
Twitter because they also had social
media call-out campaigns as well so they
did the machine gun approach where it's
just like a tete-a-tete like a constant
firing of videos throughout the day so
every time you logged into Facebook or
not Facebook but YouTube even Facebook
yet all you saw was Dyson Dyson Dyson
Dyson Dyson because they literally did
it the worst way they possibly could if
they were truly trying to get viewership
and excitement and hype about a product
they did it in the worst way possible
because in the shotgun blast at least
has time to ramp down where throughout
the day as a viewer you were probably
only getting more and more irritated
every time you saw the word Dyson
because it was never-ending
so that actually
messin with SEO pretty dramatically too
because if you follow ten people and
they release a video and the next one
released another video that's diced and
dice and dice and the algorithm is
probably gonna be like well you must be
really into fucking dice and if
everybody you subscribe to is reviewing
it isit yeah I'm so it's probably put
them at the top of your sub box every
time another Dyson video came especially
if you watch the first one right if you
watched one of them SEO would be like
damn this guy's got a boner for Dyson
and then there's a new video coming out
every two hours hitting the top of your
sub box we have a Dyson here it's not
even like a part of that campaign it was
a Dyson vacuum I owned from years ago
it's one the first one so it's J its
ginormous and it makes all kinds of
noise it's terrible it's a terrible
vacuum cleaner but yeah I was just that
three of them now I've got the original
one the the B no the big purple monster
yeah mine's redness it was the target
edition right right and then they have
like the animal version that was purple
that's the one we got because it like
had the different brush for getting cat
hair out we got that one we got the
canister version which is which I like
the canister back cuz it doesn't weigh
anything you don't have to like tow it
around a whole bunch of shit with it but
the one I like the most is their little
handheld one the one that's got that
digital motor thing in it yeah it goes
for about they say 40 minutes that's
bullshit it's like 20 minutes but I can
I can vacuum the entire house it has
just as much suction as the big one and
it's just a handheld vacuum with a long
wand on it with a beater bar yeah and
it's just as good of a job as the big
ones you just have to dump your bar
ladies my beater bar shut the fuck up
let him talk hey Mario
fuck off you're a long and time amount
you weren't interrupting me I'm gonna
timeout this little motherfucker I'm
just kidding Mario I'm not gonna time
you out I just wonder so basically I
think everyone would agree with me that
Dyson is just the apple of that games
that's fair
hey they was gonna hit you in a minute
Nick they have their marketing campaigns
and even their marketing style like even
their their advertising style like in
their own ads is very Apple esque you
know but but how many companies do that
nowadays though like I can I can think
of way more companies than just dice and
they kind of pretty much a ripoff Apple
for Batum for like the whole clean and
to the point hipster advertising you'll
do what Nick said hold on I'll do it
hold on unless I want to
dude what's he doing he's pretending -
he's pretending like he doesn't hear me
in chat you're like I'll do it hold on
oh you know they'll talk about Mario I
already told him he's got a free pass
would agree Dyson this shit just like
Apple but okay but let me ask you this
did you think Dyson was shit prior to
this campaign or do you think Dyson was
shit after this campaign that's a good
question because I mean I previously I
don't know anything about the campaign
other than what you just told me but I
like I actually do like Dyson as a
product do I think it's overpriced yes
do I think it's any more innovative than
it was when it first came out no yeah
but I do like Dyson vacuums I mean they
do a good job I've never had one break
on me
so Dyson are they have the Apple of
vacuums they're overpriced and
hipsterish tell you what's a piece of
shit a Sleep Number though I'm I am so
regretting about that Sleep Number bed
that one is fuck I don't regret our
Sleep Number but I didn't go I didn't go
to the top-tier like you I started near
the bottom though the biggest complaint
I have with it is that it's two separate
beds the reasons I bought it is because
it's two separate beds so you have two
different sets of adjustment but the
problem is they both fucking slide off
the bases when you deflate them they
lean to the side really hard the big
mattresses don't have that problem if
the little ones do say I've got a Cal
King size but it doesn't do any of that
but I also I don't have the one that has
the the sit up function makes me mad
just makes me bad I understand sleep
never and an angry Leslie tomber
is quite honestly Sleep Number is quite
honestly nothing but a glorified a
glorified air mattress it is did you
watch they look like an air mattress
bladder with a pool noodle around it
yeah the fuckers like pull out like what
and when I watch that was kind of like
scratching my head because I was like I
figured a mattress would just show up
and they would just set it up no they
build the mattress at your house come
and he says you basically have what
looks like the outside of a mattress
they unzip the top of it they stuff a
Coleman fucking air mattress in it and
then they put a line of foam that looks
like you know you pack your router's
from Newegg in like goes around the
outer perimeter to make it somewhat
rigid and then they just put two layers
of like fucking Coleman like camping
foam on top of it as if the whole thing
together and inflate it I'm like are you
shitting me yeah it's it's quite
overpriced for what it is but like I
said we didn't go to the top tier I
think ours was like 2,800 I think and
it's funny you gets for a cow King you
could spend that much on two
innerspring mattress now we're talk
about mattress talk but you got a you
got bad back like me you got a bad back
like me or even Jerry you pay attention
to these things this is true so yeah no
I'm happy with ours though because it
doesn't move it doesn't it doesn't
change settings it stays wherever we put
it and my sleep did improve because I
had a I had a 12 inch high density
memory foam mattress prior to that but
the people and I understand the memory
foam cells do break down over time and
then you get the setec and they get hot
- that's other thing is even the memory
foams that have like the cooling layers
and stuff on them I still sweat really
bad I don't think that's the mattresses
fault
no I'm serious because I'm being serious
because I don't sweat with the new one
we got Sleep Number we what the Sleep
Number has active cooling built into it
too though the yeah the the memory foam
mattresses breathe pretty well I mean we
have you know pretty hot summers here in
SoCal yeah and I'm also a hot sleeper
but I didn't really like feel like the
memory foam mattress has held heat or
anything like that well but uh he had
was a $3,000 one from Costco and it was
thick it was it was it was 18 inches
thick which we couldn't even hardly find
sheets that would go down to the bottom
of it and it had seven layers in it and
one of them was supposed to be like a
cooling layer it was like this blue blue
foam cooling layer and I always
overheated on that thing like I never
like would get wake up in the morning
and not and then the problem is when you
get hot with memory foam the viscosity
of a change is based on temperature oh
so you'd lay on it and it's like really
really stiff and then as the night goes
on when you get hotter and hotter and
hotter you start to sink into it at
least mine I did sounds like you had a
better one than I did he broke your vibe

of three showers I take I usually have
my cell phone with me because I just set
it on the little we have a little rack
that holds like the shampoos and stuff
and I just set it on the little rack on
there and I can play you know music or
porn or music or whatever works pretty
good
I can go 15 minutes without my phone I
can go an entire day without my phone if
I forget to charge the battery and I'm
too lazy to go get the charging cable
but wait did you hear the creepy
laughter from Alexa was going off for no
particular reason Skynet is rising I saw
in training news on Twitter Alexa's were
just randomly laughing that's weird that
would freak me the fucking yeah if
you're sitting there and you're living
I'm just chilling watching TV and then
suddenly Alexa - starts laughing yeah
have you ever had a Lexus carry it to
where it accidentally triggers when you
don't say anything even remotely close
to the word Alexa don't have an alerts
oh you don't okay well we have we have
three of them and every once while
you'll just be downstairs you just be
watching TV and something on the TV
won't even say anything close to Alexa
it'll be like how about that Mariners
game last night and Alexa will be like I
don't know Mariners game and it just
freaks you out because you hear the
sound coming from the living room and
you're like oh god is somebody in the
house I hate it see and that's why I'm
pretty cool fine with not having any of
these you know smart home where they
call home pods home assistance whatever
the call like yeah home assistance or
something boy's voice assistance yeah
don't take the tag off what I'm about
Xander loves his though he just he runs
through the house all day asking it for
farts and the play music and stuff he
it's like he in he'll even uh one of the
cool things about is like he has one in
his room the little one little tiny pods
j-just said stop saying Alexa everyone's
telling us to stop saying Alexa
apparently we're treating their Alexa's
oh no no here be quiet four seconds I do
this one more in copy old time

work and add it to the the shopping gun
I've tested if Alexa order condoms

stop turning on your Alexa what's the
Google one I forget the command behave
Oh hazel

think it's hey Google alright okay
Google I don't know hey Google search

hey Siri find porn oh yeah yeah there we
go chats blowing up so I'm guessing
where we're making some ground here oh I
don't know how many people actually have
Alexa going right now next to them I
don't know you'd be surprised I wasn't
even thinking one morning when I was on
I was showing people talking to my Alexa
and it was setting off everybody else's
they were just mean chat was scrolling
like crazy like a lot of people have
these I've heard people putting it in
their YouTube videos where they'll just
randomly be like hey Alexa or Alexa
Alexa yep Alexa tell a joke Danny that's
actually a working command so do you
think Alexa's right now are telling
jokes across the world tons of them tons
look guys if you're Alexa told the joke
type it in chat so we know what the joke
is
cuz I've heard them all I've heard like
every joke that thing del I'll know
Google's homes that I have my apologies
I don't understand even also did you see
the Simon Says feature see say Alexa
Simon Says Barna Cleese is the best
YouTube channel ever in J is a dickhole
I think that dick whole parts gonna
probably make it not I understand
probably Alexa I do it all time oh go
ahead Alexa play heavy metal I'm glad we
don't have one now or or for like people
who are going to sleep here in a couple
hours be like Alexa set alarm for 6
hours Alexa set an alarm for 2 hours
Alexis set an alarm for one hour Alexa
that's it just Alexa Alexa set alarm for
one minute my goop my echo diet is going
nuts about 4000 Alexa's it's kind of
learn for four minutes though you said
no I said for one minute time so it just
goes off in a minute
and this asked for a fart I like how
you're waiting for a response Jerry I'm
sorry I know I'm pausing so that it
doesn't hear something and think we keep
talking it I say Dave next up volume 11
heard oh sorry
Alexa volume 10 there we go now
everybody's volumes cranked to the max
Alexa played jazz Alexa call the police
is that a real thing I don't think so
but I wouldn't oh my goodness oh my god
how many people you think I'm plug their
their Amazon echoes you see the smart
people just unplug it the not so smart
people are the ones crying for us to
stop unless it in some place where they
can't easily turn it off can't they just
say Alexa turn off or something like
that
no you just Alexa stop listening now you
go you're welcome that'll that'll mute
her and tell you go push you have to
physically push a button now on its way
yeah but now you may have wanted to get
up which is worse the Alexa talking or
now they have to get out of their chair
well judging by the mean weight of our
audience being roughly 417 pounds they
probably mean weights oh my goodness I'm
bad my echo isn't called Alexa oh you
could change a name huh oh shit what are
the two other names home I can remember
uh Amazon order for teenage dildo what's
the other one computer order for teenage
dildo names it goes by oh I don't know
did you you have to pick a name from the
list you can't just have it be anything
at least the back last time I did the
firmware you clean up Alexa alternate
alternate names yep
okay you can call it echo let's see how
to change a Lex's name there we go we're
just before we leave here I'll crap
that's playing music I don't there we go
where does it say the names though
device name echo
doesn't say what the names are anyway
that wasn't an easy search how to change
echos wake word yeah what is a there's
only a couple that you can name it to I
thought I'm looking here oh you can
change if they have a link to their
phone you could do this too you can say
Alexa oh the three names are Alexa
Amazon and echo yeah so those were the
oh and I said computer yeah it's echo
yeah so you can do one with that go
I put Alexa into my sex doll so that
she's more interactive oh you can do
that you can say uh okay Google send SMS
to wife
this is barn achlys I have his phone
please tell me if that worked okay
Google send text to wife I'm cheating on
you I don't think that actually work I
don't think Bryan Bryan just ran up here
with a very displeased look on his face
he literally ran up the stairs oh my god
I'm looking at Google right now and that
is an accepted command you're saying
clear buy it clear you're saying nearby
now are you are you babysitting me oh my
god uh I don't know Bryan doesn't look
happy though I didn't actually cheat on
my wife I'm trying to get them to say
they did okay just checking
didn't work a lot of people are saying
no sorry I can't send text yet is what
I'm one said sorry can't okay because
you probably have to have it set up for
SMS on whatever device it is I guess
oh my god that's funny though they're
talking about Alexa and this dude asks
about head a bit Internet yeah the
people were at we understand - not
everyone is watching the show and in
live they can come in later and start
from the beginning so they may not be
watching what we're actually watching
but they're chatting thinking that we're
still at the part they're watching if
that makes sense the best part the best
part is now everybody's gonna watch this
afterwards the recorded show and it's
gonna be setting off all their shit for
like weeks to come Cory Cortana
mmm-hmm we can do Cortana commands wait
can you get it to do here let's try this
uh okay google tweet J's two cents it
works
hmm I don't think it'll no J's two cents
like I don't think it will no I don't
think I know I just I don't think I
don't know the the Z does that make
sense well he gets barn achlys every
time I say barn it actually says
barnacle he's not barnacles when Iced
tell it so it figured it out somehow
yeah but now everyone's just gonna tweet
me saying it works pretending like it
worked that's true that's true there's
no way to like know if it actually
worked or not
yeah darn well that was fun kind of not
really
there was this I didn't even think about
that but I didn't even think about all
the Alexa talk we were doing until
suddenly everyone's like stop saying
Alexa stop it yeah hey you know what we
completely missed the topic oh yeah you
had no one that's actually kind of the
important topic well we'll just we'll
blaze through is everybody oh probably
happy about well at least if you live in
Washington so Washington our governor
jay Inslee just signed a bill to enact
net neutrality in Washington State so
they're bypassing the federal block and
they're passing it as a state law that
that's basically a verbatim copy of net
neutrality rules that say that no
telecommunication service can charge
more or limit access to content freely
available on the internet so that's
awesome
although the thing that I heard that's
not so awesome is I can't remember which
state it is but one of the states is
actually trying to pass a law that
complements the removal of net
neutrality saying that if you want
access to potentially offensive or
erotic content you have to pay an extra
$20 a month so it's exactly what
everyone's fear was yep and guess who's
enacting it it's actually the state
government so where everybody was like
oh yeah I know the governments we don't
want government to have control over our
internet you dip shits by getting rid of
net neutrality you basically untied the
government's hand to do whatever they
want with the Internet
see there's tweets coming in saying it
works but I can tell they're fake cuz
they all are different like the
capitalization is not the same on any of
them god the things people do for
attention man I know right cuz they want
that J's to sense attention man they
just want it
Kentucky uh yeah I see the tweets but
I'm not acknowledging it so since I has
not noticed
yep you guys Jenner has not acknowledged
that's the I noticed that I didn't
acknowledge that's it yeah alexxa add
condoms to shopping cart
huh now people are saying it doesn't
work Jerry what's Rhode Island think you
rest rusty but it was actually a rhode
island was the one saying that they're
gonna they're gonna pass a law saying
basically to raise tax money or whatever
it's gonna be a twenty dollar additional
charge for ISPs to allow you to access
potentially offensive content or nudity
basically so porn yeah so Rhode Island
is they're lucky aren't you government
should control Internet yeah well the
good news is a VPN will work around that
guy so if you guys happen to live in
Rhode Island to do not pan or do not pay
the $20 just go just go use either a
free VPN service or use something like a
stroll or what's other one a god well
there's a stroll there's Nord VPN which
is a good one yeah there is also it's
like free internet act not free internet
search for VPNs do look at the ratings
for them the the bigger VPNs tend to
have a lot more servers available to
them so you can switch IPs and be in any
country like if you ever run into
content where it's like you cannot watch
this content from your country you can
literally go into the VPN and just
change it to the country origin for that
site refresh it and then you have access
the Neuromancer says it's a one-time fee
who cares it's still extortion is that
the right word extortion yeah no it's
torts that'd be extortion if they're if
they're forcing you to pay for something
that you'd normally get for free yeah
that's the totally extortion anyways so
tunnel bear tunnel bear I've heard of
private Internet access that was one oh
yeah yeah I try private Internet access
it wasn't as fast as a stroll though no
no wait waist lower but they had a lot
of servers and he had Nord VPN is one
I've been using too that's really that's
really fast yeah and I know I've done
I've obviously I've obviously done ads
on Nord bpms because I actually use it
and liked it so yeah oh another thing is
- do you ever use the Usenet Jay I've
never used these yet Usenet so so use
net or otherwise known as the nntp
protocol is it's basically like the old
way before the web like way back in the
days it was the way that people
basically had a forum to post text and
then people forget how to post by Nuri's
by encoding binaries into text and then
posting them as multi-part posts and
stuff like that will
using it is still alive and well a lot
of people don't realize it I use one
called
easy it's easy news thanks called easy
news calm the cool thing about them is
they're like their base plans nine
dollars a month which gives you full
access to Usenet in every article posted
over like the last ten years but it also
gives you free access to their VPNs and
their VPNs tend to get around a lot of
the stuff like Netflix doesn't think
that they're VPNs at least some of their
VPNs Netflix doesn't realize it's a VPN
so you can do Netflix through it which a
lot of VPNs you can't and it's just
because they're VPNs aren't heavily used
music okay cuz everyone's noticing you
did he's all bobbing his head around I
know if he was if he was trapped in his
thoughts or if he was listening on music
yes hey by the way it's not that's not
sponsored guys but easy news.com if you
if you've ever wondered what you said is
it's actually it's pretty cool and you
get a VPN for free basically they just
give you a VPN with it that you can use
this like in multiple countries and
everything like that
mmhmm yeah alrighty then well I'm gonna
since we started two minutes early I'm
gonna edit two minutes early
mmm yeah and then we can go and stuff
our fat faces and get all fat again well
I'm already fat but you can get fat
again I get fat or just get fat alright
I'm gonna roll the outro now are you
ready you got your button push I'm good
okay rolling thank you
so you have a wonderful night and I will
see you next week
provided that J isn't like hanging out
with Beyonce or something Alexa order
condoms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
