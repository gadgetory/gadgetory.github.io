and if you've been following my social
media then you knew we had some more
topics coming regarding this guy gtx
980ti which i'm sure that a lot of you
are sick about hearing are sick of
hearing about whatever the midea kept
this thing under wraps which meant that
there was no day one custom PCB options
for the 980ti as i'm waving it around
like a freaking chopping axe a lot of
you guys were like hey the 92 TI is
pretty awesome but i kind of want to
wait for some custom PCB options well
guys we're taking a look at our very
first custom PCB here for the 980 TI on
the channel that is going to be the g1
gaming from gigabyte this is a card that
many of you specifically were waiting
for so let's go ahead and see how this
thing stacks up the new EVGA silent
series power supplies offer excellent
silence and efficiency through their new
EVGA Eco mode technology and also
features a seven year warranty for
worryfree gaming click the link in the
description to learn more well here she
is it's a she I've dubbed it a she it's
she it's surely or call her surely you
might notice right off the bat it looks
a little bit different than your
standard g1 gaming cooler well that's
because they've added some aluminum
accents to the front and to the back so
that kind of makes it a little bit
different than the previous g1 gaming
that you found on the 980 and the 980 or
the 970 now of course the g1 gaming is
built custom from the ground up by
gigabyte using invidious GM 200 core now
obviously this is the 980 TI so it's got
20 816 CUDA cores versus tight nexus
3072
but you know it when it comes to core
clocks and it just overall Headroom with
that 256 cuda cores it's not hard to get
nipping at the heels of Titan X
performance on cards that have less CUDA
cores because they can get much better
over clocks out of these things remember
the tight next card companies like
gigabyte and EVGA ZOTAC and all of them
are not able to build custom cards they
can come up with custom coolers but they
cannot come up with custom cards and
custom PCBs to improve upon the design
that is completely managed in-house by
Nvidia so that's why the 980 TI was so
exciting to so many people because we
new cards like this
going to be coming to the market now
it's not a whole lot different about
this cooler on the 980ti versus the 980
and we've got the color accents on there
you've got the same legendary i/o I mean
I many people are still using DVI DVI
cables are able to give you up to 144
Hertz if you're using a dual link DVI
anyway but you got your two DVI is the
DVI I a DVI d3 display ports and an HDMI
2.0 so you've got so much connectivity
on this card it's freaking amazing now
it is a single BIOS card there's no
second BIOS on this thing so that's a
little bit of a sacrifice there but
considering what you get overall with
this card that's a sacrifice I think
that's worth making most of the time the
second BIOS isn't going to matter to you
unless you're doing custom BIOS flashing
and the second BIOS on most cards
usually it's just a different fan
profile it doesn't give you any better
overclocking now unlike the reference
model this thing does require two eight
pin PCI plugs or PCI Express power plugs
on there that's because this thing like
I said goes in PCB that you guys didn't
know is gonna say that again okay so
let's just take a second here to talk
about the cooler the cooler on this
thing is absolutely massive and beefcake
this card is heavy that's because it's
got five massive copper heat pipes
running the entire length of the card
you have a ton of fins on this
thing and you have a copper base that's
covering not only the core but also all
of the RAM as well as active cooling for
the V RMS Thank You gigabyte I don't
know why some companies just don't seem
to think vrm cooling is very important
so this thing is absolutely beefcake
this is heavier then even the 980 if I'm
not mistaken it might be the same weight
but man compared to the 1970 and the
1960 versions of this this thing is
freaky it's like I mean I could be doing
curls with this thing and I would get
tired but last but not least they did
give us a multi color changing LED on
the top of the graphics card this
thing's got seven different colors that
you can choose from it's not RGB meaning
you can't like pick it from a spectrum
of color you can't customize the color
in terms of you know the 18 point 6
million or whatever it really is you get
seven colors to choose from and so now
you're not gonna be stuck with that blue
LED that was on all the other windforce
in g1
cards you now can customize this to your
build needs that's cool because now the
g1 gaming card is an option for people
doing like red builds or yellow builds
it's even a yellow LED on this thing
maybe they were thing about skunk works
I don't know but that is freaking
amazing thank you guys it's the little
things like that that make these cards
so exciting and then of course the same
amazing backplate that it comes on all
of the g1 gaming cards so enough about
that let's go ahead and put it on the
test bench and let's compare it to the
980ti reference and the Titan X to see
exactly how this thing is performing
well there you go guys the gtx 980ti g1
gaming from gigabyte is still one of the
top dogs when it comes to just being one
some of the best GPUs that you can buy
gigabyte puts so much effort into this
line of product it just really goes to
show that their enthusiasm for gamers
and they're just willingness to be non
compromising when it comes to the amount
of quality that they put into these
cards is really one of the best that you
can get on the market I mean they're
what they call their GPU gauntlet which
is their own personal bidding process of
making sure that you get the best GPUs
possible or cores inside these GPUs it
definitely is apparent I mean I was able
to get this thing up to fifteen hundred
and twenty nine megahertz now I know
some folks are going to be like will the
tests weren't fair because the Titan was
only at 1400 well truth be told that
sample of the Titan won't go any higher
than 1400 anything above that and it
continues to crash so you know
unfortunately the ones and skunkworks
are getting much higher they're getting
up to about fourteen hundred and fifty
but that fifty megahertz isn't going to
make a huge difference but as you can
see for much less in the price of a
Titan you can get something like the g1
gaming which is going to match the Titan
in performance be quieter in fact let's
let's go ahead and take a quick test
here of how the sound is of the
reference card on the Titan the 1980 I
and the g1 gaming from gigabyte
you
well unless you the kind of gamer that
likes to listen to a vacuum cleaner
while you're gaming obviously the
reference blower cooler is not going to
be for you so fortunately there are
going to be a lot of different custom
coolers available a 980ti trim coming
out in the future but g1 gaming here
pretty much beaten out most of the other
aftermarket coolers and custom PCB
options don't forget this is a custom
PCB is not referenced it is completely
built from the ground up by gigabyte
giving you fantastic overclocking
amazing temperatures amazing noise level
72 degrees Celsius while overclocked
maintaining this whisper noise level is
absolutely fantastic and then on top of
it all they've listened to us finally
and stop giving us just the blue LED and
now you have seven colors to choose from
when it comes to LEDs I mean you've got
white red blue yellow green teal purple
I mean it's like they pretty much any
build aesthetic that you've got now you
can accommodate that with the card with
the LEDs and now just have that clashing
blue LED which a lot of people
complained about so stepping up the game
the g1 gaming from gigabyte definitely
is a card to be reckoned with so there
you go guys I'm going to be at e3 this
week that means unless I can find a way
to get a mobile tech talk station going
while I'm out at e3 on Thursday
Tech Talk this week will probably be
postponed again simply because I'm not
going to be here I'm going to be at the
LA Convention Center visiting and
looking around at what's going on at e3
it's actually my first time going to e3
I've seen e3 I've watched live events
I've never actually been to it so this
is going to be kind of fun anyway guys
thanks for watching let me know what you
think about this card it will be
available soon you're probably not going
to find it at Amazon or Newegg or
anything yet it's gonna be available
soon there's only been a couple of
samples sent out so give it some time
they've got to actually make this stuff
it takes time to manufacture it so there
you go
as always guys follow on social media if
you want to have some fun conversations
or make fun of me or get irritated with
all the cycling stuff I put up whatever
whatever the case may be you guys thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
