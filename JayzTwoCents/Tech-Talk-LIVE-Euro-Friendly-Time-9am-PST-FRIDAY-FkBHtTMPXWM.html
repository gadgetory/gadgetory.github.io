you
how can you say you're in love with her
she gives me stick
you
okay we're live and I really really hate
xsplit I don't know why xsplit has to
just be the absolute biggest pain in the
ass ever I mean seriously so I was able
to fix the audio delay but then I can't
get the stupid like if I'm playing an
audio sound like the mp3 background
music year I can hear it but it doesn't
pay playthrough xsplit even though it's
an xsplit source like a screen seen
source Oh what the hell uh anyway it's
time to tweet out the stream info guess
you guys should just put on your own
background music then since YouTube
we're not youtube but exploits being
stupid how the hell you guys doing I'm
doing great because when i'm done with
the stream i am hopping in the car with
the wife heading to Las Vegas and I'm
never coming back ever and someone's
gonna be watching this while eating
pizza so means I hate your face because
I like pizza and I can't I don't eat
pizza anymore bad for you okay so I let
people kind of trickle in here get your
tech questions ready i'm going to be
ending this like promptly in 57 minutes
feels weird doing live streams in the
morning I never ever ever do live
streams in the morning it's just
different strange but it gives a lot of
you guys out there an opportunity to
chat and be in the stream and all that
stuff hello from London you know a
London to me is one of those cities that
I would it's on my list of places to
visit before I die I don't know what it
is about the city and then that big-ass
ferris wheel
there that's scary I think about it
that's actually pretty scary I probably
will never ever do the big giant Ferris
wheel thingy because I'm afraid of
heights and I don't even like doing the
little ferris wheel thing my mic sounds
weird is my mic sound weird anybody else
I am just having all sorts of technical
difficulties today it sucks demons rat
damn you Jay you scheduled your live
stream to take place at the same time as
the star citizen livestream curse you
well I guess I should probably start
checking when every other YouTube or
anywhere ever is live streaming anyway
um let's see the papa do says he's good
thank you I'm glad to hear it are we
doing the time-lapse video I'm gonna try
and do a timelapse video on the way to
Vegas using vine because vite is a
pretty awesome app if you guys don't
have vine for your phone you should get
it it's really really cool as I asked
tell me if I audio sounds weird too it
sounds it sounds different to me right
in here I don't know it's what's going
on here just it sounds different to me
but whatever people like to point out
when I'm late like I'm on a sigil I'm on
my own schedule just saying uh so the
was at today's date 17th for days four
more days where I know more about the
xbox infinity and whether or not it's
going to be worth your money and my
people ask me a lot lately Jay are you
gonna buy the new xbox and the answer to
that is eventually but I'm not going to
buy it right when it comes out because I
never buy consoles when they first come
out because they're the most expensive
they have the least game selection and I
just I don't know I've never I've never
been an early adopter of new console
systems geez i think the xbox 360 had
been out for well over two years before
i bought
one and I just partially because I'm not
a major console gamer but I do like the
changes they're making to the Kinect
system with the finger recognition and
it's supposed to be more accurate and
that would appeal to my wife because she
does a lot of stuff with the Kinect and
she does a lot of the you know the zumba
and that sort of stuff so she would
probably like it my daughter really
likes the Kinect and if it's not if the
new kinect isn't going to be backwards
compatible because I don't only think
about it haven't done any research then
I'm going to have to on second
anyway I'm gonna have to probably update
that way she can have the new stuff
because she's really into it so anyway
debt audio delay is there an audio delay
back let me see
uh that audio delay yes sir yeah there's
a little bit of a delay but you're just
have to deal with it xsplit is not being
friendly not at least not as friendly as
I like actually I'm watching I'm
watching it on xsplit I think the little
bit of camera delay actually the audio
is ahead of the camera so let's be fair
here so I've got to go into the expert
sound settings and I've got to change it
so that the audio delay is about 100
milliseconds but whatever Maximus flat
flicks floods flax it says would you
recommend Nvidia or AMD for $15,000
build I think that's a typo for $15,000
build that's the case I guess why not go
for titans because you could clearly
drop four thousand dollars in there if
you're talking about fifteen hundred
dollars you can go either I mean
remember Nvidia and AMD are not like
drastically different on prices at all
in fact they both trade blows in the
same price categories so for 300 bucks
you're going to find benefits to both
cards on both sides it's for 300 bucks
right now the winner is definitely the
7950 but once you step it up you know
you may find that the cheaper card like
the 39th that's 39 739 7950 is better
than the 670 for instance so you know
you just you've got to figure out what
you want to do with your card because
they and what games are going to play
because each card is but and optimized
and rendered for a different game set in
it it really like I play a lot of nvidia
powered games like Battlefield whatnot
but it's really starting to look like
the new battlefield 4 is being rendered
and optimized and encoded around the
width at the 7990 so which is good
because that means you're going to have
good cross fire support it they
that's going to be exciting and like my
phone makes that sound there AMD or
intel for laptops I prefer Intel for
laptops unless you're going with a
higher end AMD like the a-10 because the
a-10 has better integrated graphics my
new laptop which is right here actually
for work is an Intel it's an i5 it's a
pro book 6570 be this is a work computer
right here but the 4000 bid until 4000
graphics are still decent enough to do
like like you could play league of
legends on this you could play you could
play World of Warcraft on this I haven't
tried like battlefield or anything like
that I should I don't know how well it
would do but it's a iowa intel on my
work pc when I chose it simply because
the ain't my old AMD was just not
cutting it I do a lot of heavy I do a
lot of heavy programming on this on the
computers and so I was having a lot of
different programs and suites up at the
same time like sequel studio test
manager and visual visual studio and all
that stuff up at the same time which is
can definitely be intensive so that's
why I made the switch to until at least
on the graphic card ok bitspower to
blitz power to says hey Jay what's this
what's the best silent fans and air
coolers on the market using a hyper 212
at the moment you're not impressed
what's wrong with your 212 first off I
just installed one on the build on the
livestream the other day and
temperatures on that thing have been in
very very very good on an AMD a core
which is one of the hottest chips on the
market and so I think that maybe you
might have a bad installation at least
of your thermal paste might be bad 999
says HP tech support sucks they said
your dad's laptop hard drive that failed
but it got but I got to install windows
8 now again and we're getting a free one
terabyte well I don't know how much
their support would suck if they sent
you
another hard drive at least when will I
upload the intel / clacking video and
into / cloaking video please answer I
think well I the problem with that is i
don't have a z77 system right now to
overclock that's the problem with that
so if I don't have it physically in
front of me to overclock I can't do a
video on it and you would definitely
want to overclocking on a z77 or at
least the next 79 or something like that
uh legit gamers z to a legit gamer z28
says just got a new Advent Monza v100
blue laptop hmm I don't know anything
about that laptop let's see boggle kid
says his Intel for HD 4000 and I 520
3230 plays GTA for around 25 frames per
second that's really not bad for
integrated graphics pebbles bamm-bamm
says why do you prefer AMD over Intel
when did I ever say I preferred AMD over
intel it was a lot of people accuse me
of saying that there's not been a single
video I've ever said I I want AMD over
intel i happen to use AMD because it
meets all of my needs at a lower price
point so there's no problems with that
whatsoever let's see you don't think
laptops do well on FPS games it depends
if you throw enough money into your
laptop it certainly can X I p.m. and you
x 99 why is it that a driver update
until graphics are pretty damn good why
is it that with a driver update because
drivers are what drive it fit let's look
at this like a race car you can have
like the most tuned car in the world
allemand series you know full on race
car you take it to the mods and you put
it on the track with a mediocre driver a
person who's okay at driving but isn't
an an expert per se then you take them
out and you put in a seasoned veteran to
loom on
driver which is going to perform better
is it the car or is it the person
controlling the car the drivers are
controllers for your hardware you know
there it is it is logic and algorithms
and software that tells your card what
to do down to every little my new
process so if your drivers are not
optimized or they're not great that's
what you're going to get non-optimized
in non great performance so that's why
drivers which makes such a huge deal
let's see one two addicted says did you
see Linus happen to release a gaming
build video a day after you did your
build live-streamed I thought it was
ironic it went down like that I don't
think Linus has any clues to who I am so
I don't see any irony in that he also
puts out like a video a day as a tech
channel so it's very likely that that
just as coincidence let's see 1 626
number can you please explain PSU
connection pins don't have one in front
of me well you've got several different
types of pins you've got your 24 pin
plug your 24 plus pin which is the main
power pin in fact I guess that I can't
really do it this one that's the main
plug you see right here that's the
24-pin that's the main power for the
motherboard up over here which you can't
see there is the CPU dedicated power
usually it's an 8-pin and modern
motherboards and processors it could be
a 4-pin old your processor is coming off
the graphics card right here this too
thick wires that you see that's actually
my USB 3.0 the back of that is my PCI
Express they are two 6-pin connections
you can have eight pin or six pin
connections on that motherboards usually
we'll have more than one set if they're
sli capable connecting into the hard
drive which is that's my m force SSD
right there that pin on the top that is
a SATA connector it's got all your power
in it your 5 volt your 12 volt your
ground that's the say 23 connector right
there
then you've got your for pen 4-pin molex
which is like the big fat one everyone's
used to saying for like the last 20
years which connect to you know things
like fans and old optical drives and
hard drives and such those could be like
ide drives so those are the basic
connections on your power supply unit
they're pretty standard nothing special
see here Fred chip says the msi gtx 660
twin frozr two gigabyte goo by good it's
a good card it's the one we put in the
85 850 dollar bill to my channel if you
go search for that you'll see we did use
the msi 660 twin frozr on that 7950 or
660ti what do you think ooh that's a
close call um it depends again on the
games did you play if you play a lot of
let's say far cry 3 or you play a lot of
dry dirt 3 or any of the you know
Bioshock you're going to want the AMD
card if those are the style games that
you play because they those cards are
all those games were all AMD optimized
if you play games like Battlefield
crisis what else we got up there SimCity
stuff like that then you're going to
want to go with NVIDIA because those
games are all optimized for video cards
because the way it works with gamers
game developers they need technology to
code there game around so what they do
when they're building a new game or the
programming a new game is they will
reach out to the video card
manufacturers and by manufacturer i
don't mean msi and EVGA i mean nvidia or
AMD the actual PCB developers the
reference designers and they will say
hey we're building we're designing this
new game and we need we need video card
to optimize against and so what they'll
do is they'll take the card and then
they will optimize stores
card the developers just like gamers
have a preference they have they have a
bias we technology fans and addicts we
all have a bias whether you want to say
it or not people say I'm more biased
towards a and D and right now that may
be slightly true simply because of the
upgrade path that I'm in and the money
that's already into the system but I can
tell you for the future of my channel
and gaming I am going to be going into
after the new stuff comes out so
developers will have a bias towards a
particular manufacturer they like so if
they like Nvidia they'll reach out to
Nvidia and video will say sure we'll
we'll provide you all of the devices
that you need and all of the engineering
samples that you need to encode towards
optimized performance on our graphics
card and what you need to do in the
beginning of your game is you need to
put that you know in video logo that
says you know and it's like says the way
it's meant to be played because they'll
get an advertisement every time the game
is loaded now that doesn't mean it won't
work on the other graphics cards it just
means you'll get situation like i do
where my gtx 680 plays in bioshock
infinite just fine it'll play a tomb
raider just fine because tomb raider I
believes another AMD optimized game
however just like physics on AMD is not
as powerful or as mopped optimized as
physics on video when it comes to
battlefield or deducted a totally drew a
blank here oh my god oh yeah Borderlands
2 AMD does have some of the best hair
rendering optimization and hair just
like it comes to animated movies or any
of that it's like the hardest thing to
animate and make it look realistic but
AMD is is far ahead on the hair
animation but and only AMD cards are
going to get you that sort of animation
and tomb raider apparently is really big
on that really pushing that aspect of
their cards so when i play tomb raider
i'm not going to get any of that because
of the card that i'm using so more so
than frames per second it there's more
to it when it comes to choose
a graphics card nvidia just acknowledged
the other day actually that yeah they
are falling behind in the frames per
second race and in technology that
they've developed almost two years ago
because remember by the time a graphics
card is released they've been working on
it for well over a year or two so this
680 has been out since March of 2012 and
it was being in the process of being
designed at about 18 months prior to
that so we're just gonna have to wait
and see what happens in the frames per
second race when the new generations
come out and everything may change again
AMD may pull ahead and stay there now
nvidia is always boasting that they've
got better frame latency and i'll be
honest with you i'm not an expert on the
difference between frames per second
frame latency they seem to think frame
latency is better it just could be an
answer for them to try and sound like
well we've got something better than AMD
even though AMD is beating them overall
on frames per second performance so
razor's edge tablet thoughts go back to
the January section of my channel and
you'll see that there was a little
review while at CES of the razor's edge
extremely overpriced and I think the
comments say it all the boob unto said
my online buddy just did a video on how
to get more FPS from your games when
played on laptops has to do with power
setting with a control panel yeah it's
that's been knowledge for about a decade
where if you leave it on balance your
processor doesn't get as much
performance out of it it doesn't get as
much power allocated to it so it'll draw
back the core clock and you don't get as
great a performance so you would want to
go into your power options you would
want to go to performance setting you'd
want to go to custom profile and you
would want to turn on there to never
turn off hard drives never throttle the
CPU never dim the display or any of that
stuff when plugged in but if you leave
it like that on battery then you'll kill
your
30 minutes what headset headphone when I
recommend for gaming whatever's
comfortable for you like these and I'm
wearing right here I would I would never
wear long term for gaming in fact I wore
these when I did my three live streams
of Bioshock from beginning to end and we
were talking like four hours at a time
and my ears were killing me because
these are not very comfortable
headphones at all they're these are like
50 bucks they're they're designed
they're plugged in right here as you can
see they're designed for me to be able
to hear myself in my mic that way I'm
not screaming and I can still have
anything going on with the system and
you guys won't hear those sounds but the
rubber on these is is not soft at all
it's very and you can kind of just see
by looking at that it's really stiff and
I would recommend going to the store and
just kind of checking out the different
headphones and seeing what feels like
it's going to be comfortable for you and
go with that some are really heavy I
don't like a heavy headphone these are
very light mic quality if you're doing
it for like Xbox doesn't matter anyway
are all the mic sound like over the
MS live anyway on the xbox so same
answer goes for the Papa do one when he
asked what Mouse to i recommend for
gaming I do have a review of this mouse
going up next week excuse me I'm
fighting a cold here this is the
logitech g700s it is a wireless gaming
mouse and I've always thought that that
was sort of an oxymoron I'm like
wireless gaming how can you call it a
gaming mouse when Wireless mice have
latency and delay on movement and
register and clicks and versus the
screen but the technology on this mouse
is pretty good I notice absolutely no
lag or just or delay whatsoever when
moving the mouse same thing when I click
and same thing when if the mouse has
been sitting still you know how mice
will automatically turn themselves off
so then to get them to move you've got a
wiggle them and then you know it takes
them a few minutes to register or a few
seconds to register that sometimes this
one doesn't do that you can come in the
very next day wiggle the mouse and it's
as if it never turned
off this particular Mouse happens to be
rechargeable has a rechargeable battery
in it and on the front right here you
can see that there is you know microUSB
slot and it's kind of shaped here it
does come with its own cable that plugs
in here so it's like flush so you can't
plug this in and use it as a wired and
play with it while it's charging if i
push this button right here you can see
i only have one green light of three
green lights on battery charge I just
charges two days ago this battery this
mouse only lasts about three days on a
charge so it's not that big of a deal
because you can plug it in and two
rechargeable it's just annoying because
it just seems to die out on me a lot
faster than any other wireless mouse
I've ever had but then again it really
has only the equivalent of one double a
battery as you can see right there
another some of the game you might have
to but so that's one thing just to keep
in mind and this is just a standard
sanyo rechargeable battery i think if i
put in one of my Duracell rechargeables
it might get better not entirely sure
we'll just have to wait and see you gone
mad bub one says why did you what cookie
board did it upgrade to and why the MX
Reds I'm not going to answer your
question the reason for that is upon the
completion of this live stream I'm going
to be making a video public that I have
already recorded edited and uploaded
about the keyboard that I chose which
happens to be the Corsair x70 and why I
chose that why I like it and so you're
just going to go and check out the video
if you want that question answer in fact
you'll get a better answer in that video
then you will then in this live stream
astro a40 s thoughts expensive I think
without the the mixer and controller
it's what two hundred and fifty dollars
if you want that you're pushing over
three hundred dollars they are very
expensive headphones
but if you're an extreme gamer then I
guess it would be worth it because you
know it gets to the point to where
you're wearing them all the time you
want the comfort they're extremely
comfortable I got to wear a set over at
the 24 hour livestream and they are
extremely comfortable but they're not
rubber around the ears they're like a
like a cloth fabric with the memory foam
in there so they're very very
comfortable um let's see here it's go
back a little bit and I know I missed a
bunch legit gamers says Adam orth got
fired Adam Worf fanboys do it Adam worth
technically resigned and he did that
weeks ago but yeah it's as well going to
provide a significant performance boost
in gaming over Sandy Bridge I 525
interkaye Sandy Bridge to ivy bridge was
about a ten percent improvement leaked
specs right now in leaked benchmarks on
the current ivybridge versus ivy
bridge-e or Haswell is showing only a
five percent improvement so a lot of
people right now are kind of upset that
it looks like only five percent you know
in the new generation processor she
doesn't really make much sense to a lot
of people so you're looking at about a
fifteen to twenty percent improvement
over a sandy bridge and the reasonable
math fun for you here the reason why you
can't just say oh five percent plus ten
percent is fifteen percent well you're
talking to five percent improvement on
top of a ten percent improvement so
compounds so you've got ten percent
improvement over 100 let's say which is
110 percent then you've got five percent
of 110 is more than five percent of 100
bega Oh math for you okay um the Jay why
does my computer give me memory after a
big download papa do that was make any
sense why does my computer give me
memory after a big download I don't know
what that means I'm sorry what is my
opinion on the new razor atra address
I don't even know what it is I don't
follow razor products i don't like razor
products i don't own an ADA razor
product anymore in fact i sold my
blackwidow ultimate keyboard yesterday
what about the FX radeon HD 7970 bundle
d and as FX x sx effects a brand oh and
the brand in general XFX has been around
for a long long time they are considered
like a luxury brand they tend to put
nicer coolers on their graphics cards
they're more aesthetically pleasing
their warranties are fairly decent I've
never heard of anyone that I know if
personally have any bad experiences with
XFX I almost bought an XFX myself but I
ended up not they believe only do AMD
now they used to do in video as well but
i believe they only do AMD now Eric I
don't want to ruin your last name said
where do you learn all of your
technology and what's a good resource to
learn more I go to a lot of different
forums but you need to be careful with
forms because you're dealing with
opinions and interpretations they're
just like you never want to take you
know Wikipedia as fact I a lot of what
I've learned it honestly is completely
hands-on you know if you don't you go to
school to learn a particular piece of
technology like you'll learn about
computer programming or computer
building or networking or admin security
network security and that stuff but to
become like just overall just general
and compensate when it comes to
knowledge is you've got to be like me
you've got to be a little sad loser who
sits on this computer whether it be at
work at home or on this phone or on this
tablet just constantly researching this
stuff because that's what you just do
that's what you like it's no different
than you know diehard gamers are
constantly checking out you know you
remember that those old game and former
magazines I don't know if they're still
around but constantly reading Game
Informer magazine constantly checking
out sites like you source gaming going
to the you know forums for the game
designers and and going to the Xbox you
know for
it's no different than that you just you
learn by just constantly either doing or
reading about it or something XPW and
new x 9 99 a 99 says looking to upgrade
my 7750 what is a good card for under
300 well get I'll tell you a good card
for under 300 would be the 7870
gigahertz edition I believe you might be
a look at the XT for that price very
solid performer I really really really
like the 7870 it's right into that two
hundred and fifty dollar price range I
don't think there's a whole lot out
there that can touch it now you're going
to have a hard time playing a lot of the
modern games you know max anti-aliasing
settings and the they don't have the
nvidia technology like Kepler does with
the the adaptive vsync or the the FXAA
which is a whole different faster more
efficient rendering style of
anti-aliasing so you're not gonna play
games like you know crysis 3 or any of
that at 1080p ultra settings with 82
aliasing on but I think you kind of have
to know that when you buy a card like
that you're not going to initially have
those ideas in mind anyway Viking girl
says good morning Jay will you be making
video of laptop dust removal and thermal
paste replacement yes I will that will
likely be the next upload I do away from
anything that might go up this weekend
while I'm in Vegas just kind of like
personal vlog stuff I mean that's going
to go in the vlog channel and if I
something cool comes up I might put it
up on the tech channel but yes the
laptop I'm going to be using is right
over there actually and I might even be
doing my friends gaming laptop that gets
up to like 107 degrees Celsius right now
it's insane so yeah look for that soon
early maybe to mid next week yeah skepta
calm 818 Jay will you do a GPU overclock
my game keeps crashing when I try to
over
um I already have a video on GPU
overclocking and EA hey Jay what are
your favorite case fans my favorites are
cougar case fans you like them old women
do you I'm just kidding i am a major fan
of the corsair AF there so if you look
in my case right here these two fans on
the bottom right here these are Swift
tex with what they call these helix
these are the helix fans I don't like
them because when they're oriented
horizontally like that or the corazon
and I haven't been drinking yes where
this is water not tequila when their
horizontal like this whether they're
facing up or down let's see if you can
hear if you will d you'll be able to
hear a little bit of a buzz if I turn
this mic up listen oh yeah that was my
phone maybe it's not picking up too good
the these fans right here make a buzz
when they're in this position like a
beanie it's very faint and it really
annoys me but when I turn them up my
turn up the fans it's very apparent when
you when you install them I'm just do
this good all right there when you
install them like this up and down then
these fans don't make any noise I just
haven't replaced these two fans yet
because each one of these fans these
fans this van these three fans and these
two fans are all different and why are
they different because I have to balance
the airflow in this system I've got
these two fans right here with your
bring an air in and I can feel a lot of
air coming in these are the AF 140s
these are the quiet edition so at max
speeds they move a really good amount of
air but they're not very loud I've
already gone over the helix here I use
these on radiators or did and you waked
at high static pressure the one back
here is a an AF 140 also which is 140
millimeters fan however it is
a performance edition not a speed a
quiet edition but i haveth have it
controlled the three fans I have in the
top here are 120 megahert fan or 120
millimeter fans but these are the SP
performance hi static pressure fans for
this upper radiator because I'm going to
be switching this radiator out this is a
20 fin per inch radiator and what that
means is a square inch of a square inch
of this radiator has 20 thins in it it's
really good for cooling but its noise
why's it it's more fins for the air to
hit which makes more noise so these guys
right now we're only running at fifty
percent because these are 20 250 rpm
fans very very noisy in fact I will turn
them all the way up for you right now
because i use all software control for
my fans turn the mic up slightly and
listen to how loud these top fans are
right here so right now they're only a
50-percent this is 60 this is 70 80 90
100 they're pretty loud if i were to put
a piece of paper on top it with like fly
off the top of the case so and then if i
put them back to automatic speed control
they get nice and quiet so there you go
i really like the corsair fans if that
doesn't answer your question
unfortunately they are kind of pricey
each one of the one hundred and forty
millimeter fans are about eighteen to
twenty dollars u.s. u.s. dollars and
then it's about a dollar cheaper for
them maybe 20 is cheaper for the 120s
and i got to get two more for down here
and they're going to the fans i'm going
to be getting for the bottom down here
are going to be different than the ones
on the top when it comes to the profile
these are like I said they're the sp1
20s that
formance edition I'll be getting the
quiet editions for down here because on
radiators you're pushing air through
resistance so you need static pressure
which means it's the amount of pressure
of it the air can push through or an
object it can move and so I what you
need those on radiators you can get away
with the less fins like on the on the I
stuck my finger there on the rear and
stuff you can get away with there's less
restriction there so it's not that big
of a deal hey Jay what cases that by mop
head this is the NZXT NZXT switch 810
it's partially plastic partially steel
like all of the trim is plastic the case
itself as a steel construction I do like
his everything is is filtered on it like
this filter here I just pulled out this
goes right here under the radiator so
the radiator isn't pulling in all kinds
of dirt into it the rear for the power
supply unit here is a another filter
right there so you can see see that it
pops out the front here used to have as
you can see i modify this this used to
be a solid piece of plastic right here
where these two pieces go together and
the back right here used to have a
screen the problem was I had these two
giant one hundred and forty millimeter
fans had to pull an air only through the
side right here and I could take the
front off and I could put my hand you
know right here and I could feel a ton
of air coming through the front and then
if I stuck if I put the front back on
and clicked it on all the air would stop
like no air was moving whatsoever so I
made those modifications I start to put
a grill in the front i'm going to be
doing a whole lot of case mods to this
because i have been in contact with a
couple of different companies about
sponsorship for this computer and looks
like I've got some companies that are
going to be sending me product in order
to sponsor another ultimate computer
water cooling belt so you're going to
see all this change probably pretty
drastically
let's see here see sgw clan oh I saw
your text earlier about your grandmother
dying sorry about that man that's not
snow bueno all of my grandparents have
have died already so I know how that
feels but anyway CSG w client says hey
Jay I have a 660 300 just standard air
cooler that comes with the processor in
a 7700 ases addition two gigabyte and
only one more fan in my case and only
one more fan in my case you get the max
degrees it goes up to is about 55 that's
a really good temperature actually AMD
at 55 is really good like right now
while I'm rendering this with this whole
water cooling system i'm at 43 and
that's not even not even a max load if i
was to turn on senate bench or something
it would get up in two 55s with all of
this water cool let's see yes finally I
got you got a live stream gay but
unfortunately for you it's going to end
in a few minutes because i'm going to
lost wages there's 70 of you in here i'm
going to go ahead sensor 77 d of you in
here right now i'm gonna go ahead and
say it again upon the completion of this
live stream i'm going to be clicking
public on a video that I've already
uploaded and it's all about this corsair
gaming k70 mechanical keyboard and why I
chose it a review of it and most of the
mostly the reason why I chose this is
because it is so much quieter than the
clicking MX blues the cherry MX blue
switches that are in the other
mechanical keyboard mop head said thanks
got a close-up on Amazon think I need to
get one now it's a nice case but there's
new stuff coming out this case has been
out for a few years so there's new stuff
coming up from NZXT that you may want to
even wait for not enough epic j what do
you think about the i5 3333 30s and what
a 7850 being appropriate GPU for it um I
don't know much about the 33 30s I've
never really looked below any of the
lower end 3400 stuff or the 3500 stuff
so I don't know anything about the 3330
see one chooses will you sell me some of
your old parts when you get new
sponsored stuff uh no idea what I'm
going to do with any of this yet I don't
know exactly what's coming if any of its
going to be reused I know I'm going to
be reusing the reservoir because I I
really like this bit power its power
although it's a little bit bigger than I
had hoped it would be if it had stopped
right about where the water level is I
would be happy because this takes up an
awful lot of room but we'll see no
please not yet no guys I'm you tell me
if I'd rather be sitting here talking on
a webcam or driving my ass to Las Vegas
if you guys well if you guys want to
hang out more it's going to be over on
the tech channel but miss Jay and I are
going to be doing just a little live
streams kind of a hangout over on the
not the tech channel the vlog channel
you guys I know the vlog channel is the
link to it is right down there in the
description you can click link click
click link jave brain is dying mmm
that's kind of how I feel right now it
was the end of a work week leading up to
a vacation and if you're a working man
or woman and you know Matthews Matthew
Sean heart wants to know what caught
water cooling kit I have that's not a
kid that's a custom-built loop so
there's no kit there have fun in Las
Vegas I deserve it you're damn right I
deserve it and I deserve to win too I'm
not gonna play any games I never games I
never did the games I play roulette the
problems roulette is I go to the 5
dollar minimum tables but I don't bet
five bucks I'll bit like 20 or 25 on a
bed and usually I come back with at
least the same amount of money i played
with I've won a lot of times then
there's times where I'll in a couple of
minutes lose a couple hundred bucks and
it sucks there was all sad and like I'm
gonna tell the wife one more bet I feel
it one more bit she's like no you're
done you're nothing but a little more
bet there you'd be lit it's the next one
it's gonna be it's gonna be 24 right I
can feel like it's go gene and she
doesn't let me do it presents ok that's
ok for the better Vegas for business
absolutely not Vegas one hundred percent
for pleasure Jay what do I think of best
buy um I bought my TV there
they're big store their customer service
really sucks hope you never have to call
them because they're not going to answer
if you have to go return anything it
takes an hour they have a lot to CDs but
who looks at CDs anymore I would never
buy a computer there i bought my monitor
there um i bought my surround sound of
the living room there idea if you want
something audio video AV then i would
say best buy but computer parts how god
no they have the worst selection and
they're extremely overpriced their
computers if you just want some cheap
off the wall like laptop that's fine i
would bit and then all they do all they
sell there now are like HP and dell and
they don't they sell garbage i don't
like best buy for computers at all no
way did the stream end no I'm right here
where are you a demon demon LP should I
put a 360 red in your $30 case to cool
my hard drives and for the for the lulz
no I don't think so okay I'm gonna do I
got four more minutes on this stream I'm
ending it 10 minutes early I'm losing my
voice and I don't want to lose it before
i get to vegas microcenter all day long
yeah but socal guy you got a member but
we're lucky to live near microcenter
much of the country and every 67 people
i'm willing to bet that the majority of
them are not even in the United States
so we're just really fortunate one more
bet Jays two cents autobiography my
famous last words I can beat this train
yeah that's that's the life I live hey
Jay will you please start stroking your
microphone it may sound weird but please
yes it's it's metal okay there that's
all you're getting I'm scratching it I'm
not stroking it tips on cooling a laptop
don't put it on your lap first of all
get yourself one of those cooling pads
to put it on that's about all you can do
England America prices are so cheap I
know aren't they you know I feel really
bad for is Australia wow I look somewhat
close to tigerdirect that's it okay not
enough epic says should i sell my 30 i
535 30s or 33 30s and save up for a tie
seven yeah if you want more performance
sure but an i3 is more than capable for
gaming too so a bunt you said used to
have a compusa but now we don't really
have any computer store compusa i
remember those guys again we're
overpriced and look where that got them
today like Circuit City look where that
got them today yeah all right um crazy
so po5 do i need a 6-core for gaming and
rendering videos if so can you suggest
one please I'm thinking of getting an
AMD x4 to phenom phenom what 965 975 985
1055 1090 1100 t there's a lot of
different v noms out there of course you
can you can render with ubuntu use old
dual-core if you want but it's just a
matter of how long it's going to take
you don't need six scores for gaming
absolutely not and you don't need six
for six cores for rendering it just
helps to have more cores more people
doing the work basically ah you live in
serbia and the prices are huge yeah it
the United States has the best prices
when it comes to computers I'm telling
you Mississippi here have fun on the
trip man thanks guys really looking
forward to that x-pro devices don't
worry guys I'm here now unfortunately
for you x prada phi i'm ending the
stream in one minute cuz gotta pack up
the car and get the hell out of town the
wife is at the gym right now and then
once she gets home and cleans up it's
time to go
go to Aria in all of a sudden its
content gone I was starting to read your
okay go to Aria if you want good price
on pc parts if you live in the UK well
there you go see we got to rely on you
guys helping each other out in different
parts of the world x-pro defy you are 50
minutes late my friend not enough epic
says I'm buying a gaming editing build
on a budget for friend what do you think
about the phenom 2 x 60 1045 tea and a
7750 7750 is the bottom end graphics
card that I would ever recommend like
bottom bottom bottom so you just need to
know right off the bat you're not going
to hook that up and see amazing frame
rates you're really not second of all
the T the 1045 T is the lowest six-core
I would almost recommend you getting a
4300 quad-core FX over the 1045 now if
you said you're going to be getting a
1090 or an 1100 that'd be a different
story but if it's an extreme budget then
you're probably fine I just the 1045 has
never been an amazing and amazing
performer let's see do I play black ops
no i don't i hate call of duty ecology
some can just eat it ok uba says by j
have fun see a dude please don't bet the
pc i would never bet the pc and have fun
