on Thursday November 28 I think yeah
November 28th and that is Thanksgiving
here in the United States and it may be
other places in the world I honestly
don't know so if you celebrate this
holiday happy thanksgiving to you and if
you don't happy thursday and i hope you
guys are having a great day with
whatever it is that you're doing it
would be extremely wrong of me it's not
to get on here and tell you guys what
I'm thankful for today one of the many
things that I'm thankful for I'm
definitely thankful for my health and if
you follow me long enough you know that
I've had a lot of health problems in the
past with my weight 500 pounds and lost
you know over 200 pounds and have got a
longer life ahead of me because of that
and thank you for my family my wife my
daughter my parents had some family over
today for Thanksgiving dinner and it was
great I'm thankful for the fact that I
have a pretty comfortable life and you
know there was a lot of people in the
world who were having a lot of hard
times and I definitely wish you guys all
the best if you're one of those people
who are struggling but I'm thankful for
what I have and I am beyond thankful for
you guys because 2013 is shaping up to
be the best year I've ever had my entire
life and that's because of you guys
because all of this is you see all of
this that I have it's honestly because
of you if you guys weren't watching you
guys weren't supporting this channel
would be nothing and so I'm never going
to forget that I'm always going to be
thankful for your guys's views and your
guys's support some of you guys have
just been above and beyond with the
level of support that you provide for me
and I'm going to do the best I can to
continue to provide you guys the best
content that i can create i'm going to
stay nice and humbled and grounded
wherever this goes and if this was to
end tomorrow if this was just some fluke
and all my growth stopped and you guys
all left tomorrow i would still be
thankful for everything that I've gotten
to experience over the last year and a
couple of months here on YouTube and I
love each and every one of you I I know
it's a little bit mushy but I don't even
know how else to express it this channel
would be absolutely nothing if it wasn't
for you guys I could be putting up
content no one be watching nothing would
happen
and then it would just be a lonely you
know cobweb written channel but I it's
not because of you guys I'm greatly
thankful for that and I would it would
be wrong if I didn't go down here and
tell you guys so I'm gonna get out of
here spend some time with some family
and maybe do some shoppin tonight and I
just want you guys to know that I'm
extremely thankful for that and because
of that am i doing another giveaway here
in December and it's going to be open to
the entire world because I am thankful
to each and every one of you guys
regardless of where you live and you
guys all have an equal chance to win
something here because giving back to
you guys is just one of the things my
channel is all about so once again happy
Thanksgiving guys if you celebrate the
holiday if you don't happy whatever
today is for you and I'm gonna get out
of here and I'll see you guys in my next
video which would probably be tomorrow
