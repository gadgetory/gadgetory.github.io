work blah hey you do shitty blogs no one
wants to watch what's up guys days two
cents here we're working in the studio
this place is a disaster look actually
not that bad
we have been since yesterday working on
a new set you can kind of see it getting
worked on over here um yeah so we spent
yesterday like I'm asked off
sorry I'm turning so much I'm sure I'm
making you guys all super dizzy so I
masked off this nice big square to make
a nice gray wall black desk we're gonna
have it all nice to meet guys my I saw a
picture on Twitter but I walked in this
morning and I went what I do Nick I went
I don't like that color I'm like - I'll
make it darker yeah well here's the
problem is it's satin and as you can see
like from an angle here there's some
shimmer to it but the problem is like
even though I had multiple coats on
there you can see it right here like
it's blotchy because because it's satin
so we're going to redo it a little bit
darker even because I've got these
big-ass skylights up here which you're
making this look lighter than I want it
to be so we're going to go dark we're
going like really dark not black but
close to black like probably more like
the colour of the curtains here as you
can see it's a little bit darker right
because it's a little bit darker than
the actual grey that's on there but the
other idea too though is I need to buy
woodworking tools for this I need to buy
at least a miter saws I don't have one
if we're going to then take like chair
rail and molding we're going to mold out
this square so it looks like like a
partition space if there's something I
would have done it like this was like my
home they just layer on top I'm serious
yeah we're thing about doing that too
we're thinking about because you can see
we got this kind of an ugly green
concrete floor we're thinking about
doing like a just a hardwood floor right
here where this is yeah just just to
kind of make this an official set area
the only problem is like I kind of like
the idea of carpet though more carpet we
have in here the less echo will have the
echoes getting better though I'm sure
you guys can tell like it's getting a
heck of a lot better we also have these
rugs right here that we bought they're
going to be replacing the curtains the
curtains worked well the curtains to me
were kind of like a proof of concept
like how it's going to work but it's
working but I just want something that
looks a little bit cleaner
and I think that the rugs on the wall
are going to do that plus the rugs have
more dampening vibration or reverb
damping huh yeah we look like idiots
we're going to Ikea we would go I wonder
if this will work oh no it's like whoa
that sounds so much better we look we
looked really ridiculous because we were
testing out all the different curtains
and IKEA doing that we kept putting our
face like in the rugs - we took the rug
and we like put them over our heads we
were like how does its ass people were
walking by like we've also got this guy
right here is our AV shelf where the
cameras once on the truck bounces so we
got our little AV shelf you've been
doing our lenses and and all our little
knick-knack E's and doodads and things
that we use to bring in these crappy
videos so the sardine run and gun rig we
already had the a7 but this is it here
with the I can tilt ax on there
Linus recommended it he uses it so of
course I went and got it had to be
copycat
but check this out we also got this
battery I got off Amazon bet and I need
to unplug it because we really plugged
in until during the battery so it will
power the usb on this camera and as long
as there's a battery in it it will run
off this battery which is 5,000
milliamps which is worth about five of
the batteries in here so we could go
like literally all day on this setup we
did we did and we have a second battery
too so we cannot swap these and keep
going it's amazing okay enough chatting
now we got to go to Lowe's and get more
paint whoa the car is screaming in agony
like that if you guys haven't noticed
we're not in NICs normal offer at my
sunglasses this is going to suck okay
we're not Nick's normal GTI
we're in what we call the G width
Gramma's with your him as whip this is
what years is like a 94 94 oh my god
nailed it at the 94 Geo Prizm so I'm
kind of thinking this site this top one
right here which is called No Limits we
currently have web gray which is this
one right here something and that's
gonna be just dark enough I hope another
$126 into this set we're not debating
sorry decorating it yet
oh boy this is like we're close to a
thousand dollars into putting together
this I hope you guys understand we do
this because we want to up the quality
for you like we genuinely care about the
viewer experience because you know I
could have just stayed in my bedroom
like in the upstairs bedroom but I think
I think it's important though for people
to realize too that it's the same reason
why we buy cameras that are overkill for
YouTube it's the same reason why we buy
audio equipment that's over-the-top and
why we spend thousands and thousands of
dollars a month for a studio and all of
that it's because we like what we do
we enjoy this we and we get we get
something out of having the nice
equipment and taking this to the next
level because it's more to us than just
going I'm gonna put up a piece of
content and count the money as it comes
in it's about reinvesting into the
viewer experience and that means as much
to like me I know about this guy kind of
masochist he's kind of new cuz it's like
yeah it's like I get I get pleasure out
of your pleasure this is a BDSM viewers
probably at that but no I'm serious I I
get something out of you know playing
around with the sets I've always wanted
a studio and now here I got one it's I'd
like a bigger one already but I'd like a
bigger one in many ways you know one
time we gun day two shades of grey on
that wall right we got to go through all
50 we just make it look a test pattern
pretty done yet oh where did he go can
you guys see Jay
I don't see Jay where is he behind me
this is too soon again to attack kid
show yeah I like your technique here
well I have to go above the paint line
all right are we also that he also
bought a black covers well lat and like
stainless steel because I'm not sure
which one I'm going to like more we get
a it here
the most ready second almost some myself
to do the baseboards well y'all hate to
give the tape wait listen we have a
second roll yeah I knew that I'd be okay
we got some fans blowing on the wall the
first code is up and you can see it's
much closer match to those curtains
actually wow I take almost an exact
match to the curtain yeah we should get
one of those curtain rods that have like
a bend in it like it's meant to go in
the corners so way the curtain can come
all the way over here we didn't bring it
into the kitchen right here because I've
been a really weird partition but I
think if we did that then we get a good
separation there they make what happens
is like it comes and then it makes like
a like another 8 inches as a curve so
it's meant to be like a corner curtain
rod so we can get get one for that side
and we can pull the curtains around the
corner right there and had the kitchen
completely blocked off yeah it's coming
together
another little sneak peek for you guys
here was actually gonna shoot this video
today but I decided to redo that wall I
came in this morning I was like nope
we're redoing that wall could Nick got
to the studio before me
and when you guys have been asking about
this the new fluid gaming each a water
kits I've got both of them here well two
of them the 120 at 240 and a 240 G I'll
be taking a look at two of them but I'm
going to I think I'm just going to do
the 240g
with the GPU in the loop but there's
been a lot of discussion about this kit
and people freaking out about it because
it's a well it's made out of aluminum
but there's it's not a bad thing it's
done right and that's what we're going
to talk about in that video so you guys
can look for that early next week I got
something outside it's kind of wanted to
say to you guys to is I started to talk
about a little bit earlier the reason
why we buy the nice equipment and it's
because when it comes our job it's
making videos if we can make our life a
little bit easier but also up the
quality the content quality and that's
important to me because you guys may
label me as a jerk or Jay's a dickhole
or whatever but I care genuinely about
like the viewer experience here I care
that about the what people feel when
they come to this channel I care about
how it looks this is my career now this
is everything you guys see is just like
thoughts put into video and I care about
the way it looks every little thing
that's wrong bugs the hell out of me too
so it's just important you guys realize
and I know every content creator that
I'm friends with feels exactly the same
way that they care it's our job right we
have to care but if we didn't truly have
a passion for this why would we do it
I'm telling you right now I left I left
a very stable and comfortable career in
IT to do this and you know it's it's
almost like subjecting yourself to a lot
of abuse and hate because building your
your life online is a terrible model and
I can tell you this right now though the
the support that we get definitely
outweighs the level of hey that's why we
keep doing it and that's not going to
change and so when I see people make
comments of like why do you need that
camera or why do you need that tripod or
why do you need that slider that's just
a waste of money it's not a waste of
money to us and so I think perspective
is everything I know try and think about
it from our perspective for once like
this like the fs5 right there right no
one needs an fs5 to make youtube videos
nobody needs it but you guys definitely
noticed an increase in quality the
moment I bought that camera a lot of you
guys were like holy crap and here's the
I understand compared to guys like
Austin Evans and Linus tech tips and
Jonathan Morrison and and Marquez the
mkbhd this is chump change studio
compared to like what those guys are
putting into their videos I mean there's
always pros and cons to that I'm at the
end of the day I could have way more
money in the big confident buy this
stuff just trust me I know I don't need
this but I feel better doing it how
about you
well that's learn but I like using it
yeah I think you're starting to feel
comfortable VFS eyes when you when I
first bought that you were like oh my
god there's so many buttons and things
q my farts like she break it well it's a
risk anyone takes when you start
handling this stuff every day
you know it's here's a new sledge there
is going to be a day that camera is
going to break there's a difference
between it breaking due to wear and tear
and it breaking due to negligence
let's just hope negligence is involved
and when something here break I mean I
did drill through a mother motherboard
after all you know there's that I
legitimately thought I was doing a cool
mod but seriously what are you on the
letter somewhere different to be for a
little bit so we're different it's like
this kind of man
yeah drying now it's so much darker it
looks so much better the camera can't
even focus on it because it can't tell
where anything is yeah this is coming
together nicely we put two coats on it
and yeah we're extremely happy with the
way that that turned out something else
- I need your guys's help with something
especially if you're in the Southern
California area here is the biggest
problem with my studio he's right as
skylights mocking me when you're
creating video and do you see how cool
and blue this shot looks that's because
of those lights up there and when you're
trying to shoot video you want to
control the light especially as you're
trying to create better b-roll like this
is going to be mostly a b-roll set over
here I need to block those windows out
now yes we can do window film or
something
vinyl tint or rap to try and block out
the light
I want to block out 100% of the light I
got approval from the property
management that I can block out the
windows yes that's awesome
but that's like 22 feet up and it's not
exactly like very easy to get a ladder
up there and an extension ladder doesn't
even really have anything to mean
against and then it's at like an angle
like that so as you can see it's not
flat up and down let me show you we look
straight up you can see they're at an
angle right oh yeah I need help i need
to someone to either if you're if you're
a contractor or something and you can do
this get me up because I need these
windows block out I don't know how to do
it needs to be done from the inside not
the outside they won't let me do
anything to the outside of the windows
and I don't even know how well you could
get a scissor lift up here because I
don't even know if I'd trust the
elevator to try and get like a mini
scissor lift in
that's like 25 see the top of the
windows is probably closer to 25 almost
30 feet high it's really really dull I
mean look at the height of the ceiling
in here it's really high you'd be my
best friend forever if somebody can help
me figure out how to block out those
windows up there and I also have it up
there but that's less important than up
here
who said you were ever best friend well
this is drying right now we're going to
go to Hobby Lobby and look for some
decorative beanies I'm not good at the
decorative stuff
taking the paint third coat just for
good measure still a little bit of
blotchy in there it's cut part of it
still wet I think it turned out good
here's a good example of why we did the
the dark gray because white like white
walls they just bounce the light and
don't soak up any of the color but as
you can see with this right the gray
look at that the gray just eats up the
color so we have a lot of control over
it which is which is nice so anyway
we'll put the Syst again we'll let that
dry we'll put the set together and then
I'll show you it looks like it will end
the vlog I got to get ready for podcast
tonight I'm showing up on someone's
podcast by the time this goes light a
little already happened yeah I make an
appearance in a in a very popular series
on someone else's channel you might know
him very well maybe he's not that big
image little channel alright so Nick has
gone home and we are from it's done for
the day so here's the set right here
you can see we got our bounce board I'm
setting up a system right here exactly
I'm doing a live stream right here by
the time you see this probably figured
it out already I'm Blanchot with Linus I
was doing land show but there's our
living room set you guys are used to and
now you can see we have this new set
over there
of course RGB lighting we could change
it all up really cool stuff just trying
to bring you guys better videos like I
said so that's it I'm going to go now
thanks for all of your continued support
and I'm going to do the best I can to
bring you the best content that my
little mind possibly can thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
