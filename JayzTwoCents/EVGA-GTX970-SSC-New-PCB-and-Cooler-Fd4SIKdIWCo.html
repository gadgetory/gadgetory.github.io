here and I hope that you guys have had a
great holiday season and I hope that you
guys have gotten all of the PC hardware
goodness that maybe you were hoping
Santa would leave under the tree but if
he didn't or maybe you were on the
naughty list don't worry I have a huge
announcement coming up in the near
future so you don't want to miss that
make sure you stay tuned but today we're
gonna be talking about EVGA is brand-new
gtx 970 SSC that stands for super super
klux for when one super Geist isn't
super enough with the new Silencio
performance optimized fans to
Coolermaster Neptune 240m delivers the
perfect balance of noise and performance
click the link in the description to
find out more now the general public
might find this particular product to be
a little bit confusing because really on
the surface it looks exactly like the
GTX 970 SC which EVGA already has and
launched back in September so it really
might leave someone wondering what's the
extra s4 well guys there's actually
quite a few changes that have been put
into this graphics card on EVGA Spartan
some of it is due to direct feedback
from the general public consumers and
review forms now the specs on the GTX
970 SSC is eleven hundred and ninety
megahertz base clock a thirteen hundred
and forty two megahertz boost clock and
it has six phase power delivery so
that's what already makes this a little
bit different over the standard SC it
also has an additional 33% power limit
over the reference design which means
you can get higher voltage for your core
you can also get higher fan speeds
without hitting that power limit which
means you can get better overclock sand
better temperatures but this one also
features a dual BIOS which now really
the only difference between the dual
BIOS on this card is one has that
factory default where the fans won't
start turning until sixty degrees
Celsius which means the oven completely
silent GPU when you're an idle or doing
2d things that don't get very hot on the
GPU and the other BIOS on this actually
has a
different power or fan curve so really
there's no difference when it comes to
power delivery like the GTX 980 classify
it actually has different voltage limits
and ln2 mode but this does gives you
give you the ability to flash a custom
BIOS to this without fear of breaking
your card if you want to be a little bit
you know on the wild side or maybe a
little bit dangerous but you can't
actually brick this thing with the dual
BIOS so that's really nice
but this thing also features a
completely redesigned internals of the
cooler now you guys may or may not know
when this card originally launched there
was a little bit of a controversy where
some of the heat pipe or the third heat
pipe didn't actually touch the heat
spreader of the GPU therefore making a
pipe that really kind of wasn't doing a
whole lot and EVGA said this wasn't
really an issue but reddit and other
forums said yeah this is a pretty big
issue especially when you're dealing
with other cards that are getting much
cooler temperatures so EVGA basically
went back to the drawing board they
redesigned the cooler and they also put
on here a heat dissipation plate that
goes on the MOSFETs as well as the RAM
or the G Ram on here or the vram G Ram
whatever B Ram on this card and so it
gives you much better cooler or
temperatures at least that's what
they're advertising now I wasn't gonna
just take EVGA 's word for it as much as
I do like them as a company I want to
see them see the changes firsthand so I
went ahead to rip this cooler open and
it does indeed have a very different
design when it comes to the actual heat
pipes it has a copper plate on there now
which is evenly dissipating the heat to
3/8 millimeter copper heat pipes there's
straight heat pipes with their
advertising are better for temperatures
now it does have a very massive heatsink
that runs along the length of this thing
but as you can see it does not have a
backplate which was a little bit
confusing considering the pictures they
put up did show a backplate but I have a
feeling there's gonna be a future
announcement regarding that now I do
think a backplate on this would have
made sense because as you can see there
are four Ram modules on the back of this
thing which are not being cooled
whatsoever however the other four Ram
modules on the other side of the PCB are
being touched by that plate on there
which is actually giving
a bit of dissipation to the cooling or
to the heat for better cooling so I
would have liked to have seen them do
that considering now you are gonna have
some dealt to temperature differences
between the RAM especially if you start
to overclock the RAM or it starts to
overclock itself as Maxwell does when it
comes to V RAM and power target and
power limit overhead it will start to
allocate that to the RAM and self
overclock where needed
where there's additional power it's a
great design but I think we should not
have Delta temperatures between both
sides of the RAM and both sides of the
PCB that's just me you guys know how I
feel about back plates doesn't have it
anyway this is a graphics card review so
enough talking about that stuff let's go
ahead stick this thing on the best bets
Beth - tensed the test bench and let's
just see how well it does you guys can
tell this video is not scripted today is
it no it's not so you guys get all of
the bloopers along with this video
so the GTX 970 SSC SuperDuper clocked
from EVGA how did it perform as you guys
saw in the benchmarks this thing is a
killer when it comes to 1080p edge it
massively destroys 1080p even an ultra
settings there all of my benchmarks guys
with the max settings we're talking max
anti-aliasing and max depth of field max
everything and as far as the sliders can
go to the right that's the way I do my
test bench results when it comes to
graphics cards cuz I want to see exactly
what they're capable of so you guys know
what the worst-case scenario is when it
comes to performance so you pull some of
those sliders down performance goes up
but the GTX 970 guys I said it back when
the series first launched in September
that although the 980 is fun and it's
super powerful and having three of them
in one rig is just so overkill for what
I use it for it's not even funny the GTX
970 is still the clear winner when it
comes to the Maxwell series because of
the fact that it's so much performance
such low temperatures such low wattage
needed and it's so much cheaper than the
980 s it really is the best bargain of
the series as far as I'm concerned I'm
grana we don't know what the 960 is
gonna bring when that launches but right
now the 970 we're coming in at under
$400 giving you you know nearly 780 Ti
type performance and maxing the r9 290x
and many tests in meeting it and some
makes this card by far as far as I'm
concerned the the best future-proof card
at the moment yeah I said future proof
but this card would last you easily four
to five years as far as I'm concerned
now when it comes to the benchmarks as
you guys saw it did a fantastic job even
at 1440 and for K now for K yeah we were
seeing 30s and 40s on the FPS but even
the 980 classified was doing thirty and
forty forty-one FPS and this thing
actually performed very near the 980
when it comes to 4k so again it's just
an amazing job for the 970 now it's not
the coolest cooler I've tested that
still belongs that that title still
belongs to the gigabyte g1 gaming but
then again that card has three fans a
much longer heatsink on this thing but
it doesn't feature the dual BIOS like
this one
and this one still came in 70 FPS or 70
degrees Celsius max in a closed-off room
when I just let Valley benchmark loop
for an hour 70 degrees Celsius max while
overclocked to 1500 and 53 megahertz Wow
I was also running the RAM at 8000
megahertz so yeah this thing's pretty
freakin awesome and the dual BIOS is
really cool that way you guys could play
around most switching up your BIOS or
putting some custom BIOS on there which
are now on the market you guys can find
over at like overclock net and not have
any risk of breaking your card you can
always recover it with that dual BIOS so
there you go I think this thing is a
fantastic card all the 970 as hard as
far as I'm concerned but I'm really glad
to see the EVGA addressed the public
concern over the cooler redesigned the
way the base plate works on the die
itself as well as adding the heat
spreader across the PCB which are
helping keep things nice and cool
keep those VRMs cool you can overclock
farther keep the GPU cooler you can
overclock farther and raising that
thermal or that with a power limit also
means you can run the fans harder faster
keep things cooler and not actually
reduce your overclocks
so there you go guys GTX 970 super super
clocked not the super super super super
clock that one actually comes out in the
spring tell anybody now you guys may
have noticed on my desk in front of
skunkworks earlier in this video that I
had this little mini fridge now I'm just
kidding this is actually my node 304 for
fractal design and I built a mobile
rendering PC in this and I will be doing
a video on very shortly on the channel
so you want to make sure you stick
around for that I've got a lot of
hardware crammed into this little bitty
case right here and this is going to be
going with me to CES that I'll be using
to render the videos for you guys while
I am there at least some of them some of
them will be rendered there some will be
rendered back here afterwards but if you
guys want to see what's in here and how
it performs make sure you guys stay
tuned on the channel now as always if
you guys want to interact with me check
me out on Twitter or Facebook those are
the easiest platforms to get a hold of
me I really love interacting with you
guys you guys make doing this every
single day so much fun hope you get
hopefully you guys have a nice safe New
Year's holiday and there's always guys I
hope to see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
