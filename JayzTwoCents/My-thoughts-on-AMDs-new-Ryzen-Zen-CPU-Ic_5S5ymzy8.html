especially if you're a fan of AMD and
even if you're not we're going to talk
about today is going to affect everybody
so you should probably listen
wait-wait-wait-wait-wait it's Christmas
can't week but we're way away will you
wait guys he came he came what time is
it
guys I got a fractal design Calvin s 36
oh no he's like way too early for this
I'll get the coffee okay huh
jeepers a custom build by J's to set
aside a factor design define an OS I
love the holidays golly a fractal design
core 500 yeah guys look Matan party for
days this is what makes it all worth
this season spoiled the ones you love
with the gift of Awesomeness happy
holidays from fractal design okay so we
have got more information now about Zen
excuse me I mean Rison I mean summit
ridge whatever which is the only reason
I'm even willing to talk about it today
because I've said a million times I
don't like to talk about rumor but we
are at a big crossroads here when it
comes to desktop CPUs and so I thought
this information might be important
especially for people who are on the
cusp of buying new hardware that you
might want to just hold off for just a
second if you already bought something
especially if you bought an AMD CPU
don't freak out because still there's a
lot of unanswered questions and those
those are some of the things I want to
bring up today so AMD just did a press
conference where they showed some more
raw performance of summit ridge versus
an i7 69 hundred K which is an $1,100
CPU so let's keep that in mind as we
move forward because these specs are new
I have not get them memorized so I'm
going to be using a bit of a cheat sheet
here Sumi but when you go down the list
here the specs are nearly identical to
the 6900 k i7 of course which is a
Broadwell ebay cpu again $1100 CPU I
want to point that out that's what
retail is 1,100
so we are seeing AMD here going
toe-to-toe with $1,000 cpu from Intel
actually it's more than $1,000 depending
where you buy it but I digress
alright so AMD's risin here is built on
a 14 nanometer FinFET architecture it's
got eight cores and sixteen threads just
like the 6100 k it's got a 3.4 gigahertz
base clock 200 megahertz up from the 3.2
found on the Intel it has got an unknown
turbo boost AMD has not divulged any of
that information yet they're kind of
keeping that a little bit secret here
they don't want to tip off their hat too
much to Intel but to Intel will boost a
3.7 with a max turbo boost of 4
gigahertz so we've got to see if Intel
AMD is going to even match that I have
no reason to believe they wouldn't in
fact I'd be surprised if we're seeing
numbers here that are deep into the 4
gigahertz range as we start getting our
hands on those and start seeing what the
boost to an overclock - they both have
20 megabytes of cache and they both
operate ddr4 memory now here's where
things start to differ just a little bit
here Intel uses a quad channel memory
set up on their x99 base CPUs which of
course the 6900 K is AMD is only using a
dual channel now whether or not that's
going to hurt it in the long run I guess
we'll just have to wait and see this is
only going to matter to people who are
using their CPUs to the absolute limit
people who are doing extreme CAD drawing
3d modeling even rendering and doing 4k
rendering with quad channels not going
to be as big of a hit compared to or
with dual channels compared to quad
channel so I don't see that as being a
huge issue but again that's something
we'll have to test once we get our hands
on it to see what kind of differences
there really are I guess one thing to do
would be take like a 59 60 X or a 69
hundred K which are about the same CPU
and we are going to have to disable or
take two sticks of memory out and
compare in fact I think that's a test
I'll have to do here I don't think it's
going to be that big of a deal for
people who are doing especially things
like games and YouTube and streaming and
stuff like that
of course the more memory channels the
better I'm kind of curious as to why AMD
stuck with a dual channel configuration
AMD is touting 95 watt TDP on their 8
core 16 thread rise n CPU that's that's
huge because you guys have always made
the jokes AMD is known as the space
heater in the winter yeah and you know
the temperature of the Sun in the summer
of course those jokes have always been
applicable to the Radeon graphics side
more so than the CPU but 95 watt TDP
that is a huge huge improvement over the
one hundred and forty watt TDP found on
the comparable Intel here now we don't
know what pricing is going to be yet but
it's kind of what I want to talk about
mostly today on how this is going to
affect the community is going to be
based entirely on price because we've
already seen in the latest benchmarks
here from AMD and the live benchmarks
that with no turbo clock enabled on
their CPU remember they did they that's
a question mark we don't know what it's
going to actually turbo clock up to yet
3.4 gigahertz was beating the 69 hundred
K in various tests like handbrake and
ZBrush or ZBrush core and of course a
blender we if the core can go farther in
terms of speed then we're seeing with
Intel then we're going to see a better
performance out of AMD at a lesser TDP
which is going to force a kind of a
movement here in the CPU market which
has been very stagnated now that's what
this has to do with the community here
because if you're not having competition
in the space you have no incentive to
spend big R&amp;amp;D numbers to get better
performance because you're already
dominating a market which intel has had
a solid ten years of just bored and not
really doing much and giving us really
shitty improvements Intel I think you've
done some great things but you've really
let the desktop community down as far as
I'm concerned with the improvements
we've seen over the last four or five
generations by giving us this tick-tock
method here of a slight increase in
performance and clock numbers and then
very small architecture changes so
there's really been no reason to spend a
bunch of money in the community but if
AMD is finally able to compete and give
Intel run for their money
prices half
come down I can't see AMD really trying
to compete at the thousand dollar CPU
market so the question is how much is it
going to cost them to make the CPU and
how much is it going to cost the
community to adopt this CPU because I
don't see a lot of AMD fans who've
really based their entire love for AMD
being based on performance per dollar
running out and spending a thousand
dollars on a CPU I don't see them
running out and spending seven hundred
and fifty dollars on a CPU in fact if
you guys remember when the AMD 95 90
first came out they tried a ridiculous
thousand dollar price tag on that
because it was actually achieving five
gigahertz um yeah the community pretty
much laughed at that and what do they
cost today um $199 yeah I mean look how
far that's come down is an 80% price
drop because the community did not adopt
it then again the performance really
wasn't there either but the performance
is there now what's the price going to
be because if they come out with
something like swing let's just say 500
bucks okay I that's still a lot for an
AMD CPU and that's a lot for the
community to really gamble with with a
company that has really kind of lost its
way over the load and gone through hi
CEO turnover and just really really had
has not been there for the extreme
performance market so that's a big
gamble right now if you jump on Team
AMD's bandwagon
moving forward is what is the upgrade
path going to be unfortunately if you've
adopted am-3 recently you cannot adopt
this CPU because a m4 is a new platform
moving forward now there's something
else I kind of want to talk about here
actually a couple things there's so much
I could talk about here but these are
just some questions that I've had for
the community and this is why this is
kind of an open-ended video here where I
want you guys to have a adult and civil
conversation I know this is asking an
awful lot of the YouTube comments
section is how you guys feel this is
going to play out we're not going to see
any of this until early 2017 it's been
pushed back a little bit we were
expecting a q3 q4 2016 it's now q1 2017
that's probably one of the major
questions I have right now is what is
the upgrade path going to be and not
only that what is the CPU lineup going
to be they can't read debut this with
just one CPU it yeah I know that
have server CPU coming out the extreme
CPU like we just saw Anna Notebook CPUs
but there what is the lineup going to be
within that desktop range right there is
it just going to be this one CPU that
you can adopt at XYZ dollars and that's
it or are they going to have a shape
down version like a four core eight
thread or even a four core with no hyper
threading I mean what that's some of the
biggest questions I have right there
because you're only going to adopt that
mainstream performance per dollar market
if you have obviously options the other
thing that kind of sucks about this
though is to take advantage of the new
CPUs is you have to adopt Windows 10
Microsoft has sort of strong-armed Bank
route or Windows 10 down the throats of
PC users everywhere and now you can only
adopt the new CPU architectures on both
AMD and Intel cabie Lake is also going
to require Windows 10 which really
really sucks but if you're not going to
update to Windows 10 then don't bother
upgrading your CPU now nobody's got a
chance to actually test yet what's going
to happen with the new CPUs if you try
and run it on an older operating system
because they're not in anyone's hands
yet but that's a question that's waiting
to be asked so what does this mean for
the community it could mean some great
things if price competition is starting
to take place
I don't think AMD and Intel are going to
try and battle it out at the thousand
dollar price mark I just don't and I'm
really really hoping here and I'm
praying to gaben that somehow AMD has
made this manufacturing process
affordable for them and they can do it
at a huge huge upset of like 500 bucks
for performance based CPU that's
matching the 60 100 K at $1,100 that
will shake up everything so am I going
to run out and build a system using
summit ridge of course I am you guys
know I'm going to assume this is huge
this is not something I'm going to leave
on the table and not try out I feel like
I need to have a permanent test bench
set up as well with summit ridge so that
we can do side-by-side comparisons and
see exactly helpings are performing
there and I would be doing the community
a disservice if I didn't cover both of
those especially now that we've got a
level playing field about to take place
here in the CPU market as long as the
train doesn't derail which unfortunately
rooting for AMD their trains never seem
to stay on the track especially when it
comes to their marketing team so
guys don't mess this one up don't mess
this one up all eyes are on you guys I'm
gonna be blunt don't it up okay all
right guys that's been my two cents let
me know what you guys think down in the
comments please try and keep it civil
fanboy isms aside this is big for
everyone
AMD a named AMD and AMD fans alike of
course but AMD and Intel fans alike we
might finally for the first time in a
decade see some true competition taking
place here in the CPU market it's
exciting
sound off in the comments guys and as
always don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
