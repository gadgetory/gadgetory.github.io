here and it's been a while since I've
gotten to do any sort of graphics card
review because we're kind of deep into
the lifecycle what's currently out so I
was super excited when EVGA told me
they're launching a new graphics card so
I have to go turn tricks on the corner
to get my fix anymore but I digress
that's a conversation for another video
but we got a chance to go to the EVGA
headquarters and check out the new for
the win two gtx 1080 which is featuring
their new icx cooler I say icx cooler
but trust me when I say there's a lot
more to this than meets the eye it is
not just a cooler we're going to talk
about that today now last week I had the
opportunity of going in a
behind-the-scenes tour EVGA s
headquarters where they showed us like
the RMA Center the testing center the
packaging I got to hang out with some of
my friends like Paul and Kyle and Steven
with gamers Nexus and we all got to get
really hands-on with this so trust me
when I say that there's a lot of
information here I apologize if there's
too much information in the video where
it's too long I'll try and condense it
so make sure you guys check out their
coverage too because it's always good to
get multiple perspectives on a single
topic after all we all know I don't know
what the hell I'm talking about now on
the surface the icx cooler in the ACX
cooler are very difficult to distinguish
but trust me when I say it's what's
underneath that is really different here
now we're going to talk about three
things here about this major design
we're going to talk about the new cooler
we're going to talk about the PCB and
we're also going to talk about software
I'm not going to be doing any game
benchmarks on this it's still a 1080
it's still going to have the very same
performance as you saw before although
maybe a little bit less throttling so
we're not going to doing any game
benchmarks today I'm focusing simply on
a teardown and temperatures now the
heats in array found on the icx actually
has these holes drilled all the way
through it which allow air to kind of
escape through the heatsink going
sideways as well as moving air through
it so it's supposed to get a little bit
more efficient cooling capability it's
also a little bit more efficient airflow
and trust me when I say that you can
indeed feel the air coming off the back
of the card especially when it's under
load more so than I could with the back
of this card which is completely solid
and blocked off air can't really get out
besides very well at all underneath the
heatsink is also a very different design
when it comes to the base plate the vrm
is definitely a forethought when it
comes to cooling because now you have
these sort of heat spires we'll call
them it's not really a heatsink but
they're definitely heat spires
they're designed to pull heat through
the plate get it up into the airflow and
give you better vrm cooling now EBG a
solution to the thermal issue was by
putting heat pads between the heatsink
and the top of the base plate which
doesn t touch to vrm it's just it didn't
have anything on top of the base plate
to dissipate the heat so the thermal
pads though did increase the cooling
efficiency quite a bit but the problem
is the heat sink that it's touching is
not flat on the bottom it's it's pointy
so there's a lot less surface area that
could have been there in the first place
so what EVGA did on the icx cooler was a
sort of bent the fins to make them a
little bit flat so where it actually
touches the thermal pad is giving you
much more efficient transfer of heat now
also to the heatsink that's directly on
top of the GPU the bottom of that was
completely flat and closed off well now
they actually have 50% of airflow that
can actually travel through that and get
down to the base plate as well which
gives you much better cooling for the
memory so it's quite a bit different on
the heatsink although it looks very
similar on the surface now moving on to
the back of the graphics card you can
see the original backplate was a very
nice piece of machined aluminum it had
some vents where it mattered but again
where the back of the VRMs were was also
a vent it didn't have the greatest
contact in mind when it came to the
backside of the power delivery now
remember heat radiates in multiple
directions not just one direction so
heat coming off the back of the card was
also an afterthought so what they've
done is they actually created a bit of a
heatsink built into the backplate which
is separate down the middle so you don't
you don't get as much heat contamination
from the GPU side of things moving over
to the vrm side so obviously it's
working with that very defined
limitation of heat transfer from the vrm
now before I talk about temperatures
let's talk about my testing methodology
I use an open air test bench because I
want the only factor on the temperature
of the graphics card to be the cooler
itself there's no way I could put any
case on here that's going to account for
all real-world scenarios so right now
the only factor on what the temperatures
are on the graphics card are what the
limitations of the cooler itself are so
I'm not going to address any of the open
air test bench comments in this video
you guys can go and check out this one
up here I actually tested open air test
bench versus a closed case with the same
GPU to see what the differences are you
can have the conversation over there if
you want it now on the flipside having
an open air test bench actually makes
neck
of results when it comes to things like
back plate testing and seeing this new
back plate design is going to be
efficient because there is zero air flow
happening over the back plate there's no
case fans moving air usually your case
fans are blowing directly on your GPU
especially we have a side case fan so
that was something to keep in mind so I
did do testing without any airflow and
then I also tested what they stand on
there to see what the differences would
be so now with all of that out of the
way let's talk about how well this
design really works
now with the new precision X you can
actually monitor power delivery GPU
temperature and memory temperature so
you have full control over what's going
on your system you can actually set
temperature indicators where you can
change the color of those LEDs to kind
of tell you what's going on at a glance
if you can see your graphics cards
through your window if you don't want
those on just set the color to black and
they won't even be there now idle we
were seeing power delivery temperatures
sitting in the mid 30s perfectly
acceptable it's where I would expect it
to be but once I put it under load we
saw temperatures go up into the low 70s
which sounds like a lot the MOSFETs are
typically rated up to something like 120
C so we are well below that threshold
that's because obviously now we have
cooling on both the back plate and the
front plate that's giving us active
cooling to the V RMS it's doing a
fantastic job I also use my thermal
imaging camera for this test because the
matte black backplate was perfect
emissivity for this test and I was
surprised to see that we actually were
within one or two degrees of the
temperatures that were being shown for
the GPU on precision precision OC if I
was I wasn't expecting that so I was
kind of happy that made me go yeah the
thermal testing is actually worth doing
but also got me thinking in cases like I
mentioned earlier typically there's air
flow that moves over the back plate so
how well is that going to work
so I took a thousand rpm fractal design
spam put it about the distance away a
case the front case that would be and
had it blow air towards the GPU it's not
a huge stream of air it's a thousand rpm
fan it does not it's not a high CSF and
it's just a steady light breeze on the
back of it and check this out
temperatures actually came down to where
they matched what was actually showing
on precision XOC so that was very good
one it sort of validated the temperature
sensors and saying yes this is legit
temperature and - it made the use of the
FLIR just completely valid so I was
happy about that so I think that makes
all the emissivity gurus out there
satisfied at least I would hope so
but Jay I like to overclock my graphics
cards what's going to happen if I do
that well guys I got good news because
fortunately there's a separate fan curve
for VRMs as well which will override any
fan curve you have going on for the GPU
because guess what the fans are separate
the right fan on top of the power
delivery is independent from the left
fan and it will do its own thing based
on vrm temperature and the left and can
be set directly to GPU now if you want
to link them together you can but I
think it's really neat that you have a
system that overrides it and says hey
once we hit 74 see on the vrm let's
start speeding up the fans a little bit
to keep things as cool as possible and
the temperatures that you saw right here
were all with the factory curve I didn't
change anything and you can see that we
had temperatures that were very very
respectable
so even when I applied a 2088 overclock
I wasn't seeing any additional
temperature on the vrm simply because of
the fact that the fans are speeding up
to kind of counteract that the EVGA
tells me they have a temperature target
of 74 C on the BRM that can't be changed
that's a safety thing they've determined
that number so that's where it's going
to be but I also was curious with an
overclock and setting the fans on
something manual like 60% fan speed
sacrificing a little bit of noise the
temperatures on the vrm came all the way
down to the low 60s absolutely amazing
the design is clearly working now
speaking of safety some of the photos of
the burned PCBs on the AC X fiasco
scared EVGA enough to where they
actually added a fuse to the PCB that
will blow before anything else catches
fire or burns so that's a good I think
all manufacturers should do that
anything that's got power going through
it might finish it up some sort of
built-in fuse including me I blow my
fuses all the time so as you can see
it's quite a bit more than just a new
cooler it's software it is a cooler and
as well some PCB changes and nine
sensors to keep an eye on what's going
on inside of your system now at the EVGA
press day we did have some questions we
asked you Vijay directly well what if
you're out of the step-up program or
what if you've already got a for the
wind card and you want to step up but
you're outside of that window are you
just leaving the old owners out to dry
well know that what they're doing right
now and you have to get more information
on their website I don't have any of the
details but what they've told us at
least be a messaging is that there's
going to be a $99 step up program to be
able to upgrade to a four that when to
if you want it now will say this I've
got three of these for the wind cards
thermal pads applied I have no problem
using it in fact I put one inside a
friend system if you guys remember that
I have full confidence in the a CX 3.0
with the thermal pads applied to it it's
just good to see that EVGA responded to
the public outcry about something
needing to be done about the design a
company that doesn't listen to its
customers is not going to be a company
for long so kudos to EVGA on that one I
think more companies should actually
follow suit and listen whether their
customers have to say Apple but who
needs to listen to your customers when
you have courage anyway guys time to go
thanks for watching today's video again
make sure you check out the other
coverages out there there was quite a
few of us at the press days so chances
are your favorite outlet has probably
covered something regarding icx - make
sure you check them out guys as always
thanks for watching tell me what you
want me to test moving forward the Terry
Crews build guys it's coming I promise
the last bits of pieces I was waiting on
are finally here it's coming I just
don't want to devote too much I want to
be a surprise for the guy so stop
nagging me
alright time to go thanks for watching
and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
