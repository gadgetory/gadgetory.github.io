today we're going to go ahead and do the
popular request and I'm constantly asked
is how do you put together a water
cooling loop so since I have to drain
mine pull all the water out of it I
decided to go hitting all the parts out
of the machine I'm going to show you
guys exactly what you need to know when
it comes to building the water cooling
loop when building a custom loop there
are specific parts that are required to
complete the system of course you're
going to have to have a block for your
CPU this is what's going to transfer the
heat into the water you're going to have
to have a pump this right here is a MCP
nine six six five five
leave number the actual number of it
yeah MCP six five five from Swift tech
it's a variable speed it's a very high
pressure pump you don't need to go this
extreme but you obviously do have to
have a pump you have to have a radiator
you have to have a way to dissipate that
heat you have to have a reservoir to
hope have a place to fill the coin have
a place to hold the coolant and of
course you have to have the tubing which
I already have connected here because
I'm not going to redo it all and of
course you have to have a fan you have
fans for your radiator one of the most
common things that I'm asked is how big
should your radiator be well that really
depends on how many pieces that you're
going to be cooling inside your water
cooling kit you could cool as much as
just the CPU or you could cool the CPU
the MOSFETs the motherboard the
Northbridge if you're running AMD if you
run a graphics card multiple graphics
cards Ram there are so many ways that
you can build this custom loop the size
of your radiator and how many radiators
really depends on what it is you're
planning on cooling so if you're going
with the bare minimum like a CPU we can
get away with even just a single 120
millimeter radiator which is half of
this this is a 240 radiator which is to
120 millimeter fans from my loop however
I'm also including the water cooling for
my GTX 680 here so that includes the
price you have to include a graphics
card water block
my case I'm using a full cover water
block which means that I'm adding a lot
more heat to my system because graphics
cards tend to get much hotter than CPUs
so I included another triple Swift tech
radiator right here let's go ahead and
take these parts let's put them together
in the PC and show you guys exactly what
you need to do to take it from part to
loop when it comes to applying the
thermal paste you want to apply it
directly to the CPU heat spreader
there's a lot of different opinions and
ideas going around about the proper way
to install thermal paste I'm going to
show you the way that I do it I tend to
just take and put a few dots evenly
spread out on the top of the heat
spreader and then just take a business
card or a credit card and you can use it
to this evenly smear and apply the
thermal paste and I know somebody
watching this video is going to be like
that's not the proper way to cut down
the pace well you can eat me this is the
way I've been doing it for years I've
never once had a problem the thermal
paste all it does is fill any gaps
between the two metals as they touch and
it promotes heat exchange between the
block and the CPU and what you want to
do when you're installing the block and
this is true for any sort of heat sink
or water block is you want to get two
opposing corners started and you just
want to get these just slightly tight
and you want to work on a start pattern
just like a heat sink you don't want to
tighten down in a circular motion
because then what you'll do is you'll
create a bulge in the center and you'll
have a gap you know what make very good
contact which can lead to overheating
okay so once we got the CPU block
installed go ahead recommend installing
your radiator the radiator is kind of
the most bulky part to work with here so
keep it firm in one hand
and we're going to keep this very very
clean people get your mind out of the
gutter
and then I would just keep in your other
hand one screw ready so that you can get
it hand tight to hold the radiator in
place just a point I want to make when
it comes to routing your tubing here my
two thing was pretty much already all
cut and ready to go because I removed it
from a working system but what you want
to be mindful of is how tight of a bin
you put on the tube the tubing is very
flexible especially if you go with a
tube designed for water cooling from a
reputable source like frozen CPU or
performance pcs it's very very flexible
however if you get to a certain point
you're going to get a kink in it so you
have two options you can get an anti
keep a spiral piece of plastic that goes
over without a tube I think it looks
really tacky I don't like using anti
kink coils the other thing you can also
do is just plan really really well so
for instance I changed it up the way my
loop was routed here just slightly and
so when going from the CPU block to the
GPU it was putting as you can see right
here how it flattens out a little bit
this is flattening out which is reducing
the water flow so all I need to do to
fix that is just put the tube next to
the bar about where I think it needs to
be and then just slowly cut off about
quarter inch increments of the tube and
test fit until it's no longer kinking
and then just leave it at that so you
want to plan ahead when it comes to
tubing you want to do some some test fit
it doesn't really matter what order that
you run the components in the most
important part is that you have your
pump being fed directly by your
reservoir you want your pump pulling in
from the reservoir and you want your
pump to be lower than the level of your
reservoir because you want gravity to
feed into the pump we'll talk more about
that when it comes time to fill in prime
the system but it doesn't really matter
as long as the reservoir goes before the
pump the pump can go out to the graphics
card then to a radiator then to the
block then to the other radiator or in
your case just block and radiator and
it's fine
now I'm getting your hand drop your
wrist more break my arm
go away he did break your arm off it's
sort of in the way in order to mount
your reservoir you might have to drill
some custom holes my case for the
reservoir it has an L bracket and I had
to drill a hole into the bottom here to
melt this down
and the loop is now back together just
that easy so I've got to go ahead and
put some of these clamps back in place
but I mean guys that's it so here's the
order of my loop this is the way that I
run my loop here
I'll go from reservoir to pump to upper
radiator to the CPU directly to the GPU
then to the lower radiator back to the
reservoir so that's my loop
