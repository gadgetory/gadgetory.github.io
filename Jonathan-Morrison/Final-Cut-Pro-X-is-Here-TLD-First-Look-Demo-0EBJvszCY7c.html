TLD got a first look and demo of the
newly released Final Cut Pro 10 just at
the mac app store this morning it's
gonna run you two hundred ninety nine
dollars and it's going to come at a
whopping one point three three gigs in
size it's actually not that big on a
side note we have motion 5 in the apple
store along with compressor for those
are going to run you for 29 bucks a pop
those are available today download as
well but this is Final Cut Pro 10 so
let's go ahead and jump into that
program this is what you guys want to
see i'll just say quick note is going to
be a first look I'm barely browsing into
this so I've really learned it in depth
yet so I'm just going to give you guys a
quick demo they'll be more in-depth
videos later coming on I imported a
couple clips right here this is straight
from my 60d SD card slot I wanted to see
how the h.264 files reacted to the new
Final Cut since it was supposed to do
well with those run you guys back in
time show you guys the import options
you can do to do it from your camera so
if you're doing this like firewire or DV
you have that option as well or you can
import directly from your computer or SD
card if you're using a DSLR you can also
import all I movie projects it does look
a lot like iMovie as some of you guys
are probably noticing right now we have
a little quick clip selects let's go to
drag it down to the timeline and this is
going to show you where it's rendered
there's actually a cool little window
right here if you go up as actually a
key command is command 9 and that'll
show you the background tasks so if you
are importing something and it's
analyzing transcoding it it'll show you
everything right here just if you want
to see what's going on in the background
now if we head over to the right again
very similar to I move we've got a
couple options right here we have video
effects built-in we got a slot for
photos music transitions text and then
introductions basically that's going to
be themes they're going to call it so
very similar to iMovie again so we I
think we've seen a theme right here but
it's going to be boosted up on steroids
all right so for the fun of it let's go
ahead and add a quick effect and see how
it handles it we got that on there add a
little bit of noise and you guys can see
it's already been rendered actually it's
not been rendered so there we go it's
going to render it right there this
little circle looking guy right here is
shown off the render so we're about
thirty percent once that's done it's
going to do in the background we can
still look at the clip and you guys can
see plane it still functions perfectly
it just happens to be rendering in the
background and let's go to and scroll
through these wall
that's rendering in the background so we
got H film age paper we got a lot of
effects camcorder cast cold steel combat
we got contrast cropping feather
crosshatch dazzle so there are a lot of
effects we got fish eye and I'm just
scrolling through these and there's a
lot so insect I intro flashes mask old
world photo Raquel a quick flash spin
projector radio sci fi so there's a lot
of built-in effects and I'm just barely
a these are audio effects right here now
I kind of really like this layout
actually compared to the old one audio
effects kind of could be a little bit
daunting to work with now it seems is
going to be like a lot easier so the
background render is done really no
different from what you saw a second ago
it was handling it very well and there
it is so let's go to look at a couple
more things we got text again the music
photos right here you can balance color
show color board so color is actually
built in to this and you can actually
adjust everything from here so I'm not
doing everything serious just showing
you guys a little example of how that
would work so we get color saturation
exposure and the layout is really really
nice so this just been a quick little
first look I'm definitely going to dive
more into this and probably do some
in-depth separate videos and I want to
check out stabilization I also want to
do the auto sync from a DSLR and
separate audio source so look forward to
those videos coming out soon I'm gonna
have a little playlist right here so if
you guys once those videos are up click
this playlist and that's going to bring
you back to all the other Final Cut Pro
10 videos I'm going to do so thank you
guys for watching if you guys pick this
up let me know what you think leave me a
comment down below as always feel free
to subscribe and I'll catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
