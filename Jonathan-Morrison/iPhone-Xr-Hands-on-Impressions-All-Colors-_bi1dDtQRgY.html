more coverage of the brand new iPhones
this is the new iPhone 10 are not a
tendency not to 9 the iPhone 10 are
without a doubt the most enticing things
about these phones got to be the colors
they look amazing we have a total of six
black white red blue yellow and my
favorite and I gotta admit I was a
little bit disappointed at the price
point of the 10r I was hoping they would
kind of just like shake up the world and
release this thing for $6.99 but it
starts out at 749 regardless so I think
this thing is going to sell like crazy
now definitely go more in depth on the
10r versus the 10s and 10's max but
essentially what you're giving up is a
NOLA display and a dual camera system
otherwise everything else is crazy
similar you have a 6.1 inch LCD liquid
retina which I gotta say from in person
looks good ol√° definitely has an
advantage but I think 99% of people
aren't really gonna care what's awesome
those Apple is still packin the same
exact a12 banach tip that we saw in the
iPhone 10s and 10's max in this 10 R so
again it's very very similar so I think
for the most part people are gonna go
nuts over this phone now a couple small
things this is an aluminum frame versus
stainless steel on the iPhone tennis and
tennis max but I gotta say the colors on
these frames look really good it's a
super nice touch that complements these
phones perfectly so with this display
even though the form factor is smaller
than a plus you're getting more screen
real estate very similar to what we saw
with the iPhone 10 last year so that's
all good news with the iPhone 10 R now
with the 10 are you do give up 3d touch
like on the 10s and 10's max but there's
something similar called a haptic touch
but I would definitely have to wait and
form my opinion and use that in person
the good news is though you still get a
face ID which is supposed to be faster
all the way around on all I phones this
year so again this is a single shooter
on the iPhone 10 R 12 megapixels F 1
point 8 and again correct me if I'm
wrong but I think most people don't
really care about dual lenses people are
going to see that price point and I
think opt for the iPhone 10 are most of
the time over the
and tennis max now unfortunately unlike
the iPhone tennis and tennis max you're
gonna have to wait a little bit to get
your hands on the iPhone 10 are
pre-orders start October 19th they ship
October 26 so for me that's good there's
a little bit of time in between to go
hands-on I can really go dive deep with
the tennis and tennis max but either way
I'm pretty stoked for these brand new
iPhones aside from that here's my
coverage on the iPhone 10s and 10's max
code and check that up out here or down
below if you want to see a more in-depth
comparison of the iPhone 10 are that
beautiful color iphone against the 10s
and 10's max code and take a shot every
time I say one of those names let me
know by smashing that like button thank
you guys very much watching this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
