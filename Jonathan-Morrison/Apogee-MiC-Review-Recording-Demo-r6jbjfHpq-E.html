review and demo of the mic by Apogee
which not only functions as a studio
quality microphone for your iPhone iPod
Touch or iPad but it also double
functions as a straight-up USB
microphone they can go directly into
your Mac via USB and then record into
GarageBand or even something like Logic
Pro now in the box you get the mic
itself 1/2 meter 30 pin connector for
your iOS device but if you do happen to
be rocking something with a lightning
connector like the iPhone 5 don't freak
out because I have used Apple's adapter
and it works flawlessly with the mic
next up we get a 1 meter USB cable and
this is what you'd use to go directly
from the mic to your Mac and then record
in something like GarageBand beyond that
you get a Quick Start Guide which will
give you a rundown of everything you
need to know on how to record with the
mic and they also throw in some tips on
mic placement so you get the most out of
your recording on both vocals and
instruments and then lastly they do
include a desktop tripod which mounts to
the back of the mic into the threaded
input and with that a slide for maybe a
pop filter if everything you need to
record right out of the box now the mic
is completely bus powered so there is no
external power or batteries needed and
being built in the USA the build quality
really stands out at the top there's a
cardioid condenser capsule that is
surrounded by a silver aluminum mesh
like enclosure typical of what you'd
find on most condenser microphones then
these solid construction continues all
the way down the mic with the entire
unit being made at a metal right below
the mic logo there's an LED indicator
and that's going to give you an easy
readout of the status of the mic so if
it's blue that means it's connected but
there is no engagement with any audio
software if it's dim green that means
it's working with the audio software but
there is no audio level now when you see
bright green that means the audio level
is present if you happen to see orange
you are approaching the maximum input
level and finally if you hit red that is
he mic telling you what II it is too
loud turn down the game because I'm
going to clip or distort now you're able
to adjust the input levels with the gain
control knob right there on the side
that's going to give you up to 40
decibels of gain they can precisely
control and dial in the exact amount
that you need that is made possible with
the built-in mic preamp which is not
something that you notice or see on the
outside but it's extremely important
because it's going to give you the
maximum amount of gain or input level
with the lowest amount of noise so
altogether you
the microphone capsule followed by the
mic preamp then lastly you have Apogee
is analog to digital converters which is
also really important because that's
going to take the analog signal and then
give you a clean conversion into digital
going into your iPhone or to your Mac so
you combine all those things with 24-bit
recording and that should separate the
mic from other microphones on the market
but no specs though features mean
anything unless the mic sounds good now
up to this point for the entire review
everything you've heard thus far is
being recorded directly with the mic
into my iMac and de Logic Pro and just
for reference here is what it sounds
like with the built in iMac microphone
so we are now recording with the built
in iMac microphone and holy hell you can
see that does not sound good it's thin
its tinny let's go back to the mic so
you can see there is a huge difference I
think it's safe to say that for vocals
for podcast and just overall for a USB
microphone this thing sounds damn good
so now that we can see it works
fantastic as a USB mic and it sounds
great for vocals we're going to go and
try out recording acoustic guitar
directly into an iPhone 5 using
GarageBand for iOS
Oh
you
you
so what did you guys think let me know
with a comment down below that it sound
good great bad terrible or just okay I'd
love to hear you guys opinion and I felt
even though this is geared primarily as
an iOS microphone for the money I think
it's the best sounding USB microphone on
the market at almost go as far as saying
that it rivals microphones at twice the
price but then you add in the fact that
the interface is built-in you get a
fantastic microphone preamp and Apogee
digital converters that's what makes it
a standout product if I had any
complaints or anything negative to say
about it I really wish they would have
included a headphone jack or something
to monitor yourself and really take
advantage of those a 2d converters but
aside from that it is a fantastic
microphone and if you're looking to step
up and really step up your audio
production I can wholeheartedly
recommend checking out the mic aside
from that thank you guys for watching
the video if you did enjoy its make sure
to hit that like button as it does help
the channel out if you have not
subscribed make sure you do so so a time
as any future tech content if you guys
are interested in picking one of these
up I'll pricing availability and where
to get one down in the description below
as well as a couple more mic options
just in case is a little too expensive
for you of some cheaper options that
still do a fantastic job linked right
next to the mic down in the description
below again thank you guys for watching
if you have any tech questions you can
hit me up on Twitter Facebook or Google+
those are linked down below along with
what gear I use to make my videos and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
