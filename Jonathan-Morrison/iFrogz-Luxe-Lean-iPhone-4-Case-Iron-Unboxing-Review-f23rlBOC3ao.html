with tod bringing you an unboxing and
review of the ifrogz luck saline iphone
4 case that this comes in about 25 bucks
a few different colors red black and
this is the gunmetal kind of metallic
finish to this so let's going to take a
look at the front you see the case
itself says iphone 4 right there and on
the back kind of gives you a little
instructional type deal telling you how
to put the case on so this comes with a
lifetime warranty let's go ahead and
open it up and see how the case it looks
so this is actually a kind of a lean
case or a slim case it's not meant to
fully protect the iphone so if you're
looking for a huge completely protective
case this isn't the one but this is
going to be a nice slim case and kind of
give you a natural feel for your iphone
4 so that's it itself you guys can take
a look at it right there i do like the
fact that they put this in there it's a
little kind of a satin protective
covering right there the iphone 4 is
glass so this is very smart from them as
far as protecting it from scratches so
you guys can see there's ifrogz logo and
let's go ahead and actually jump over to
the review all right jump it over to the
review section of this video is going to
install a case so according to the
instructions should be very easy snaps
right on there what i like about this
like i mentioned this is a very they
called the lean case so it's not going
to be completely protective of it you do
have the top and the bottom kind of bare
now there is a little bit that comes out
so if you drop it it's not going to
completely hid it but it is a little
bear compared to other cases now I like
this is a great alternative to the
bumper now this is going to cover the
antenna gate so you're going to have a
solution to that problem and it's
actually cheaper than the iphone 4
bumper so you guys can see you have the
camera popping through my favorite
things constructed really well the case
feels good what I like about this I
actually don't like the bumper compared
to this now I really feels kind of like
you're having just the iphone and it
really reminds me of that Simpsons
episode
kind of keeps a real nice original
feeling to it so you guys can see it
looks kind of like we have a vent on the
side so you can't access a sim card you
do have the volume up and down as well
as the silent button so overall I'm very
impressed with this it feels good I like
I said I don't like how the bumper feels
after using this and messing around with
it if you guys are looking for a nice
lean case that's something that's not
going to be too bulky this is definitely
a good pickup it's not expensive at all
at 25 bucks and like I said it comes in
a couple different colors you don't get
to cover the front so I do recommend
throwing on like maybe one of the
invisishield on the front that's going
to give you kind of the ultimate
protection but overall I definitely like
this it looks good it feels good and
like I mentioned before it's not very
expensive at all so go pick one of these
up i'll post a link to these in the
description I hope you guys enjoyed this
