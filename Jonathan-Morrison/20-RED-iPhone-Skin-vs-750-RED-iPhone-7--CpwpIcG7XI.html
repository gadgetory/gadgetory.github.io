tooth in shut up - J yo guys Johnson
here and this is a 750 dollar product
red iPhone and this is a 20 dollar skin
so the product red iPhone 7 has been out
for a little over a week down if you
caught my unboxing my general feelings
towards the phone is yes that red looks
amazing it is super tempting but it
might not be the smartest buying
decision right now so typically because
the iPhone 7 is now 6 months old which
puts us at the halfway point until the
next generation iPhone is out on top of
that if you own an iPhone 7 or 7 plus it
does not make sense to drop $750 + just
to have a red phone the other thing and
maybe the bigger controversy was why
Apple decided to opt for the white front
on their product what iPhone and not go
for the stealthy black and red
personally I really like the white front
I thought it look clean I better look
classy but kind of you out there on a
black and red and with that you have a
couple options by far the riskiest
option would be to disassemble your
iPhone you can do this by either
frankensteining parts from a black
iPhone or the cheaper route will be to
order these screen online now the
problem with this is because touch ID is
actually connected to logic board if you
want to take the safer route and not
potentially break your touch ID that's
going to leave you with a red back black
front and a white button that sticks out
like a sore thumb conversely if you
wanted to level up to advanced mode like
my buddy Danny widget you want to take
that risk and disassemble everything
higher risk big reward but the end
result is a red back black front and
black touch ID now if you are awesome at
taking things apart and putting them
back together fantastic but I could see
why a lot of people would be kind of
hesitant to do this because honestly it
is a near thousand dollar risk so jump
it back to the skin which is
significantly cheaper and much safer
whether you have an iPhone 7 6 s6 or
even Google pixel for that matter that
is going to give you access to that
sweet sweet red now disclaimer color
work did not sponsor this video
specifically I actually sent them out
some phones to wrap and send back but if
you do want to pick one of these up a
little bit does go back and support the
channel or maybe if you want to win one
of these go ahead and drop a life down
below so give you guys a rundown of the
goods I got in this is an iPhone 7 plus
with their formula red matte on
back and black leather on the front if
you dig that really clean matte look
this looks phenomenal and beyond the red
there are a ton of other color option
the reason we are here though is this
candy apple gloss red which my goodness
looks good for those of you familiar
with color where you know they made
their name with custom painted tech and
they've taken that skill over the skin
game and the end result is something you
really haven't seen before this looks
like a painted freaking foam but it's
not it is a $20 skin no joke when I got
these and I could still smell a little
bit of that freshly coated pate on the
skin and it's probably not the safest
idea to sniff your phone but you get the
idea and honestly I'm not going to lie
I'm going to do one of those basketball
games where you got to keep your eye on
the phone which one is which keep your
eye
crowds going crazy can you tell which
one is the real deal or soup and you
don't know what's happening right now
which one is the real iPhone when you
stack these two side-by-side this being
the real product that iPhone 7 this
being these skin I got to say the skin
actually looks a little better and pops
more you guys are seeing this right on
camera for yourself this is going to get
you the black Apple logo the black car
wear and on the front of this I went
with a carbon fiber black front which
looks awesome next you quickly saw me
tease the red Google pixel and this is
an XL and all of its red glory what I
like specifically about the pixel is how
you can mix and match on the main
portion I got that smooth shiny glossy
candy apple red and I'm complementing it
with a red leather which looks
phenomenal as far as the front goes this
is black leather which is a great
contrast of the red back flip the switch
for a second as cool is that red iPhone
is it really made me want a blue iPhone
and now I got one I've kind of teased a
blue MacBook here and there I've got a
ton of questions on where I got it from
and no it is not a painted MacBook it is
a painted skin on the MacBook the same
thing applies here you can see how much
this blue pops on camera compare that
with a carbon fiber white front and this
is the perfect combination for me now
maybe you don't like blue maybe you're
not an OKC fan maybe you bleed purple
and love the lakers not sure why but
would but seriously look how good these
looking just like the blue iPhone I got
a white contrast up front this is
actually white leather which also looks
crazy good so it's safe to say whether
you want red blue purple orange your
phone your MacBook there is probably an
option for you
now if you want a custom wrapped iPhone
7 or potentially the brand new Galaxy S
a go to hit the subscribe button and
tell notifications so you do not miss
that announcement
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
