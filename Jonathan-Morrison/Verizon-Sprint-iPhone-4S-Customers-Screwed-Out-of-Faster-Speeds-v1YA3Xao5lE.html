TLD got some iphone 4s updates it's
actually some bad news if you're
planning on buying the iphone for us for
either sprint or verizon if you look on
apple's website it states iphone 4s as
the first phone to intelligently switch
between two antennas to transmit and
receive so call quality is better it
also doubles the maximum hsdpa data
speeds to 14.4 megabits per second down
so technically it's not 4g but it is
faster than previous generation iphones
the only problem is they don't tell you
that hsdpa only works on AT&amp;amp;T so the
Verizon and Sprint versions will be
bottlenecked at 7.2 megabits per second
down keep in mind those with theoretical
speeds but it's still a little bit of
unfortunate news so if you were planning
on buying the iphone 4s for the AT&amp;amp;T or
Sprint does this affect your purchasing
decision and will you be moving to AT&amp;amp;T
now so I just wanted to bring you guys
this news I thought it was a little
unfair but you guys need to know that if
you guys missed a new ipod announcement
as well as the iphone 4s both those
links are right here make sure to check
those out topher to subscribe if you
guys feel like we an awesome give this
video a thumbs up spread the word and I
will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
