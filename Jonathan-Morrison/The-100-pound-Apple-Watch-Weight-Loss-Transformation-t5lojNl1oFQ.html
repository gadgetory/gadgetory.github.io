constantly struggled weight lost my
entire life so I've always been like a
heavy kid like I've tried losing weight
I'd cut stuff I'd go exercise but I'd
always stop and I'd always put it back
on and sometimes I put on more weight
than when I started so the series for
Apple watch has been out for about a
week now while there's been a ton of
heat on the iPhone I think the general
consensus is that the watch has been a
hit we've seen it all over Apple
keynotes
those stories on how the watch saved a
life how it impacted someone I thought
it'd be cool to actually find someone
like that me Gregory who lost 100 pounds
using the Apple watch my starting weight
was 280 I'm down to 175 now took about
two years to get there but I've
maintained it you know ballooning a
little here and there but maintaining
175 and still looking to get better
though now for me the biggest benefit of
the Apple watch has always been that it
encourages you to be active because
chances are you are more than likely
less active than you think I always
thought I moved around a lot or more
than the average person I think a lot of
people like to overestimate how much
they're actually moving around so for me
when I got home and I saw that I only
took like 2,000 steps I was going oh man
and then you see that the calorie rings
only a hundred filled and you have to
burn 600 calories it's a little
disorienting that first I'd start going
on walks too short little walks
15-minute walks on my breaks and that
would help fill the gap eventually I
just want to lose more and start going
more so I'd start walking home from work
and would about be like an hour walk and
you get like 10,000 15,000 steps and
after a while I just got tired of
walking all the time and took up a lot
of time so I just started running and I
picked it up from there started going
half mile mile two mile and then
eventually 5k so when I saw Gregory
story it really motivated me I've been
up the fitness game a little bit more
than I would have liked to admit lately
so to see him go from a mile to two
miles to a 5k oz like jeez he is
completely out doing that his step my
game up
I sent the tweet out I sent a tweet
sharing the video that I actually had a
hard time making telling people about
how I lost the weight so I did want to
share it with my audience and let them
know where I came from and how how heavy
I was how much I progressed and it was
important to me so at most I was
expecting a like
all of a sudden sitting at work and all
of a sudden I see a message and I'm like
oh shoot my heart rates pumping up I can
I couldn't handle it I can't believe I
let myself get that heavy I barely
recognize myself when I look at older
photos and sometimes people will say in
my life that you weren't that heavy and
then I'll remind them and I'll show him
a photo and they go wow that was you I
have a friend from college Evan he lives
in Massachusetts and we haven't seen
each other for a while and you know
we're sitting there and it's like the
elephant in the room no one brings it up
and then we're sitting on a drive back
home one day and he's goes man you lost
a lot of weight huh if I could do it at
280 I think a lot of people can do it
I'd say find something that works for
you if it's an Apple watch that can help
you track your movement or if it's
something like MyFitnessPal that can
track your calories just try something
start doing it every day and keep at it
so with that I thought it'd be awesome
to bring Gregory out to hang out and run
with them see what he does on a
day-to-day because right now my cardio
and endurance I'm gonna admit is trash
so Gregory is gonna kick my butt
all right so brought the kickoff this
run with Greg I'm a little worried that
it's gonna kick my butt but we'll see
what happens I'm gonna try and run two
miles with them let's see how it goes
Mansa were like six seconds in his pace
though like I knew was gonna kick my
butt but going man so I'm bringing this
pace down right now we're about a little
under half a mile I'm breathing need of
tea and he's just chugging through it
like a champ man I got all the credit in
the world great like I knew I was out of
shape but holy crab is just like a giant
slap in the face like dude you got a run
more Joshy murdered me like destroyed me
like I just go home after this
yo Sal was expecting like this calm
peaceful jog
you know he's downplaying it the whole
time it's no big deal I just kind of I
run for fun my pace isn't that fast I
say go it's not that fast
dude there's like Blair Witch footage of
me trying to catch up to you and you
just like knee high running uphill just
booking it so
damnit I'm sweating so much from Gregory
this mic won't stay on so you do that
like if I didn't screw it up you would
have been going the entire yeah
you stopped a couple of times stop with
you and walk I never stop do my whole 5k
let's go straight through he was telling
me how it slows them down and makes him
feel it's actually harder when you slow
down just keep going get over with oh
man I feel so bad like I need to get my
stuff together
either way though man like already from
the get-go a hundred pounds is like a
it's an amazing accomplishment so you
should be so proud for that but the
endurance you built up kind of blew my
mind thank you so everybody out there
mad props smash the like button for
Gregor he also does some really awesome
tech videos on top of just being this
like boss human being so check them out
I need to get my stuff together because
good god am I out of shape later
I did by Jimmy

is do it again do it again yeah hey guys
