unboxing of the 12 South hover bar and
what it is it's an adjustable arm for
the iPad 2 so I wanted to use this video
as kind of a preview to let you guys
know the review is coming very soon and
also if you guys happen to search for
this product you came across this video
if you haven't subscribed already feel
free to do so so you do not miss the
review now I've always been a fan of 12
South for a while they always do an
excellent job with their packaging
aesthetically you can see it's all laid
out very nicely here they show it hooked
up to a thunderbolt display but as we
flip it to the back you can actually see
there's a few more applications here's
the guy that hooked up to a desk with a
Bluetooth keyboard kind of got the
school environment going on here's a
closer look at the clamp to the
Thunderbolt display or iMac for that
matter and right here on the bottom
right hand corner you can see how it
would look in a kitchen environment so
if you're using this for a cookbook or
anything of that nature so without
further ado let's go to flip it over and
begin the unboxing I guess I'll just
turn to the side you flip it upside down
slide this off there we go
I'm not sure what that is it looks like
maybe some glue or adhesive someone to
keep it securely in place so we'll go
ahead and lift it and like I mentioned
they always do an excellent job with
their packaging with their box seems
kind of goes hand in hand with their
products so hover bar install guide and
user's manual very simple very cleanly
laid out looks like we got the little
clamp right here this would go on the
base of your Thunderbolt display or your
kitchen counter top anything for that
matter I'll lift that off nice and
protected here's a closer look at the
clamp so this is very well built solid
aluminum not flimsy at all so we're
gonna set that aside and get this looks
like the actual bar it rotates and
adjusts so you can swivel this angle
this to your liking and finally we have
the little back plate that would hook up
to your iPad and this is actually very
lightweight so it's not gonna put any
stress on your iPad so far everything
looks good I'll be sure to test this out
again this is just an unboxing and kind
of first look at the product we got a
couple more little tools and accessories
and a little rubber pad right here as
well as some salt so you can eat it
actually don't eat that mess off you
guys but this is just again a first look
and unbox
of the 12 South hover bar again if you
guys haven't subscribed already feel
free to do so for those of you guys
feeling awesome make sure to give it a
thumbs up it is always appreciated and I
will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
