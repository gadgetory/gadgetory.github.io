save the Galaxy Note 8 is getting way
too much hate like way too much now by
far the biggest critique and shot fired
I've seen taken against no date is that
as an overhyped si+ with an S Pen a dual
camera for some reason a slightly
smaller battery more RAM and I'm not
gonna lie at the no dative and I
jokingly called it an s8 plus plus my
reacting to the si plus but you're
acting - I'm sorry
in actuality though that really isn't
the case yeah you are paying more for
the know date but that is because you
are getting more - the battery if we're
to break this down into its simplest
form no one's gonna yell at a
cheeseburger for being a glorified
hamburger are they similar yes but you
know the difference and you have no
problem paying extra because it's an
option same thing it to pull a you want
guac you are ponying up the cash and I
guess in some strange way what I'm
trying to say is spen equals avocado
ultimately in some weird way Samsung has
almost kind of screwed themselves by
having too many options if we're being
honest the only reason Samsung's Plus
models exist is to compete with Apple
and their plus model phones
for simplicity's sake imagine there was
no s8 plus just the s8 that was their
smaller flagship and then in turn we had
to wait for the note 8 as they're bigger
flagship conversely after what happened
last year Samsung could have easily
killed off the note lineup and brought
the s kind of over to the si plus but
something about that really just
wouldn't have felt right because
ultimately what makes a note of note is
the S Pen and that's how it's always
been
so mini right outside actually you
really like to notate and by far what
stands out to me most of this of course
is that giant beautiful display it is
big and it is beautiful this here is a
6.3 inch display and again it's not much
bigger than the s8 plus which sizes in
at six point two inches but the thing we
got to get out of our heads
is that displays between the note 8 and
the s8 plus are not gonna be deciding
factors again it comes down to the S Pen
to the dual cameras but regardless Note
8 has a beautiful display you guys know
I love what Samsung did with their and
finish this place not only does it look
fantastic just simply using the phone
but of course consuming media with it
looking at photos video and on top of
that aesthetically I think it takes
these phones to the next love and
honestly I think so far they're the best
looking phones of this year your move
next Apple now specs wise one thing that
separates no date from the s 8 + + S 8
for that matter is Ram this is packing
six gigabytes in the side which makes
sense because Note has always kind of
been known as that multitasking machine
speaking of multitasking being able to
use multiple apps simultaneously in
separate windows isn't new but what is
is the ability to create app pairs so
instead of opening an app running
through the process every single time
you can actually pair up apps that you
use most frequently and from there it is
only one step and I think that is
awesome
switching gears one weird thing spec
wise with a note 8 again is battery
capacity not only is it smaller than
last year's Note it's also smaller than
the s8 plus which kind of leaves you
scratching your head the note 8 is a
bigger phone whether it's just barely
bigger it is still bigger so the fact
that it has a smaller battery really
doesn't make sense and again as much as
a notice kind of been synced up with
multitasking I think the note has been
synonymous with big battery life so I
can see why people will be upset here
past that though I think there are
still a ton of enticing elements with no
date and there's not a whole lot you can
complain about you have USBC a headphone
jack quick charging wireless charging
water resistance micro SD card expansion
overall it is a really solid package so
from there I think we all know it s-pen
is about what it can do so I first want
to focus on the dual cameras because
that is what really impressed me you
have dual 12 megapixel sensors a
wide-angle lens and then a telephoto
lens what what makes us really special
is the fact that both of these have oh
is and that makes a big difference
speaking of stabilization I do want to
slightly call out Samsung for their Oh
is video demo at the note 8 event if you
watched it they compared the note 8
against an iPhone but something was
clearly off like could you imagine the
behind-the-scenes on that
jokes aside that we have clearly seen
and know what the s8 and s8 plus cameras
are capable of and I think with a note a
it kind of takes things to the next
level now one of the biggest camera
features on the note 8 is live focus and
yes some people are gonna say it is very
similar to portrait mode on the iPhone 7
plus and really every other dual camera
out there for that matter but in
particular what I love about this is not
only the quality but the flexibility
there definitely are other smart phones
out there that give you the ability to
edit things in post but it usually comes
with a sacrifice and quality as far as
notate goes it's not perfect and it's
not gonna work every single time but as
a whole it is super impressive the
ability to adjust the amount of blur to
really fine-tune and dial in and find
that point of clarity and both
naturalness is really cool but on top of
that what I think is the coolest thing
about this is you have the ability to go
back at any time and view the wide-angle
version of that photo which is crazy
now beyond live focus mode in terms of
the camera as a whole no surprise it is
really good here's an example of jumping
from the wide-angle lens the telephoto
lens and yes you do lose a little bit of
light with an f-stop of 2.4 on the
telephoto lens but look at the pictures
you can see both are really nice in this
picture here this is the telephoto lens
but what stands out to me here is the
sharpness and the detail it was just
about sunset so you can really see that
Sun beaming down on the floor but beyond
that the detail and the leaves and the
concrete's I think one might call it
crispy in this picture here in
particular the dynamic range is really
impressive we see the blue of the sky we
see the clouds we see all the lighting
of the signs nothing's blown out and
overall it's just a really really
well-rounded photo now if things started
to get a little darker this was one of
my favorite shots not a ton of light in
the foreground just a light bulb itself
but we still see the clouds we see a
little bit of that Sun blown out and
overall it is just a beautiful picture
as far as the front-facing cameras I
think Samsung has done an amazing job
that last couple years and again nothing
has changed shirts and no dates this is
how this shot looks on a red camera and
here's how it looks with the
front-facing camera of the note 8 jump
it over to an outdoor selfie again great
dynamic range great sharpness I love the
fact that you have a wide-angle lens and
really there's not much more to say than
great job Samsung on the cameras video
quality wise here's a quick example of
how that looks how the stabilization
works and also I'm gonna shut my mouth
for a second so you can hear the
microphone quality
oh the shine so from there I want to
round things out with s-pen because
again that is ultimately what makes the
note a note it has definitely evolved a
ton over the years but there really
wasn't a huge jump in features from this
year over last year but that's not
necessarily a bad thing
smart select and screen writes are
useful as always live message while it
isn't necessarily original is actually a
lot of fun to use with a physical pen
you kind of just draw out your message
but it's nice having that extra bit of
accuracy with that physical pen you can
play it back make sure you just screw it
up and then send it off
definitely though one of my favorite
features with s-pen is the ability to
integrate that with Samsung's always-on
display if you just need to jot
something down quickly or you need to
remind yourself you don't have to go
into the phone just bust out the pen
write it down and it will stay there as
a reminder in your face
overall the Galaxy Note 8 while it's not
perfect it is a damn impressive phone if
you know what you want you want that
s-pen but you kind of been skeptical
because people have been a little too
hard on the note eight forget the haters
grab it you will enjoy it I want to give
a huge shout out to my boy Benjamin who
I met out of London super humble super
hard-working but also has a really
underrated youtube channel definitely
check them out I will link them down
below he actually helped me get a hold
of the note 8 a little bit early so this
entire video is thanks to him thank you
guys for watching this is Jonathan and
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
