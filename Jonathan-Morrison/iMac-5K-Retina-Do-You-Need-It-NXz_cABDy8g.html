you guys are doing well now I do have a
retina 5k iMac on the way but before I
get my hands on it unbox it test and
bench market I wanted to talk about why
you would possibly want a screen
resolution of this density the good the
bad and overall why I'm excited for it
so for starters 5k means it has a fifty
one twenty by twenty eight eighty
resolution so that is two times a
resolution vertically and two times
resolution horizontally of a non retina
27-inch iMac and that results in four
times the total pixels was a total
amount of fourteen point seven million
pixels now the word I want you to focus
on right now is perspective just
recently Dell announced its own 27-inch
5k monitor with a price tag of twenty
five hundred dollars the retina 5k iMac
is also twenty five hundred dollars but
it has an entire computer inside that'll
get you an Intel Core i5 3.5 gigahertz
quad-core CPU eight gigs of ram a one
terabyte fusion drive and an AMD r9 290x
GPU with two gigs of VRAM you can bump
that up to a core i7 4 gigahertz CPU
which is really going to scream for
single threaded applications the RAM
however unlike most Apple products these
days is user upgradeable up to 32
gigabytes so if you're interested in
doing it yourself and saving a little
bit of cash I'll post a link to some
kits down below now the stock one
terabyte fusion drive can be bumped up
to three terabytes or if you're all
about that speed you can configure it
with up to one terabyte of pure flash
storage
lastly the GPU can be bumped up to an
AMD r9 M 295 X with 4 gigs of VRAM now
one of the questions that I've seen
asked over and over again is what is the
big deal with this display why not go
for a cheaper 4k option Samsung and a
soos both have 4k displays that are
under $700 but the reason it's so much
cheaper is those use TN panels as
opposed to the IPS panel in this iMac
now IPS displays generally have a much
better viewing angle and color accuracy
and this is important if you're going to
use this for any video or photo work now
if you stepped up to the ac30 1.5 inch
4k display that features an eye zgo
panel which is beautiful that alone is
currently around $2,000 and that's with
a price drop so one of the other
questions that I see all the time is why
do you need that man
pixel's I am perfectly fine with my 720p
content or 1080p but you got to think
about it if you're doing photo or video
just a simple 12 megapixel photo has a
resolution of four thousand by three
thousand UHD video on the other hand has
a resolution of 3840 by 2160 so with a
5k display you could see the entire
viewer 100% and still have screen real
estate left over so for me working with
4k video that is a big deal
lastly one of the questions and comments
that I see all the time is why would you
want a screen resolution that high isn't
text going to look super tiny and pretty
much unreadable well without scaling yes
but with scaling it's a beautiful thing
and scaling is one of the main reasons
why the new iMac is 5k as opposed to 4k
the non retina 27-inch iMac again has a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 5120 by 2880
is exactly double that both ways so the
screen real estate visually it looks the
same but here's how it works for text UI
elements menus and so forth for every
one pixel of screen real estate
there are four pixels crammed into there
which results in a super crisp super
vibrant image conversely it recognizes
where a photo or video window might be
so instead of a four to one pixel ratio
it is now one to one and that's what
allows you to view that entire 4k video
window but still have text and menu
scale properly and not be the size of
ants
now as exciting as all that is I can
definitely be critical of Apple because
there was some disappointment for me one
being they completely ignored the
Thunderbolt Display I would have loved
to have a standalone version of this to
go alongside by Mac Pro but it looks
like once again Apple kind of put the
professionals or the professional market
on the back burner again and I think
they were worried that maybe that would
cannibalize some of the iMac sales so
for now that is the only option we get
the other disappointment was the fact
that this cannot be used as an external
display now we talked about some of the
prices so really the thought of using
this as a monitor and having a computer
on the side as a bonus really isn't that
crazy of a thought but as of now it is
not supported and if you were looking to
use this with your Mac Pro you are out
of luck at the end of the day though
there's a lot of good that is coming out
of this retina 5k iMac and I am super
excited to check it out there's just a
lot of really cool technology that is
happening right now one of those things
that stood out to me was the fact that
Apple said they design their own
I'm in controller or t-con so they're
driving all these pixels off a single
controller whereas some 4k displays are
actually using two just to power those
pixels so some pretty impressive
technology going on and speaking of
technology I want to give a huge thank
you to little bits for supporting the
channel and help making this video
possible
little bits is the easiest and most
extensive way to learn and prototype
with electronics by using magnetic
modules that require no wiring soldering
or coding modules range from the very
simple power sensors and LEDs so you
could do something basic like enhance an
arts and crafts project all the way to
the very complex something like wireless
modules where you could do something
crazier like a cloud-based real-time
weather dashboard in a matter of minutes
I was able to whip up this little
rotating stand for my Android guy which
could be a pretty cool little video back
piece if you want to have some fun like
this or just learn a little more about
electronics and prototyping little bits
is offering TLD fans 20 bucks off your
first kit all you got to do is go to
little bits comm and into the promo code
today when you place your order and
you'll receive 20 bucks off your first
kit plus free shipping in the US once
again the offer code is today and this
is a cool way to not only support the
channel but also getting to learn and
appreciate technology just a little bit
more aside from that thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully you enjoyed
it hopefully you have a better idea of
what the retina 5k iMac is all about if
you found it helpful
or educational definitely feel free to
hit that like button it is much
appreciated and of course in return you
get a virtual high five Acho face now as
usual if you guys have any questions
definitely drop a line down below I do
try my best to reply to as many as I can
it does get a little bit messy so the
absolute best way to get a hold of me is
on twitter at TLD today again if you
guys missed anything it'll be recapped
down in the description along with the
gear that I used to make these videos
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
