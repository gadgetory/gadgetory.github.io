TLD with my full review and unboxing in
the elgato thunderbolt SSD this is
completely portable all powered through
the center bolt cable so you don't need
any external power and as far as the box
content goes it's pretty minimum I get
the owner's manual and then the
Thunderbolt SSD itself you can see it
comes in a brushed aluminum kind of
design looks good aesthetically kind of
pleases the eye now one thing to point
out is that the Thunderbolt cable is not
included in the box II must buy that
separately that's an additional $50 you
got a dish out specifically this is the
120 gigabyte model which retails for 429
US dollars they also step up to the 240
gigabyte model which sells for 699 US
dollars so this is definitely not cheap
as far as the design goes it's built
very well feels extremely solid but
however as far as the ins and the outs
it's very limited there's only one
Thunderbolt port which is a little bit
of a drawback to me because you cannot
daisy chain anything and also I would
have liked to see maybe a firewire or
USB 2.0 port just in case if you're onto
old Mac you want to transfer some
information that doesn't have a
thunderbolt port so we're going to break
this down into the pros and to the cons
and see if this thing is worth the money
we'll start out with the pros it is
completely bus powered so if you're
looking for a mobile solution you're not
gonna need any external power everything
is coming through the Thunderbolt cable
also it is completely silent being that
it's a solid-state drive inside there
are no moving parts therefore you have
no annoying loud hard drive noise now as
far as the speeds go this is kind of
where it draws into that negative area
for me they advertise at about 270
megabytes per second as you guys can see
from the test results it gets pretty
close to that so we're about to 60 to 50
varies from time to time but they do get
as advertised now my problem with this
is it's nowhere near what we could see
with Thunderbolt technology now here we
look at a 2 gigabyte file transfer one
on a firewire 800 Drive and one on the
Thunderbolt SSD drive you can see
obviously the SSD is much faster
and finally the firewire drive is done
so you might think that's pretty
impressive but upon opening this up
something kind of pissed me off there
are four screws one of them was a little
hard to get off they really don't want
you to open this up I'll tell you why in
a second but much my disapproval upon
opening up there is an old generation
stated to SSD now Thunderbolt is
completely capable of speeds much much
higher than this so they could have
easily used a SATA 3 SSD that's going to
get speeds anywhere from the ballpark of
around 500 megabytes a second but they
kind of cheaped out and use old
generation technology you can buy this
SSD by itself for about 130 bucks
depending on the price so essentially
because also the cables not included
you're paying about $300 for a little
aluminum enclosure which isn't really
cool my opinion it is silent it is bus
powered it does perform as advertised
but I don't think for the money it is
absolutely worth it unless you
absolutely need a portable bus powered
SSD I would hold off on this right now
wait for more to come out in the future
wait for an enclosure because when the
actual enclosures come out you can buy
your own SSD much faster than this not
worry about opening it up voiding your
warranty that was what I was talking
about earlier because you can see this
nice little message right here pretty
much saying by the way now that you
opened up your so again I couldn't
honestly recommend this for the price
hopefully you guys enjoyed the honest
review if your film lock being awesome
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
feel free to subscribe if you have not
already make sure to check out our
previous video and I will catch you guys
later
