2017 office tour so by far one of the
biggest changes from the last office
tour was crazy enough with two years ago
is the giant wall behind me back then it
was empty pure white it could be a
little intimidating and overwhelming
because of how massive it looked but
since then we painted this really nice
dark gray color which I love because it
absorbs pretty much any color you throw
at it so this right here is kind of
become the product table where we shoot
a lot of the b-roll for the videos got a
couple of target lamps in the back here
although there are some very similar
ones on Amazon in case you're looking
for a style like this now as far as the
landscape I'm sure by now you've seen
them in many of my videos they're both
for Commons this is technically the
newer model whereas the white one it's
got that classic toy store it picks our
action but I really like the contrast
the black and the white and then like I
was talking about the gray well really
absorbs the color so I've got a couple
of cue bulbs in each of these splash up
against the wall pair that with a light
strip you got a really cool-looking
combo now one of the things I've been
wanting to do forever it's outfit this
entire space with Phillips here I can
now say we have successfully done that
so giant shout out to Phil's for
sponsoring its office tour and making
that a reality so instantly through
voice you can turn every single light in
this place off turn off all the lights I
really like Google home because it is
super responsive at changing color turn
all the lights purple
and then lastly the Amazon echo works
fantastic if you want to instantly
change scene turn on savanna sunset
downstairs now Justin back over here
you're probably wondering what this
crazy setup is and it's actually a
custom Xbox console that was built by
Chris over at four-eyes furniture we've
kind of turned it into this little
product showcase area with that classic
circle led a really awesome sounding
speaker from name this is actually
custom right here we got a crispy AF and
a TLD logo huge shout-out to Dan and
Lincoln over at what's inside we got
that cut and half golf ball action and
then this is the giant Xbox one
collection so if you want to see more of
that mr. Kevin Kamps and just did this
crazy ultimate Xbox setup that I'll link
to here and also down below move it
along this is my desk right here and the
one thing you notice that I wanted to
keep things kind of uniform so we've
used the IKEA OPA Bey and I'm probably
slaughtering that name across all of our
desks here these are some of my favorite
looking tops I've always really liked
the glossy look from Ikea so these are a
little bigger a little wider give you a
little more room to play with then that
pair with the legs which are actually
technically a dark brown looks super
classy back at it again is mr. Toy Story
Pixar lamp from Tommen's little Homer
Buddha I'm not sure if he's still
available but I will link him along with
everything if I can find it down below
now recently I've got a ton of questions
on what speakers do I use and these
right here are the atom artists reason
by far they are my favorite sounding
pair speakers they are incredible kind
of got a little hack here going in the
sense that these are actually audio
engine speaker stands but they work
really well with the atom my mouth of
choice right now is the Logitech MX
master pair with a wireless apple
bluetooth keyboard that is being powered
by 2016 MacBook Pro straight into an LG
ultra flying 5k display I talked about
it a little bit in my latest what's my
bag video but this has been my set up
I'm not using an iMac I'm not using a
Mac Pro this is my desktop when I'm here
and then I just take the MacBook and go
when I'm on the road now the other
uniform thing you'll see across the
office are the chairs these are the sail
by Herman Miller
kind of got that white and gray look
that looks really clean I think matches
the aesthetic of the wall of the white
desk they're also extremely comfortable
really like the looks of this mesh back
right here what's awesome Aziz you can
pretty much customize them any way you
want down to the color the legs the feet
and I know it might seem crazy to invest
any sort of money into a chair but if
this is something you do on a day to day
basis where you're sitting down for long
periods of time then it's not that crazy
moving this way again along with the
tables the chairs we have 5k monitors
across the board so here at Ralphie's
desk we got that lamp macbook product in
Ralphie's weapon of choice right now is
the sony a6000 which is arguably the
best 4k youtube camera out right now
this is also a secret weapon the rode
videomicro which is hard to beat for the
price over here we got a little Lego
action and if you ever watch the Ralph's
these Legos videos they are really
really good you should go check them out
curiosity box by Vsauce shout out to
Jake I Love You Man so moving over here
this is kind of become like video gear
world we got C stands and sliders and
monitors a crazy sky panel I know some
of this gear might be a little
intimidating and overwhelming honestly
it's more the stuff we use for the
higher end and crazy production stuff
but really most of the time these airy
look asters will we end up using you
could do some crazy good stuff with just
a single LED bounce like this and that's
honestly what I use for most of my
talking head stuff that you guys have
seen in recent videos so it's safe to
say as we've done a little further into
this video world we've finally upgraded
some gear for the longest time honestly
we use Home Depot lights for like I'd
say three or four years so don't feel
intimidated if you see any of this crazy
stuff because you can do some really
spectacular stuff with budget gear
closing it up over here this is a mr.
Matt as we recorded right now I saw the
sweet transition you're ready for it
BAM so if that's not enough to entertain
you and maybe pique your interest you
should probably go watch that video
while the truck outside here interrupts
me
dekes why these blood you screwed me
again $200 a change a hard drive how do
you sleep at night
so close on Matt's desk is very similar
to mine in the sense we got the Pegasus
you've got those atom artists threes
which are phenomenal and then again here
just closing out the matching desk set
we've got the lgo supplying 5k display
ready to go at any given time to dock a
MacBook Pro into now before we move on
shout out to dude perfect for making us
waste to many many hours shoot baskets
are not making videos also before I
forget you guys yell at me those Disney
posters found those on Etsy printed them
at Costco where did the canvas to frame
everything not sure if they're still
available but if they are I will link
them down below move it over to the IKEA
case of doom this is actually meant to
be a closet we've turned it into a gear
container we've actually had this for a
couple years now
that's a lot of batteries on the flip
side actually I want to know what too
many of the USB cables looks like we got
rat's nest we've kind of got it
organized under a lightning micro USB
USB C Thunderbolt three lenses galore
and then this mess and this match has
kind of become like a tech under 50 2500
kind of testing area where I'll just go
on these Amazon rabbit holes and add
many many many things to my car order
them test them out to see if they make a
video and that's kind of where they live
a Maui in my mouth continue it along
this is some kitchen stuff not really
anything that interesting water tacit
eating cookie no pears unfortunately
this here is kind of like a little
entertainment get around together watch
some YouTube video Center home to the
Google home couple Xbox controller with
TV another really awesome speaker for
name in the Amazon echo right here now
this guy right here is actually from
Ikea needed
mainly useful in terms of being like a
gear cart so we've got this power
extension kind of mounted here so that's
not going anywhere this is probably my
favorite extension cable from blue
lounge because it's blue really easy to
see and not miss in the massive amounts
of red action cable and it's a magnet
so Jesse would approve and that's about
it now if we go over here if you don't
have a motion sensor in your life you
should because that is honestly one of
the coolest things we've done here it's
not that important or not cool right now
but when it's nice and there are no
lights in here and you walk by it's the
best so as far as upstairs this is kind
of become the entertainment center of
sorts back in the day that used to be
actually my desk and speaker set up but
since then we kind of went with a
similar theme as we did downstairs with
that dark gray wall say hello to rich
and the ice lengths as far as the TV
goes we got that beautiful curved OLED
from LG tons of consoles this has kind
of become the game memorabilia area
Virtual Boy holy crap
here's actually one of my favorite
pieces that I've used in a few different
time-lapse shots the Mario Brothers and
duck hunt clocks really really cool and
shut up to the Bulls who are back and
forth this year last but not least we
got this halo needler action this is
also part of the ultimate xbox setup so
don't normally have this around you can
check out why we got it in that video
also you might notice there's a closet
back there that is just boxes and core
nerve projects no we man we can't show
them that they'll never come out of it
alive
