twelve days of top five and this time
we're hitting under 25 bucks so what
kind of tech can you pick up on a budget
let's find out what's up guys Jonathan
here with TLD hope you guys are doing
well it is nice and cold and rainy
outside but we're kicking out the list
with the alkie 4 port USB 3.0 hub which
has become a staple in my backpack this
guy is super compact lightweight and
gives you plenty of extra USB 3 ports on
the go or even for most desks I use this
with my macbook pro on the road to take
advantage of extra ports and get that
USB 3 speed it's also PC and Mac
compatible but it definitely matches the
look of a macbook pro MacBook Air Mac
Mini or even iMac with a beautiful
aluminum finish now the best thing about
this is it sells for under 20 bucks and
it's linked down below so not everyone
likes Apple earpods or stock headphones
for that matter so I get questions all
the time asking what's a good set of
alternatives that's not gonna break the
bank these are the smile Jamaica in-ear
headphones from house of marlin they
come in four different colors fire
midnight mint and Rasta they have a
built in one button remote and mic and
hit the market at under 25 bucks what I
think about these is the fact that the
cable is wrapped in a braided fabric so
not only does it look unique but it also
helps to minimize court angle because
ain't nobody got time for that they also
use recycled aluminum and packaging so
not only will your ears be happy you can
feel good about minimizing waste on our
planet if you guys want to check out the
different colors and availability that
of course will be linked down in the
description so I think for as far as
smartphones have come and advanced in
terms of technology I think the one
thing that's been lacking is definitely
battery so one thing I always keep with
me is a nice beefy external battery this
monster is from omakr and it is a
massive 10,000 milliamp hours power for
days the beauty with these is that they
aren't phone specific so you bring the
cable you got the power so right now
this is on sale for under 25 bucks
obviously pricing does fluctuate from
time to time so for the most up to date
price to make sure you guys check out
the link below but if this happens to
sell out or go up in price I will find a
comparable model and place it down in
the description so you want a Bluetooth
speaker but you don't want to spend a
lot I got you covered with a super sweet
super
portable one from amazonbasics this
little guy comes in black blue red white
and gray it features a 3 watt speaker
it's not stereos to keep that in mind
but it is surprisingly loud for its size
it only weighs a quarter of a pound and
is 85 millimeters in diameter so it's
not going to take up much space and fit
super easily into your bag and the top
things off it comes with a nifty little
carrying bag a USB cable so you can
charge the bad boy up so if you own a
13-inch MacBook Pro or know someone who
does this sling from initech makes a
sweet gift and it's under 20 bucks it'll
also work with both the 13 and 11 inch
MacBook Air and most 11 inch ultrabooks
it features a super soft felt outside
that feels great against your face and
it also protects your laptop pretty well
too there's a main compartment for your
computer a second port tablet or even
books and there's two more back pockets
so you can throw in your headphones and
small gadgets so that wraps up this top
5 every single product feature will be
linked down below and definitely hit
that like button if you want to see the
next one
and also let me know what price range
you guys want to see now if this looks
different to you I'm actually out here
in New York City shooting some of these
with the verso huge shout out to them if
you guys have not checked them out I'll
link them below and also annotate it
somewhere around my face if you guys
want to click there so thank you guys
very much for watching I'll see you guys
with the next top 5 again this is
Jonathan with TLD and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
