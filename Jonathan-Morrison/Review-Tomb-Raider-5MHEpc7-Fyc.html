bringing you our review of the new tomb
raider now prequels and reboots have
been a really big running theme this
year and tomb raider is no exception as
actually running just a little bit of
both while the lara we play in this game
is considered to be the same one as in
the original series this game takes
place a number of years beforehand
featuring a younger much less
experienced main character who's forced
to learn all the skills she'll need on
the spot in order to survive all the
ordeals presented in the game now this
concept is a little misleading because
while at first the game does give you
some survival tones and there's a
constant feeling of always being injured
and having to survive different
catastrophes there really isn't a whole
lot in terms of actual survival game
mechanics this game is a lot more in
common with more action platformer
titles like uncharted than with more
survival oriented mechanics the basic
idea for the plotline in this one is
that laura is still studying in college
goes on a trip with friends and a
professor to try and find a lost island
off the coast of japan hit some heavy
storms and is now stuck on that same
mystical Island supposedly unlivable and
filled with a bunch of mad men trying to
kill both her and her friends the game
has you playing as Lara exploring the
island in a linear fashion collecting
weapons and gadgets to fight off your
enemies and make Island exploration
easier all while avoiding numerous
dangers and surprisingly gruesome deaths
that really help to turn up the grim
tone of your situation the Lara does
seem to have an odd pension to shake off
injuries that would normally be more
permanent like walking off a bear trap
as you've survived challenges and kill
enemies Lara gains experience and
salvage that can improve our combat and
exploration abilities as well as upgrade
her weapons for more damage accuracy
less recoil and occasionally special
options like first fire or zooming one
thing I have to congratulate this game
on is having actual platforming
challenges there's been a lot of games
in recent years that claim to be 3d
platformers but really don't do much
outside of just having to climb a wall
or take a really indirect route to get
through a level Tomb Raider on the other
hand has moments where you're really not
sure where to head to next to properly
navigate and will require some degree of
puzzle solving and timing to properly
get across large chasms or ancient ruins
that are falling apart where this really
shows is in the game side tombs minisite
quests that require Lara to properly
time different platforming mechanics in
order to seize the tombs treasure they
did a great job of adding actual
platforming challenges to the game that
they were also entirely too short only
having
a single room and puzzle apiece I can't
help but feel one of the biggest things
this game missed out on design-wise was
having far more complex side bedrooms
like these to really add to its overall
time and challenge factor alongside the
platforming the game's main form of
action is in the form of a third-person
shooter having Lara switch between four
different weapons a bow pistol assault
rifle and shotgun combat is fast paced
if i'll be at a little unrealistic in
terms of how quickly Lara becomes an
expert killer and just how many bad guys
can be stuck on an island that needs
doing outside of outright gunning
enemies down laura has a number of other
options including stealth attacks melee
strikes and dodge counters for tougher
enemies one thing that I really liked
about the game's combat is just the
little details they added to it
especially enemy dialogue which ranges
from giving tactical knowledge to Lara
or just being downright hilarious like
cursing and responds to you giving your
first assault rifle the campaign is
fairly well balanced between both its
action and exploration segments but it's
only really huge weakness being the fact
that its overall way too short even when
you attempt to get one hundred percent
completion in the game by finding all
the little different collectibles and
completing all the side tombs the game
still only has about 12 hours max to
offer which isn't terribly short but
it's short enough to make you feel
wanting in the end especially
considering the pacing of the game now
the one huge glaring flaw in this game
and one that is partly responsible for
its overall lack of content in the
single-player game is the fact that
multiplayer is even a thing in this
title basically take the game
single-player combat segments tack on a
class customization system and throw
yourself into matches with not very
well-balanced combat mechanics or level
design there's a few interesting ideas
here like ziplines and less direct
routes with platforming segments but
overall the experience is just awkward
and feels uninteresting especially after
coming down from the single-player game
if anything playing it just makes you
think of how much time and resources
could have been spent on adding more
content to single-player it is hopefully
a lesson they will learn we're working
on a sequel personally I've just gotten
really tired of games adding multiplayer
segments out of some kind of sense they
have to in order to boost sales only to
see the single-player modes
result it's happened before and some
series have learned from this mistake
already like dead space 3 and bioshock
infinite the wave yet to see how
bioshock single player turns out point
being multiplayer should never be added
simply because there's a demographic for
it especially in the case of shooters
where there's so many out there now that
many tacked on once filled just
unoriginal or an interesting compared to
alternative choices the problem with
adding attacked on multiplayer mode
aside the single-player campaign does
offer an excellent 3d action platformer
which not only has actual platforming
mechanics but also a solid combat system
and an interesting albeit short story
line while multiplayer was completely
unnecessary in the game sense of physics
is just a bit off at times it's not
enough to sour the overall experience
and I have to say that while I was a bit
skeptical but how much I'd like the game
when I first started it it wasn't way
over in the end and I was hooked the
entire time I played the single-player
campaign well that's our review of Tomb
