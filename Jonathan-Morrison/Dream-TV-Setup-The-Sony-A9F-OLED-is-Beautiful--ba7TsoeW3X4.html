- Yes.
- The TV's much bigger than you think.
It's very very big.
- Utah in the house.
(funky techno music)
- Yo guys, Jonathan here
for those who caught the
most recent office tour,
in that space is this giant, beautiful,
85-inch monster TV from Sony,
which honestly has been
the only TV big enough
to fill that wall.
I could not be happier with it.
So when Sony asked me
if I wanted to check out
this beauty behind me,
their 65-inch A9F Master
Series 4K OLED TV,
I was like,
&quot;Uh yeah!&quot;
For me, not only am I a tech nerd,
I'm a cinematography nerd, an audio nerd,
and I would even say an aesthetic nerd
because oftentimes it is
form over function for me.
But with this it's kind of like this
ultimate sanmmich of
awesome that checks off
every single box.
Now if you've never seen
an OLED TV in person,
it will change and
potentially ruin your life
because nothing else after
that will ever look as good.
This thing is packing
4K HDRs, IMAX Enhanced,
but the secret sauce,
and my friends, this is some tasty sauce,
is their X1 Ultimate processor
which works in conjunction
with that beautiful panel
does a ton of complex
things in the backgrounds
that you would never wanna think about
and in turn delivers next level visuals.
From there, if you are a
Netflix fiend like myself,
this TV might have just
become your best friend.
Not only is it Netflix-recommended,
it has a Netflix calibrated
mode exclusive to Sony,
which allows you to see what
creators of that show or TV
wanted you to see.
Master of None is not only
one of my favorite
Netflix shows of all time,
but one of my favorite
shows just like period.
So I was really excited
to check that on this TV,
and when I flipped on that
Netflix calibrated switch,
I noticed an immediate difference.
It is such a beautifully shot show.
From the composition to the colors,
it's just super rich, super warm.
And I noticed without that
super calibrated switch on,
it tended to shift a little
cooler, a little blue.
So when I popped that magic button,
everything just felt way
more organic and natural.
On top of that,
Sony makes the industry standard
monitors for TV and film.
In fact, one of the best
investments I have ever made,
is this Sony Trimaster
monitor in front of me.
I saw it on set one time, and fell in love
because nothing else I've
ever seen has come close.
So when film and TV is
not only being monitored
through something like a Trimaster,
but then mastered on some crazy
high-end Sony production monitor,
it only makes sense that
they are going to be the ones
to trickle that down to a TV.
So picture quality is phenomenal,
but could we please talk
about the aesthetic?
Because it is ridiculous.
It kind of looks like it is
coming out of the media console,
which is both crazy and awesome
because it allows you to get
immersed into the content
and the way that's possible
is this genius kickstand
built into the back.
Not only does it allow
you to prop your TV up,
like a badass,
there is built-in cable management.
Are you kidding me?
If more things in life came
with built-in cable management,
it would be a better place.
Cables, you are not my friend.
I'm sorry.
It's one thing if you
have a beautiful image,
but if your setup is not
equally as beautiful,
it's kind of a sad thing.
Fortunately though, we
got both kinds of happy.
What absolutely blew my mind
more than the image quality,
more than the aesthetics, how clean it is,
is the sound quality.
This thing slaps.
I feel like there have
been many TV manufacturers
that claim you don't need a sound bar.
And I'm not gonna lie,
they might be right.
If you weren't sold by now,
there's also built-in
Chromcast, built-in Android TV
so you have this super
clean intuitive interface
and on top of that there
is also Alexa integration.
So if you wanna channel your
inner Tony Stark and be like
&quot;Yo, Jarvis turn that volume
up, make it slap a little more&quot;
you can do that as well.
All and all, this TV is
packin image quality,
audio quality, aesthetic quality,
just sauce, on sauce, on sauce, on sauce!
Hopefully you guys enjoyed the video.
If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome,
make sure you guys slap that like button.
Definitely check out the
Sony A9F Master Series TV

This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later.
