because I got a chance to spend the last
couple of days with the brand-new DJI
Mavic Pro and so far this may be the
coolest drone I've ever used
so without a doubt the most appealing
the most attractive and by far the most
interesting thing about this is its size
it's super compact and honestly when
folded up it is not much bigger than an
iPhone 7 plus which is kind of
ridiculous when you put it into
perspective it only weighs about 1.6
pounds and that combined with its small
footprint makes it perfect for taking it
on the go or traveling you're easily
able to fit this into a bag or a
backpack and while I probably wouldn't
recommend this if you wanted to you
could sandwich it in your pocket
well this yeah this is my package now
from there what is also awesome is the
fact that the setup process is crazy
simple so the way it works when
everything is fully compact and tucked
away all you got to do is extend each of
its four legs to on the top and then two
on the bottom and if you look closely
there's a little plastic cover over the
camera this is simply there for
protection when you're traveling and
taking this back and forth so if you're
going to record anything make sure you
take it off now as far as the camera the
gimbal and the camera body are
physically smaller and more compact but
the sensor is the exact same as a
phantom form you're still getting 4k
video at 24 and 30 frames per second now
if you've been on the internet lately
there's been a little controversy of the
video quality on the amount of acro
maybe isn't so crispy and before I touch
upon that first I want to talk about the
brand new remote control which in a way
directly affects the video quality that
may seem strange and weird but in a
minute everything will make sense so
just like the Maverick pro the
controller is now smaller and more
compact the thumbsticks are detachable
which is a super nice touch it allows
you to easily fit this into your pocket
and while there is a standard USB port
to connect your phone what is killer
about this is there is now a built-in
lightning port so you can connect
cleanly with no cables anywhere there's
a really nice blend of information
between the controller itself and your
phone and what's really nice is the
controller will display any errors
before you're flying so in this case you
can see there is a problem with the SD
card so in this case instead of flying
the drone and thinking you recording
video only to find out there was a
problem later with the SD card we are
easily able to see it first and address
that problem before taking off now
jumping back to the Maverick Pro for a
second if you look closely there is a
tiny switch that'll let you go back and
forth between RC and Wi-Fi mode and what
that does is allows you to fly the
Maverick pro with only your phone and no
remote control regardless though whether
using the phone by itself or with the
control or the single most important
thing to remember
for flying or recording is that there is
now tapped to focus so this is actually
brand new and something we hadn't seen
before DJI it's very similar to how you
pull focus on a smartphone camera which
was the idea behind it the problem is
those if you don't tap the focus
nothing will be in focus so in my
experience the footage has looked really
really good I will definitely say it is
not as sharp as the phantom 4 but almost
in a good way for me personally the
footage from a phantom 4 was very
similar to what Samsung cameras do to
photos the video they're very saturated
in almost over sharp which may be a good
thing depending on your preference but
in my case I like having the flexibility
of being able to tweak that in post I
also got a chance to really push the
camera in two completely different
situations this footage right here was
right around 1:00 p.m. with the Sun
beaming down as bright as it possibly
could be in Southern California normally
you would definitely want an ND with
this much light but you can see the
camera actually holds up really well on
a maverick Pro also the footage you're
looking at here is untouched unaltered
straight out of the Maverick Pro camera
this is the stock picture profile which
you get right out of the box I did go
ahead and get a chance to mess with D
log mode so you can see this is
completely ungraded superflat and then
from here you can see the difference
adding a grade on top now opposite of
the footage in the blistering bright Sun
this was about 15 minutes after sundown
there was a little bit of light left but
not much and you can definitely see some
noise because we were really pushing
this with light but overall I thought
the footage looked awesome and the
stabilization was fantastic so up to 48
hours consider me impressed hopefully
enjoy the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure you
like move it move it or knock back
button if you guys want to be featured
in a video just like this make sure you
add me on snapchat and just look out for
the next time I ask you to send me a
snap this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
