TLD and I got the unboxing to the
samsung galaxy s2 this is the AT&amp;amp;T US
retail version for those you guys that
saw the international unboxing yesterday
this actually isn't mine I borrowed it
so I can compare to this guy so for now
get out of here and this is the main
attraction the galaxy s2 for AT&amp;amp;T so
wouldn't pop the top no knife needed
first thing you see right out of the box
is driving and texting it can wait not a
poser that's so we're going to slide
that out I'm go to the comparison in a
second but here's the phone and I'll go
and look at the accessories first so
slide that out get a little landscape
mode going on so here's our Quick Start
Guide BAM next up we have the battery
next up we have the USB wall charger
adapter now this is a little different
from the international version they
actually gave you a whole USB cable plus
a USB wall charger connected and this
actually comes separate so you actually
plug this in so not a huge deal but just
thought I'd point that out so let's go
into the magic of video jump inside it
up and we'll compare the two so we're
all powered up on the AT&amp;amp;T version first
thing you notice is a little bit
different of a home wallpaper than the
international version and more
noticeably down here you actually have
four touch buttons as opposed to the one
physical button in the middle let me
pull it over see you guys can see so you
have the one physical home button right
there with the two touches on the left
and the right this actually has four
touch buttons all the way across the
board so there is no physical button
other than that it's the same 4.3 inch
display you got the same front-facing
camera same a megapixel camera on the
back going to get that for you guys bam
bam now on the AT&amp;amp;T version it says
galaxy s2 on the backplate whereas the
international version it does not and
there is no Samsung down here so it's a
little bit different but overall they're
pretty much the same phone minus a few
tweaks so I wanted to bring you this a
lot of you guys had some questions I was
able to use this on AT&amp;amp;T no problem but
I'm going to set this up now that I have
the US retail AT&amp;amp;T version so it's just
been the quick unboxing I'm going to go
ahead and test up security flaw right
now so stay tuned for that video as well
as some pictures and some photos other
than that make sure to check out our
latest
Gears of War 3 it's the full review feel
free to subscribe and I will catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
