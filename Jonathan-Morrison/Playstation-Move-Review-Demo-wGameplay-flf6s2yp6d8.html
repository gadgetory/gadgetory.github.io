with TLD reviewing the brand new
playstation move this just came out a
couple days ago this retails for 59 99
for the wireless motion controller or
the ping pong ball whatever you want to
call it now you guys can take a look get
a field has most of the familiar
PlayStation controls with a new one for
the controller itself this is the eye
camera which retails for 39 99 you will
need this to run in addition with the
motion controller you guys can see it
hops onto the top of your TV and it's
what's used to track the device as well
as calibrate your unit now you can buy
this in a $99 bundle package which comes
with the wireless motion controller the
eye camera a demo disc and sports
champions game which is essentially free
if you were to buy everything separately
now as far as what comes on a disc you
get Tiger Woods PGA Tour demo TV
superstars time crisis and a few other
games to try out to see if you guys like
those now this is one additional
accessory that you don't have to buy but
you will need it if you want to play
games like resident evil I'm sure
there's a lot more games that will need
this as far as support goes for the
future that retails for 29 bucks this is
what the motion controller looks like
all lit up and pretty like nominal walk
you guys through some gameplay and
besides tech review and I'm also a pro
table tennis master obviously not you
guys can see from the the footage it
takes a little bit getting used to but
one thing I want to point out is from my
experience right away with a stock wii
controller it's a lot more responsive
it's a lot more fluid even though you
guys want to make fun of the little ping
pong ball up top the glowing purple
stick it works well and it cracks will
now I've heard a lot of posts and been
reading a lot of comments of how play
station is copying we and essentially
that's true they're taking that idea
they see that we is doing well so they
want to capitalize on that so if you
have a wii right now I wouldn't
necessarily say you have to go out and
buy a Playstation and by the PlayStation
Move I say this is a good buy for those
of you that already own a PlayStation
maybe you were considering buying a wii
but you really didn't want to drop to
300 bucks with the system and the games
so if you like i said if you only have a
PlayStation you have a family you have
kids this is a good little $99 package
that you can pick up and add to your
PlayStation so this is another game this
is the archery game off to sports
champions disc and this is a really good
example you guys can see how well the
actual device tracks you have to reach
behind your shoulder to pull the arrow
out so it's like I said it's all fluid
smooth you're shooting watermelon
shooting money so I don't know how you
could not have fun but I want to
reiterate if you guys have a Playstation
and you're thinking about buying a wii
this is probably the better purchase and
if you have a week don't go out and buy
this I don't think you're gonna really
miss on too much but all in all the
units nice I hope you guys enjoyed this
review go ahead and check out some of
the other PlayStation Move videos and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
