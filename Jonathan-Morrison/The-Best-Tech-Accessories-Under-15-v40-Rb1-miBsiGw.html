under-15 is rare but get ready get
excited because it is time for a fresh
episode of some of the best tech on a
budget now for starters there is a ton
of cheap tech out there some of its good
some of its bad some of its terrible so
with that my goal is to sift through the
sea of it and find things that are cool
useful or hopefully both so kicking off
the list is the luna mobile nightlight
and for sure this is no question on the
novelty side of things but how many
times we've been in a situation where
you're looking for an expensive gift for
someone and deep down you know it's not
that cool but you get it anyways I
guarantee you if you give someone this 9
times out of 10 they will genuinely
think it's cool so what this is is a
tiny hard plastic shaped transparent
lamp that attaches to the end of your
phone line it up with the flash not the
camera and once you engage flashlight
mode on your phone now you have a
miniature working lamp again this is not
something you're gonna use all the time
or as an actual lamp I don't expect
anybody out there to buy this and cozy
up with a book next to it but it looks
great it works as advertised more
importantly it has the effect following
that we're taking a look at some good
old fashioned ball action and for you
perverts out there these are cleaning
balls so these actually come in a pack
of three you get one large one small and
then one more small with a keychain
attachment now it's right with these is
there are two sides to them which in
turn makes them dual function there's a
terrycloth aisle which is meant to be
used on finger prints and nasty grimy
grease and then on the flip side there's
a microfiber portion which is geared for
smudges dirt and nailing down that
squeaky clean finish what's also a nice
touch is the little rubber ring around
these guys which gives you a nice grip
and honestly more control in a cloth so
really for under 15 bucks this is a
killer way to keep your tech and your
gadgets clean plus if you shoot video
you can also juggle these while you wait
for your video to render rekt now
following that are the cable band cable
ties not only are these under 15 bucks
right now they are under 10 plus just
like the cleaning balls they also come
in a pack of three
what's unique with these is they're
actually handmade which is not something
you'd normally expect with a cable tie
most of them are masked
Douce generic kind of boring and this
gives you a little bit of character and
flavor what's especially awesome with
these guys is the flexibility because
that allows it to adapt to a ton of
different cables and power adapters so
you can see these work extremely well
and it's also nice to have different
designs because that allows you to
easily decide for the different tech and
gadgets in your bag or on your desk
following that we're jumping back on the
cleaning train because it is very
important to care for and take care of
your tech and this is perfect for those
who take pictures and shoot video so
this is the lens pen and what it is it's
a really handy inexpensive tool that
allows you to clean your lenses there's
a retractable brush on one side which is
great for things like hair and dust and
then a cloth tip on the other side which
is going to help you get out those
fingerprints now this doesn't mean you
can be reckless you're not going to go
eat some fries and grease up your lens
you always want to take care of it but
in those situations where you do get it
dirty or you get a fingerprint on there
this is going to help you get it out
without damaging the lens alternatively
the brush works great for things like
keyboards or things around your desk but
on top of that the cloth end actually
works great for a camera that most of us
carry with us our smart phones so last
up is the herbal charger yes Urbo
charger and not turbo charger what this
is a tiny little keychain micro USB
cable now this comes in four colors red
pink green and blue they're ten bucks a
pop or you can buy a 4-pack for 30 bucks
which is perfect for you tech under 50
fans what's especially useful with this
is even though it's intended to be used
as a keychain there is no keychain on it
it's magnetic so that is how it attaches
to your keyring its tangle free it looks
killer it's a really inexpensive way to
always ensure you have a cable and in
turn a card with you aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
and hopefully enjoy the video if you did
and you want to see more make sure to
smash that like button if you're still
craving it and you want more of that
budget tech I got a ton more where that
