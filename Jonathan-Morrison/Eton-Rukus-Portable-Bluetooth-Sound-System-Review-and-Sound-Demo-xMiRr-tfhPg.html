review of the eat on ruckus portable
bluetooth sound system and with being
bluetooth that equals compatibility so
whether running an iPhone iPod Touch
iPad or the latest Android device you'll
be able to wirelessly stream your music
no problem now if you happen to have a
device that does not have bluetooth for
example there is also an auxilary input
which you can use for a wired connection
it's a very simple design it only weighs
about 4 pounds and that combined with
the built-in handle make it awesome for
portability now it either runs on AC
power which is included or six double-a
batteries which may or may not be a good
thing depending on the person some
people like the fact that you don't have
to worry about charging it you just want
instant power poppin batteries you're
good to go on the other hand some people
hate wasting money on batteries so that
is the case they also do offer a ruckus
solar model which I'll have a link to
down below so that's not a big deal to
you that's really the only drawback I
could find that might be an issue to
some people so just take that into
consideration now the next question is
how does it sound because ultimately
that will make or break whether or not
you want to buy it obviously the best
way to do that is to listen to an in
person but that's not always the case
maybe the store doesn't have it that's
close to you or obviously you can't
listen to it an online store so I'll
give you the next best thing so I'm
using a zoom h1 high quality stereo
recorder which in turn will capture the
stereo sound we're gonna start with a
reference point being the iPhone so you
have something to compare it to and then
I'll kick it in to the Etan so you guys
can compare the difference
so there you go hopefully that gave you
more or less of an idea of how it sounds
to me I was actually surprised with the
amount of sound it puts out for being so
small so it is an awesome portable sound
system battery life has been awesome so
far it actually has an intelligent
feature where if it's not being used for
10 minutes it'll shut itself down so
I'll have a link to both this and the
rock is solar down in the description if
you guys enjoyed this video and you're
feeling like being awesome make sure
that that like button aside from that if
you're new to the channel you stumbled
across this video for the first time
make sure to subscribe so you don't miss
any future tech videos if you happen to
miss my latest video I unbox the galaxy
s3 which made a small cameo in this
video and aside from that I will see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
