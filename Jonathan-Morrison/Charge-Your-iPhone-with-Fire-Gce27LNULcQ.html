♫ Don't play with fire
♫ Only you can prevent wildfires
♫ Fire! ♫
- [Voiceover] So what's up, guys?
Jonathan here and this is the FlameStower
which will use fire to
charge your electronics.
Whether it's a camera, external battery,
or in this case, a phone, where I'm using
the iPhone 6s plus to test it out.
It's a fairly simple design,
which is geared to be
both lightweight and
portable, which in turn
will minimize the bulk
you're bringing with you.
And the idea here is maybe
you're on a camping trip
your external battery
died, or a bear ate it.
Now, you're able to generate a charge
without relying on electricity
or potentially even solar power
because those clouds come
out, the sun goes down,
you're screwed.
Now this is geared to work
with multiple types of heat,
whether it's the stove in your kitchen,
a portable camp stove,
or in this case, a fire,
which now that we have going,
let's see if it actually works
- And it looks like we are in business.
The little LED indicator has lit green,
which means we should
be ready for a charge.
What's happening here is
the blade is hot enough
where its transferring the
thermal energy to the generator.
That's working in unison
with the reservoir filled with water
and the opposing temperatures are actually
what is creating that charge,
which should hopefully work right now.
Plug in the USB cable.
It is hot down here.
Kids, be safe with fire.
It works!
It works!
It works!
- [Voiceover] Now this is not going to
output a fast charge whatsoever.
It's supposed to be equivalent to
charging your device on a laptop.
But again, the idea here
is if you're going camping
you're gonna be there for a while,
and you're probably not in a rush.
So for fun, let's see how much
of a charge we can generate
while making some s'mores.
- No, man, haven't you
ever watched The Sandlot?
First, take the graham,
then you stick the
chocolate on the graham,
then you flame the mallow.
- Ah, Austin thought it was right.
&quot;Oh, you're gonna stick
the chocolate in the fire?&quot;
Take it out!
- There you go.
Blow on it.
(loudly puffing)
Dude, you gotta get the melty insides!
- That is the melty insides, man.
- How to not make a
s'more with Austin Evans.
- Austin, you're gonna chew like a mother.
- On your marks,
get set,
go!
- Bon appetit!
- I think Austin's
gonna win this one, man.
You done?
- Ahhhh!
- Ralphy wins.
- Ah, got it.
- More importantly,
- Never open your mouth
like that again, Austin.
- Now we gotta see if there
was any charge to the phone.
(bleep) there was no charge.
(slowed-down laughing)
Quick update, we've jumped up 1%
And this is not going to be intended
for a fast-charging device.
The fact that it works at all with fire
is kind of awesome.
And really, the idea here is that
you're gonna be out there for a long time
making chili, making s'mores,
- Making Colin Moriarty.
- Making Colin Moriarty.
And while you're out
there for a long time,
your phone is slowly, but
surely getting some juice.
So, in cases where maybe
your battery pack is dead,
you went for a long camping trip,
you're out there for
two, three, four, five,
six maybe seven days,
the fact that you can actually juice up,
and it's not going to be
limited to just your iPhone,
it's gonna work with any
phone, any camera, GoPro,
you name it, this thing works.
It's not fast, but it's awesome.
Aside from that, thank
you guys for watching.
If you want to see some more
awesome iPhone accessories,
check out the link below.
Hopefully you enjoyed it,
and if you did, and you are
feeling like being awesome,
make sure to go
- You're killing me, smalls.
- On that like button.
This is Jonathan, and
marshmallows in his mouth, Ralphy
and I will catch you guys later.
