and already Samsung has unleashed a
plethora of tablets upon us one of them
being the galaxy tabpro and specifically
I'm taking a look at the Tab pro 8.4
which is geared to give Apple's iPad
Mini a run for its money it's got a
quad-core processor
super high-resolution screen but also
features a controversial magazine UX
interface gonna kick back relax and
let's check out what comes inside the
box today's unboxing is brought to you
by LegalZoom hey guys john here with TLD
hope you guys are doing well now before
we can review this I got to spend some
time where they get to know it but in
the meantime I thought it would take you
through the unboxing and show you guys
what comes inside and also give you my
initial impressions after about an hour
of using it so Samsung it appears seems
to really stick with themes ever since
the galaxy s4 came out they really loved
that Fingal wood box that's obviously
still apparent here kind of matched my
desk pretty well but regardless code and
set it aside for the moment
now this features a Snapdragon 800 2.3
gigahertz quad-core processor and 8.4
inch 2560 by 1600 LCD display and is
also rocking Android 4.4 KitKat out of
the box so next up we'll go to begin the
under sto and I think ever since the Mac
Pro came out something about ripping
plastic off electronics became more
enjoyable for me so we've got one more
stickety sticker on the front and we
have the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 now inside
the box it's kind of slim pickins it
really isn't a whole lot going on up
towards the top left-hand side you guys
have all seen this before it is a USB
wall charger it's white it's clean it
plugs into your wall and it'll charge
your tablet next up right there in the
middle is the wall chargers P I see we
got a microUSB to type a USB cable which
obviously you can use to either charge
your tablet or sync up with your
computer and lastly there is the
literature in the bottom right hand
corner now looks like you should
actually just rip this open but nope
Samsung told me you actually just slide
it off take on a closer look you can see
we have the Quick Start Guide which is
obviously gonna get you started quickly
following that is there a little stick
on galaxy rewards so they encourage you
to register your tablet that's gonna get
you eligible for discounts giveaways and
things like that we then have the
instructions on how to upgrade your
software so just in case you're new or
you're not sure how to do that
we'll give you a step-by-step
walkthrough on how to upgrade your
tablet and last but not least the health
and safety and warranty guide so you
don't injure yourself while using the
tablet but if you do at least you know
what is covered so taking a closer look
at the Tab pro 8.4 you can see Samsung
is still opted to go for that fake
leather design that they introduced with
the Galaxy Note 3 it's not premium by
any stretch of the imagination but I do
prefer it over the old plastic design
now that guy right there in the top left
hand corner is an 8 megapixel camera so
if you want to be that guy yes this guy
you have all the picture-taking tablet
powers in your hands now on the flip
side there is a 2 megapixel front facing
shooter so this is what you'd use for
Skype and things like video chat you
guys can see towards the bottom there
are two stereo speakers right there in
the middle is the USB port and this
thing is actually really light it's
point 7 pounds and that actually makes
it just a tad lighter than the iPad Mini
with Retina display so if you guys want
a full comparison of these two let me
know by hitting that like button now
this comes stock with 16 gigabytes of
internal storage but it is expandable an
additional 64 gigabytes via the micro SD
card slot now as far as impressions go I
spent about two hours for the last night
just kind of getting a feel for it as
you guys can see there is the familiar
swipe to unlock home screen that we've
come to expect on Galaxy devices now on
the inside this is Samsung's brand new
magazine UX interface which kind of
looks like TouchWiz met up with
Flipboard somehow Windows Metro got
invited to the party did some stuff I
can't really talk about and voila
here is magazine UX now on paper that
sounds like a disaster but actually
using it for a little while
it's not terrible it does kind of hinder
performance a little bit there's some
slight Samsung lag going on but nothing
too tragic the downside is it doesn't
look like there's any option to disable
the magazine UX interface in the
settings or anything like that
but I did test it out with Nova Launcher
and that actually does a fantastic job
of getting rid of that just in case you
absolutely hate it now jumping back out
of the app launcher on the homescreen in
the bottom left hand corner you can see
we have quick access to Google now which
kicks the pants off s voice and even
Siri for that matter here is how you
would access multitasking so you can
either close all or quickly access the
task manager right there now as far as
the pulldown toggles and notifications
menu you can easily use one finger to
get a quick look or two fingers to get a
detailed look
all your toggles taking a closer look
into the settings there are four main
tabs one beam connection so you can
control Wi-Fi Bluetooth things like that
the device section will cover sound the
display you can actually even customize
your notification panel from within this
menu so you can see it's literally a
drag-and-drop operation of subs of
something you do or don't want in a
notification panel you have the power to
control that next up after that is the
controls tab which will give you access
to control the voice control motion
gestures palm motion and even smart
screen and lastly the general section
will give you access to your accounts
it'll show you things about your device
so you can see this is running Android
4.4.2 kitkat out of the box which is
definitely a plus and lastly one of the
good things that TouchWiz does bring the
tablets is multitasking so here I open
up Chrome I'm gonna go in and open up
YouTube as the secondary app I'm gonna
go ahead and play the video and you can
see I can seamlessly run back and forth
between two applications at the same
time I can browse the web I can scroll
all while watching the video on the
bottom half of the screen so this is
actually one of my favorite features on
Galaxy devices so hopefully you guys
