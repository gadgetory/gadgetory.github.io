a head-to-head comparison of not only
two of the year's top Android
smartphones but arguably two of the
year's best smartphones period the
galaxy s4 versus the HTC One
now when you stack these guys
head-to-head without a shadow of a doubt
the biggest difference between the two
is build quality the HTC One epitomizes
what a flagship phone should be in terms
of build quality and the all-aluminum
design to the tapered edges from the way
it feels cold when you pick it up in the
morning everything about it just screams
premium at your face now as far as the
galaxy s4 you can tell Samsung
definitely went with the it ain't broke
don't fix it model as it looks eerily
similar to the Galaxy s3 it features the
same plastic polycarbonate design with a
removable back which does have some
perks such as expansion via microSD and
a removable battery and not to say that
it's built poorly or bad because it's
definitely not it feels solid but being
a flagship foam it pales in comparison
to the HTC One and in terms of build
quality the HTC One takes the cake and
then some now as of today's date in the
US if you were to buy either of these
phones on a new two-year contract $1.99
will get you a 16 gigabyte Galaxy s4 or
for the same price you get a 32 gigabyte
HTC One nopsi pricing fluctuates their
steel sales promotions so if you want to
stay up to date I will have the most
current price and availability deals and
sales if there are any as well as unlock
pricing just in case you'd only lock
down to a contract I'll link right below
that like button jumping back to the
storage of the 16 gigabytes on the
galaxy s4 because there are so many
software features packed into this thing
there's only about nine available to the
user now yes you can expand by a micro
SD card up to an additional 64 gigabytes
but that is limited to only photos music
videos you can install apps on there so
if you're someone who loves apps
specifically games which can easily get
to over a gig in size you'll find
yourself running out of space sooner
than later on the galaxy s4 whereas the
HTC One if it's 32 gigs about 26 of that
is available to the user to have a lot
more room to play with in terms of apps
and games and on top of that you get 25
gigs of Dropbox space free with HTC One
so if you're the person that doesn't
really rely on apps or games and you
need that microSD card slot for your
movies for your photos for your videos
and it also plays a big role in routing
and also making backups of your phone
then the edge goes to the galaxy s4 but
if you're the person that downloads tons
of games and apps then that edge goes to
the H
tc1 next up let's talk about what is
powering these guys what's under the
hood because they are both stupid fast
and it's gotten to the point where
smartphones are becoming faster than
most household computers the HTC One is
rocking a 1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon 600
quad-core CPU with 2 gigs of RAM whereas
the galaxy s4 being the u.s. model is
rocking a slightly faster 1.9 gigahertz
Snapdragon 600 quad-core CPU that also
features 2 gigs of RAM now yes the
Galaxy s4 is more powerful just slightly
but in terms of real-world performance
and actual benchmarks that rose a huge
difference between the two in quadrant
the galaxy s4 scored 12112 whereas the
HTC One scored slightly lower at 12
thousand and 75 in Geekbench the galaxy
s4 pulled away a little bit with a score
of 3207
whereas HTC One was a little bit slower
at 2676 given the edge to the galaxy s4
jumping over to 3dmark Icestorm again
the galaxy s4 was slightly faster with a
score of 11,000 266 compared to the
slightly slower score of 11010 on the
HTC one now I will have all these
benchmarks linked again right below that
like button so if you want to download
them yourselves share your results leave
a comment down below and let me know how
your device fared the last benchmark I'm
going to show you is GL benchmark 2.7
the on-screen version and this is going
to translate directly into gaming
performance and again you can see it was
really close with the galaxy s4
averaging 15 frames per second and the
HTC One averaging just a slight slower
13 frames per second now obviously that
is a benchmark and it's going to be more
demanding and taxing than most games so
we'll go to jump out and check out Iron
Man on both of these devices you can see
they run buttery smooth they both look
fantastic there's no lag they look great
on the 1080p displays not leads us to
the next question since they are both
rocking 1080p displays which of the two
is better the Galaxy s4 is a little bit
bigger coming in at four point nine nine
inches rounded up to five whereas the
HTC One is slightly smaller at 4.7
inches giving it a slightly higher ppi
array because they are packing more
pixels into a smaller area now you can
see side-by-side in terms of that point
three inches you don't really gain or
lose a lot with either phone in terms of
screen real estate but in terms of
actual quality I'm gonna have to give
the edge to the HTC One it's a little
more accurate and kind of gives you a
true representation of what you are
looking at on the screen whereas the
Galaxy s4 is a little
a little over the top saturated the best
way I can kind of describe the two is
the HTC one is like a good pair of audio
monitors that's flat frequency so kind
of what you hear is what you get in this
case is what you see is what you get and
the Galaxy s4 is kind of like an
over-the-top set of speakers maybe they
enhance the bass and hence the treble
kind of tricking your mind and thinking
it sounds better or again in this case
looks better but for me it's a little
too over-the-top a little too saturated
and I definitely prefer the color
accuracy on the HTC one but again not
saying the galaxy s4 is bad by any means
both of these displays are jaw-dropping
and I'm willing to bet some people will
prefer the over-the-top look of the
galaxy s4 because it kind of tricks your
mind into thinking images look better
than they actually are it's really close
but for me again the HTC One takes the
crown in terms of display quality so now
that we've taken a look at most of the
hardware it's going to take a look at
the software and this is where the
galaxy s4 really separates itself from
the HTC one out of the box the galaxy s4
is rockin Android 4.2.2 whereas the HTC
One is rocking 4.1.2 and even though the
galaxy s4 is rocking a more current
version of Android neither of these are
like stock Android at all I actually
really did like Sense 5 on the HTC one
it's light it's clean elegant blink feet
which is one of their features there
pushing is kind of like a permanent
Flipboard on your screen I found it to
be a little intrusive on your home
screen but if you actually move it to
the left I found it much more enjoyable
and actually found myself checking it
often one thing I didn't like on sense
though is multitasking you got to press
the slightly awkwardly plays home button
on the right twice that's going to bring
a little window up with nine different
rectangles you have to swipe each out
individually conversely on the galaxy s4
all you got to do is hold the home
button which is conveniently placed
right there in the middle it's going to
give you an option we can swipe off apps
you can kill everything at once you can
quickly access Google now or you can get
a shortcut to your active applications
now while we're on the topic the galaxy
s4 features obviously a physical home
button with two capacitive buttons on
each side kind of seems to make more
sense and is more intuitive in terms of
navigation whereas the HTC One only
features two capacitive buttons no
physical button on there whatsoever so
for me like I said the galaxy s4 does
make more sense and has a little more
intuitive in terms of navigation but
it's not a deal-breaker and wouldn't
stop me from using the HTC One
continuing on with the software on the
Galaxy s4 this is where this phone
separates itself with any other phone on
the market they
jampacked this guy with tons and tons
and tons of features some of them were
gimmicky but the more and the more and
the more I use this phone the more I
found myself enjoying these features for
those of you guys who are familiar with
the Galaxy Note 2 and really enjoyed the
multi window support that has also come
over to the Galaxy s4 all you got to do
is hold the back button and from there
it's going to give you a little tab that
you can slide out you can choose from a
list of applications and view two of
those simultaneously now as far as the
futuristic features on the galaxy s4
everything you see plastered all over
these Samsung ads on TV I'm sure here on
YouTube I actually really enjoyed air
gesture if you've ever moved an icon on
your Android phone and you've been a
little frustrated when you're trying to
drag it over to the next screen it
doesn't quite make it with the galaxy s4
all you do is simply hold one down and
you can actually swipe between pages and
easily move it to another page without
all that hassle and headache that same
air gesture applies to waving your hand
like a magic wand and moving through
photos you can scroll with your fingers
on a webpage and yeah it's a little bit
gimmicky but as technology fans this is
some of the stuff that we should geek
out over if we show this to somebody 10
years ago they probably lost their mind
because that's some of the things you
expect to see on something like back to
the future another feature I really
enjoyed was smart scroll and by default
it is stupidly set to follow how you
move your head and you can all imagine
how you look out in public trying to
scroll moving your head on your galaxy
s4 but if you actually adjust it to
watch your eyes and then how you move
the phone it works a lot better so when
your eyes are on the screen if you tilt
the device back it's going to scroll
down to the article for you or if you
tilt it towards you it's going to scroll
back up and this is actually really
useful and I found myself enjoying this
a lot then you have things like smart
stay which will watch your eyes if you
move your head it's going to pause the
video for you you have things like air
view where you can hover your finger
without touching the device and you're
going to get a preview of a picture or
an email or a calendar
those are cool but I really didn't use
those too much now they also do both
feature IR blasters to control your TV
both were extremely easy to set up both
in under five minutes and they both work
extremely well nothing to the point
where I'd say choose this device over
the other because of the remote control
I do prefer the simplicity of sense on
the HTC One but overall in terms of
navigation and features the Galaxy s4
smokes the HTC One now I know I'm not
talking about every single feature on
the Galaxy s4 there's probably too much
to talk about in this video but if
you're interested in learning more I'll
have all those features posted down
below
as well as my top five galaxy s4
features so now that we took a look at
what separates the Galaxy s4 from the
pack let's take a look at one of the
biggest features on the HTC One
something that really hasn't been done
on a smartphone before and that is the
HTC boomsound now it sounds simple too
front-facing stereo speakers yet you
haven't seen that before on a smart
phone combine that with a little bit of
audio processing and software and the
results is the best sounding set of
speakers I've ever heard on a smartphone
the galaxy s4 on the other hand has a
tiny little speaker located on the back
and it really doesn't even come close to
HTC One is night and day better and I
know a YouTube video really can't do it
complete justice but in order to give
you guys the most accurate
representation what I'm going to do is
hold up the h1 which is a stereo
recorder and show you guys how the two
sounds side-by-side so you do have a
plan yeah mr. white yes science so
hopefully here there was a huge
difference between the two so if you're
watching movies videos YouTube music
whatever it is if you consume a lot of
media the HTC boomsound is a feature
you're probably not going to want to
overlook next up are the cameras the
galaxy s4 is rocking a massive 13
megapixel camera whereas the HTC One is
rocking a 4 megapixel or ultra pixel as
their marketing in it and they do a
great job of showing that it's not
always about the megapixels for a lot of
people there's an assumption that more
megapixels equals better and that's not
always the case it really comes down to
the sensor and the HTC one shows why
that's the case for most environments I
think both cameras performed
exceptionally well and I really don't
think you'd be disappointed with either
of these phones if you pick one but for
me the HTC one was a little more
accurate a little bit quicker and
overall I prefer the pure camera on the
HTC one over the Galaxy s4 it performed
better in low light as you guys can see
right here this is the galaxy s4 it's a
little noisy and then here is the HTC
One now conversely the galaxy s4 I think
more people will enjoy the camera
because of the layout and yes we're
going back to it
features because it is jam-packed with
tons and tons and you guessed it tons of
features even on the camera it's very
similar to the Galaxy camera with the
scroll style layout where you can choose
from tons and tons of presets drama was
really cool here's a little example of
one of those shots you can get a similar
effect on the HTC One but overall
there's a lot more you can do on the
Galaxy s4 you can simultaneously use
both the front and the back facing
camera which kind of could be cool for
vlogging and I think overall like I said
I do prefer the HTC One just a pure
camera ability but I think more people
are going to enjoy the camera on the
galaxy s4 because it's not bad by any
means they're both awesome cameras and I
think the features take the galaxy s4
over the edge they both took outstanding
video and is what you'd expect on a
flagship 1080p smartphone I really
wouldn't say one was drastically better
than the other but I did notice the
galaxy s4 microphones performed a lot
better especially in windy situations so
if you log and you want to use your
phone for that matter you may want to
check out the galaxy s4 next up what's
going to talk about some of that's
really important that kind of gets
overlooked a lot of time that is battery
life the HTC One is rocking a 2,300
milliamp hour battery whereas the Galaxy
s4 is rocking a slightly larger 2600
milliamp hour battery now in terms of
real world use I found myself sometimes
struggling with the HTC One to make it
through an entire day on the battery if
I was watching lots of video or if I was
playing games I felt like it really
struggled to make it through the whole
day and on top of that if your battery
is low it takes a super long time to
charge up so this is something where
that removable battery on the galaxy s4
kind of gives that the edge so the
galaxy s4 on top of all of that seemed
to perform about 10 to 15 percent better
in terms of battery life it charged
faster and overall got me through the
day a lot easier than the HTC One now at
the end of the day the lack of removable
battery on the HTC One wasn't a complete
deal-breaker for me because I usually
carry some sort of an external battery
right now I'm using the Trent I carrier
which is a 12,000 milliamp hour external
battery it'll charge whatever device you
got whether it's a tablet smartphone iOS
or Android and it'll charge it for days
if you guys are interested in more
information on that again I will have
that linked right below the like button
now lastly I know we forget a lot of the
times because these things are phones as
well but both performed about the same
in terms of cell quality and call
quality I don't really get any drop
calls on either phone they both feature
LTE that of course depends on the area
you live in but they both got about the
same speeds for me and both
worked about the same in terms of call
quality now in terms of advantages or if
there are any between the two in terms
of being a foam I've had to give a
slight edge to the HTC one in terms of
speakerphone because of the boom sound
so at the end of the day hopefully this
video showed you the strengths and the
weaknesses of each phone kind of showed
you which phone is better for you and I
think that's really what it comes down
to what is better for you if you did
enjoy this video you found it to be
helpful and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button as it is much appreciated and in
return I will throw a virtual high five
at yo face so to sum it up we have two
of the most badass smartphones that I've
ever used and to make it easy if you
prefer expandability micro SD card slot
removable battery fee prefer a slightly
better battery and tons and tons and yet
again tons of features then go with the
galaxy s4 on the other hand if you think
you really like boomsound and you watch
a lot of media and consume a lot of
music prefer build quality and the
external battery it's not a huge deal to
you I think you'd like the HTC One so
let me know what you guys think with a
comment down below try to keep it civil
these are smart phones not anything to
fight about kind of think about what you
were using ten years ago to what we have
now as options and have to decide
between these two phones is definitely a
first-world problem again thank you guys
for watching if you have any questions
on these two phones or just tech in
general hit me up on twitter at t--
Eldin today I also have Facebook and
Google+ where you can contact me there
as well also I'll be working on my next
phone comparison video let me know what
you want to see either the galaxy s4
versus the iPhone 5 or the HTC One
versus the iPhone 5 let me know in the
comment down below and again this is
Jonathan from TLD and I'll catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
