looking to pick one up hands down one of
its coolest features is the fact it can
essentially transform from a smartphone
into a fully fledged
desktop and it's now I turn my galaxy of
state from this into this so long side
the galaxy okay the other important
pieces of puzzle that you need to
absolutely make it work is the Samsung
dec this is a sphere like hockey puck
shaped gadget then transforms into a
dock that houses the Galaxy S eight
outputs video and also allows you to
connect things like a mouse and keyboard
now if you want to get that sweet
desktop experience you're going to need
to drop some cash index itself is not
cheap by any means it's around 150 bucks
then on top of that you need to buy a
monitor keyboard and mouse now of course
there is the argument of what if you
already own a display keyboard and mouse
if that's the case I'm willing to bet
that you more than likely have a
computer to go along with it and lots of
some twenty two-year-old Dell from 1995
that is barely stayin alive with that
sweet 256 Meg's of RAM then more than
likely your computer is going to be a
better full fledged desktop experience
than the galaxy s 8 &amp;amp; DEC's combined now
as far as the display goes from my side
up and with a 23 inch monitor from
Lenovo the name and product number is
ridiculous and dumb so if you're
interested I'll drop a link down below
for the keyboard always the logitech
k310 Drowned of bright beautiful orange
that kind of complements the screensaver
perfectly for the mouse I won't be
Logitech ultrathin Mouse which is a
super clean minimal touch mouse that
isn't the cheapest around 50 bucks but
it works great it looks awesome and also
perfectly complements the Harman Kardon
Bluetooth speakers that I went with for
audio so the Dex there definitely are
some pros and cons for starters even
though the Box advertised that will
output 4k right now only 1080p will work
on one side that actually may be a good
thing based solely on the fact that if
you were spending four to six hundred
dollars on a 4k display just for your
phone that might be a little crazy yes I
also understand that it might be a
little bit weird used in a display with
less pixels in your phone but honestly
I've really enjoyed this set up so far
now beyond the HDMI out on the decks
you're also getting two USB ports and
sadly these are USB 2.0 not 3.0 so you
might have to deal with some painfully
slow transfer speed lastly you also get
a gig Ethernet port for those of you who
are all about that hard wired life
converts to the one disappointing factor
with the decks is the fact that there is
no headphone jack or audio out on the
in theory he could have technically used
the Galaxy s8 if the headphone jack were
up top but since on the bottom and it is
then docked you're out of luck
so with that as far as a workaround goes
you pretty much have two options you're
going to be the monitor supports audio
pass-through over HDMI or in my case
what I did was set up through a
Bluetooth speaker now surprisingly using
a Bluetooth speaker what the setup works
really really well so as far as audio
control goes I really like how
everything is laid out in the interface
you have independent control over your
ringtone the Bluetooth speaker
notifications and then the overall
system volume which is awesome so that
we're past audio as far as the actual
user experience with decks goes it
actually works surprisingly well
now regardless of how great the
experience is and trust me I give
Samsung all the credit in the world for
executing this well I think the biggest
downfall right now is the lack of app
support there is a dedicated app section
that is optimized for decks but that
list is really really small right now
the other confusing part is that there
are apps that aren't on the optimized
list that still works so it's almost
like you get a play this weird guessing
game for some strange reason Spotify
does not work with Dex play music of
course does in a big beautiful
full-screen mode it will make me scratch
my head as well Spotify isn't supported
for some weird unknown reason alpha
music works on Dex now in third cases
some apps don't work well because you do
need a touch screen to actually take
most advantage of those it's really hard
to talk and not get eaten by ghosts
right now so I'm gonna try and does
these guys Oh No yeah now jump some
games and be on things like Word docs
and note-taking apps one thing I was
genuinely curious about was video and
photo editing much to my disappointment
video editing is not really a thing on
Dex Adobe clips from what I can tell is
one of the better options out there but
it was not a great experience at all
photo editing on the other hand was
actually really cool
for starters Photoshop Express and
Lightroom mobile both are fully
supported on deck so you can get a
pretty fantastic fullscreen experience
as most of you I'm sure are aware the
Galaxy S 8 has a fantastic camera so
being able to edit those photos on a
bigger screen and then have them
directly on the phone after you're done
is kind of awesome now as far as after
work well actually really like the
YouTube LED especially in full-screen
mode we have
nice big window forget it here on the
left shut up to your savage consumer on
the right you have a nice layout of all
the videos and a little tip just in case
you own this instinctively you want to
scroll down here to leave that first
comment but actually you got to scroll
down all the way right here we've jet a
little love drop a comment I usually say
what's up within the first hour so let
me know how your day is going also from
that giving you quick demo how well the
Bluetooth functionality works you can
actually control volume from the
keyboard if you want to encounter a bad
product that you can't actually feature
in also strangely enough Instagram work
index you can also access the camera so
if we wanted to send out a picture Evans
want to take a selfie with me
so filming through deck oh that's yeah
that's decks it you're really close man
not to me not the screen oh I'm clicking
my mouse right now to take the picture
you could get Friday yeah here we go
there you go that's what I get
I'm asking the mouse is like a stylus
has workers me other really cool points
with deck setup as well your Galaxy f8
is docket is also charging
simultaneously on top of that it does
support fast charging honestly I think
where this makes most sense for those
who don't already own a computer and can
pick up a display mouse and keyboard for
cheap is the Dex a full-fledged desktop
replacement absolutely not but it is
definitely a step in the right direction
the only thing I got to say they hope
Samsung sticks with this continues to
make improvements and does not abandon
this it is a crazy cool concept and a
smart phones get faster and more
powerful I don't think it's insane that
they will eventually turn into our
computers put sweats postin hey Lex
but gazelle action not super star X it's
a zebra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
