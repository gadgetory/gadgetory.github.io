welcome back to coolest tech on the
planet CTIA edition brought to you by
AT&amp;amp;T so first up we're taking a look at
some connected car tech from Volvo we
got a chance to take their xc90 out to
Vegas not only is it a piece of a car
it's packed with the killer technology
now I Drive a simple truck which really
isn't packing much in the tech
department so I kind of nerd it out over
this for starters this is how you start
and stop the ignition below that is how
you can adjust the drive mode you can
select from eco comfort off-road or
dynamic and this will physically adjust
the car now as much as I love crispy
video I also love crispy audio so as
cool as the touch navigation was I think
I was most excited with the sound system
which is powered by Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins
it's loaded with both awesome looking
and sounding speakers and topped off
with killer control which let you
optimize for the entire car just a front
seat just the rear seats or even
simulate the gothenburg concert hall
well blew my mind most though was this
the xc90 is equipped with four cameras
and simulates a 360 degree view that
helps you back in perfectly now the
minute samsung dropped gear s2 I've been
dying to check it out in person seen it
up close good god is it attractive it
features a stainless steel body and a
pretty simple but good-looking BAM but
what I dig most about it is the bezel
because that's actually how you navigate
through the watch is silky smooth feels
great and is really intuitive so I
definitely plan on getting one of these
in house when they're available before
when I saw at CTIA the gear s2 is
looking to be one of the best Android
wear options of 2015 now jumping back to
car tech for a second I also got a
chance to check out the new Audi TT
which as far as looks go is straight
fire inside is a 12-point three inch
display which acts as a central hub and
displays everything from your dash to
the weather to navigation and even
settings as far as navigation goes this
is done through audi's MMI touch which
is not only intuitive but also a really
nice way integrated physical tactile
form of control paired with the digital
display plus I don't know about you but
this is just about the sexiest possible
way to adjust the a/c now unfortunately
I don't get a chance to take this guy in
the road but if you want to see more car
tech
on a channel let me know by going buff
dudes on that like button aside from
that that wraps up today's video
definitely let me know your favorite
piece of tech with a comment down below
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
