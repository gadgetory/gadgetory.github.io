familiar with check on a 50 tech under
25 but now I think it's time to take a
step up and look at some of the best
tech under 300 this ranges from one of
the best budget smartphones this year to
one of my favorite pairs of headphones
and also a toothbrush that is smarter
and way cooler than you'd ever expect
now before I jump into this yes I have
seen the comments rest assured it is
coming out very soon so go to drop a
like if you're excited so jumping back
in first up is the aura clean from towel
clean and huge shout out to them for not
only sending this out but also
sponsoring this episode firstly it
actually looks good and comes in two
color options both white and black but
what makes this kind of genius though is
the way it actually charges so you
actually pop in the toothbrush upside
down and that in turn leads to a couple
of things one the actual brush itself is
isolated from the environment that is
the bathroom no matter how clean it is
the bathroom is for sure more prone to
bacteria and germs and what this does
essentially is bubble boys your
toothbrush on top of that you might have
noticed when you pop the toothbrush in
the logo on the base lights up it what
happens inside the base is not only is
it drying the brush but there's also a
UVC light which is killing off that
nasty bacteria now as far as the brush
itself it's stroke action game is on
point dishing out 40,000 strokes a
minute there are two modes its
waterproof and that combined with the
tech and the base make this a pretty
killer package now if you're Tod fan
tell clean wants hook you up so down
below is a discount code to save 50
percent which puts us not only under 300
but right now it's under a Benjamin
Franklin so next up is the fourth
generation moto G and specifically this
is the standard 32 gigabyte option which
is priced at 229 but alternatively if
you're an Amazon Prime member and don't
mind a few ads here and there you can
save 50 bucks and scoop this up for 179
this is rocking a 5.5 inch 1080p display
and not only does the screen look good
but the actual phone itself feels great
in your hand
there's no USBC just get a little
standard microUSB it's lightweight and
overall it's just a simple really
good-looking phone little nice touches
with this are the inclusion of micro SD
card expansion certain Motorola features
like shaking to open up the camera which
is decent but not great it'll definitely
get the job done but don't expect
anything amazing with this camera on top
of that what I've always liked about
Motorola's for the most part they keep
Android Android don't pile a ton of
rap on top what this leads to is a nice
fluid non-distracting experience it
allows the phone to perform well even
though it may not have the greatest
specs overall though it's a great option
for students or someone who's looking to
get into a smartphone for the first time
it's nicely sized it's got a solid
display most importantly it won't break
the bank
now last up are the sony Hurons and
these nail - end of the spectrum both
looking good and sounding good I
actually covered the wireless version
these in my latest what's in my tech bag
video those are phenomenal easily my
favorite pair of headphones right now
but if you're looking to save a little
cash these being the wired version will
save you over a hundred bucks what I
love about them are the bright vibrant
colors they come in this being lime
yellow which is the loudest of the bunch
but they also come in pink black red and
blue which honestly is definitely more
of a turquoise now the question that I
know is coming is are these better than
the 80 hm 50s dat HM 50 X's and they put
it simply yes inside our 40 millimeter
drivers a dish out a nice punchy
well-balanced sound after in the bass
they definitely pump out a good amount
of low-end but not to the point where
it's overpowering or distracting they're
extremely comfortable so if you're
someone who listens to music for
extended periods of time it's not going
to hurt your head again though the
absolute biggest selling point for me is
the fact they look as good as they sound
which you can't say for most headphones
out there and now without question makes
these one of the best options out right
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
