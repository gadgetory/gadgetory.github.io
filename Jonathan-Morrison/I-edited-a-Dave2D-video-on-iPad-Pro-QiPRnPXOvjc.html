this video looks and sounds and yo guys
johnathan you're back with round two of
editing a video on the iPad pro so a
couple weeks ago hung out like guy Dave
2d and we shot a video that went live on
his channel and I'm not gonna say that
it was well-received and that no one
knew was edited on an iPad pro but it
was pretty well received and nobody knew
it was edited on an iPad pro this one's
along wants to kick back relax grab your
popcorn Before we jump in I wanna give a
huge shout out to today's sponsor
LastPass
so it's 2018 soon to be 2019 and nobody
should be using one two three four five
six seven eight as their password and
with that LastPass takes the burden off
trying to remember a complex password
and getting locked out so with LastPass
that essentially does all the legwork
for you from entering the username to
the password it's super secure with
multi-factor authentication and the best
part is is that it works on both iOS and
Android so you guys want to check it out
for yourselves and support the channel
make sure you guys hit the link below
and again big things to LastPass
response err in today's video but now
back to the iPad pro edit off now this
video I had to fight every bone in my
body not to edit this on the plane ride
back from Toronto hanging with Dave I
did though that wooden captured the Edit
process on video I did however get a
little bit of a head start in terms of
importing organized and doing a little
bit of a color grade and also syncing
the audio with the video because I like
the Kevin Kenton video where that audio
was recorded internally into the sony a7
3 this was done externally so inside
luma fusion we have the blue clip which
is the video and below that is the green
clip which is for the audio the simplest
way I found to kind of sink those up is
find the actual first wave point at the
clap cut there do the same thing with
the audio line them up and you are good
to go now hopefully with future versions
of luma fusion they come up with some
sort of automatic sync or at least a way
to kind of nest or compound clip because
if I could do this and then kind of
group that into one clip and make the
cuts it would make my life much easier
but with this again I want to do
something a little different and also
challenge myself in addition to the
original Kevin canson video now for
those that watch the previous video for
the most part I do tend to enjoy editing
music like with it loud and that kind of
dictates the style in the field but with
this I think I want to get the talking
head portion with Dave out of the way
and kind of keep it true to his normal
style now quick tip with luma Fusion is
really cool audio mixer you can access
by tapping here so we have all the
channels pulled up and what I did was
completely mute the Sony a7 3 audio and
all we're hearing is the external audio
which is a shotgun mic into a sound
devices mix pre 3 and again just the the
fluidity and the smoothness of the
timeline scrubbing pinching zooming
still continues to blow my mind to even
you know multiple times through this on
the iPad pro why do you say speed Dave
is such a sweetheart so sound speed
camera speed I guess if you hang around
people who know what they're doing long
enough you kind of at least can fake
like you know what you're doing I think
the actual Wharton stored up and I think
the actual origin story of that is back
when cameras actually recorded to film
it would take a certain amount of time
before I would actually speed up to the
proper frame rate and that is why you
say Sound speed camera speed with this
cut though I think in my head I know you
know we did a couple takes at the
beginning so I can kind of scrub or
ready to the actual real take and it's
just gonna be like this smooth relaxing
process because Dave 2d he should read
it out of a book and it's just one of
the most soothing voices you'll ever
hear the laptop of these case so that I
know we're ahead of the game the laptop
nope Beauty here so if this video looks
there's the intro so I'm gonna scrub in
hey how's it go there we go so that is
the endpoint that I want and shout out
to everybody on Twitter that answer this
question instead of actually selecting a
clip cutting deleting cutting deleting
if you have nothing selected and you
actually you know hit a blade that will
cut both of them at the same time so
really helpful there and I think because
if we scrub back this is connected to
that so if I delete it
boom it's cutting both so just a little
efficiency tip in luma fusion also again
just kind of talking about the speed the
fluidity this clip
is actually color graded and again just
playing a real-time 4k just no drop
frames no lag it's kind of crazy here's
what the clip looked like before so not
bad and here's what it looked like after
so I wanted more of like this cool kind
of just ambient fill to match Dave's
voice the actual blue the white or the
set up and I think it turned out pretty
now the more and more I've kind of
edited within luma fusion yes the pencil
is helpful in terms of that kind of acts
as your mouse but I would say in terms
of what's more beneficial I would say
the keyboard hands down because just
having the ability to use a space for it
to play and pause is like immensely
helpful I'm gonna try to actually see if
I can edit this video without the Apple
pencil I did that with the Kevin canson
video so it'll be a little bit of a
challenge this time to see if I can do
this only with my hands and the actual
Apple keyboard again for keyboard
shortcuts the luma fusion command B is
to blade I want to make sure that both
clips aren't selected and there we go
so now I'm gonna find the next point
where Dave talks about the laptop use
the most this year was actually the drew
vote count cool so that is the talking
point about D and you can kind of start
to feel like if you look at the
waveforms you can see that's kind of
like the beginning of a sentence so I'm
gonna roughly put it there command B
this command X and again because that is
attached to this it should delete
everything and then we should have one
like cohesive smooth cut hopefully the
lap but the LA it's not bad we're gonna
mask that with a little b-roll there's
most of in 2018 so I'm gonna start with
the hardware and then kind of go into
the details of it the laptop to do you
think I get that a little tighter yeah
so that's nice just having the ability
to cut both at the same time and then
delete
Lille those of it the LA and you know
like cutting is such a specific style
sometimes you kind of want that that
voice to lead into the next sentence in
this case I actually think maybe that's
more Dave style so I'm gonna kind of
leave a little bit of that breath just
for that pacing because he is such like
a smooth natural talker kind of go into
the details of it the laptop them to use
the mostess use like there's our blade
15 so I'm gonna get a real a real real
precise cut right here and then try and
blend that with the next line down the
road I really like the wireless okay
here we go
so I know that's that's what I want
let's see if I can make that work
command X wired I really like the
wireless not bad called it the perfect
keyboard and it actually featured
different keyboard a control keyboard
but that thing was wired I really like
the wireless experience so I just went
with the dreamville caliber more often
than not this year and a great keyboard
highly recommended Dave is worried about
the length this video because I made him
shoot this like at midnight so right now
we're about a minute and eight seconds
in if we can hit like three minutes
I'll feel good so Dave is on standby
with the updates it's got to feel like
pretty nerve-wracking not editing your
own video having it in someone else's
hands especially mine on an iPad pro if
I screw this up this could be hugely
terrible for him and I'm sorry Dave I'm
also very thankful for putting that
trust in my hand so you see here what I
did there's actually had the main clip
selected so it cut both command-b
that does the entire video and audio and
again that's like kind of a big tip when
you're editing video pay attention to
the waveforms if you see like little
minut chunks that's more than likely not
going to be like the cohesive sentence
you want it depends on yourself but with
Dave's someone who has like a really
good talking presence I know if he's
hitting like a big chunk of audio that's
more than likely going to be the take
that I
this particular okay a little bit of
natural I just have like a black base
and stuff this is silver white looks
clean that like describes every Dave TT
video clean cleaning calm we're at two
minutes so again I think if we hit the
three minute mark Dave will be content
with that hopefully four minutes if I
can stretch it out a little bit with
some some little fancy editing so you
can see like editing is so much just all
about like feeling anticipating knowing
kind of when that next cut or
something's gonna happen I know it's
weird but that's just kind of how I get
into it the pixel three is probably the
best camera in my opinion I feel like it
just shoots the nicest we clearly now
know it is not the pixel three thanks
Marcus
cocoa foam we should have put a poco
phone in this setup I've talked about it
before but just obviously the smoothness
the fluidity the silence like you can
hear everything else around right now
the outside the the people the neighbors
next door
thank you mad at us because we're loud
they're making noise right now hopefully
I'm not watching this I don't think they
will because I don't think they like us
and I think it looks good that's why we
went with it there's a white power bank
oh we hit we hit three minutes I'm gonna
text day right now he'll be happy he
would be pissed already was gonna be
short because it was so late at night
you know and the other drug your desktop
use but if you're interested okay this
is gonna be a challenging cut because uh
there's another Mouse in here something
this I got it this is hi there's another
Mouse let me see if I can get that out
of there this is gonna be a challenging
cut
whole color setup there's another Mouse
in here so this yeah I used this mouse
this I think I can do it so let's take
effectively three cuts
hopefully that sounds like one cohesive
sentence nope
there's another Mouse in here so this is
the Logitech almost almost almost
your setup there's another Mouse in here
so this is a Logitech ah no you go the
other way so I'll take let me take less
of that and then more of this last too
much I could get like in there
okay here we go there's another Mouse in
here so this is the Logitech sometimes
you just gotta like close your eyes
matches my whole color setup there's
another Mouse in here so this is the
Logitech g7 or three and it's a gaming
mouse and I switch over so three cuts
one-sentence this knows when I'm playing
games but and yeah hope you guys enjoyed
this video thumbs we liked it subs if
you loved it I'll see you guys next time
BAM cold hard four minutes and 27
seconds with nothing with no Dave 2d
intro let me let him know four minutes
and 27 seconds now with this particular
project one kind of idea I had in mind
right now was that because there you
know there's no sort of sink or anything
what I think I might do is kind of
bounce this as it's one one file that
way when I bring in the music and kind
of the b-roll instead of worrying about
the audio being connected to the video I
just have one file sometimes I'll do
this you know what I'm on the road
taking something on my macbook pro I'll
chop a talking head do the color do the
sound and that way I just have what I
need instead of all of like the
unnecessary stuff so I know it's not
necessary for this but I'm just gonna
kind of see what that workflow looks
like so let's try that I'm going to nope
I want to bounce not import movie let's
go ahead and try to go into go into the
rendered movies folder we'll go high
quality it's gonna be amazing when you
can do pro res on this stuff like
that'll be the day so it's going to
export all right okay there we go so I
already have that into the rendered
movies folder what I'm going to do is
let's go ahead and actually create like
a backup of this one so we're going to
duplicate it
and we're going to I'm just like a
command a no I do it everything all
right got that blank slate here's the
balanced file and again the purpose of
this was just so I can have the audio
kind of melded with the video and I'm
not gonna worry about that I can just
throw in some music and just kind of
like finish this guy up now what I'm
most excited for is when the music comes
into play because there's this track
that's like super it's not Dave 2d like
he's never used it but I heard it and
just Dave's calm voice with this track I
think is just gonna be like so we got
the Dave 2d folder I got the Dave 2d
intro someone dropped that in now now's
where the Dave 2d video kind of starts
to to come together let me see what I
want to do is actually bring this back
up because in the original project I
actually muted that main one so I don't
want that in this case hey how's it
going Dave 2d here so if this video
looks alright so there's a Dave intro
what I would like to do is see we can
actually mute that and then let the
background track kind of do that so I'm
going to tighten that up a little bit
hey how's it going deep as a clean clean
clean cut this track right here I just
want to hear Dave's voice over it like
can you hear days voiceover that Dave 2d
here today I'm gonna give you the most
soothing voice on YouTube and talk to
you about graphs and benchmarks and give
you the most dense information you'll
ever see with beautiful colors and
lovely close-ups I'm excited to stay
with the intro
hey how's it going Dave TV here so if
this video was yeah I cut that off a
little bit give it like a little bit a
little mini cut before he has gone deep
- yeah that's like that that's the
feeling right there hey how's it going
Dave to be here so if this video looks
and sounds ok so that I think I'm
feeling that sorry Dave I'm gonna make
the executive call on that one I like
that over your voice it's just it just
works what I'm gonna do here is actually
I maybe I'll bring the volume of that
down just a little bit so it's not like
a huge difference from when we bring it
in so it's not a huge difference when we
kind of bring it down with the the voice
or the narration so I'm gonna start like
it negative 3 decibels hey how's it
going Dave TV create a little marker be
here so if this video looks and sounds
and feels a little bit different it's
because there's something special going
on for me I'm like if this makes me
happy the calm this little marker bring
that down quick let's see how that feels
interested follow my Twitter in a couple
days you'll find out what I feel like
these videos really aren't like super
music driven behind me is the computer
setup that I used most of in 2018 so I'm
gonna start up at the hardware and then
kind of go into the details of it the
laptop that i use the most this year is
actually the razor blade 15 so this is a
device that has a 144 heard screen great
for gaming which i did way too much of
this year I kind of dig that so like if
we go like just from the beginning here
the flow I want to do some sort of like
montage the intro for Dave but it's just
not
hey how's it gone Dave TV here so if
this video looks and sounds and feels a
little bit different it's because
there's something special going on if
you're interested follow my Twitter and
a couple days you'll find out why but
behind me is the computer setup that you
use most of maybe we'll make that like a
little bit of a less drastic so I'll
give them some more time you're
interested in following Twitter in a
couple days you'll find out what but
behind me is the computer setup that you
use most of in 2018 so I'm gonna start
with the hardware Kaela so that'll be
like the the point where things kind of
just it'll like come down to that point
so now it's time to start laying some
some b-roll I know just from shooting
everything like we got some we got some
good day shots in here look at that man
how could you not like that face look at
that guy he looks so happy in that bokeh
ball alright let's get to the UH I know
I want one particular shot now I think I
did something stupid here because I
bounced the original file I don't have
any of that like color graded stuff
which I wanted to just copy and paste as
like a base point to this b-roll because
I think for the most part it should
match so I want to see if you can
actually go within projects and actually
see if you can copy and paste attributes
so that would be cool so what I'm gonna
try and do is actually copy attributes
from the previous file option a copy and
then see if I can paste those in the new
file here option a pastes ooh it works
so that's pretty click you can again
paste attributes from a previous project
and then apply them to a separate
project which i think is cool oh my
Twitter and a couple days you'll find
out what but behind me is the computer
setup that I used most of
20:18 so i'm gonna start with the
hardware and then kind of go into the
details of it the cut command being the
main reason why did that was just in
case there were points during the video
where I wanted to cut and kind of
intertwine maybe got mini music montage
that was the reason for bouncing
unnecessary but it was just kind of one
way to slim things down and one less
thing to worry about laptop to be used
in most this year is actually the Razer
Blade 15 man they've just make anything
sound cool
I want that laptop now human mercury
silver mmm okay well I think might help
this one too is the what's also maybe
mildly bugging me is the the composition
of this one so I think if we just maybe
bring that in a little bit this will
kind of lessen the effect of it not
being a stable let me try that it's like
the way that it felt to me and when it
came in mercury silver like that was
better that feels better but behind me
is the computer sense that he used most
of in 2018 so I'm gonna start with the
hardware and then kind of go into the
details of it the laptop that we use the
most this year is actually the razor
blade 15 so this is a device that has a
144 heard screen great for gaming which
I did way too much of this year great
for video editing and the thing is I had
access to a lot of other laptops but
actually went with this one the most
because of the design of it I just like
the way they looked like the way that it
felt and when it came in mercury silver
or mercury whiteford what they called it
it's just no-brainer
this was the laptop that I went with
I'll use this for the intro for the
monitor and I'll save the overwatch for
a little later
so I want that just like a half beat
before he comes in with the line super
long battery life the monitor is the 38
you see 99 from LG
it's a widescreen monitor not Super Cup
is kind of like shows off or accurate
more though the whiteness I would say
accurate enough but I like the width of
it and I think the thing I like the most
about this ok blade there give Dave some
talk time monitor is just how clean it
looks a lot of monitors that are big I
just have like a black bass and stuff
this is silver white looks clean now
when it comes to smartphones all right
so it's gonna just straight up here the
thing I like the most about this monitor
is just how clean it looks a lot of
monitors that are big just have like a
black bass and stuff this is silver
white looks clean first I'm not great at
like writing shots down in my head I'm
terrible with that but at least all I'll
see them in my head so with this Dave
did the talking first and because of
that it kind of allowed me to put myself
in a place where I knew what shots I had
to get afterwards that way we can tell
the story and get the coverage because
you know a lot of the times if you just
go out and the talking is separate from
the actual b-roll or the story it kind
of feels like just disconnected in a way
so one tip just always be cognizant of
you know if you're gonna do your talking
first do your talking to make notes or
vice versa be aware of what was shot and
then implement that into your talking
there's a lamp in the background so this
lamp was made by Xiaomi it normally has
a red power cord but I spent some time
to kind of put nail polish on I don't
think it looks great but I just can't
stand red I felt like if it was gonna go
on the scene it had to be blue and this
was only I'd want to do for a while but
I finally did it earlier today to make
it match the whole setup now in the
drawer okay I think that's like the
audio point where we can let me see what
we got in the bank I know I have Dave's
music in here but see what
got pull back from that I don't think
any of these are gonna work with Dave
it's like the stevie status that's too
much yeah nope not Dave TD approves
never go through that and Dave are you
gonna have fun Dave can't get away with
this it's like a Latin drop right
very Latin let's see what let's try it
the whole setup now in the drawers there
are some headphones these are the V noh8
I believe I've been wrong a link
improperly below and there's a blue dry
post so this is from angel bird it's an
SST superfast super small having looked
anchor that can't work for ya can't work
for Dave much as I want it to I'll go
back to the Dave the Dave mix there's
also a knife in here and the only reason
why I have this knife is because it
looks super cool to me white and blue
are kind of silver and blue just really
matches my whole color setup there's
another Mouse in here so this is the
Logitech G 7 or 3 and it's a gaming
mouse and I switch over to this mess
when I'm playing games but the battery
life on this thing is really short so I
don't use it for regular desktop use but
if you're interested this is probably
the best gaming mouse that is on the
market right now in my opinion now in
the other drug did you see as I pad
drawings they're amazing well I'm gonna
hop on pop them in there you can see
them for the final I need Dave to DS art
in my ipad review and when you look at
devices and they just are really nice
looking it's inviting to use right you
just makes you want to use a device more
so I feel like Apple nailed the design
element this year and it just makes
people want to use this thing I don't
want this video to end but it's gonna
end right now I'm almost done a stupid
idea number two all setup is almost snap
a loss in the bank's sin that I use the
most of over 2018 and yeah hope you guys
enjoy this video thumbs be liked it the
subs if you loved it
I'll see you guys next time that's a
genius like ending do you guys next time
add that little end slate I'll give him
a little little length at the end you
guys next time
huh you want to guess the length of the
total video okay go 4 minutes and 38
seconds because I I wanted to I don't
want to keep it like I want to keep it
like Dave 2d I don't want to throw like
super like montage II b-roll everywhere
I've got to keep it like gotta keep it
true today in the drawers there are some
headphones the I do like this track a
lot though for the end it's a disaster
I'm just kidding it's amazing start to
finish the Edit was 2 hours like I'm
like an hour in 50 minutes
yeah pretty much like 8 seconds I think
it's probably gonna end up being around
a real time the finish cut is 4 minutes
and 38 seconds I wanted to like if it
was me I think I would have like you
know thrown like some some montage DB
row but that's not really like Dave 2d
yeah it's not your style so I kept it
true yeah the only thing I tweaked was
there was one track that I really liked
that was like super ambient that I think
went well with your voice and so I just
one of them one one that I found I don't
think I don't think I would use it but I
use it with your intro splash so I'll
just like I'll let you see the intro
real quick and then I'll export it
but I don't even know like what this
looks like but it's like let's see what
so it's it's a like I have it plugged
into my normal speakers because of like
to edit speakers and it's just that I
pad into this giant dock that gives me
audio out and it allows me to charge it
okay so and then the Apple keyboard the
pencil I tried to challenge myself not
to use it just because people were
asking like you know what's more
valuable the keyboard or the pencil yeah
it was just a iPad and the keyboard I
yeah yeah yeah it's crazy though like
here we go
hey how's it going Dave 2d here so if
this video looks and sounds and feels a
little bit different it's because
there's something special going on if
you're interested follow my Twitter in a
couple days you'll find out why but
behind me is the computer setup that he
used most of in 2018 so I'm gonna start
with the hardware and then kind of go
into the details of it the laptop that
we use the most this year is actually
the razorblade 15 so this is a device
that has a 144 heard screen great for
gaming which I did way too much of this
year great for video editing and the
thing is I had access to a lot of other
laptops but actually went with this one
because it's big design yes I had a key
I had to stay true to you and then not
real whatever I know we've talked about
it I don't I don't really watch like all
your windows videos but ok I watch
enough your videos to know your style so
like the ending worked out really well
we got your sick drawing in there it
just makes people want to use it more so
that's probably why I sucked onto it but
that's basically it this whole setup is
kind of a snapshot of the devices that I
use the most of over 2018 and yeah hope
you guys enjoy this video a thumbs we
liked it subs if you loved it I'll see
you guys next time
BAM
oops I don't want the camera off is the
camera off yeah I'm gonna bounce it so
it'll be done like in seven seconds and
then then uh I'll send it to you sweet
