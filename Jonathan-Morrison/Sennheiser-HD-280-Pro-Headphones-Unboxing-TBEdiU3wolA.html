you guys a quick unboxing of the
Sennheiser HD 280 professional
headphones these are closed back so do
you want to say a big thanks to
Sennheiser for sending these out for
review today just a quick unboxing and
we're going to follow up with a review
later this week so in the front of the
box we see Sennheiser HD 280 2-year
warranty that's pretty cool comes with
the headphones on the flip side of the
box they kind of go over all the
features and different languages English
Dutch France that's fun yo italiano and
Netherlands so pretty diverse there it's
going to open these up shouldn't be too
heavy as far as content goes but we're
going to check it out anyways so we
wouldn't set that aside looks like we
got some owner's manuals in there for a
minute so yep this is the owner's manual
Quick Start Guide like a few different
languages as well nothing too drastic
then we have the headphones themselves
looks like we've got a nice length as
far as the cable goes as well as 1/8
inch to quarter inch adapter for you
guys right there
so let's go past a plastic aside and
look at headphones themselves always had
a good experience with Sennheiser so far
so shouldn't expect nothing less with
these they do feel pretty light I didn't
get a chance to mess with some older to
80s back probably a year or two ago so
these do feel a little bit different
curious to see how that affects the
sound at all so like I said this just
been a quick unboxing this is perfect
for you guys looking to look for some
monitoring headphones these come in at
just at 100 bucks so stay tuned for the
full review and I'll catch you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
