with TLD i've got a few requests as far
as a tour of geeks room you guys want to
see my setup someone when you guys to it
right now so this is my main desk where
do my editing I have my macbook pro
hooked up to a samsung syncmaster T
240hz I kind of give you a zoom up here
and give you guys a little walk through
the desk so just have some basic tascam
speakers listen to music stuff like that
nothing too crazy here I have fun of a
terabyte and a half seagate drive hooked
up to a little dock there's the beats by
dre solo headphones and this is the
wired apple keyboard i actually prefer
that over the wireless just because i
like having the number pad there then as
we go down this is the western digital
two terabyte external drive i use that
with my mac pro as my main drive as far
as a scratch disk for the video that's a
sandisk multi card reader i use data
transfer video with my canon 7d actually
works a lot better and I'm actually able
to transfer it with a plug-in and final
cut we take a little bit closer look at
the samsung it's a touch of color do you
guys can see a little red bevel on the
edge and everything's touch so there's
no buttons right here just at the power
off and then the actual other buttons
are on the side of that so 24 inches at
1920 x 1200 resolution and then we guys
can see my macbook pros the 2010 core i7
i got a bunch of wires hooked up right
now I got two ethernet go and i got the
adapter from mini displayport to DVI
that's hooked up to my monitor right now
so i basically have a dual monitor setup
right now so i can drag anything over
here from you guys can see the mouse
scrolling from here over to my desktop
so basically like a nice little
multi-monitor setup that's standing on a
logitech stand I don't have anything
hooked up as far as a USB power I
definitely want to get that going down
the road and you guys can see here's my
magic mouse and a nice mouse pad my
girlfriend got me for Christmas that's
pretty cool then we moved down there's a
little actual this is a coolest I gosh a
tripod for the video I was trying to
actually hook this up to my monitor
didn't fit so I'm gonna figure out what
I'm going to do with this this is my
zoom h4n I'm actually recording the
audio through this right now I'm gonna
sing that up after but that's what I use
for my audio in my videos there's the 7d
am I using an hv30 right now
I wanted to show basically my whole
rigas why i left the 7d out of this
question that's a Gary Vaynerchuk book
it's awesome book if you guys are
looking for basically some information
on how to succeed anything like youtube
or you guys who are tech guys that want
to get going with that it's really good
book so i recommend that i got some
vitamins I got the case for the h4 in
and get another picture of me my
girlfriend my basketball huge basketball
fan then I got the Apple in hair
headphones a couple of 2.5 these are
older drives that have had taking on a
macbook pros the beats by dre a little
case then I got some monster cleaner
this is actually my favorite works
really welcomed with the cloth about 20
bucks for my macbook pro as we go down
I've kind of made this the new unboxing
area so it's got a nice little roomy
area we can do that and as we go down
there's kind of the the past boxes that
I've done so we got everything from the
beach to the 7d to my macbook pro that's
actually some skullcandy headphones
wasn't my brother that's his box
plugging to do a review on that that's
why that's in here and we got an
old-school Mickey phone big Disney
family me and as we go up we got Michael
Jordan like I said I'm a huge basketball
fan huge Bulls fan I've been a Bulls fan
forever now and then we got my guitar so
you guys don't know play a little bit of
guitar and then there's the famous homer
that you guys have seen in some of the
videos so that pretty much does it
covered about everything in here from
the speakers to my macbook to the
monitor but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video not much to it but I had a few
requests for it so I hope you guys like
checking this out and I will catch you
