with Texas lunch and dinner I'm
reviewing mad at 11th for the iPhone
iPod Touch this comes in at $7.99 in the
App Store there are four different game
modes from exhibition season playoffs
all the way to Bluetooth multi player so
I'm gonna run you guys through a little
exhibition mode I really like the
interface on this the ability to scroll
through teams is very intuitive very
smooth and it almost gives you kind of a
random type of effect if you want to
just play a random team now we're going
into the gameplay you guys can see the
coin toss if you swipe it of course I'm
awesome so I win and if you guys haven't
talked any crap in yes I'm a Lions fan
they are my favorite team all I can say
as I miss Barry Sanders now moving on to
the gameplay
yay really pushes the graphics on this a
while I think they're good I don't think
they really live up to the full
potential of the iPhone 4 Retina display
the virtual control actually works
pretty good it's very responsive as you
guys can see right here I'm a big fan of
the little slow motion feature you guys
can really dial in and hit that open
receiver now they have what's called
game flow so what that does is basically
if you're new to football you just
really want to enjoy the game it selects
the plays automatically for you and vice
versa if you turn it off you can go
ahead and manually select your place now
getting into some more gameplay the
Lions can't win game in the real seasons
so I'm gonna enjoy this score touchdown
and you guys can see the slow-motion
future one more time you get a few
options such as spin you guys can see
everything runs like I said smoothly
runs well and we're gonna hop over to
the defensive side where I'm gonna cause
a drop so overall I really enjoyed this
game I hope you guys enjoyed the review
if you guys are wondering about picking
it up if it's worth some money
I'd say if you're a big football fan
definitely pick it up if you're not
maybe so so wait wait till you can find
this on sale for about 4 to 5 bucks
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to check out the latest video and I'll
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
