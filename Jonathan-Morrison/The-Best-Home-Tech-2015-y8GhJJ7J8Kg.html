and this is the best home tech both
practical and downright awesome so first
up is the Wiggins home a Wi-Fi based HD
home security camera with a few tricks
up its sleeve
the aesthetics matter you'll probably
dig the looks of this it's simple clean
and doesn't take up a tremendous amount
of space now Withings advertises a 30
second setup but realistically after
downloading the app and pairing it it's
about a minute or two nonetheless it's
super quick simple and you won't want to
clayton kershaw it out the window it
features a speaker and microphone so you
can both input and output sound yes come
down here I got something for you what
the lens is super wide and you can see
how wide of an area captures here with a
little behind-the-scenes camera ception
action the companion app will alert you
of motion noise or even a dip and air
quality thanks to its air sensors but
you do have the ability to adjust the
frequency of notifications or turn them
off altogether what's sweet though is
being able to run through those alerts
as a journal where you can then playback
small time-lapse segments out of the box
you get two days of cloud-based
recording history but you can bump that
up to seven or thirty days now as of
recording this video that's invaded so
it's actually free but for the most up
to date info and pricing make sure you
check out the links down in the
description next up is the Lisa mattress
which brings the element of tech with
how they get it out and delivered to
your door this is a queen-size mattress
but you might not have guessed by
looking at it but once you unbox it
that's where the magic happens
now do you make sure you have a place in
an area with an adequate amount of space
take the plastic off and watch it expand
it instantly reminded me of those old
school magic toys that grew with water
so naturally you have to test the
mattress and I did first we played a
little game of trust pass with flying
colors next was the classic jump over a
chair on 180 FPS slow motion test
you
pretty solid but could it handle the
water in a glass Chuck and orangutan
shaped kettlebell test goddamn right
oh and it's comfortable too which I
guess is an important thing with a
mattress that is thanks in part to its
tri layer construction which equals
killer support plus if you're like me
and you get hot while you sleep the top
layer is cooling foam and who doesn't
like cooling foam
now obviously pricing depends on the
size of the mattress but if you need a
bed there is a special discount linked
down below following that is the flux
smart LED light bulb which is Bluetooth
enabled multicolored and can be
controlled by both Android and iOS
devices now it touts 16 million color
combos that's really just fancy talk for
a basic group of colors with slight
variations but it's awesome nonetheless
changing from color to color was smooth
and responsive and you can set up
control over a single light or group
them together you can also schedule
these lights to turn on or off at set
times and two specific colors so if
you've ever thought to yourself man
I'd love to wake up to blue lights but
come home to green lights you're gonna
go nuts with these seriously though they
work well they're cheaper than other
similar products and they add some
flavor to your lighting now I can
guarantee you most if not all of you out
there have either tried to play music in
your shower or wanted music in the
shower and if not so what had happened
here is a shower head and a Bluetooth
speaker and I'll pop this guy it's a jet
shower head with a built-in wireless
bluetooth speaker so now you can leave
your phone out of the shower and then
play or pause or even answer phone calls
with the speaker's buttons unfortunately
though you don't have the ability to
skip through songs which kind of sucks
but I don't think it's a deal breaker if
you're wondering how the speaker gets
power its removable and thus recharge
bowl just like most Bluetooth speakers
out there but I think the coolest thing
about this aside from the speaker is the
fact that the shower head is actually
good so you're not going to be rocking
out in the shower but have a shitty
shower head so last up is the most
practical and affordable on the listen
even though it's not flashy or fancy
it's definitely smart in the sense of
damn this is actually useful and this is
belkin's conserve socket now this might
seem really simple but it's also really
practical on the side there are three
time options half an hour three hours or
six hours once that selected time window
is over the outlet shuts off genius now
I can see this being useful for girls
who curl their hair those who iron their
clothes you're not going to be driving
to work and have an oh crap did I leave
that on moment or those who are just
downright forgetful of turning off
monix and that's going to eliminate
vampire power which is otherwise known
as phantom power where something may not
be plugged in but that outlet is still
drawing power so aside from that that
wraps up today's video hopefully enjoyed
it if you did and you are feel like
being awesome make sure to smash that
like button again everything is linked
down below do you guys have any
questions drop me a line or hit me up on
Twitter act eld today
this is Jonathan and I will see you guys
later shower head and a Bluetooth
speaker went to a park had a picnic pick
up some trash and volunteered at a food
shelter and I'll pop this guy okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
