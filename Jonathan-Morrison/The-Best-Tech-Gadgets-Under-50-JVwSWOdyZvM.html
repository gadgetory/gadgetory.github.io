another episode of the best tech
Engadget under 50 bucks today we are
kicking it off with a pair of truly
wireless earbuds that are a fraction the
price of air pods didn't get cracked in
the face with the ugly stick like the
clothes I just looked at and also
surprisingly don't sound half-bad so
these are the Axio - which are clearly
named after a very similar product in
the space but the idea and the intent
here is to be a budget alternative at a
much lower price point what if things
set up to me most of these though is the
fact that the pairing process was not a
giant smash your face into a desk
session because I think is what you'd
normally expect with most truly wireless
earbuds at this price point so the
headphones is what they're calling a
multi-function button what you're going
to do is hold this for six to eight
seconds and then once you see a red and
blue light blinking and alternating that
means you are ready to pair now normally
with other truly wireless earbuds you
would need to repeat this exact same
process with the other earbud cross your
fingers pray to Koreans use they somehow
didn't fall to sync and magically work
together at the end of this nightmare
but with these you simply power them on
and they are magically connected on top
of that I'm going to reiterate they
don't look ridiculous they're stealthy
they got that ear hook so they got that
sporty look to them and alternatively as
a result of that ear hook they're going
to stay in your ears really really well
so with these if you're going to use
them for working out or for running not
only are they going to stay locked down
in your ears they are also waterproof
that's something that the beach acts at
three times the price doesn't even offer
beyond that after all said and done if
these sound like garbage none of those
features matters the good news is they
don't sound like garbage they're not
going to be audiophile great headphones
they're not going to sound better than
the air pods the jaybird x3 the beats X
Wireless but for the price nearly a
third of the price point they actually
sound surprisingly good so next up is
the bright tech USB desk and table lamp
which is sitting right next to me truth
be told I actually ordered this for the
next death setup which is geared to hit
the $500 budget if you guys are excited
for that if we can hit 25,000 likes I
will drop that video this week so coming
back to the product there's no secret
that I love lamps
I love lighting and therefore I am
constantly on the lookout and this one
is special because not only does it
produce light it also charges your phone
now for sure if you're using this on
your desk let's say next to your
computer has an extra USB port to charge
your phone
really isn't that big of a deal but on
the flip side where I can see this being
more useful and more practical if
somewhere like next to your bed we can
then charge your phone at night now as
far as the lamp itself aesthetically it
is killer as much as I love colored
lighting I've really grown fond of
practical warm lighting like this
because it adds really relaxing tone to
the room I don't care for shooting video
or just coming home to your set up
having something that is aesthetically
and visually appeasing kind of just
makes you feel good inside and then and
then and then a friend man nephew I that
sweet iPhone right there no that is not
a jet white iPhone what it is is a super
clean skin from color where if you're
thinking yourself at the color war was a
company who did ridiculously awesome
paint jobs they just dropped a bomb and
the skin game on a serious note though
what separates color wear is our
expertise in paint and customization
where they can then apply it to the
skins which is also something truly
badass honestly they have one of the
coolest looking color options for the
Google pixel out right now and not only
are these under 50 bucks they actually
start at under 15 you get to check out
the link below for the endless amount of
customization but about 15 up with color
where to give away a custom wrap iPhone
7 next up is a really great-looking
wireless mouse from Lenovo is this is
the end of 50 which has this really cool
unique diamond prism design that would
look great on any desk it's actually
very similar in terms of looks and
design to a Logitech performance MX it
is less customizable that in turn yields
a lower price point right now this guy
is currently sitting under 40 bucks and
on top of a 10 meter wireless range it's
a nice touch of the fact you can
actually store the USB receiver when you
are taking this mouse on the go I
guarantee you at some point this is
going to make its way into one of my
videos because honestly it is really
hard to find good looking nice apology
Stuart little but the looks come by with
the fact that it functions well it's
nice even better makes this a fantastic
all-around wireless mount so next up is
the strange looking device on the camera
right here and while it may look funny
it's actually very useful for you
videographers out there so this is a
lens shifter and what it's geared for is
either to pull focus or to adjust zoom
in and out in this case because I'm
going to prime lens the only parameter I
can control is focus but in the case
we're at a zoom lens and you wanted to
control both focus and zoom there is a
matching red version so you can easily
tell us you apart
now I guarantee Samantha's going to say
that it's stupid I could pull focus with
my hand
what do you suck at video or something
Jonathan and to that I say once you get
past that mindset and start to use tools
like this to help you you can then take
your mind off the tedious portions and
therefore focus on the creative part
with also cool this is a fact that is
adjustable but it shouldn't work with
lenses ranging from 56 up to 98
millimeters in diameter and like I
mentioned it will work with both zoom
and prime lenses so if you're some other
shooting video may be struggling with
focus pools maybe is not as smooth as
you would like them to be something as
inexpensive and effective as this could
make all the difference in the world
so last up is the Lago beast and get
your mind out the gutter so this
actually is a multi-purpose charging
dock geared for lighting equipped Apple
devices I do think this looks best
honestly with the air pods of the Apple
TV remote if you do for whatever reason
want to charge your Apple wireless
keyboard you can but it looks silly and
again like most of the products featured
in this video not only is under 50 right
now it's actually under 20 it looks
great build quality is fantastic and
just like the mouse it's going to look
great on your desk the one thing I do
want to point out though is that it
seems like it's geared for Apple
specific lightning cable so if you want
to use with a third-party cable you're
not going to get the best results apart
from that though especially if you're
going to use this to dock and charge
your air pods
this is a great inexpensive option that
fits the bill perfectly
a side flat thank you guys very much for
watching if you're wondering how do I
win that sweet iPhone 7 details down
below and if you haven't I definitely
make sure you subscribe got a lot of
killer content coming up including the
$500 get set up
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later damn I wrote that I was like
