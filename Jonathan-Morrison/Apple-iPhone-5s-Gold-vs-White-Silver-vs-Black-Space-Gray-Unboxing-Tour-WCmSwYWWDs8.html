or online portfolio for a free trial and
20% off go to squarespace.com and use
the offer code TLD 9 hey guys johnathan
here with TLD with an unboxing of not
one not two but all three models of the
brand new iPhone 5s so I'll be taking a
closer look at silver Space Gray and the
extremely hard to find gold model and if
you were actually able to get your hands
on one of those let me know with a
comment down below so obviously the main
purpose of this video is to compare the
colors let you know the pros and cons of
each but I also want to talk about what
is new on the iPhone 5s and ultimately
what are my first impressions after a
day of using it now of course the
content within the box is going to be
the same so I'm not going to go through
each box individually but what you do
get with your brand new iPhone 5s is the
literature which includes the always
awesome Apple stickers followed by that
you get a set of Apple earpods which
actually sound pretty good for a set of
stock headphones if you happen to miss
my review last year I will have that
linked down below you then get the USB
wall charger nothing we haven't seen
before and last but not least the USB to
lightning connector now in terms of what
is new with the iPhone 5s because I know
aside from the new colors physically it
looks exactly the same as the iPhone 5
but there actually are some cool changes
and one of those is the touch ID
fingerprint sensor which I actually
posted a walk through earlier if you
haven't missed that I will also have
that link down below but essentially
what it does is allows you to unlock
your phone or verify iTunes and App
Store purchases just by using your
thumbprint and so far it works very well
also something new under the hood that
we couldn't see unless we took the phone
apart is the a7 processor this also does
feature the m7 coprocessor which works
in tandem with the a7 but I will cover
that more in my full review for now with
my initial impression is testing out the
iPhone 5s as you can see running
Geekbench right here it nearly doubles
the score of the iPhone 5 so there
actually is a huge performance
difference now in terms of how much all
that extra power translates into real
world benefits I'll know a little more
in a couple days but I do plan on having
a full comparison on the iPhone 5 and
the 5s so if you're excited for that let
me know by hitting that like button also
new are improvements to the camera and
yes it is still 8 megapixels and before
you freak out megapix
do not equal picture quality what's more
important here is the fact that the
sensor is now larger the aperture has
been widened and we now see larger
pixels much like we saw in the HTC one
so low-light performance is much
improved there is also dual LED flash
which again I will cover more in the
full review but from initial impressions
with the camera low-light performance is
awesome the iPhone 5s can now also shoot
120 frames per second at 720p so you can
get some ridiculously fun and awesome
slow-motion shots and honestly that was
the most fun I've had testing out a
feature on a new phone and here is a
quick sneak peek of what you will see in
the for review
right
right
so that pretty much wraps up this video
just giving you guys a little more
extensive look at the color comparison
so far after a day I'm kind of leaning
towards Space Gray I thought I was going
to lean towards gold just because it was
new and different but I generally tend
to lean towards black fronts on phones
just because you seem to get more
submersed into the content and the
subtle change with these Space Gray from
the slate on the iPhone 5 not sure what
it is about it but it just looks really
clean and there's something about it
that I really dig now if I to pick a
runner-up color I'd probably lean
towards gold just because it's new
the silver is clean it's classy it looks
great but we saw that exact same color
on the iPhone 5 so that is probably why
it is my least favorite at the moment
aside from that thank you guys very much
