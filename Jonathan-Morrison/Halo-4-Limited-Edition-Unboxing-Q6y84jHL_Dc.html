bringing you just a quick unboxing of
the halo 4 limited edition I say quick
because unlike some of the past special
editions for Halo titles this time
around we have one that is dominantly
digital content with only a few small
physical items accompanying the game
opening this thing right up we take off
the outer casing pop open the top of the
pocket and we can start taking out all
of the goodies starting with the special
steel game case that you can only get
with the limited edition after that we
have a couple little different packets
and folded up items including a mission
briefing for the events of the game a
schematic for Spartan armor and the ways
in which it can be customized and the
personal effects of a Spartan Gabriel
thorn lending some insights into the
events and backstory of this entry in
the series we also have this nice little
orange packet which includes the many
digital bonuses included in the Limited
Edition including a 14-day Xbox Live
Gold membership bonus armor and weapon
skin options a special avatar skin and a
cryotube prop additive a copy of the
live-action movie Forward Unto Dawn and
access to three war game map packs when
they're released so as I said pretty
skim on the physical bonuses and while
I'm usually not a huge fan of numerous
loose pieces of paper as collector's
edition items I will say that the
blueprint is pretty nice and could
easily double as a little poster with
most of the contents being digital it's
hard to say whether this Edition is
really worth the hundred dollar price
tag though a lot of that also comes down
to how much value you place on the movie
Forward Unto Dawn I must say I'm also a
little disappointed with the in-game
bonus content as usually when we get
bonus skins it's something a little more
definitive and stands out like a flaming
helmet whereas this time you just have a
few little extra lines or a small
insignia on your armor or making it
barely noticeable so there you have it
