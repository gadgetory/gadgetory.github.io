picked up a 2016 MacBook Pro this might
be the perfect setup
so without a doubt the centerpiece of
this setup aside from the MacBook Pros
LG's 27 inch 4k USBC monitor now it's
special about this is a USB see
functionality essentially turns a
monitor into a giant hub which is
awesome so with that the first thing I
did was take a little tiny Samsung t1
external SSD slap some 3m adhesive on it
and then mount that guy to the back of
the monitor
so the idea behind this is once you plug
your MacBook Pro into the monitor you
instantly have a second drive already
plugged in and ready to go
now as a quick note the Samsung t1 SSD
is actually an older discontinued model
so for anyone looking to pick this up
there's actually a newer t3 Drive which
I will link to down below move it on to
the dock set up the stand I use for the
MacBook Pro is the IQ Nicks Eden and
what makes this awesome is the fact that
it's adjustable so whether it's a
12-inch MacBook the 13 or 15 inch pro
whether it's this year or last year it
is going to fit perfectly this allows
you to rock a closed MacBook setup which
I think looks cleaner and neater and in
this case I can keep the cables nicely
tucked away one going to the monitor and
the second port going to the secret USB
C hub so if you're wondering what the
heck I'm talking about with the secret
USB C hub the objective of this entire
setup was to effectively go dongle as'
whether I was plugging in a USB Drive an
SD card I want to have to stick that
into something hanging out of the
MacBook Pro rather I wanted something
stealthy so what I did was take a USB C
hub from whoo - which bonus points is
also Space Gray I wanted this to live on
the actual desk and dock setup so what
if it was mounted underneath and with a
USB C extension cable I was able to run
it underneath the desk into the MacBook
Pro through the back and effectively use
it as part of the dock setup so now all
I got to do is plug something into the
front of the desk and it instantly shows
up on the MacBook Pro which is a giant
win now another thing worth mentioning
is the monitor is also charging the
MacBook Pro so in this case where I'm
using a 13-inch MacBook Pro was only two
Thunderbolt three ports it allows me to
maximize functionality
rounding out the setup as far as the
speakers go these are the kanto yu2
powered desktop speakers they're
definitely small but they pack a
surprising punch they connected via USB
which is awesome because it allows you
to bypass the need for external audio
card or a DAC it will make these
especially cool when you pair them with
the matching speaker stands which points
them at the perfect listening angle to
keep everything else clean and tidy I'm
using the Apple magic keyboard which
connects via bluetooth and as far as the
mouse goes this is the Logitech MX
anywhere Mouse which also connects
through bluetooth or through a tiny USB
receiver now because I know someone out
there is going to ask the lamp is from
Tommen's and it's one of my favorite
ways to spice up a setup I featured the
white model my back-to-school tech
this one is the newer updated model so
this setup is going to work great with
either the 13 or 15 inch macbook pro but
on top of that it's also a great option
for the 12 inch macbook if you are
looking for a convenient all-in-one dock
setup where you can take your macbook go
do your thing come back plug in and be
ready to go this is it the baseline 13
inch MacBook Pro handled the 4k display
no problem in quickly jumping back to
the monitor this is a fantastic display
the hub functionality is awesome but
more importantly the image quality is
phenomenal the brightness the color
accuracy and whether you're watching
video editing video or editing photos
this is a great pick up aside from that
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and he dug this set up make sure
to smash that like button I also got
word that the 15-inch MacBook Pro touch
bar is shipping this coming week so if
you haven't yet definitely make sure you
subscribe I will have plenty of coverage
on that again links to this entire set
up or down below this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
