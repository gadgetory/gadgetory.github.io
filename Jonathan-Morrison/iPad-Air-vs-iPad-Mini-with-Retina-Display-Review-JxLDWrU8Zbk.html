audible hey guys johnathan your TL d
hope you guys are doing better than the
bulls if you are a Bulls fan I feel your
pain if not go easy on me because the
rose news is so so sad anyways I am here
with a much requested comparison on the
brand new iPad air versus the iPad Mini
with Retina display because now the gap
between the two is smaller than ever
from the pricing to the hardware to the
performance so if you are up in the air
between the two this video will
hopefully help ease your decision now if
you happen to miss my comparison of the
first generation versus the second
generation iPad Mini I'll have an
annotated up here and also linked right
below that thumbs up button just in case
you missed it that video was more based
off speed test and performance because
the gap between those two were pretty
significant these two on the other hand
the iPad air and iPad Mini with Retina
Display the gap as far as performance
goes is much much smaller so this is
really going to come down to everyday
usage and how it actually fits into your
lifestyle so to kick things off the iPad
Mini with Retina display starts out at
399 lets them get you an a7 processor
and a 7.9 inch display with a resolution
of 2048 by 1536 400 bucks more the iPad
air will get you the same a 7 processor
and they both do feature the m7
coprocessor for motion processing you're
going to get these same 2048 by 1536
resolution but you're going to jump up
to a 9 point 7 inch display as opposed
to the 7.9 inch display on the iPad Mini
apart from that they're the same cameras
Wi-Fi connections battery life so you
can see there are a lot of similarities
so aside from the obvious form factor
differences there are a couple variances
that I want to point out starting with
the processor even though they both
feature these same exact a7 processor
the iPad air is clocked slightly higher
at around 1.4 gigahertz whereas the iPad
Mini is clocked right around 1.3 guards
now as far as how that translates into
actual performance if you just look
solely at benchmarks and Geekbench here
for example the iPad air of course does
score higher than the iPad Mini now as
far as how those numbers equate into
actual real-world performance I would
say 99% of the people out there wouldn't
tell the difference between the two as
far as gaming or snappiness they are
both blazing fast and to me there's not
enough there to solely base your buying
decision off benchmarks or a slightly
higher clock speed they both perform
really really well now the next big
difference is the actual display quality
not the size
the actual quality there have been
reports that the actual color accuracy
on the iPad Mini is subpar compared to
the iPad air I have used both in hand
and I will say it is noticeable but
again it's one of those things where the
majority the people out there won't
notice difference between the two I will
say I am a little disappointed that the
quality isn't up to the iPad air
standards but as far as how I use my
iPad it's more for media consumption as
opposed to creation so I don't need a
super super accurate display I'm really
going to rely on my computer for those
needs so with that in mind if you do
want to use your iPad more for creation
and photo editing and things like that
you need the accuracy you might want to
consider the iPad air now aside from
those two major points for me it really
comes down to Portability and how you
plan on using it in your life for me
before the iPad Mini I didn't really use
the iPad that much because if you put a
laptop or an iPad in front of me I would
always lean towards the laptop because I
can do more I'm gonna be on Final Cut
editing working being more productive in
my eyes not to say that you can't create
an iPad but before the iPad Mini like I
said I would always choose a laptop so
for me why I prefer the iPad Mini is
definitely the form factor it's more of
a complementary piece of tech now I can
use it alongside my laptop and not
really feel like I have to choose I can
consume mediate watch Netflix play games
because I do enjoy that form factor for
playing games and the iPad Mini it's
easier to throw on my bag with all my
camera gear it just fits a lot better
now I will say because the iPad air is
thinner and lighter the difference
between those two as far as weight goes
is pretty small the iPad air weighs just
one pound whereas the iPad Mini is just
about seven tenths of a pound so there's
not a huge gap there and that made it a
lot harder of a choice that I initially
thought it would be so watching movies
playing games with the iPad air was a
lot more enjoyable than it ever has been
before I can watch an hour-long show off
iTunes on the iPad air and it wouldn't
feel like my arm was straining so there
was a lot of good but ultimately just
wasn't as portable as the iPad Mini was
for me so that's kind of my thoughts on
who I think the iPad Mini is for as far
as who I think the iPad air is for if
you're going to use it as your main
computing device and you really don't
plan on using a laptop then obviously go
for the bigger screen it's a great
complementary item to a desktop so if
you don't plan on using a laptop or
anything in between
then the iPad air makes a lot of sense
another example that comes to mind will
be using the iPad in the kitchen I think
the iPad air would make it much more
enjoyable peace in your kitchen having
to see recipes on a bigger display and
things like that so if you really don't
need it so much for Portability and you
like the idea of a bigger screen
again the iPad air is probably going to
be a better choice for you again it
really comes down to how you're going to
use these in your lives you're not
getting any extra screen resolution on
either people are saying is it a big
difference between the two because the
iPad Mini is more dense because there's
more pixels and a smaller form factor
and to me it's not really a huge
difference they both look fantastic it's
not like one is better than the other
again the iPad air does have a better
color accuracy but as far as actual
sharpness they are both stellar so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
hopefully it helped ease your decision
between the two if you guys enjoyed this
style of video and thought it fit better
as opposed to more of a benchmarking
type video definitely know by leaving a
thumbs up it is much appreciated and of
course in return you get a virtual hot
Bob at Show face now before I hop out of
here I wanna give a huge shout-out to
audible calm for making this video

had actually bought these Steve Jobs
biography when it came out way back when
I had never read it now it has nothing
to do with me not liking it read I wish
I could read more optimist usually
really busy and when I do get free time
I usually want to put that towards
bettering myself with video production
or editing but with audible in
situations where I do have more time
like driving or Matt the gym I was able
to take advantage of that and actually
listen to the book so if you are a fan
of Apple it is definitely interesting
