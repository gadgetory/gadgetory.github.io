bring you our first impressions of dark
souls for the xbox 360 and ps3 now for
those of you that didn't play demon's
souls which is a ps3 exclusive this is
the spiritual successor that is now
multi-platform and it is ridiculously
hard basically the way the game plays is
that it's a third-person action RPG in
which you're basically just thrown into
the world and told just killed tons of
demons who will destroy you if you're
not careful the game is not try about
its difficulty there are several moments
in which you just feel like you're
screwed and that if you're not careful
and kind of plan out where your
positioning is you can easily get taken
out by a lot of enemies or just get
surprised attacked and one of the
biggest issues too is that when you die
you lose all of your accumulated souls
in humanity which are basically like
experience points if you don't get back
to your body where you died before and
you die again you lose it permanently so
you need to be very very careful about
how often you die and where because you
can really screw yourself over the long
run especially if you've been saving up
experience points not spending them on
things like equipment or stat ups I've
only played for about an hour so far and
I'm a pretty in progress considering how
well I did back with demon souls once i
get farther into the game and who knows
maybe even beat it if i can muster up
enough skill i'll let you guys know what
i think in the full review till then I'm
Kevin for TLD thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
