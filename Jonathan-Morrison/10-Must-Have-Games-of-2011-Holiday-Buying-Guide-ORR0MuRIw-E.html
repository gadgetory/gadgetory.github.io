now being the holiday season a lot of
games have been released in the past
month or so we thought it'd be a great
idea to give you guys the top 10 list of
those you should look out for as gifts
for people now this isn't exactly a
ranked list this isn't like my number
one of my number two games of the year
anything like that these are just ten
games that we think are great ones to
look out for to get for your friends and
family and we are placing an emphasis on
console games and throwing one handheld
into the mix now to begin with we do
have one of my personal favorites Elder
Scrolls 5 skyrim which is one of the
top-selling games of the year it's an
xml example of an RPG that allows you to
do whatever you want to do within its
own setting whether that's just to
continue the main quest killing dragons
running around protecting people or just
stealing anything that isn't nailed to
the ground then we have one of the other
big sellers of the year call of duty
modern warfare 3 a fast-paced action
shooter that's an excellent choice for
anyone looking for something that can
easily just jump into and play right
away along for quick pickup matches
whether it's free for all or team play
as well as featuring a solid campaign
that acts as a solid finish to the
modern warfare trilogy now of course we
can't mention modern warfare 3 without
also mentioning one of its biggest
rivals this year its tactical
counterpart battlefield 3 a game that
place is much heavier emphasis on being
an actual combat simulator rather than
just a straight-up action game featuring
larger Maps the use of vehicles and a
stronger team focused gameplay approach
by using classes next up we have batman
arkham city which does an excellent job
of doing the one thing it needs to do to
be a fun game making you feel like
you're freaking Batman having a strong
combination of intuitive combat
interesting stealth mechanics and a
storyline that can be enjoyed both by
hardcore Batman fans and casuals if
you've got a friend or a family member
who's a fan of one particular console or
another there are a number of very
strong console exclusives that came out
in the past months to begin with for the
xbox 360 we've Gears of War 3 the final
chapter in one of the 360s most
successful franchises offering a fun
gameplay experience for those who prefer
an over-the-shoulder shooter rather than
a first-person experience like mana
warfare or battlefield as well as having
one of the best hard modes available in
gaming today now for a ps3 exclusive we
have another third entry in a series
uncharted 3 a game that does an
excellent job of balancing out both
cinematics and gameplay narrative give
you a great combination of platforming
elements shooting and just simple melee
brawls here and there and a storyline
that is awesomely reminiscent of Indiana
Jones now this hasn't exactly been the
strongest year for the wii but nintendo
still knows how to make their first
party tells count and the legend of
zelda skyward sword acts as a solid new
addition to the series giving a great
combination of his
the traditions that everyone knows and
loves as well as having strong dungeon
design and some interesting new
mechanics with the wii remote plus i'm
moving on to the only handheld game we
have on our list Super Mario Land 3d for
the 3ds which is the first first party
Nintendo title come out that is not just
simply a remake of an old n64 favorite
featuring gameplay that is reminiscent
of new mario 64 while also adding
mechanics familiar to older games it's
definitely a title well worth picking up
for any 3d a center that has yet to
they're going back to some more
multi-platform options we have one of
the more surprising successful game
releases of this year with Rayman
Origins a game that harkens back to old
platforming conventions but also
features full four player co-op making
it a great experience to play with your
friends and that's some of the best
visuals to be seen in a 2-d game proving
that you don't have to have a game in 3d
just to be beautiful and last by at
least just a round out our list for the
fighting game fan out of your friends or
family there's ultimate marvel vs capcom
3 which even though it acts as more of
an update to a game that was already
released it hosts a new cast of 12 new
interesting characters as well as a
number of rebalances to the game's core
mechanics and is available for the
cheaper price tag of 40 bucks rather
than 60 we hope you guys found this gift
