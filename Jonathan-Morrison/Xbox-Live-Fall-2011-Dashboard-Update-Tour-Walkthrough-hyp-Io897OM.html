dena for those of you that didn't know
today was xboxes big update to their
interface I know it took a little longer
them to implement them they planned
their aim to release it this morning
most people didn't start getting it
until about a few hours ago in fact I
just got it about half an hour ago so
I'm on the later end of some people of
course one of the first big noticeable
changes is the interface itself they've
gone from the sort of row design with
different sections that they had before
to are now sort of boxed page designs
may have different pages you go through
with little box segments of what you
want to select they also now have a
dedicated app section so things like
Netflix last.fm they're all grouped
together each of these apps has received
a bit of a facelift and a change or also
seeing the addition of a few new ones
now today they saw the addition of two
new apps the first of which is epics
which is another option for streaming
movies which doesn't appear to be
working at this exact moment just yet
the apps there you can download a go
once you launch it there are no movie
selections to choose from as well as the
addition of today which is sort of like
a little news app that just has little
clips you can watch from recent events
now there are a lot more apps they're
planning to launch by the end of the
month if you actually go to the my app
store you can check out all different
ones they say are coming soon which
includes things like YouTube MSNBC HBO
or even sci-fi and depending on what
country and you might see a few other
channels or few different additions such
as BBC now one big thing that Microsoft
really wants to push that this update is
Bing integration which basically allows
you to use bing search all relevant
media content for different terms so for
instance if you look at something like
Skyrim you'll see different DLC add-ons
the game itself or even trailers for the
game or if you look other terms that
have both movies and video games linked
to them you can see them all together I
find it kind of be a bit of an odd
add-on because for the most part you
could find most things you're looking
for before easily just by browsing
through the relevant sections but some
people may find that makes things a
little easier to search for and if you
have a connect you'll also be able to
access being via voice commands you can
just use them like say Xbox Bing search
for whatever it is you're looking for at
the time now as far as actual gaming
relevant updates go there are two very
interesting new additions first off now
everyone has access to a 512 megabyte
cloud storage basically what this means
is is that when you have saved data for
a game you can choose to actually upload
it onto the internet that way when you
access through someone else's Xbox you
can download it through your profile
this is actually really cool because
that means that you can go to a friend's
house and still access your saved data
to play your parts of the games or if
you guys want to pick up a co-op match
at someone else's house the other
addition is what they're referring to as
beacons which is
basically way for you to tell everyone
to hey look I want to play this game
right now so instead of just waiting to
see other people playing games relevant
to you you can actually make a big post
that all your friends see that hey
you're really looking to find someone to
fight in say street fighter or more vs
capcom or modern warfare 3 it's just an
easier way to be able to try and make
some matchmaking with friends so that's
just a quick little review of all the
different new additions in today's patch
let me know what you guys think do you
guys like the new changes do you miss
the old interface do you like some of
the new app so you're looking forward to
some of the new ones how do you guys
feel about the major changes to xbox
live so let me know what you guys think
in the comments section as always guys

be extra also make sure that like button
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
