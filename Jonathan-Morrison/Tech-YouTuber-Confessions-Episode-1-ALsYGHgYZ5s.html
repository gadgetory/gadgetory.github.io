confessions tech confessions okay I
might have a couple of those kind of
confess don't tell anyone
he's a Mac it's doing care about that
yeah in the MacBook everyday MacBook
I thought you do gaming yeah see now
that well actually do that on netbooks
too sometimes but that's only because
I'm stupid why do you use a Mac
du bien welcome to tech confessions the
video I personally didn't think I would
ever make it was inspired because over
the past month or two as much as it
pains me to admit I've been using a
magic mouse and the big deal here is
I've personally gone on record and said
I don't like this Mouse terrible I
praised a lot of tech performance MX and
I don't know if it's just laziness or
partially enjoying the space grey color
or maybe deep down I like a little
slight aside scroll action but for
whatever reason every time I got on the
computer I realize I'm using it I think
to myself why the hell are using this I
only started using a mouse about two
months ago that's right I've been using
a Bluetooth trackpad for eight years my
very first job at a college I was a
software engineer and I saw my boss at
the time was using an external trackpad
and I thought I was weird that he paid
money to use a laptop trackpad outside
of the context of a laptop just beside
it instead and for some reason I bought
one because he was my boss and I was
like well if he's got one I got to use
it and I used that for eight years eight
years everything programming editing
making music everything I've used that
thing and I finally got a mouse two
months ago and it has changed my life
and it was not easy for me to admit but
that's my tech confession
I've kind of built up a reputation on
YouTube as an audio file which saying
out loud it sounds like the douchiest
thing ever yet my number one most used
pair of headphones is Apple earpods
which is so convenient I loved their
size I loved the battery life I love
that I can just pop them in my ear I
don't have a cable they automatically
connect to my phone I can walk away from
my laptop when I'm watching Netflix
they're just handiest thing ever no they
don't sound good
but they also don't sound well and at a
hundred and $69 I really really like
them and I use them more than anything
else the first might be as a tech
youtuber I buy every new flagship that
comes out lots and lots of cell phones
but my daily driver is a phone I bought
a year and a half ago the Galaxy S a
just haven't been worth my time to
change over yet makes me wonder what
kind of tech youtuber I really am on the
inside
also I'm team headphone jack don't get
me wrong but I was thinking the other
day when the last time I actually used
my headphone jack was there's been like
six months I still like it I still want
it but I don't actually use it as much
as I thought I did when it comes to the
iPhone I use a lot of stock apps I
actually like the Apple Mail app and the
Notes app I know there are so many good
apps out there to replace that but it
just seems simple to me
does that make me a noob and only for my
boy John when I go on the internet and
expose myself mess with my street cred
but for my tech confession even though
I'm a tech reviewer and I've tested tons
and tons of smart phones I am an
absolute terrible texture when it comes
to typing on smartphones
I am very slow I mean look at this the
quick
Brown listen I'm not even gonna go
and show how bad I am at texting but
that's that's me I'm not exaggerating
this is just how long it takes so this
is why I use you know keyboards like G
board and I can just swipe boom you see
stuff like that that's why I swipe
texting is horrible for me but you can't
come at my keyboard skills with an
actual keyboard I'm a beast at that
trust me but when it comes to a
smartphone I'm terrible the worst hey
I'm Brandon and the tech that I'm most
ashamed of is probably the August smart
law now this is the source of endless
ridicule from friends and a lot of
mental agitation the simple fact is it
just takes a ton less time to pull out
your key instead of waiting for Siri or
the August smart lock app to actually
unlock your door for you and that's not
even taking in the inevitability of Siri
just refusing to unlock your door for
you or your phone crashing and having to
restart it a couple times to actually
make your door unlock I don't really
have a great explanation for why I still
own this piece of technology or why I
still have it installed on my front door
mostly probably because I don't know how
to take it off but moral the story is if
you want to keep your friends and you
don't want to be made fun of don't buy
the August Mart home lock don't waste
your time and while we're confessing
things I have to get off my chest that I
am super jealous of the Apple watch I
wish there was an Android equivalent
that thing does so much anyway that's it
don't tell anyone talk to you later
as always links to everyone's channel
down below if you missed it I dropped
probably what is my favorite setup to
date is this crazy color-changing TV
media set up a link annexed to my face
and also down in the description
this is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
