Jonathan here,
and I am back with another episode
of the best tech under 25 bucks.
So, if you don't have a ton of cash,
but you've been looking
for some cool gadgets,
I've got some really
awesome stuff to show you.
So, first up are a pair of really red,
but also really affordable headphones.
These are from GranVela,
and the most attractive thing about these
is the price point.
They come in under 20 bucks.
Now, in addition to red,
this comes in a total of
seven different colors.
So, more than likely,
you're gonna have something
that fits your taste.
I think what surprised me most with these
is the amount of features
that are packed inside.
First and foremost,
these are Bluetooth so your are wire-free,
but just in case you don't have a charge,
it also comes with an included
3.5 millimeter audio cable
so you have that as a backup.
You have built-in media controls
so you can play, pause,
go preview a song, next song.
Even a built-in micro SD card slot
so you can listen to music internally.
A dedicated call button
and finally what I consider
to be the secret ninja
hidden feature on these
is built-in FM radio.
Now, as much as I love Spotify,
that's kind of a cool back-up option.
And when you pair that with
the micro SD card slot,
you could technically leave
your smartphone at home
and just rock these.
I think honestly, my
only concern with these
is going to be build quality.
They're not bad, but I question
how these will last up over time.
Again, the ultimate point
though, is for the price point.
If you wear these down to the
bone over six months or so,
it's not going to destroy
you to replace them.
Finally, as far as sound quality goes
these are on-ear headphones,
not over-ear headphones,
so you're not gonna get a
tremendous amount of volume,
but again for the price, the features
and a really overall well-balanced sound,
these are hard not to recommend.
Next up from there,
if you own a Nintendo Switch,
pay attention,
because the robots over at dbrand
got some stuff cooking
up that's gonna allow you
to customize it pretty
much any way you want.
Back when the Nintendo
Switch initially came out,
skins would actually destroy the Switch.
Luckily, dbrand has cracked
that code and you can see,
you got some pretty
fantastic color combinations.
So, you can skin each Joy-Con
and the Switch itself for under 25 bucks.
More than likely though
you're probably gonna go crazy.
You can also skin your
dock if you wanted to.
So, for the complete details
and all the endless possibilities,
I will drop a link down below.
One thing worth noting
is that these will work
best with gray Joy-Con's.
It's not that they won't
work with colored ones,
but for the best possible results,
definitely use the gray if you can.
Now in full transparency,
dbrand did not sponsor
this video in particular.
I am, however,
partnered with them,
so anytime you see me
mention them, just know that.
Just trying to make it clear.
They're amazing to work with.
They support the channel,
and whether you wanna skin your Switch,
your phone, or even your face,
make sure you guys check them out below.
Next up we're handing
off to my good friend,
Randomfrankp.
I wonder why he's random?
- What's up guys?
I'm Randomfrankp.
A big thank you to Jonathon
for having me on the series.
What I wanna show off for you guys today
is this two-in-one dock here.
It's actually a headphone hanger.
It has a built-in USB hub
for charging your smartphone
or anything like that.
It's gonna be a really great
addition to any desk setup
for only 25 bucks.
I'm sure you've seen
headphone docks in the past,
but probably not too many
can also charge your phone
or other devices.
On the front side,
there are three built-in USB slots.
Then on the sides, there
are these two of these wings
so you can mount your headphones.
Using the 3M adhesive,
you just stick it underneath your desk
and you'll be good to go.
And I've used two of my
heaviest pairs of headphones
when testing this and it
handled it all just fine.
Also, inside the box,
they include some cable
management mounting gear,
so you can route your cables efficiently
and it will keep your
cables from drooping down.
So, when it's holding your headphones,
you can see these little
grooves on the fins here.
This is so when you're
charging your phone or whatever
you can actually keep your
cables there in place,
so it's not gonna fall down
and they're always gonna
be at an arms reach.
Like I said,
I've been loving this.
Holds two headphones,
has three charging ports there for you.
Gonna really help keep clutter down,
and get you a proper place
to store your headphones
when you're not using them.
Now you've go no excuse having
a messy desktop anymore.
This is really gonna help you out.
Well, thanks guys.
Again, I'm Randomfrankp.
Throwin' it back to Jon.
- Thank you Mr. Randomfrankp.
Definitely check out his
channel if you haven't yet.
Next up,
if you like wood and you like alarm clocks
this might be the best day of your life.
Aesthetically,
what I love about this is how
simple and how minimal it is.
When that LED is off,
you honestly can't even really
tell that this is a clock.
It's compact, it's small,
and in addition to
running off of wall power,
you can also power this with batteries.
It makes a great travel piece of tech.
I know we have smartphones,
but sometimes it's nice
just to actually look
at a clock next to your bed.
It might not wake you up any better,
but still it is awesome to look at.
As simple as this guy is,
there's a hidden trick up its sleeve.
There's a mode where it
will shut itself off,
so in case maybe those
lights are bothering you,
you can't sleep with them on.
But, when you wanna wake it back up,
all you gotta do is simply clap.
You can yell at it.
- [Boy] Ahhh!
- Finally, you can tap it to activate it,
so I think it's a pretty
unique and handy feature
just in case you're
someone who can't sleep
with lights blinking around your face.
Next up from there,
maybe wood isn't your thing.
Maybe you're more into that retro look.
This Bluetooth speaker is badass.
If Bluetooth speakers were
a thing back in the 1950s,
this would hands down
be on Don Draper's desk.
But the plot twist is if
Don Draper was around today,
leave me a comment down below,
on what you think he'd be listening to?
Now, much like the headphones,
I think what surprised me with the speaker
is the amount of features
that are packed inside.
You have media controls,
there's a built-in SD card slot
and the volume control actually
is really easy to access
and feels great in the hand.
What's also cool is the little
built-in carrying handle
so you can grab this,
scoop it up and take the
retro wherever you wanna go.
As far as sound quality goes,
it's not gonna help perform
something like the UE boom,
but again it is a fraction of the price
and more so it's gonna sound pretty good
but you are overall buying
this for the aesthetic.
It's got a great retro look.
It doesn't sound bad,
but I think it adds a
nice flavor to your desk.
And for the price point,
it is a fantastic scoop up.
Thank you guys very much for watching.
Hopefully you enjoyed the video.
If you did,
and you are feeling like being awesome,
make sure to go Raphael
on that Like button.
Thank you guys again.
This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
