just want to give you guys a quick
rundown breakdown and first look at the
newly announced 2011 macbook pros happy
birthday to Steve Jobs by the way and I
also want to give you guys some buying
advice i've already got tons of messages
emails and tweets asking me which models
do i get so i'll try to help you guys
out with that in a minute let's go to
break them down starting with the two 13
inch models at 1199 you get a two point
three gigahertz dual-core i5 processor
four gigs of memory a 320 gig 5400 RPM
hard drive intel HD 3000 graphics and a
built-in 7-hour battery life now for 300
bucks more that'll jump you up to a 2.7
gigahertz core i7 processor you get the
same four gigs of memory you jump up
slightly from a 320 gig hard drive to
500 you get the same until HD 3000
graphics and the same seven hour battery
life move it along to the 15 inch models
for 1799 that'll score you a 2.0
gigahertz quad-core CPU its core i7 so
we finally get for physical cores on the
macbook pro super excited for that
alongside with that you get four gigs
memory a 500 gig hard drive you get the
same Intel HD 3000 graphics as the 13
inch models but you get a dedicated AMD
HD 6490 with 256 Meg's of gddr5 memory
love saying that word and a seven hour
battery life the next model up for 400
bucks more you get a 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core CPU the main difference
between those two CPUs is the 2.0
gigahertz quad-core that turbo boost all
the way up to 2.9 whereas a 2.2 will
turbo boost up to 3.3 on single core
applications you get the same for
giggles memory you jump up to a 750 gig
hard drive on this 15-inch model and the
biggest thing probably would be the
graphics card instead of Lee 6490 you go
up to a 60 750m which is one full gig of
video memory so if you're doing 3d
motion rendering after effects that will
help you out big time as far as that
goes in the 15 inch models last but not
least is the 17 inch model this will run
you 2499 essentially it's the same specs
as the high-end 15-inch model with a
slightly bigger screen you get the
resolution of 1920 x 1200 so that's full
HD if you're going to be editing videos
and if you're not sure what's to pick up
between the high end 15 inch or the 17
inch model it really depends what you're
going to be using it for if you want
something on the go we're going to be
traveling go for the 15
use model because it's more portable you
can always hook it up to an external
display like a cinema display or even go
by 24 inch monitor for two or three
hundred bucks and use that at home with
the wireless keyboard and mouse now if
it's going to be your main computer you
have no intentions of like binary
external display are using it with
anything else then I would opt for the
17 inch model because you're gonna get
extra real estate on the screen if
you're going to be editing HD video that
1920 x 1200 will help out not only with
that with photoshop after effects just
to have more screen real estate that
would help out personally in my opinion
let's go and go backwards to the 15 inch
models if you're not sure which one do
you get you get a 2 point 0 or the 2.2
personally I would opt for the 2.2
because you get a faster processor and
you also get a much better video card
you jump up from 256 megs all the way up
to 1 gig like I said if you're going to
be doing 3d after effects or motion or
anything like that that's where it's
going to help you out so 15 inch models
go to point to going back to the 13 inch
models if you're not sure between those
models between the 2.3 or the 2.7 I
would personally stick with the baseline
1199 model you're not going to really
notice too much difference going from
the core i5 to the i7 you get the same
integrated graphics anyways maybe if you
had a better graphics option on the 2.7
then I would opt for it but if you're
going to be looking for more power save
that money like I said put it towards an
SSD or memory or even jump up to the 15
inch which is actually going to give you
a quad-core CPU over the physical two
cores on the 13 inch models so to sum it
up if you're getting a 13 inch gets a
2.3 core i5 if you're getting a 15 inch
I get to 2.2 gigahertz that's 2199 and
lastly if you're not sure between a 15
or 17 inch model I really like select
comes down to if you're going to be
portable the 15 inch you can hook it up
to a monitor or the 17 inch I would go
with it that's going to be your main
computer and you have no intentions of
hook ended up sending things so hope
this helped let me know down below if
you guys are pick one up if you already
ordered one I want to know what
configuration you got I will try to get
my hands on a couple of these to review
them compare them for you get some
actual benchmarks other than that I'm
going to go try to run to the apple
store right now make sure to check out
our two latest videos I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
