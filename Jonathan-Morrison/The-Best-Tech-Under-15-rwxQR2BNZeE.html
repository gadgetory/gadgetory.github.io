hope you guys are doing well I am back
with a roundup of some of my favorite
tech and gadgets that all fall under the
15 dollar price point even some of them
under the 10 dollar price point so
without further ado first up is the core
DS by corking this is for anybody that
this has ever happened to for under 15
bucks this is an awesome tool to add to
your collection and step up your cable
management game it features a weighted
base so your cables aren't jumping all
over the place and has four slots each
of which are deep enough to where you
can actually stack multiple cables
within each slot if you so desire as you
can see this is gonna work great with
laptop chargers phone cables headphones
you name it
following that these are called cool
feet by blue lounge and these are pop on
suction cups which not only elevate your
laptop allowing for better airflow but
it also lets you rest it at a more
ergonomic level which makes typing much
more comfortable becomes they travel
pouch too large and too small feet and
then for adhesive discs which are meant
to be placed on the bottom of your
laptop and allow these suction cups to
reach optimal suck if you're worried
about the adhesive sticking to your
laptop or just plain out having an
eyesore I did try the suction cups
without those they did work and would
tend to fall off from time to time but
when it was stationary and doing what it
was supposed to do it really wasn't a
problem so keep that in mind if that's
something you don't want to dive into
obviously this isn't perfect by any
means but for the price point it's a
really neat cool little accessory to
have in your bag for traveling that way
you're going to get better air flow to
your laptop and also a better typing
angle next up at number three this is
the blue garuda magnetic car mountain
this is a sweet inexpensive way to mount
your smartphone into your car the base
clips on to the air vent in your car
which is dope because that means there
is no adhesive stuck to your car the
second part is a magnetic strip that
attaches one of three ways you can stick
it directly to the back of your device
which of course is lease optimal you can
place that plate in between your device
and its case or if your phone features a
removable back like this Galaxy Note 4
you just simply place the adhesive on
the inside of that
we're back up and bam you are good to go
so definitely to me this is the ideal
situation with the case come in a close
second if you're not really a fan of
either of those ideas I would probably
look to an alternate method but either
way for 10 bucks this is an awesome way
to mount your smartphone into your car
so by now I'm sure a few of you have
seen little dancing baby Groot cameo and
are wondering where you can pick one up
and yes I know this little dude bends
the rules a bit in the sense that it's
not directly tech but to me it's part of
the tech lifestyle and makes an awesome
addition to your desk and bring some
character to your setup plus if you
don't like Groot or guardians of the
galaxy I have no idea what is wrong with
you and the best thing about this is
it's not only under 15 bucks it's under
10 bucks also real quick to clear up any
confusion even though it says it's
dancing Groot this is not electronic it
is however a bobble head which is still
legit now last up today is the Amazon
basics high output dual USB car charger
and it's not fancy or flashy but it's an
essential piece of tech you should own
if you drive it's 10 bucks features twin
2.0 amp USB ports and 20 watts of power
it's clean compact and is optimized for
high speed charging on any 5 volt device
but do keep in mind this is just for the
car charger so if you need extra cables
I'll post a few of my favorite
inexpensive ones down below along with
everything you've seen in this video so
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully you enjoyed it and if you do
want to see more tech under-15 possibly
a version 2.0 of this let me and baby
Groot know by smashing that like button
and speaking of cool stuff under 15
bucks I want to give a big shout out to
Harry's for powering videos like these
because they are killing the Shave game
and have an entire month of shaving
supplies for only 10 bucks when you use
TLD at checkout on their Truman set what
you're seeing here is the Winston set
which is a little more premium but still
only 20 bucks
after that TLD discount but all of
Harry's kits feature killer precision
blades made straight out of their
Factory in Germany quit buying cheap
overpriced crap of the stores check out
Harry's and grab yourself an awesome
shave and a discount down below
