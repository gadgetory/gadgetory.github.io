here with TLD bringing you the unboxing
to the brand new ipod touch 4g for
generators whatever you want to call it
it's here got a little bit of luck i was
stuck it wasn't supposed to be here till
tomorrow but I went down to fedex and I
was actually able to pick it up early so
he's just the little cardboard FedEx box
that I came in ahead and toss that aside
nobody cares both that all right so we
have the ipod touch here it's got a nice
little white rapper go ahead and bring
that out we have the ipod touch sitting
there in the front let's see if you can
just pop that open probably have some
sort of tape on the side let's see if we
can find that okay here it is so even
the simplest thing like that makes it
all right so that just pops right open
and we have the ipod like I said right
there on the front very light very thin
cephas taped here pull that out slide it
out and let's see here we have your ipod
touch itself so on the front they have a
little sticker there that mocks the home
screen you just peel that off and there
is the ipod touch itself so i'm gonna
set that there for a second just take a
look and see what we get as far as
accessories fingertips so you had a
quick start guide you guys not using
this before we get the 30 pin USB
charger docking cable whatever and then
soldierknowsbest calls him shitty ass
apple headphones sure to have an
unboxing for this too and let's take a
look at the ipod touch itself now while
this boots up i'm going to turn this
thing on and we're going to compare it
with the is 14 got them side-by-side you
guys can see the iphone 4 is very thin
to begin what this thing is insanely
thin so let's go ahead take a more look
at this so right off the bat we have
them side-by-side turn out the other way
so you guys can see that put them right
there for you guys and as far as just a
quick specs going between the two really
i think this is as close to the iphone
as you can get without having AT&amp;amp;T in
the contract now to my knowledge the
only difference is obviously not going
to have the 5 megapixel camera and then
at the same time you're not going to
the noise cancelling microphone on there
so I do see built-in speakers and I'll
get some tests as far as the video
quality to see if it is the same but
they're you guys have it this is the
unboxing to the ipod touch 4g 4th
generation stay tuned for a lot more
videos on this reviews comparisons and
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
