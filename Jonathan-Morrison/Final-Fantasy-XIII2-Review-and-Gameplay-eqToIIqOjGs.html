bring you my review of final fantasy
13-2 for the xbox 360 and ps3 now I have
to admit I wasn't the biggest fan of
final fantasy 13 for a number of reasons
varying from how they handled the combat
system to how the characters were just
designed as well as the plot itself I
didn't hate it as much as some long-term
fans did but it definitely wasn't my
favorite as a result I didn't have the
highest expectations for 13 too
especially considering squares history
with direct sequels to their games and I
have to admit I was completely caught
off guard by how much fun I found myself
having with this game now being a direct
sequel the game uses the exact same core
rules as 13 including the use of the
paradigm system in which rather than
directly controlling each character
individually and picking actions instead
you pick overall roles for the team to
use and overall team strategies to
follow what's different this time around
is that rather than of a full cast of
characters to choose from you know have
to lead characters that have access to
all six roles as well as having a third
slot dedicated two different monsters
that you can tame and raise to fight for
you each of the monsters that you can
tame uses only one of the six rules that
are available to the main characters and
rather than leveling up to the use of
experience they use items that are
dropped from similar enemies it's really
straightforward and easy to pick up
system and each monster has its own
little perks and unique abilities making
interesting different choices instead of
just having a few main ones and they
have a large variety of choices ranging
from little cat creatures that act as
healers two gigantic behemoths they're
just wreck enemies with melee attacks on
top of this the game also gives you a
small degree of customization with your
monsters being able to give them a
number of different nicknames or being
able to customize their appearance to a
small extent like giving them hats now
both characters and monsters grow using
the crystarium system which has been
simplified since final fantasy 13
instead of each individual role having
its own tree that you have to develop
now a character is a single tree and
each time you level it up you pick which
role you want to do so each time you get
different status based on that role as
well as unlocking abilities when a
particular role hits a certain level
once enough level ups are gained the
crystarium system itself expands and
offers a special one-time power up for
instance unlocking a new role improving
the status for a particular class or
even granting you certain special
abilities this shift makes level ups
occur much more often I'll be it with
much smaller gains each time now while
the game does offer some minor changes
from the original as far as the core
rules go is a real shining difference
lies in its storyline and the manner in
which it flows now not wanting to give
away too many details for those you that
want to play the game I will tell
one of the central notes of it is that
the game does revolve around time travel
and as a result it has a much more
episodic feel than some of the other
final fantasies players will travel to a
number of different locations taking
place in different times and may even
revisit the same location in different
eras causing the midden otis differences
and how time has changed them and they
may even create their own alternate
realities where you see how things have
changed as a result of things you've
done in history each note in the
timeline has its own little story and
serves like a little mini episode and
one brought together they form the
overarching plot of the game the game
also has the interesting feature of
letting you lock time gates so you can
restart a particular episode allowing
you to re-experience storyline make
different decisions or even cause
special paradox alternate endings there
are also a number of special wild time
gates which require hidden items
throughout the game to unlock and are
completely unnecessary for the main
story but add number of interesting side
quests and special areas to explore
which are grant new backstory or new
admissions for characters complete as a
result the game fixes 1 upon fancy their
teens biggest flaws and that is much
less linear both in terms of storyline
and level design now these changes aside
the game doesn't here at some of its
weaknesses from its predecessor the
combat system solar wolves are on
pressing x repeated label changing
strategies so go into an offensive
boudic pressing x then go to defensive
mode press X go to offensive mode press
X again so on so forth it can be a
little more interesting if you have a
particularly tough fight but since
characters seem to level up so fast
there ever really seems to be much
challenge in any of the fights in the
game even in some of the final bosses
now the game does try to vary up combat
a little bit and add some new features
for instance now there is a sort of
QuickTime event feature that takes place
during a certain boss fights sometimes
in the middle sometimes at the end it
does give a little interesting cinematic
feel to it but it doesn't really add
that much and to be honest it feels
almost unnecessary given how often it
occurs another problem for the game is
that while the storyline can be very
entertaining and each particular episode
is fun the overall concept of time
travel is extremely convoluted and the
game doesn't do a very good job of
explaining why certain changes occur
based on your actions as a result this
may cause some players to lose interest
in the story midway through especially
if you're looking for some form of
consistency in their concepts of time
travel overall final fantasy 13-2 is a
surprising improvement over its
predecessor and while it doesn't fix all
the problems it does do a good job of
making it much more appealing for fans
of the series if you like the first
Final Fantasy other team then you'll
definitely love this one and even if you
didn't you might still want to give this
one a chance as it just might catch you
off guard that's our review

chance it make sure to check out our
previous vids and if you want to be
