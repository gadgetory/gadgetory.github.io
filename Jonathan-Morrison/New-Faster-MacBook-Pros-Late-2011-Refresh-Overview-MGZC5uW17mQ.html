TLD coming T guys at a complete random a
shower it is three thirty in the morning
California time so it'll probably like
morning for you East Coasters by the
time you see this video but I got hooked
reading these steve jobs biography
downloaded to my iPad Kindle app got
hooked and now I'm here so if you guys
want to check that out i'll post a
kindle link as well as the physical copy
it's like 17 bucks on amazon and the
iBooks link if you guys prefer that that
is all in the description also if you
guys missed the 60 minutes Steve Jobs
special does it completes replay that
you guys can check out the description
as well now the whole reason I'm making
this video is that Apple pulled a ninja
move on us they were super sneaky super
quick but they actually just updated
every single macbook pro in the apple
store or the online store but you know
what i mean so let's go and test my
memory at three thirty in the morning
let's see how much I have this down so
we're going to start with the 13-inch
MacBook Pro all the prices are the same
there was no changes to design no
physical changes just internal speed
bumps so the 13-inch macbook pro still
starts at eleven ninety nine but instead
of going from a two point three
gigahertz core i5 dual-core CPU that's
bumped up to a 2.4 gigahertz dual-core
i5 CPU still the same integrated
graphics same 1280 x 800 resolution
there were some hard drive tweaked so
you can check out the complete details
of that in the link below of a complete
recap of all the specs now the 1499
13-inch MacBook Pro that was once a 2.7
gigahertz dual-core core i7 now it is a
2.8 gigahertz dual-core core i7 again
same integrated graphics all that same
jazz as the previous 13-inch the 1199
base model moving up to the 15-inch
MacBook Pro the 1799 model used to have
a 2.0 gigahertz quad-core i7 CPU was a
60 750m video card with 256 Meg's of
video memory now it has a 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core i7 CPU and it bumped up the
video memory to 512 Meg's so it's
actually a pretty awesome deal for the
exact same price now for the 2199 model
that used to have a 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core i7 now that comes standard
with a two point four gears core i7 same
video card 6770 and with one gig of
memory as well as the same screen
options on the 15 inch so it comes stock
with a 1440 x 900 resolution or you can
upgrade to a anti go
they're 1680 x 1050 high-res version
there's also a 2.5 gigahertz built to
order option which turbo Slyke 3.6 is
pretty crazy for a quad core macbook pro
that'll cost you a little bit more again
you have different hard drive options
again you can check out the complete
recap in the link in the description now
for the 17-inch MacBook Pro which is
huge I would almost consider a laptop
because it's 17 inches obviously 1920 x
1200 resolution it weighs a ton but that
starts out with a 2.4 gigahertz
quad-core cpu you can bump that up to
the same 2.5 like on a 15-inch same
video card I like jazz but this has a
bigger screen obviously with a higher
resolution and then you do have the
expresscard slot on the 17 inch model
only so hopefully i covered everything
for being now it's probably like 3 45 in
the morning but i hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you guys haven't already
make sure to check out my iphone 4s
review i think you guys will dig that
again all the info on the macbook pro
refresh goodness that you could possibly
want that is in the link in the
description if I haven't already said it
again check out my iphone 4s review you
guys will dig it I will see you guys
later I'm gonna go catch some sleep
play the next song change it yourself
you lazy son of a bitch play the next
song speed off the treadmill no speeding
up the treadmill hear you mother
starting review what's going on guys
Jonathan here with TLD with my full
review to the iphone 4s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
