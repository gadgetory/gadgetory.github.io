+ 5 t so alongside the 1 + 5 t get the -
charge USBC cable is a power brick
QuickStart guide sim tool and if you
flipped that QuickStart guide you get a
not that great of a case but it's still
cool that they included it so today I
want to break this down into five things
to know before you potentially go out
there and buy a 1 + 5 t unless you're a
1 + 5 owner and you're probably a little
upset I'm sorry
what that said though the first thing I
want to talk about is pricing now there
were rumors that the 1 + 5 t could cost
upwards of nearly $700 does that upset
you
take a deep breath you'll be happy to
hear the 1 + 5 t starts out of $4.99
that'll get you 64 gigs of storage with
6 gigabytes of RAM or alternatively you
can double your storage a bump that ramp
up all the way to 8 gigabytes for 559
now I've seen the argument you can pick
up an unlocked Galaxy s8 in the $500
range on Amazon but to clarify those are
refurbished models cheapest new Galaxy
has head I've seen it's about six
hundred and thirty bucks right now
regardless so I will link both of those
down below I'm curious to hear what
sounds more enticing a refurbished
Galaxy S 8 or 1 plus 5t next up is
probably the biggest change to the 1
plus 5t and that is the display oneplus
is finally joined that 18 by 9 super
tall screen party so this essentially is
a 6 inch display 2160 by 1080 which may
be a turn-off for some of you
enthusiasts out there again given the
price point I think the screen looks
fantastic and if you need more
resolution you can hop up to a Galaxy S
8 or even the fan favorite the LG B 30
what's nice with this though you stack
it up side by side against the oneplus 5
the form factor really hasn't changed
you were just getting a taller display
because of the display though you do
lose the fingerprint reader on the
bottom that effectively is moved towards
the back in a much better location in
galaxy s 8 or no date it's right smack
in the middle and it works really well
not the event oneplus was not shy to
take shots at Google and their pixels to
display issues and for those curious
about the 1 + 5 t I have not seen any
blue shift on this phone it looks
fantastic and again the only potential
drawback for some of you out there is
it's a 1080p display never know
third thing to talk about is the camera
or dual cameras brethren still features
a 16 and 20 megapixel sensor just like
the oneplus 5 did but what's kind of
weird is that secondary lens is no
longer a telephoto lens it's the same
exact focal length the same exact
aperture and from what I understand
oneplus is claiming that the secondary
lens is going to be a low-light lens so
when it knows you're in a lower light
situation it's gonna opt to use that one
instead so what that comes a couple
different things one port remote will
still in fact work the only difference
is because those are the same focal
lengths the image will no longer be
cropped now number two when you punch in
on the 1 + 5 t camera that zoom is
purely digital so to give an example of
how everything looks here's a shot
taking on the 1 + 5 t here's that same
shot punched in I'm curious to know what
you guys think of the quality same thing
here is a shot straight out of the 1 + 5
t camera and as we zoom in I gotta say I
don't notice too much in terms of a
quality loss but it's still kind of
weird to me that they opted for no
telephoto lens now this here was one of
my favorite shots and a couple notes one
this was using that fake digital
telephoto zoom in and - this was not
using portrait motors just straight out
of the camera now from there as far as
low-light goes I actually got a pretty
amazing test thanks to mr. Linus tech
tips and the event was super dark so
here is an example of the flash and the
1 + 5 t looks very nice from there brace
yourselves
this was straight low light no flash or
anything you're welcome
from there here's a quick selfie shot
from the 1 + 5 t nothing special or
magical but still really solid I gotta
say overall first impressions with the 1
+ 5 t camera are really good now from
there the fourth thing to talk about is
there is now face unlock love the name
now on the 1 + 5 t what I can tell 1
plus is not banking on this being the
primary form of security on this phone
especially because you can only use it
to unlock things as far as purchases go
you must use your fingerprint and do
those with that said though setup was
insanely fast and I think the unlock
process may be even faster no joke you
literally pick up the phone hold it up
to your face and you are in the phone so
is face unlock a game-changer on the 1 +
15 no but if it's a super fast and
convenient way to get into the phone and
for those who still want that trusty
fingerprint reader you get the best of
both worlds now the last thing I want to
talk about is the 1 + 5 t isn't that
much different than the 1 + 5 the weird
part
one plus five was not released that long
ago so I'm sure some of you out there
who just bought that phone gotta be
feeling a little left out the dark they
did this last year with the 1 + 3 + 3 T
so it's kind of citing a track record to
not buy the first iteration of the phone
the other kind of weird part too is this
so lately a year we're getting closer to
the galaxy s 9 or samsung is probably
gonna cause the galaxy has 10
either way though it's really late in
the year and from that I'm curious to
know what you guys think of this now at
the event oneplus kind of defended this
by comparing it to a software update in
the sense that if you had the ability to
upgrade hardware why wait a year for me
just kind of feels like this is what the
oneplus 5 should have been based off of
reactions on Twitter or at the event I
think most people would tend to agree
granted are some pretty solid updates to
oxygen OS which is super clean and
customisable one feature in particular
that I think is really cool are parallel
apps so for example maybe up to Twitter
accounts - Instagram accounts - Facebook
accounts you can actually have parallel
versions of these where you're logging
at the same time and choose which one
you want to launch from there maybe the
one post fire really didn't do it for
you how about buying that now the one
plus 5t makes way more sense aside from
that hopefully toward the video if you
did and you're feeling like being
awesome make sure to go super sexy
lioness on that like button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
