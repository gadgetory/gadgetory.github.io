new Mac Mini now that it's updated and
not 28 years old is the fact that you
can essentially build out your perfect
setup like Steve Jobs once said BYO dkm
now clearly the Mac is mini the desk
under their hand not so much in the
ongoing series of me butchery and IKEA
names the desk is called the MA Colby
maka by mochel be someone please correct
me in the comments below but regardless
this desk is big boy certified also pro
tip if you're looking for a desk at IKEA
don't look in the office section the
best ones are in the dining area for
real now huge moji hands to viewsonic
for sponsoring today's dream desk
because that monitor behind me just like
the desk is big with three G's this is
the VP 38 81 which is a monster 38 inch
ultra wide display that is packing six
million pixels in a beautiful curved
package seriously if Andre the Giant was
chef enough videos this would be his go
to monitor it was so big that's the
reason why we had to go pick up a dining
room table because a normal desk would
not accommodate this curved colossal
beauty now this is plate isn't just big
and beautiful it's actually a really
awesome choice for content creators you
of course have that big curb display so
you're immersed you're pulled into your
content whether it's photos whether it's
videos and on top of that you have 99%
srgb coverage and this also supports HDR
10 in this case with the Mac Mini
because the monitor supports USB 3.1 it
works perfectly but you also have hdmi
and displayport so if all that sounds
amazing you guys want to check this
monitor out there's actually a special
deal
link down below
from there if you couldn't tell we got
this beautiful space great dark theme
going on and shout out to the og Black
Power Ranger everything from the Mac
Mini to the speakers to the accessories
the mouse the keyboard the wireless
charging everything is now with the set
up yet we got tons of space great but
there's also some blue tones going on so
it's time for a little lamp love this is
the for stuff from Ikea just keep on
butchering names but it's got a little
bit of that space gray a little bit of
that blue and kind of complements
everything perfectly now for the
speakers these are the MX sound from
Logitech they look great but they're
also relatively inexpensive so maybe
you're not ready for that entire desk
overhaul just yet but you're looking for
a step of an audio these are a fantastic
choice sound wise these are relatively
compact but they will punch you in the
face without you known it's pretty big
considering the size and what's also
really cool the Z's are blue too so in
this case it's one less wire and it's
keeping everything nice clean and tidy
now going back to the Mac Mini Y I think
it's a really good option is you are in
control of everything so if you want
just some equity in a monitor you can do
that or in my case if you want just a
little more power I added a Blackmagic
external GPU which makes a huge
difference for video editing it also
doubles as a hub is looking really good
in Space Gray and normally on an average
size desk I would say things will be
cluttered but this thing sits perfectly
on this giant setup now going back to
the keyboard and the trackpad I went
with this option to keep things super
clean and simple but if you're more of a
mouse kind of person you could easily
swap that out but in this case I kind of
just really like one the Space Gray look
and how everything flowed together it
was kind of like the secret sauce of
this setup though one of my personal
favorite us is the native Union wireless
charger which kind of sits there
perfectly kept nice and tidy between the
crevice in the middle of the desk all
stealthy ninja like most phones charge
wirelessly these days so having an
option in front of you easily accessible
and also not looking like an eyesore is
really handy also what would a tech desk
set up be without a plant and baby grew
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
