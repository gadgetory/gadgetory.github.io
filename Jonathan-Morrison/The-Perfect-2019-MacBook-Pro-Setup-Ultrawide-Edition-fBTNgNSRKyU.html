perfect MacBook Pro setup this is the 5k
ultra wide music edition
to say get you must be contagious
looks like there's no master
speak
so meet Jacob and Sita two of my
favorite human beings but also two of my
favorite artists I've used countless
tracks there's my videos you guys can
too if you want to check them out a
music bed which I will link to down
below but yeah Jacob is a super gifted
mixer producer and Sita is this crazy
talented songwriter with an amazing
voice so the heart of this setup really
comes down to two main elements one a
15-inch MacBook Pro this is the Vega
update that happened late last year and
then of course we have this giant but
also beautiful 34 inch ultra wide 5k
monitor from LG which is bananas so a
huge reason I chose and wanted to
highlight a macbook pro for this setup
is the flexibility that it gives you not
only can you create in a desktop like
environment but essentially anywhere
which is huge for jacob and his creative
process a lot of times when i'm mixing
or i'm producing a beat like i like to
go to many different places like i feel
like if i stay in one place all the time
like i I start to not know what I'm
hearing because I'm just you know seeing
one thing over and over again so I like
to take my laptop go upstairs and then
go from there I'll go outside or go to a
coffee shop or just go anywhere because
I can take it anywhere I want to go so
yeah it's perfect for the road or on the
couch but I also wanted to complement
that with the 5k ultra wide so you get
the best of both worlds and that big
immersive desktop experience
this is packin a ridiculous resolution
of 50-120 by 2160 and especially for
music production when you have plugins
and multiple windows that extra screen
real estate is essential it's been great
you know like when you get the white
monitor you're just like you like
looking really far like oh I didn't know
I had those muscles it's beautiful like
I love all of the hub like the hub on
the back you can just put everything in
there you can hide your wires like God
knows like my desk just looks so
terrible at the time but this makes it
very easy and seamless rounded out to
set up I added a wireless keyboard and
mouse from Logitech this is my favorite
pair and of course got to add a splash
of Philips hue to really bring some cool
vibe to the entire setup now in order to
get music into the MacBook you need an
interface and Jacobs weapon of choice
for this setup is the app as you do it
which is really awesome it's
for those looking to step up their
quality but don't necessarily really
want to break the bank I just love how
portable it is it doesn't require a
power supply it sounds amazing like I've
had the symphony I've used a symphony
for a long time and I think it's it's
comparable it's it's amazing how much
they packed into such a small device
that is then connected to these monster
audio monitors the full count
twin six bees which oh my goodness these
things sound amazing I got these because
trach mixes all of his records on them
and I was fee sewed as good as Drake no
I just I actually did consider that when
buying these monitors but they're just
very accurate they give you a very
balanced mix coming out of the monitors
so you know exactly what you're hearing
you don't want the monitors to be too
close to you and also not too close to
the wall so you want them to be like
equidistant from the wall and also
equidistant from your two ears and the
the two tweeters which are the little
things at the top they should be hitting
your ears like this when you're really
trying to mix things right and of course
like the most important thing
aside from monitors is having a treated
room so you want bass traps in the
corners and the thing that I didn't do
until I moved to Nashville was I have
the cloud like straight up above my head
and that's really important because you
don't want the bass to be bouncing off
right on top of your head and coming
down and hyping the bass so you don't
mix it properly now the secret sauce the
Jacobin seats has tracks besides a ton
of talent is the microphone preamp combo
we use which consists of a fleecy 12
that is impaired with a DW from preamp
which adds a ton of warmth and it just
sounds beautiful
it basically emulates like to the T like
what a brand new like c12
Telefunken microphone would sound like
from like the 1960s but it's much more
reliable and with those old microphones
they all sound different because there's
a different wear and tear on the parts
but this is like a brand new like old
microphone and it just sounds incredible
it's the build quality is fantastic flea
microphones like hands down like I think
they're the best microphone company
opinion and then with that we use the
the DW fern pari which is just like it's
just butter it's like you just that with
the mic and you just have a beautiful
clear three-dimensional to be warm sound
and it's it's not hyped and you can just
go to town on your plugins and it just
it sounds amazing
so yeah that is some really pro level
amazing gear but what I love about Jacob
is his open-mindedness to create
essentially with whatever you have which
is really encouraging for anyone looking
to get started you know I there's really
no need for me to have like any outboard
gear whatsoever because there's a
plug-in for just about any piece of
outboard gear that you can possibly
imagine with companies like splice and
noise like the possibilities are
limitless like there are no boundaries
for music you can create any sound that
you hear and in the beginning what I
would hear in my head I couldn't
actually translate into a beat but now I
feel like I can actually do that freely
and because I had to wait for so long
like I appreciate it so much more and
I'm so happy for it so huge thumbs up to
Jacob and Sita for being awesome humans
for letting me hang and putting that TLD
splash on there setup and also making
awesome music which you guys can check
out on Spotify and also even use in your
own videos through music bed which I
will link to down below hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did you want to
see more like this make sure you guys
