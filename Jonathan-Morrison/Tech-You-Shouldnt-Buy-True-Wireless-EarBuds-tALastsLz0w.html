with some wireless earbuds.
- That's true, actually, I've probably
done more than dabble in fact.
- [Jonathan] Hey guys, Jonathan here.
Sometimes in life there are things that
no matter how much you tell yourself
you shouldn't buy, you
still kinda want to.
This happened to me when
I was walking through
Best Buy and saw these
truly wireless earbuds.
I knew they probably
weren't gonna be that good,
but that didn't stop me,
I ignored the responsible
part of my brain and got them anyways.
Honestly I think the packaging played
a little part in luring me in.
It was simple but clean,
and so much in fact
that it even impressed a certain
someone who's unboxed a thing or two.
- Oh, you know what though,
there's something there.
Hey, let me just, one second.
If you're out there, you're watching this,
and you're some kind of company,
take note. Look at this.
Mag- Oh god...
The potential to lose it,
look how tiny that is.
It's not connected to anything.
Beautiful look, they put the instructions
right on the other side.
Actually you know, I
can kinda get with that.
- That's high tech, it's
like the Men in Black.
- Erases my memory, yeah.
- [Jonathan] So what that
Men in Black looking thing
actually is, is the capsule
that not only houses but
also charges the earbuds as well.
It's made out of solid aluminum,
looks futuristic and fancy,
and the idea of how this is
supposed to work in theory
is cool but execution is poor.
Because of the capsule there aren't any
power controls on the earbuds whatsoever.
So the idea with that is when
the earbuds are outside of the
capsule they're on, and
when they're tucked away
and closed they are then turned off.
This is a little annoying
because you're not
ever quite sure how charging is going,
paired with the thought of, &amp;quot;Did I insert
these into the capsule correctly?&amp;quot;
And on top of that with
all of these little parts
that are screaming to be lost,
the margin of error is minimal.
- So, no joke, shooting
a video on this guy
talking about how small
it was, how you could
potentially lose one of them very easily;
I dropped one in the rocks,
and I spent the last 10 minutes
digging rocks around and
you can see, thank goodness,
I found it but you can see
what I'm talking about.
- Oh my god, I might have to take back
what I said about this experience.
Jon likes to go to the gym,
you know he gets on the
treadmill, he's got his outfit
on, better for his knees.
Don't bring up knees again, man.
My knees are damaged alright.
- Hockey's dangerous.
- The smaller ones are rubber,
and the larger ones are foam.
I'm gonna put the rubber ones on,
my feeling is these are kinda
the standard, the stock ones.
See how that fits on there.
You might not know why
he brought this here,
but he's paying homage to a very special
moment in both of our lives.
♫ Kind of love that lasts forever ♫
- This thing's been on a
charger for three weeks.
Okay listen, I might have exaggerated on
the three weeks thing; okay one hour.
- They're lightweight for sure.
That's max?
- Max.
- Okay, I'm gonna be respectful
because of the fact that they're so small,
you want me to react right now right?
(static)
- Okay I'm gonna be respectful because of
the fact that they're tiny
little, little things.
And you have to kinda limit
your expectations based on that.
I'm not blown away, I'm not like I can't
wait to put those back
on and listen some more.
There's not quite as much
thump as I'm looking for.
Maybe the convenience for
you outweighs that fact,
but at $250 I'm like...
- [Jonathan] So as a
whole it is really hard
to recommend these, and
even though I would strongly
advise against picking these
up, what I would recommend
is heading over and checking out the
Amazon reviews for some entertainment.
For the price of these
you can grab not only a
really good pair of
wireless earbuds, but also a
really good pair of wireless headphones.
Oxy posted a few different
combinations and models
down below that are a much
better buy than these.
So with that hopefully you
guys enjoyed the video and
if you wanna see more
tech you shouldn't buy
drop a like, this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later.
- That's a hell of a way to end a video.
(beep)
- Austin just informed me
before we started shooting
this video that he's put on
like 28 pounds of pure muscle.
Don't look at him sideways.
Don't get in his way, for your own good.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
