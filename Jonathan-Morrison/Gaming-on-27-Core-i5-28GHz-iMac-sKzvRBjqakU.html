with TLT we're gonna be testing out the
new core i5 27 inch 2.8 gigahertz iMac
the one that was just released about a
week ago so we're going to be testing
out how it does with gaming so it comes
loaded with the ATI 5750 that has a gig
of video ram so let's go ahead and go to
the settings now by default I'm running
killing flow right now so by default
this only goes up to 1920 by 1200 so I'm
going to set it to 1920 by 1080 we're
going to run everything to the highest
settings now I'm gonna show you guys a
keyboard shortcut on how to get the max
2560 1440 resolution for your iMac so
it's going to go back now right here
you're going to press the tilde key on
the your Mac keyboard and that's going
to allow you to do a key command so
we're going to go to set res space 2560
by 1440
so that's going to kind of reset
everything and now we're going to get
the maxed out 27-inch iMac
display so now we're running that like I
said 2560 by 1440
and this is going to get your Mac
setting for this now we also want to
check the frames per second so you go
stat FPS and now it's going to give you
a little counter up top so we're running
everything maxed out and you guys see
initially I don't know you guys can't
see that on the screen but we got about
150 average so that'll change when you
get into the game let's go and start
playing so we're going to go in there so
now we're down to about 85 but this is
everything maxed out highest settings
highest resolution even higher than the
default setting for the game so this is
actually running off steaming yeah
I apologize not the best gamer in the
world but I will try my best slow motion
there kill me
you guys probably destroy me in gaming
but I want to show you guys so we're
averaging about 7080 when we got some
action going on
this guy looks scary headshot so right
now once it gets crazy it drops down to
about 20 30 frames per second let's go
ahead and jump to a different level and
see how it goes but this thing actually
runs very smooth there's no lag so for
you guys looking to get an imac to do
some gaming this actually does the job
fantastically so like i said when it's
about nothing much going on we get about
70-80 it goes up as high as about 150
170 and everything like I said is maxed
out so that's very good for a Mac and
like I said before in the review anyone
looking kind of for all-in-one solution
for gaming video editing watching movies
this thing is going to kind of kick ass
this games actually pretty damn fun so
this is 20 bucks from Steam it's
actually my first experience with Steam
this guy's a never I headshot headshot
I'm dying
I don't know how I got out of that but I
did so actually that besides this games
actually pretty fun the music school
graphics look pretty good again now
we're down to about 20 frames per second
okay so I'm going to try to get some
screenshots of the actual frames per
second for you guys so I can toss the
video so you guys can see as high as it
goes but other than that that's pretty
much it for the video I'll compare this
with the i7 when I get that for gaming
so I hope you guys enjoy this again not
the best gamer but I want to show you
guys how it does so overall this very
good a very good job in the overall
frames per second are very good so I'll
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
