2.2 Gerdes got the tab we'll go and get
back to the MacBook Pro in a second set
that aside gets the accessories you guys
have seen one MacBook Pro unboxing
usually you've seen them all Mac safe
adapter cord and then all the literature
that we'll get to in a second usually if
you're new to a Mac it'll give you like
the Quick Start Guide your backup discs
if you ever want to reinstall so we've
got everything Mac which kind of gives
you an overview of what's in your
MacBook how to set everything up you get
a cloth for your screen in case you
grime it up and in this compartment
right here eat your Apple stickers your
Apple hardware warranty the I guess at
the backup discs and the software
license agreement so let's go ahead and
move this box out the picture and get to
the main attraction there is the MacBook
Pro we have it sent it down nice and
gently move the plastic aside pop the
cap open nice fresh brand new taking a
look at the side of the MacBook Pro got
the Mac safe input Ethernet input we
have firewire 800 we've got the new
Thunderbolt in push which I will cover
in a later video but that's awesome got
a lot of good things to look forward to
with that to more USB 2.0 ports the SD
card slot looks like we got audio in and
headphone out on the opposite side we
got the super drive the on/off button
we've got speakers left and right of the
key
and of course the trackpad nothing new
one of the new things with the new
MacBook Pros is they have an HD eyesight
