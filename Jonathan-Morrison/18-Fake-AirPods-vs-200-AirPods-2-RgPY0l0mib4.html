air pods are officially out.
I've compared them against
Galaxy buds but today, we are
going in the complete opposite
direction and stacking them
up against these 18 dollar
air pod clones that come in
multiple colors, space gray
and matte black included.
And honestly, my thoughts
on these have been all
over the place.
(upbeat percussion music)
Now I've seen these as cheap
as 16 dollars in change.
This though is the exact model
that I ordered for 18 dollars
and 80 cents.
And surprisingly, you
can actually score free
shipping on these.
It takes a while, they smack
it to a raven, three to four
weeks later you get
your i88 Tws, but hey at
least it's free.
Hands down though, my favorite
thing about these clones is
gotta be the promo video on the website.
It's all kinds of ridiculous.
It looks like your traditional
top down how-to tack video
with a twist though.
The soundtrack honestly
sounds like the trailer
to Air buds 17.
The only thing missing is a voice over.
Are you tired of wired
headsets always dropping
off during sports?
With biceps rivaling Austin
Evans, clearly this chick is.
That's not mean, right?
She's got some vascularity.
Wanna enjoy music when driving?
I'm not sure if wearing two
air pods in your ears is legal,
but I don't think the
rules apply to this cool
entrepreneurial dude with the
wind flying through his hair
in that car.
He's probably listening to Gary
V. In one ear and a Ted Talk
in the other.
Have you tried of many
earphones and failed to meet
your music require-
This guy sure has.
Get i88 Tws true wireless
earbuds, bring a full
new music experience.
If you don't wanna pick these
up after that, I don't know
what else will sell you.
Back to my thoughts,
kinda getting all over
the place though.
First off, you get these in and
the build quality feels like
they are 18 dollars worth.
It's really, really cheap plastic.
Honestly the flip cap, I'm
not sure how long this is
going to last.
Like if you're Austin Evans
with that bicep or that chick,
you snap this open, that
thing might fly off.
- That doesn't sound good.
Alright, here we go.
Oh wow, that was really easy.
That was getting much harder.
Actually, you know what?
With the magnet, it
totally works like that.
See I just improved your air pods.
Don't you wish the real
air pods were like-
Nah, no one wishes this, this is dumb.
- Honestly the plastic is so
cheap and light, that it almost
feels like the air pod clones
aren't in the case even
while they're there.
Which is a mind trip and you
don't wanna lose these things
and put that kind of work
load on that poor raven.
Now, one of the beautiful things
with air pods going back to
the original, is how easy it
is to connect to your phone.
Flip open the cap, couple of
taps and you're good to go.
With these, it's not quite as
simple but still really easy.
Just flip open the cap, assuming
you don't break it, you're
gonna see flashing lights that's
gonna let you know it's in
pairing mode, you then head
into blue tooth settings, tap
connect, and what's awesome
is it's going to automatically
connect both earbuds at the
same time because with certain
clones you have to deal with
pairing one then the other,
then the first comes unpaired,
and you're pissed and
you break 'em.
With these though, you don't
have to out yourself through
that frustration it's just
a really simple process.
- Oh that works really quickly actually.
Surprisingly fast.
- By far, in expectations with
these honestly weren't that
high especially because they're
18 dollars, like what would
you expect for 18 dollar air pod clones.
And my immediate reaction when
I popped these in my ears,
listened to music was, these
kinda sound like those cheap
earbuds they give you on
airplanes, where you're like, &quot;nah
I'm good, I'd rather listen to the engine.
Then I kinda came back to
reality and was like, yo dummy
stop judging these so harshly,
they are 18 dollars, what do
you actually expect.
And when I listened to 'em a
little bit more, again, they're
not great, they don't sound
amazing, honestly I think the
review on the website
kinda sounds (unclear).
The colors are red.
And I would have to agree
with them, sound quality for
listening to music is acceptable.
It kinda feel like air pods
and I never thought I would say
this but like, air pods
without low-end because we know
air pods, they don't have a
ton of low-end to begin with,
but with this, it kinda feels
like air pods and someone just
sucked out all the bass.
- There's definitely no bass though.
Like guitars are distorting
a little bit even.
But, um, I mean for 18 bucks,
I guess they're not bad.
- I mean, they're loud, um,
there's not a lot of bass is
probably my main criticism
but, eh, they're not that bad.
- It's like when you hear
the P.A. radio in like a
department store or something,
like, it's exactly what
it sounds like.
But, I guess, for convenience
sake it might actually not
be that bad.
Now in the website, they list
so many features, just like
completely off the map.
But apparently the i88 clone
hates the iw10 because they had
this boxing dude just Batman
style powing the i10 clones,
which is just weird.
But if you look on that list,
it does state that there is
wireless charging with these
clones, and I'm not sure if
I'm doing something wrong, I've
tried pretty much every pair
that I order, and could not
get wireless charging to work.
So, what's going on guys?
Future John checking in,
you could also hold tap to
activate hey Siri.
- But I did that and it sucked.
- But we're telling a story.
- I mean, it works it just sucks.
- I know Evans but I didn't talk about it.
- Oh, okay.
- How to make YouTube videos.
- Yeah.
- [John] The other weird thing
is in the manual it shows
that it charges through USB C.
Clearly though, this is our
old friend Mr. Micro USB.
Which is a little weird to see
on an air pod case but again
it comes back to the mindset
that hey, these are 18 dollar
clones, with free raven
shipping, you can't judge these
things too hard.
Over all, I've kinda come full
circle on these, they're not
a lot of money so maybe if you
don't wanna drop 200 bucks on
a pair of air pods for
your kids , then they're
a great option.
You might have someone who's
clumsy or loses things, you
might have like five
kids (inaudible) style.
And hey, I kinda like
the fact that they come
in different colors, so that
way if Billy loses his matte
black pair he's not gonna try
and switch it with Kens blue
pair, no Billy, those were
yours, you lost them, I'm not
waiting for a raven again.
So if you're sold on these
or you got a kid named Billy,
links to these are down below
along with coverage on the
Galaxy Fold, got a chance to
check it out before they pulled
it away from us.
So drop a like for Billy
and his long lost matte
black air pod clones.
Thank you guys for watching,
this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later.
Uh, let's take one of John's bull (bleep)
video, bull (bleep).</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
