mad lad this week,
just dropping new products left and right
and today, AirPods 2,
AirPods 1.5, AirPods S,
whatever you wanna call them,
the second generation of
the AirPods are official
and we know this from this
super, highly detailed,
professional PR image directly
from Tim Cook himself.
You might be thinking,
&quot;Those look a lot like the AirPods
that I already spend a
hell of a lot of money on,
what is the difference?&quot;,
and today I am going to break that down.
(upbeat electronic music)
So the two biggest features
with the second generation of
AirPods 2 is one,
the ability to activate
haste with your voice. - Whoopi
And two the inclusion
of wireless charging.
The breakdown of how
much these new AirPods
costs is a crap load kind of crap load
and then wow, I'm surprised they let you
buy the wireless case
separately and didn't
make you go with option one.
For real though that's actually kind of
surprising on Apple's behalf.
Normally, they're the first company
to make you upgrade to that
new product just so that you
can get your hands on that new feature,
so if that voice activated - Sloppy
- Isn't that enticing to you
and you already own a pair of Airpods
you can still join the
wireless charging party.
Playing that in my head,
I don't know if I wanna go to that party,
or do I.
At the pace Apple is going this week
by the time you watch this
video there's a good chance that
AirPower, yes, AirPower
might finally be announced
and officially cause I
think most of us thought
that Johnny I was taking
that thing outback and
putting it out of its misery,
but with the introduction of
AirPods2 and that wireless charging case
it just wouldn't make sense for Apple
not to have that as part of its line
because there is no way a Galaxy S10
would be better suited with those
Airpods than anything in Apple's line up.
Seriously, Galaxy S10 will be able
to charge these second generation AirPods
so Tim Cook, please,
please, please, please
release AirPower, it is long overdue.
Jumping back to the wireless charger,
the good news is, this case will charge
the AirPods through the standard
wireless choe charging.
So whether Apple announces
AirPower or not you can use any
wireless choe compatible charger
and I will drop a few of my
favorite down below.
You do, of course, have access
to lightning port on the second generation
AirPod's case just in case you don't
want to use wireless charging.
I would of loved, loved to have seen
USBC but we are not quite there yet.
Now yeah, voice activated
haste is nice. - Women
- But sometimes you
just wanna be quiet so
personally I was hoping
for some sort of advanced gestures
where I can turn the volume up or down
by swiping up or down,
that would be awesome because
sometimes I don't wanna be
that guy out in public
saying, - Hey Samsonite
- turn the volume up or down
they're like Yo!
Whose that dude talking too?
So yeah, on the outside
these new AirPods look pretty
much identical to the first generation
but on the inside there's actually
brand new H1 chip which not only
enables the voice
activated haste, - Swanson
- but leads to a more stable connection.
This should translate to a couple
of benefits right off the bat.
First, Apple is claiming that
you're gonna get two times as fast
as switching from say your I-phone
to your MAC Book to
maybe your I-Pod touch.
That's a win and also 30 percent less
latency when your gaming and overall
just improved sound
quality across the board.
That last note though, I'm 100% taking
with a grain of salt until I get these in
my hands or rather in my ears so I could
check them out, compare them against
the original AirPods because while I'm
hopeful for some minor sound improvements
I'm not holding my breath that
it's going to be drastic.
Finally, this may be a huge
selling point with these new
AirPods if you use them
a ton for calls or
your Face timing loved ones.
You're supposed to get 50% more
talk time which is actually
pretty significant.
All in all it wasn't as sexy as,
as craziest or most impressive update,
we got no color options but it was
definitely necessary and
I'm excited for wireless charging.
Thank you guys very much for watching,
hopefully you enjoyed it.
If you did and you're feeling
like being awesome make sure
you guys go metal gear on that
like button and if you missed it
we made these beautiful awesome
Galaxy S10 wallpapers that you
can't find anywhere else.
This is Jonathan and I'll
catch you guys later.
