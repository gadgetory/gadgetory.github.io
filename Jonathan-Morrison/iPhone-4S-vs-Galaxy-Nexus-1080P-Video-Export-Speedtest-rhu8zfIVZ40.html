TLD I got a quick speed test between the
Galaxy Nexus located here on my left
hand side and the iphone 4s located on
the right hand side now spec wise
they're both dual-core CPU phones has
clocked at 1.2 gig hurts this is clocked
at 800 megahertz which a lot of people
laugh at this is running ice cream
sandwich android 4.0 this one in iOS 5
so what I did will it took a one-minute
1080p video clip at 30 frames per second
on each phone and I'm going to open them
up in their respective video editor now
since there's no I movie for Android and
vice versa that is as close as I can get
as far as fairness goes but this should
win because it is higher clocked now
first and foremost let me open up
multitasking so we can make sure no
other applications are running double
tap you can see there is nothing else
this is actually is extremely cool so I
really enjoy the multitasking on Ice
Cream Sandwich that's for another video
so get Twitter open let's go to swipe
and get that out so there's nothing
going on you can see no recent apps and
there's nothing there so what we'll go
ahead and do is open up movie studio on
the Nexus and then we go ahead and open
up I movie on the 4s so we're going to
go to create new project tap to start go
to name this test for the sake of it now
we're on the blank canvas so we're going
to tap to insert media there's that clip
double tap and there it is so we'll go
ahead and scroll to the end you can see
as one minute and what we're going to do
is go to import the video clip here then
again both 1080p so here's the camera
roll we're going to scroll to the end
and we can see there we go a minute so
same footage 1080p 30 frames per second
there we have it so what we're going to
do now is exit out of here because
that's how we export in iMovie and then
we're going to go ahead and set this up
here so export movie we have a few
options we're going to change that to
1080p 1920 x 1080 ruled and set that to
high quality and then we'll go ahead and
set this up camera roll 1080p so I
believe once I hit that that will export
and I'm going to get this as even as
possible 1 2 3 so you can see and we are
off to the races
and right away and I'm not trying to
start a flame or but you can see clearly
on the right hand side the iphone 4s is
moving a lot quicker that jumped a ten
percent so if that keeps going those
increments we should be closer but right
now you can see the iphone is moving
quicker and I'm not trying to knock the
Galaxy Nexus I'm a little disappointed
by the performance this should in theory
smoke this because this is at one point
two gigahertz this is that 800 megahertz
a lot of people laugh at that but you
can see it is tearing through the export
we're at thirteen percent there is no
percent but you can see just by looking
at it we're over fifty percent and we
are coming to the home stretch now we're
just about done on the iphone 4s for
about fifteen percent on the Galaxy
Nexus and again I know it's not
completely the same but it's as close as
I can get 1080p video exporting it to
full 1080p and we are done pretty much
done on the iphone 4s just wrap it up
the final bit of the export your movie
was exported to your camera roll and
that is it and we are barely at eighteen
percent so I know Ice Cream Sandwich is
supposed to be optimized but you can see
right here it's not always about the cpu
speed it's about OS optimization and
that's pretty much the same task I don't
care how you spin it it is pretty much
the same task i exported a 1080p video
on my phone faster period that said
there's a lot of good things about ice
cream sandwich about the Galaxy Nexus
that I will get you at upcoming videos
but for now you can see we're stuck on
23% I did enable GPU acceleration on a
developer settings on the Galaxy Nexus
with or without Saddam didn't really
make a difference it's just slower at
this point so hopefully future movie
editors will be able to take advantage
of the speed on here but for now again
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz 800 megahertz
this one was faster it's about OS and
optimization so if you guys are feeling
like being awesome and you don't hate my
face make sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you haven't already make
sure to check out our latest video feel
free to subscribe got a lot of videos
coming up between these two and i will
see you guys later
