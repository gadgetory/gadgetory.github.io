now i know it's been a little while
since we did our last review we kind of
disappeared there for about a month but
we're finally back and we're starting
with our review of max payne 3 for the
xbox 360 and ps3 it's been nine years
since Rockstar released the last Max
Payne title and about that much time has
passed in the game's storyline and all
we're seeing an older version of Max the
core gameplay itself remains very much
the same max payne 3 makes use of the
same third person camera angle that was
used in prior titles and also features
the return of the two main mechanics
that made the series popular bullet time
and the shoot dodge well these two
abilities work very much the same as
before allowing you to slow down time
but still line up your shots perfectly
giving you an edge over your enemies
there are two special new additions that
make things even better the first of
these new additions is the Last Stand of
mechanic what this does is that when max
loses all of his life instead of simply
losing the game if you have one
painkiller near inventory you're given a
chance to shoot the last guy that shot
you you just excessively kill him you
automatically revive and get a chance to
keep shooting on now while this is a
useful way to keep you in the fight for
longer it's still much more risky than
just taking painkillers whenever you're
low on life the main reason being that
if you're low on ammo and you end up
missing your shot you can't reload while
and last stand so you just automatically
died the other edition ties into the
last stand ability as well as with the
popular shoot dodge what happens is that
once you recover from last stand or you
land from shoot dodge you stay laying on
the ground until you try to move while
laying on the ground you're allowed to
freely aim around you in a 360 degree
angle as well as making yourself a
harder target for enemies to shoot one
last change the game makes to the core
gameplay is that you're given the option
between whether or not you want to make
use of any form of auto aim when playing
in the arcade or multiplayer games
you're given the option to pick between
soft lock or free aim which is basically
having a little auto assist or none at
all the game's story mode also offers a
third option of hard locking which
basically means as soon as you hit the
game button you're instilling at a lock
on in the nearest enemy and shoot them
to pieces now the game story takes place
eight years after the events of max
payne 2 and there are some noticeable
changes in the way they handle the
narration of it first off the entire
graphic novel use for showing storyline
is completely removed and replaced with
traditional cutscenes one of the smart
things they did with this is that
cutscenes are used as a form of loading
screen so while you can't skip them very
often because the game is getting ready
for the next level it makes it to where
you never have to deal with any kind of
boring blank screen and a loading bar
the game starts off with max still going
through a sort of mourning period
self-medicating with a great combination
of
our liquor and painkillers but as the
storyline progresses you go less from
self-pity and more into just a blind
rage of shooting every single person
that does something wrong due to over
the course of the story it's by no means
a happy story line but it's definitely
action-packed and comes across with a
great movie feeling that we're used to
from these games overall the storyline
for the game is pretty solid I don't
feel like it was as enjoyable some of
the earlier games and it also feels a
bit shorter but there's also possibly to
the fact they made an addition of a full
multiplayer mode this time around it's
still a lot of fun to play through
though and definitely worth picking the
game up just for the campaign now
alongside the story mode the game also
features an arcade mode as another form
of single-player it's basically just a
chopped up version of the story mode
allowing you to replay specific chapters
but by adding additional challenges like
trying to get the highest score possible
or getting it done as fast time as you
can getting bonus time by getting
headshots or bullet time kills these
challenges serve two purposes first by
completing them you'll gain XP which
will improve your level and multiplayer
but also you'll be able to rank on a
scoreboard now one of the biggest
additions to this installment is that
this is the first Max Payne to have a
full multiplayer mode available rockstar
has also celebrated this by integrating
it with their new crew system which is
also going to be used in Grand Theft
Auto 5 it's basically just rock stars
own way of having a social media with
their games in particular allowing your
friends to join crews so that when you
go online you guys can fight alongside
each other and get special benefits for
playing together often like bonus xp now
while it does feature the long time
standards of death match and team
deathmatch Max Payne 3 also has two
unique modes that make use of its
certain style one of them being
painkiller and the other gang wars
painkiller works as a sort of juggernut
mode with two players taking on the
roles of Max and his new partner passos
maxim pazos will get points for killing
their enemies while also being the main
target of everyone else in the match the
main goal being that you want to kill
one of them become them and then last as
long as you can killing as many other
players to get as many points as
possible now my personal favorite mode
is the game worst mode which actually
works out is its own little story line
now the way it works that players are
assigned to two different teams
representing different gangs or
fractions from the plot line of Max
Payne as you play as these gangs each
match will have a different objective
whether it's just an all-out killing
spree or trying to defend one particular
teammate or checkpoints the start and
end of each match will actually be
narrated like a plot line and depending
which team wins which fight events will
occur differently most interestingly is
that you do not win
by winning the most events rather it
ends in one total team deathmatch with
the team winning more events earlier
getting bonus kill points right at the
start giving him a big advantage but
still giving the other team a chance to
come back at the very end the gameplay
itself and multiplayer is very similar
to the standard gameplay we see in the
single-player story but there are a few
key changes first off bullet time is
replaced by various different burst
abilities such as gaining access to a
temporary machine gun or being able to
instantly heal yourself and teammates
one of the other little additions they
made that I really like in concept is
vendetta the way it works that once a
player has killed the same player twice
that player can mark him for a vendetta
once that happens whichever them kills
the other first gets bonus xp character
customization is fairly standard for an
online shooter you're able to pick
different guns unlock different special
abilities perks what items you carry one
thing that is interesting is that you do
have a carrying capacity as you level up
this capacity increases the downside to
it is that if you carry too much stuff
not only as your movement speed reduced
but also the rate at which you were
generate health and stamina overall well
it doesn't maintain the exact same
essence as the original Max Payne games
max payne 3 stands alone as itself is a
great shooting title it's an excellent
example of how a third person shooter
cannot just be a cover focused game but
even more just a real fast paced action
focus shooter with cinematic qualities
in many ways a text reminds me a lot of
what uncharted to become but with less
platforming and a lot more just high
action moments with a fun I'll be a
depressing main storyline and a
multiplayer that sets itself apart by
not being focused on first person or
cover mechanics it's a great game to
pick up for those of you looking for
something a little different or just
wanted to see how the max payne
storyline continues that's a review of
