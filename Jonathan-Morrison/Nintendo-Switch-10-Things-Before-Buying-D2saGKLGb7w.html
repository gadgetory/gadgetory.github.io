switch has officially arrived but before
you go run out and scoop one of these up
here are 10 things to know so for
starters we're going to kick this off
with a weird one because the cartridge
is so small about the size of that D
card and kendo actually Heisenberg the
way to prevent kids from ingesting this
now from what I've heard Nintendo
applied a layer of denatonium benzoate
on the cartridge and that's apparently
one of the most bitter tasting chemical
compounds on the face of this earth that
way if a kid sticks it in his mouth he's
gonna spit that out in the name of
science though I get totally fair if I
test this out myself the question is
though do I lick it or do I completely
stick this in my mouth that is the
obvious answer that's nasty
no kids eating this for sure kind of
those the best idea doing this as the
first fact oh I can't I don't even know
what it tastes like like my mind's going
did I lick a Sharpie huh what is that oh
I need some water taste update I'm
getting a lost of nail polish and hats
off to Nintendo for being true I guess
because I don't think there's a kid on
the face of this earth or adult for that
matter that's kind of enjoy the taste of
that so next up number two is the fact
that game availability really isn't that
great at launch
you just got your switch you're excited
to play then you realize they only truly
major title available out launches
Legend of Zelda breath is a while there
are smaller nd titles which are also
available on the ps4 and Xbox one but as
far as switch exclusive you really only
have a couple options one of them being
one to switch which essentially is a
group of party games currently as far as
major releases go you will need to
practice some patience Mario Kart 8
deluxe slated for April platoon 2 in the
summer NBA 2k in September but if you're
looking forward to Super Mario Odyssey
you're gonna have to be extra patient
because that is not coming out until the
holidays so next up number three jumping
into some positivity the system is super
adaptable for day-to-day life but I
think by far one of the coolest features
about to switch is how easy it is to
switch between all the different ways
you can play you could play around the
house then hop on the couch pense being
optional you can even maybe go outside
and get some Sun although it's a pants
are probably mandatory
and that one and then when you're ready
for that TV action just pop it on the
dock and magic now it's not actually
magic what happens when you place the
system into the dock is it automatically
ups the system clock speeds which allows
it to output it in 1080p the switch also
features a built-in kickstand just in
case you want to dock it onto a desk or
hard surface and I emphasize hard
surface because the kickstand really
isn't that great so if we place it on a
soft surface it is guaranteed to fall
over there of course other accessories
that do a much better job at this so if
you like the idea that that is probably
the route you want to go the next step
number four speaking of accessories the
pricing is insane set of the boxes which
comes with two joy con controllers those
are those little detachable handles one
controller grip which allows you to
combine two of them to make a more
traditional controller and then lastly
some wrist strap attachments that way
you accidentally throw a joy con out
your window now this is totally adequate
for the single-player games and some of
the simpler two-player games but if you
want anymore that you're going to need
to pony up each toy kind of 50 bucks you
can however get them in a double pack
480 but you will need to tack on an
extra 15 bucks for the controller grip
there's also a pro controller option for
70 bucks you can see if you're buying
this for just yourself it really isn't
that big of a deal but if you've had a
giant household or a BB 50 amount of
kids this is going to do some serious
damage to your wallet so next up number
five if we through pricing out the
window for a second with those
accessories there are so many ways to
control the game the simplest option you
have is by holding a pair of joique on
one in each hand where you just relax
your arms and use them independently
this is a privately comfortable and
personally my favorite way to play if
however you want something closer to a
more traditional controller you can
attach the joique on to a copper grip
but you're going to be disappointed
because honestly it feels worse the grip
paddle themselves are super tiny not
particularly well shaped to the human
hand plus once you're used to using the
Joye con separately it kind of feels
like you're taking a step back if
however you absolutely need that
controller fill you're much better off
spending the extra money and getting the
switch pro controller so next up number
six talking a little bit about game play
in terms of portable mode surprisingly
it looks really good in terms of specs
switches built-in screen is a 6.2 inch
capacitive multi-touch panel with a
resolution of 720p
now I guarantee people are going to hear
720p and
lose their minds where's Katy where is
4k what is this caveman crap but the
thing is the screen is so small in terms
of scale for its size it actually looks
incredible for comparison the PS Vita is
capped at 544 P could you imagine
inviting someone over and asks they
wanted to watch a movie on your 544 P TV
that ain't quad HD that is quarter HD
specs and resolution aside though the
backlight is great the colors are even
better not even go as far as saying the
switch is at its best when used in
handheld mode now next up number seven
as great as the graphics are battery
life is actually kind of a concerned the
switchers battery life is expected to be
somewhere between three and six hours
and you can actually expect closer to
that three hour range if you're playing
more demanding games like Legend of
Zelda alternatively you could remedy
this by plugging yourself into a wall
outlet but if you plan on being on the
go consistently that battery bank you
got to chug through those Pokemon Ghost
session isn't going to hack it here
you're going to need something way more
powerful with that said though if you
are going to be that guy or girl on the
go post some of the biggest baddest
power options down below and next up a
temporary if you are worried about
battery life one bright note with the
switch is Auto sleep now with previous
antenna systems those would continue to
run until the battery was completely
drained from the instance for your
system saying hey plug me and I'm about
to die and you ignored it you're going
to lose all of your progress the switch
however features an emergency sleep mode
that way just in case the battery gets
to a critical point it's going to
automatically put itself to sleep in
turn preventing itself from dying and
you losing your data so next up a
timeline one really important thing to
consider is the fact that the built-in
storage on the switch really isn't that
much so for example Legend of Zelda is
13 gigs so if you are to download that
instantly halfway your storage is gone
now well the switch doesn't support USB
thumb drives or USB hard drives it does
feature an SDXC card slot located
beneath the kickstand
but again diving back to the fact that
the accessories are expensive and they
add up this is going to be one more
thing you're going to have to buy now
last up at number 10 one thing to
consider is the fact that online support
really fully hasn't arrived yet
currently the only thing you can do
online is browse and buy from the eShop
or add a friend use Nintendo's
outdated friend code system now Nintendo
has promised more online features in the
future specifically with their companion
app but that is still a little ways away
so as of
right now we're kind of in the dark with
that the good news is though because
you're essentially a guinea pig right
now everything is free but its features
Rolo and becomes a little more robust
you can definitely expect to pay a fee
PS as a bonus fact for some reason to
switch charges a Macbook seriously
besides not hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video if you did and you appreciate
me licking cartridges make sure you drop
a like and about that giveaway you can
find out more details here or down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm
gonna stick it in my mouth
that's my game</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
