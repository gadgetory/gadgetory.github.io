save your MacBook now specifically I am
referring to the 12-inch MacBook which I
really enjoy the display looks amazing
it's lightweight it's portable the
speaker sound incredible but one thing
that's always driven me crazy is because
everything is centered around one single
USBC port because of that as far as
charging goes you lose the MagSafe
connection which for me was always one
of the coolest features on a macbook you
could have your macbook plugged in
charging and because it was a magnetic
connection you didn't have to worry
about knocking it over and your MacBook
flying with it so enter the griffon
break safe which is a magnetic breakaway
USBC power cable that's intended to
bring Mac's a functionality back to the
12-inch MacBook so with this there are
two parts a USB C connection piece that
lives inside the MacBook and then from
there you have the breakaway cable
itself which attaches just like a
MagSafe cable would and pops on
magnetically that'll be honest I was
really apprehensive to show what could
potentially happen to a 12-inch MacBook
without Mac save I don't want to yank or
even trip over a cable and risk wrecking
a MacBook but fortunately my good buddy
Ken did that for me hey Ken this is
Austin first you got to stop staring at
my biceps buddy I know they're as big as
a Mississippi River but you got to focus
second you can't let anyone know we're
using a Mac if word gets out it's gonna
blow up in my face I'm a PC lastly
whatever you do do not drop the macula
stanka mean what's that Austin you need
help
it was at this moment kin realized he
cooked up so you can see if Ken had this
in the first place that MacBook would be
a lot better off on the flip side the
downside with this cable is that it does
not support data or video transfer so
its sole purpose is for charging
unfortunately if you do need to transfer
documents or transfer a video signal you
will need a second USBC cable but if
you're someone who's had some close
calls or you just like the idea of
having a MagSafe type connection then
this works as advertised now even though
I'm showcasing this with a MacBook it
will work with other USB see devices not
only does it meet USB C power standards
but it's also rated up to 60 watts of
power aside from that thank you guys
very much for watching hopefully enjoy
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to smash
that like button harder than Ken smashed
that MacBook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
