you guys so much for the incredible love
on the latest video featuring Henny the
business honestly creatively this might
have been the most fun I've had not only
shooting something editing something but
kind of taking a step back away from the
front of the camera and directing it so
it should be no secret that have a huge
passion for film and cinematography but
I think I also have an equal passion for
music and music productions so to have
someone like Henny and then Ken freakin
Lewis together using technology as that
means to bring two immensely talented
people together for me was such an
amazing experience and seriously I'm
sitting there holding the camera and you
could not slap the smile off of my face
with that said I think it got kind of
lost into the story so much to the point
where I almost did not want to include
my voice whatsoever it was just kind of
one of those situations where I'm
sitting there editing everything
watching it come together to the point
where the story essentially told itself
the entire process from flying Haiti and
Ken out to shooting to editing to get
ended up on YouTube was all within a 24
hour window so kind of sitting back and
watching I think my biggest self
critique was not including enough of the
educational aspect there was a ton of
feedback that I 100% absolutely agree
with wanting to see what was happening
on the iPad display especially with
someone like Ken Lewis whose track
record is about as legitimate as it gets
he's a multi Grammy winner he's mixed
engineered produced written songs for
everyone from Kanye West to Mary Jane
polite to fun the list is absolute
insanity so to have someone like that in
the room not only with his knowledge but
just reacting having a pure genuine
moment mixing on the iPad for the first
time I think is invaluable what I did
was kind of put together a looser more
kickback educational feel style video
kind of similar to what I did with the
editing on the iPad pro video I'm not a
hundred percent sure if I'm gonna leave
this up publicly I might switch it to
unlisted and then link it back to the
original video for those that want to
see more of an educational site but if
you guys dig this and you think it's
worth leaving up let me know with a
comment down below and also drop in a
like and with that said let's go and
check out henny mixing with Ken Lewis on
the iPad for the first time in his life
so what I had is basically three
different ideas right
the piece with just kinda like the drums
the swing part and the bass in the
sample light in the string sample right
and then like it gets funky and you take
the string sample out and it kinda has
the pianos and synth that's part of a
different part of the sequence and then
throughout we could try to figure out
how to bring those lives and so so I
have anything you're gonna start the
record off probably with the string
sample as a solo so if you take the pin
you can little let's let's let's copy it
out so if you grab the whole thing I
down here you have three different
functions right yep
that's that's two copy that you just
kind of drag around that whole thing yep
and then just repeat yep that's dope
yeah one more time yeah all right now
this is kind of like how you get back
forth up there
and so say for instance it was string
sample if we just wanted it to go maybe
eight bars you can always just spread it
out and take out the pieces that you
want so if I just draw like this
everything but the string sample and
rich
remove there we go so now we have an
arrangement
there were some comes in there maybe the
blaze every basin bells so you can
literally take those here and you can
drag it over you know
what I do is hit undo is up there mm-hmm
I'll just take that drag it over one and
then where am I yeah where's the drag
all right yeah well just in the middle
of it all I see you know and then just
and then repeat it smart yeah yeah I see
what you're doing and let's do the same
thing with the bells and see how that
hits us okay
in there
the drum yeah we have this as a prelude
so and then repeat that so yeah so if
you go up here and play from there so
we're looking right at that so there's
two here's the cut piece
do I need to select this first yep okay
and now any on any line you just cut it
and then you can go back to their throat
go back to select and then delete
and if you want to go all the way out
right
that's Italy or the let's say the synth
lead for the hook okay
and maybe the pianos to the rock kept so
no I say this is moves the whole
arrangement yep
gotcha all right so the synth lead may
will cut this was that cut this much
more out
yep and sometimes you can just tap on it
if it's the whole piece ah okay it's in
pieces I didn't yeah they're in there
they should be in either for eight more
pieces there you go okay let's see see
what this gets us
why
so now going back to where we were
sometimes you can just do that nice and
then would you you do that and then you
use the cut tool or you get elect to the
car I want you to cut the cut tool put a
line and then and that automatically
does it yeah so now we have I don't know
if that was it or if we wanted oh I
think trying yeah we just let the loop
rock through it
they're not for ya setup okay so
so if we wanted that I think from that
point we can start to figure out there
all right
the mix right yeah this is plenty to dig
into so now we have sequence window mix
window double tap
this is
all your fix so you have these normal
effects that beatmaker comes with right
but all these third-party people make
these other effects so if you you're
saying you know compressor I'll show you
where it is
EQ show you where it is well so it's
just like I can select congas
yeah add effect go maybe I want a
dynamics processor mm-hmm and then how
do you fast forward we can
yeah just maybe loop a full section of
let me just get a bye for a whole thing
and another can see how that fine Tunes
itself
so where's the McCain
for detail
now is there a meter that shows up and
it's like right
full mixers there's a company called
cleb grande that makes some really cool
third-party ones right so we want stereo
widening they have this thing called
haze so say for instance we like you
never want right yeah yeah just like
you know by frequency that's great yeah
it's kind of like a waves spread look
yeah do it with one finger
I'm very nice so you can get really
fine-tuned into the frequency rate I
want and the mix
and how do you bypass this and come here
yeah it's nice and if you want out of it
so that's like a wet/dry yeah parallel
balanced and then if you want to eat you
there's are these up to or how much yeah
here I hear what it's doing
where is the
what
yeah esto
are there different types of overdrive
you see
can you automate on-the-fly so like if
you arm I'm I think it's too complicated
right I'll pick you and I'll sign but if
I arm this and in real time I could yes
man yeah that's what that's what you
call a media video let's hear that in
the whole mix and then if I just want to
adjust like a string
is there a way to set it automatically
sentimental
if I wanted to add a second plug in I
just did that
they're like a tap delay you can select
this is actually it's been left and
right inside it's already on
Wow yeah that's always prudent is a
right
throwing it back to that up again so I
could bypass the fuzz and just you know
what's doing about it yeah
so at this point we basically have a
basic arrangement and I've kind of got a
feel for how the plugins work okay let
me go to the full mixer and just pull
the faders down and get an idea of just
how the faders are you know we're
looking is let's go and that way you
have the whole sequence so it did bring
this all the way back and I'll just keep
it looping like that okay okay cool
that's the master up
I can just do this with my fingers
that's really nice so let's loop a
section that has everything in it with
it that way I just know all right so all
faders down I'm just gonna start
building a mix from scratch just you
know getting basic balances and see how
the functionality is can I turn the
speaker's no it depends on the song
usually I like to plastically stun
volume for about 15 minutes get all of
my basic balance
yeah
so if I want is all compression under
dynamics processor yeah
no clipping that makes me move coverage
stuff too like yeah that sounds more on
my hey you don't that I've no idea how
to use this but let me find out kind of
a squeeze it out you have a my god
attack time
I'm liking what's going I'm gonna just
add another compressor to it okay which
one what hit went from there I want to
take down just the initial attack okay
so it's not so sharp and more of the
resonance of the bell comes out then the
initial like mallet hit that nominee so
super fast attack and wheelie is higher
compression and just get a little bit of
reduction so that that now at strike
isn't so
we can't filter do I just wanted to so
that the compressor is only looking at
more the high-frequency unless the
low-frequency watching but you know a
crisis let's just put it back
I'm also gonna try a spreading effect on
that perfect stereo one I want to do the
way does this do really really short
delay times like 4 milliseconds now it's
only on tempo yeah yeah how do I get rid
of this you do that's perfect let's see
what else we got here modulation delay
widening out that's nice I'll kind of
keep it away from the drums and vocals
and keep it lower
do anything to see if
[Laughter]
that also brings a little bit that shake
around in there
we didn't really hear it like that
before
this is a ban for that come bring out
that sharpness in the snare
stop and see what it sounds like from it
from the top
yeah let's do it and then I'd love to
like give the mixbus a a try and see
what kind of mixbus stuff they they okay
have now let's see I get back to the
take that whole piece and just Joe yeah
there you go
and where's the stop start
I'm pretty good with where we're at now
how do you feel like you know your whole
first take on the iPad is something I
never really thought I would be doing
this on an iPad yeah but if but from
from your experience it's very much it's
very capable right yeah I mean the thing
I love about it is is it's all tactile
and I come from old school analog you
know you have 15-foot mixing consoles in
front of you and those have gotten
smaller and smaller but I'm still on an
analog board and one of the reasons I'm
on an analog board is because it's all
tactile and I can't touch it and you
know and work it and get the the feel
for that musical connection that you
know turning the knobs gives you and
moving the faders gives you and it feels
like one of the things that I have
always disliked about the mouse that's
kept me analog for so long is that that
tactile experience of being able to look
at the whole console and just grab
whatever you want to tweak on the fly
and to me this is like the best version
I've seen so far of that in the box Wow
and I mean I haven't used the Raven so
the Raven might be this or you know who
knows but the Raven is multiples more
expensive and write in a much bigger
footprint and you can't stick it in your
backpack so this guy yeah I am
definitely gonna be like taking this to
the beach and putting the headphones on
with the controller and sitting there
for hours at a time just making music
and the my favorite part is the tactile
response of it that I can just scroll
around and I can very easily select
everything that I want to do and it's
and I don't have to use a mouse to do it
that's that to me I love that and it
seems like their effects packages and
their plugins are super usable yeah so
it's only getting better device I'm sure
as third parties come on board and and
the awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
