tod bringing you the unboxing of the
epson workforce 635 all-in-one printer
it prints copies scans faxes and even
makes you coffee I'm just getting out
the coffee part but you guys can see it
does a lot so I want to thank epson for
being so kind to send this out for
review especially Cindy over at epson
she was pleasure to work with and they
went as far as all the little details of
senators game I'd even sample paper
let's go ahead and set this aside I just
want to make a quick note about that
what's getting to the emboss I think I'm
actually gonna need a knife for this one
I think waffle John would agree this is
a manly size box so let's go I know you
guys tell me to cut away so I don't cut
myself but you guys can see they do a
nice job with the packaging plus I'm
playing games on box and really excited
I can't take a look at this so at the
top you guys can see we got the
styrofoam let's see what the best way to
pull this guy out you probably want to
flip it instead of looking like a smart
guy on camera I think this is the best
way to do it we're going to toss that
aside we have some more free paper
samples inside so tons of samples got to
love that on the bottom looks like we
get our driver's seat with his mac and
pc compatibl just let you guys know then
bust this out
and this is a heads up for you they're
actually providing one of these for a
giveaway that I will announce sometime
next week so if you guys want a heads up
on that make sure to follow me on
Twitter and or Facebook those links will
be in the description let's make sure
put this right side up I've got some
more ink so neat and paper galore
ethernet cable and the power cable so it
looks like all the accessories for this
is going to the styrofoam off now my
cover it's going to be all messy cut
foam everywhere at the vacuum after this
so they do tonight wrapped package in
that sense have built in Wi-Fi from
looking at the box does have a built in
SD card slot reader so this thing is
packed it's loaded with features so let
me get that camera for you guys so that
pretty much does it you guys saw all the
accessories this is the actual printer
itself get that up so you guys can see
that this is the unboxing for this like
I said we'll have a giveaway next week
