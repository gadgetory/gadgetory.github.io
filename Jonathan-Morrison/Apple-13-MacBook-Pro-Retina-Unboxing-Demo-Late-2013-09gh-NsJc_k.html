Squarespace hey guys johnathan it with
TLD hope you guys are doing awesome I am
back with an unboxing and performance
demo of the just released 2013 13 inch
MacBook Pro with Retina display I do
plan on putting this thing to its paces
and more thoroughly testing it out so if
you are interested in the review
definitely feel free to hit that
subscribe button so you do not miss out
now I'm sure many of you guys have seen
your share of MacBook Pro unboxings but
just in case you haven't or you're still
interested aside obviously from the
MacBook Pro itself which we will set to
the side for a second you get it
designed by Apple in California box
which includes a QuickStart guide which
will give you the basic rundown of all
the important information you need you
then get the MacBook Pro important
information guide which includes
information on your warranty and things
like that following that is the always
awesome Apple stickers and I'm actually
curious to see who has the most Apple
stickers so let me know with a comment
down below how many Apple stickers you
have and following that you get an apple
cleaning cloth to wipe all dem
fingerprints off yo shiny new Retina
display you then get a Mac safe to power
brick too of course juice up the MacBook
Pro and you also get an extension cord
which surprisingly enough not everybody
knows what this is for so what you do is
pop this piece off right here attach the
extension cord and bam you can charge
your macbook pro from across the room
now with any MacBook unboxing the first
thing I generally like to do is perform
a boot up speed test these new MacBook
Pros do feature PCI Express flash
storage so they should be pretty fast
and as you can see we clocked in at just
over 14 seconds not bad at all
next up is the black magic hello sparkly
shiny stuff in OS 10 mavericks had lets
me know i installed a new application
sparkly distractions aside back to the
test you can see we're getting over 300
megabytes per second on the right side
of things and over 700 megabytes per
second on the read speed side of things
so that is very impressive now yesterday
I got a few comments on Instagram that
some of these tests look wrong they've
seen faster results and from what I've
gathered if you pick up the 128 gigabyte
flash storage model they have slower
write speeds whereas the 256 gigabyte
and above will feature read and write
speeds around 700 megabytes per second
each now before anyone worries or panics
that's not necessarily a bad thing or a
deal breaker on the write speeds most of
the things that you use your MacBook Pro
for will require read speeds so booting
up your computer
loading applications and then accessing
those files those are all affected by
read speeds now write speeds on the
other hand affect things like transfer
speeds or writing video or photos to
disk but chances are if you are doing
things like that you're going to want a
bigger flash storage SSD anyways so in a
nutshell if you do pick up the 128
gigabyte model those speeds are still
very impressive so don't feel like you
get ripped off you just get even more
performance if you jump up to the higher
capacity flash storage model now the
model I am looking at here is the
baseline model which comes configured
with a has low base 2.4 gigahertz
dual-core i5 CPU 4 gigs of ram 128
gigabytes of PCI Express storage like we
just talked about you can actually
configure this up to one terabyte but
that will punch your wallet in the face
you then get Intel iris integrated
graphics and Apple is claiming 9 hours
of battery life which I will investigate
and report back to you guys on the full
review so as far as what all those
numbers and specs mean in terms of
actual performance in my preliminary
tests in Geekbench 3 the 64-bit edition
we got a multi-core score of 6300 and a
single core score of 29 43 now I am
trying to get my hands on the previous
generation 2012 13 inch retina MacBook
Pro for performance comparisons so if
you guys are interested in seeing
something like that definitely let me
know by hitting that like button and I
will do my best to make that happen
captain now like I talked about this
does feature an absolutely beautiful
Retina display 2560 by 1600 so at normal
distances there are no discernible
pixels now believe me checking this out
through a youtube video does not do it
justice by any means so before anybody
knocks it see if you can check it out in
person for yourself and you'll see what
I mean once you see retina it's kind of
hard to go back to anything not on
retina it is absolutely gorgeous
next up moving on to the ins and the
outs on one side of the MacBook Pro we
have the MagSafe 2 power input connector
2 Thunderbolt 2 ports a USB 3.0 port a
headphone jack which also doubles as an
audio out port and next to that those
two little dots are actually dual
microphones on the flip side that's not
a whole lot going on but we get a single
SDXC card slot and HDMI out which is
very awesome and the second USB 3.0 port
these MacBook Pros also do feature 802
11 AC Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 then of course
have the backlit keyboard the
multi-touch glass trackpad stereo
speakers and a 720p FaceTime HD camera
so that pretty much wraps up the
unboxing thank you guys very much for
