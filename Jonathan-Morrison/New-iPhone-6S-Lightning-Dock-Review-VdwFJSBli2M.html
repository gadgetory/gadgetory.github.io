alongside the release of the iPhone 6s
comes an update to Apple's lightning
dock which now comes in four colors
silver gold Space Gray and rose gold
matching the new iPhone 6s lino
previously Apple's lightning dock came
in white so aesthetically I think these
look infinitely better now with rose
gold being a brand new color option I
was excited to check these out in person
and see how it stacked up side-by-side
against the standard gold now there is
absolutely no doubt about it being pink
but again it's not a super bright in
your face pink it's subtle and rounds
out the iPhone line up nicely one thing
I did notice on the space gray though is
that it's ever so slightly lighter than
the space grey on the 12-inch MacBook
which for me is a little bit of a bummer
as far as the dock itself goes it's
built solid looks fantastic but like
most Apple accessories there's
definitely a premium as far as the price
goes coming in at just about 50 George
Washington's there are definitely
cheaper docks out there which I'll link
below but in this case if you do pick
one up you're paying for looks and
functionality the Lightning port is
built into the dock so you won't need to
mess with installing and adjusting it
lightning cable to dock your iPhone all
you need to do is plug in your cable to
the back of the dock and you're good to
go another nice feature is the
integrated 3.5 millimeter audio out just
in case you want to plug into a set of
speakers but if you're about that
Wireless and that Bluetooth life then
it's not really a big deal
so that about wraps that up just wanted
to give you guys a quick look at Apple's
neat dock and also a preview of rose
gold just in case you were looking to
grab that color hopefully enjoy the
video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to go
Batman on that like button
and speaking of Batman these skins are
actually part of a brand new Justin
baller and slick wraps hero series
collab which I'll link to down below
huge thanks to Mike aka the Detroit
Board for hooking these docks up make
sure you check them out as well and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
