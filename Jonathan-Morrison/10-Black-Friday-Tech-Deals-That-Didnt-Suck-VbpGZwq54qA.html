thank you guys for the love on dream
desk form and reading the comments
seeing the lights come through which
have been incredible so seriously thank
you that is not while we are here though
today is Black Friday the classic
American tradition where people wait in
line and trample each other to save a
few bucks luckily though thanks to the
internet you don't have to endure that
or step outside your home so with that
here are 10 Black Friday deals that
don't suck first up is the Logitech g600
Wireless Gaming Mouse which right now is
39 bucks now even though this is
technically labeled as gaming mouse it
is a fantastic all-around Mouse period
it has great battery life ergonomically
it is really comfortable and there are a
ton of buttons that you can customize
the crap out of alternatively does not
as cheap but the MX master is also on
sale for 68 bucks inside note holy crap
I just discovered that there are two new
colors stone and navy and I'm having a
really hard time deciding which one I
should grab so let me know which color
you think I should pick up next up
number two is the honor age from Huawei
which is easily one of the best budget
smartphones of 2016 it's got great build
quality comes in a few different colors
all of which will look equally fantastic
normally at its regular price it is a
great deal but if you've been waiting
and looking for a phone right now it is
under 300 bucks which is a crazy deal
following that at number three is for
anyone that's been looking for a sweet
deal on a monitor currently there is a
23 inch 1080p display from Lenovo that
looks good and is on sale for 139 there
are three really attractive things that
stand up to me with this monitor the
first to watch being the color it's got
kind of that Space Gray action going on
the second being the really thin bezel
and lastly the stand kind of completes
the entire package next up is for those
of you out there I've been looking to
step up their pixel game because right
now there is a 40 inch 4k TV for under
350 bucks
it's from Samsung which is cool because
it's not some no-name off-brand that you
never heard of and may potentially break
after six months it might explode
kidding but seriously if you've been
looking a step up to a 4k TV this is a
better deal than most 1080p models plus
you pair this with the chromecast does
4k and you got yourself a pretty sweet
setup next up at number five is the
13-inch
MacBook Pro without touch bar which is
currently a hundred bucks off some of
you out there have been looking at the
new 2016 MacBook Pro but don't need a
touch bar this is your chance to save
some cash plus 100 bucks you saved you
can put that towards an external display
a mouse a case a backpack or even some
dongles after that number six the UE
boom - which is one of the best
Bluetooth speakers period is on sale for
129 these things have fantastic sound
tons of volume come in a bunch of
different colors on top of that they are
also water-resistant so if you've been
looking for a great Bluetooth speaker
whether it's for yourself or for a gift
for someone coming up this is a really
good deal to jump on next up at number
seven is the SanDisk Extreme 64 gigabyte
micro sd card which is on sale for 25
bucks you can't plug it directly into
the new MacBook Pro but whether you have
a GoPro or you've been looking to add
some storage to your phone this is a
really good deal to jump on next up at
number eight is the nest thermostat
which firmly sells for around 250 bucks
and right now is 50 bucks off at $1.99
we own and use one here at the office so
I can personally attest that it is a
really cool piece of home tech to have
so if you've been on the fence about
buying one for 50 bucks off I would
definitely recommend picking one of
these up fall in that number 9 is one of
my favorite pieces of tech ever the blue
Yeti USB microphone and both the
whiteout and blackout Edition are
currently on sale for 90 bucks most
youtubers got into the game the blue
snowball which is around 50 bucks so for
not that much more you can step up to a
much better microphone it's got an
adjustable stand is great for podcast
for voiceovers for recording an acoustic
guitar it on top of that it looks really
good on your desk no matter what setup
you have last up at number 10 is the
Amazon echo which is currently on sale
for one and thirty-nine obviously these
prices may change and fluctuate so for
the most current and up-to-date deals
make sure you guys jump on the links
down below if you're not aware what the
echo is it's one of the most popular and
widely used pieces of home tech period
with that you're able to voice control
pretty much everything in your house
whether it's the lights music you can
order things with it and what's crazy is
you can even call an uber so between
this the nest and Samsung 4k TV there
are some pretty great options to upgrade
your home tech hopefully you guys enjoy
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to smash
that like
button but to make Black Friday just a
little more fun and interesting I am
giving away five 100 our Amazon gift
cards and 10 $50 cards to answer all you
got to do is follow me on twitter at TLD
