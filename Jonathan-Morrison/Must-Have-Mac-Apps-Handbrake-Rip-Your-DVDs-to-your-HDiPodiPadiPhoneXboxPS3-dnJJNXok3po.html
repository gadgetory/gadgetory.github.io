with TLD we are back with the must-have
mac apps and we're going to looking at
hand brake what this is it's a DVD
ripping program it's not a backup or a
copier so what it's going to do it's
going to take your DVD and rip it to an
mp4 or an MKV file i got my simpsons DVD
loaded up right now just to show you
guys a quick example so it's going to
take a few moments to scan the title
while it's doing that i want let you
guys know a lot of people use it with
netflix so if you guys can put two and
two together I'm not condoning it I'm
not giving you any ideas put a lot of
people use it so I'm just giving you
guys a little hint right there I'm not
going to go into that I don't want to
get in trouble but a lot of people use
it with Netflix so you guys can see
right here you can scan through the
titles it gives you the option to choose
your format they have a lot of different
presets in there I actually have a very
good Xbox preset that I use to stream
with my xbox if you guys are interested
in that actually just come to Facebook
leave me a message and I can email you
that file if you have multiple episodes
in a season you can set up a cute walk
away come back later there's audio video
options you can set up chapter so
there's really a lot you can do with
handbrake here you guys can see I my
simpsons season for ripped into one
folder it's very nice you can throw it
on your ipod like i said i stream it to
xbox as you guys can see right here you
can get a very good looking video file
at a relatively low file size you do
need one more program called VLC to work
with Henrik i will post boast links in
the description for you guys i hope you
guys enjoyed this video i use this app
all the time i'll see you guys next time
