fresh episode of the best tech on her 15
we're kicking it off with some wood
before we get going I first want to
commend you for your continued
destruction of that like button if you
want to keep those legs coming to skin
shell follow jumping back to the wood
this is a really neat bamboo charging
dock which is cool for a few different
reasons the first of which being the
utilization of magnets so once you place
the top housing down the magnets lock it
down making it nice and secure secondly
are the cutouts which are there with the
intent of place and a Bluetooth speaker
inside which then allows the sound to
come through for reference and for your
viewing pleasure Homer has taken the
place of a Bluetooth speaker so you can
go to visualize the sound coming out
magical and lastly what I like about
this is flexibility so you can see
there's space for a USB hub that you can
buy as a bundle but you can also mix and
match so whether you need more USB ports
or you just want to save a little cash
this particular one was only around 10
bucks which will save you more than 15
compared to the bundle following that
may go down in the tech under 50 Hall of
Fame because there definitely when my
favorite pics ever these are the
amplified by a duo which are stereo
speakers but the kicker is they're
wireless so these ship in a pair what's
cool is you can use them either
independently a single Bluetooth
speakers or use them in unison together
getting stereo left and right wireless
audio now to reiterate that is really
cool because you're not getting a single
audio source replicated over a second
speaker rather two independent channels
so in turn if you hate wires these are
perfect for a super clean minimal setup
dealing downside as you are going to
have to charge them at some point
instead of having them plugged into a
constant power source but overall that
very well may be worth the price of
having a set up as clean and more
importantly they sound fantastic for the
price so following that you guys know I
am a huge fan of docking setup so
therefore I'm constantly fascinated by
different docking stands and this
particular one dubbed the eat-in for
Mike UNIX is just about perfect for
starters it's made from solid aluminum
not only is it built like a tank it also
looks phenomenal the attention to detail
is strong with this one what makes this
unique though and stand out a bit from
the crowd is how easy it is to adjust
with this there is no need to mess
around with different pieces or swap out
parts you simply adjust your desired
width lock it down and you are good to
go so whether you deal with different
size laptops in your house
or you simply just want the peace of
mind I'm not worrying about having to
change this out if you upgrade computer
this is a solid choice so next up is
going to stop the music because we are
testing out a USB mic and in particular
this is the CA D u3 7 this thing
surprised the hell out of me with how it
sounded for under 50 bucks and keep in
mind if you're comparing the prior audio
my normal microphone is about 20 times
the price of this guy on top of that for
reference this is the built-in MacBook
Pro microphone and oh my god I'm sorry
and what I appreciate with this guy is
that it's a complete package you get the
mic stand the USB cable it's flexible so
you're going to be able to angle it at
just to write access to ensure optimal
sound quality and then things like a 10
decibel padding the low-pass filter are
a super nice touch last up is the up a
bluetooth outlet speaker by acoustic
research this is one of those things
where I was going down one of my usual
Amazon rabbit holes
I found it my initial reaction was why
does this thing exist with the more and
more I thought about it this thing is
really practical so it works by of
course plugging into your outlet but
what's sweet is not only do you get an
AC pass-through but you also get a 2.1
at fast charging USB port as well so in
turn this is kind of the perfect kitchen
accessory because one you're not gonna
have to worry about charging the speaker
and two you have a USB charging port
integrated right smack in there now the
only thing to point out is that this is
25 bucks so it's not gonna fill your
entire room with sound but it's gonna do
a much better job than your tablet
speakers or your built-in phone speakers
and it's a really quick and convenient
way to eat of play music or use it for
phone calls aside from that thank you
guys very much for watching pricing
availability and a ton of those slick
rap codes are linked down below if you
guys want more keep smashing that like
button and lastly before how about in
here I wanna give a huge shout to
Braintree payments for making today's
video possible they are a killer choice
for app payments and their V dot 0 SDK

payment integration that supports
Android pay PayPal Bitcoin Apple pay and
more it's ready for Android iOS
