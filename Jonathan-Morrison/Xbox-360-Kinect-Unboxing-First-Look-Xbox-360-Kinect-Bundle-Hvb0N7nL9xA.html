with tle bringing the unboxing to the
brand-new Kinect for the Xbox 360 just
pick it up at the midnight release over
at Best Buy I'll see you guys completed
and take a look at the package we went
ahead to went with the bundle with the
Xbox for a 64 gig version oh no it's
going to bust this guy open on the
bottom so right away jump in right there
on top of the box we get the Xbox 360
platinum hits builds your collection of
the best-selling games starting at only
20 bucks you can't lose right
that's kidding then they go over the
Xbox 360 start here Quick Start Guide
and of course we have the Xbox 360
really gets that in a minute
that's not what we're here for you guys
have seen an Xbox 360 unboxing so at the
top we get to connect adventures you
need to take a look at this so you guys
can see it requires the Kinect sensor so
we're gonna get that into the setup
guide and go over and cover all that
stuff beyond that is an Xbox roller for
the phone that we're going to unwrap
that amazing black Xbox controller we'll
set that with the Xbox looks like the
actual connect itself
looks like like a power brick more Xbox
cables you guys see the Kinect so we
have a full coverage on this hole
connect covering to set up the demo of
the game we'll compare to the move even
though I think that's kind of find this
but will do anyway I'll bring you guys
the full review so there you guys have
it there is the Kinect looks like we got
the camera Xbox 360 right there on this
top Kinect right there we have your
connector and I do you believe you need
an adapter for the older X boxes and
newer ones however will just be plug and
play and you're ready to go so there it
is kind of glossy black matches the Xbox
360 and since we're here let's go ahead
and not bringing the 360 out so we can
kind of see him hand-in-hand bring that
back into the package for you well it
looks like the four gig is not the
glassy version so there we go this is a
four gig kit there is the Xbox Kinect
360 Kinect this has been the unboxing
stay tuned for the review that
comparison to the move and the setup and
demo so doesn't that hope you guys enjoy
us unboxing and catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
