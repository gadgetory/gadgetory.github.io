welcome to a roundup of some of the best
Android apps and games so kicking up the
list is the artist formerly known as
lazy swipe now Omni swipe which gives
you ninja-like access to your most used
apps settings and even contacts now at
first glance you'd have no idea it was
there but swipe left or right and that's
where the action is you get a radial
style drawer with a tool box your
favorite apps and then your most recent
apps which can also be swapped for
contacts if you prefer that
the toolbox gives you access to system
settings which is completely
customizable but for example I have mine
set up for Bluetooth screen rotation a
quick screenshot the Omni settings Wi-Fi
flashlight and brightness sound and
volume favorites on the other hand is
really simple you pick your favorite and
most use apps drop them here and it's
just a really nice way to keep your
homescreen clean and tidy you also get a
handful of themes to choose from and
adjust your style plus as an added bonus
the notification function is a simple
visually appealing way to interact with
your notifications and for those
wondering what that little hanging
string dude is it's just a random way to
get recommended wallpapers and apps by
simply pulling it down next up is an
awesome time killing puzzle game dubbed
threes it's number base and the gist of
how it works is that any number higher
than three can only be added to itself
so for example when you add three plus
three that gives you 6 you now need
another 6 which turns into 12 and that
keeps going and going twos and ones on
the other hand they can only be added to
each other and these are the annoying
guys that ultimately lead to you running
out of moves the games themselves are
fairly quick but the addictiveness comes
from you trying to one-up your previous
score now Instagram just rolled out an
update with support for higher
resolution pictures so I thought it'd be
fitting to feature a sweet photo editing
app and in this case we're taking a look
at Pixlr you get your basic adjustments
like cropping and auto adjustments but
then like a billion more one thing I
really like is the launch screen where
you can quickly access your camera go to
your photo library or create a collage
and then you have the fresh button which
is access to your most recent photo one
quick tip though as a heads up which
might be a little bit confusing at first
is that the brighten adjustment is
actually just a brush and if something
you use to brighten something like teeth
or a specific region and not the entire
image
if you want to brighten the entire image
however you'd actually find that under
the contrast button some of the
adjustments I think most of you would
find useful as focal which allows you to
bring a particular object into focus
splash which lets you isolate a single
color to stand out or completely change
you can also touch up skin stylize the
picture and straight up doodle on your
pictures you then of course have a ton
of effects overlays borders which are
cool but should not be overused and then
a handful of text options which i think
is pretty damn awesome
also if you for some reason to have a
burning desire to slap some stickers on
your pictures or your face you can go to
town with Pixlr next up is pushbullet
which at its core allows you to bring
things from your phone to your computer
and vice versa but it's especially
awesome if you aren't tied down to one
ecosystem and want to bring some
uniformity to your life this works
across Android Windows iOS Mac and all
the major web browsers now I message has
its flaws but something I find immensely
useful is the ability to quickly send an
image from my desktop to my phone for
things like a video thumbnail that I'm
going to tweet from home later and with
pushbullet I can do exactly that but not
be tied down to using only an iPhone you
of course can do this not only with just
images but files and of course links
what's also awesome is the ability to
receive and act on notifications that
happen on my phone through my computer
so if I get a text on my s6 edge not
only will I be alerted on my macbook but
I can reply it right there and this also
works on web browsers as well on top of
that it has built-in chat the ability to
follow sites and things that interest
you but mostly it's a killer way to sync
multiple devices on different platforms
last up is 360 security which sandwiches
optimization and antivirus into one
convenient app it's huge in the Play
Store with over a hundred million
downloads nearly 6 million reviews and
is currently the number one downloaded
free tool now in terms of optimization
you have boost which shuts down unneeded
background tasks which frees up memory
and in turn can extend battery life you
then have clean which allows you to free
up application cache and junk files
which frees up more space for files you
actually want for security you can scan
and protect against viruses malware and
then add a layer of protection on things
like mobile payments what's really
useful though is the
AppLocker and I'm sure you've been in a
situation where you hand someone your
phone and they start piling through your
photos and you're like WTF dude well now
when someone jumps to your photo gallery
BAM it's like Chuck Norris is standing
right in front of them and this can also
be applied to any app or even contacts
so obviously 360 security is pretty
legit but they're so confident you'll
dig it they sent me a brand new Galaxy
s6 edge to give away for a chance to win
download the 360 app which is linked
below follow us on Twitter and then
tweet 360 security a screenshot of your
homescreen with the app installed using
the hashtag TLD 360 definitely make sure
to smash that like button if you want to
win this galaxy s6 edge all the details
and links to everything covered in this
video is down below and aside from that
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
