those easy i don't know right now is III
the big press conference for all the
major gaming companies microsoft just
went up first and they just finished and
i have to say it was a pretty weak
conference overall now don't get me
wrong commented to have some strong
points mostly in the form of gameplay
for some games that we already knew
about or haven't seen actual gameplay of
yet like halo for splinter cell
blacklist we did get a little bit of
color duty black ops 2 at the end and
one that was actually pretty happy to
see is the new tomb raider now aside
from these few small parts where they
did to actually show new gameplay the
rest of it was basically teaser trailers
for games we already knew about new
teasers for games that we haven't heard
of but didn't really tell us anything
about them and then a lot a lot of a lot
of emphasis on a lot of casual stuff
first off while the kinect wasn't the
centerpiece like it was the last two
conferences it was still mentioned just
about every other sentence every game
they showed off was always better with
connect with you know this little voice
commander this little addition even
though it wasn't as pushed as hard there
was this subtext that was going along
the whole time not only that but
microsoft somehow decided to be a great
idea to dedicate a whole six or seven
minutes of the press conference to just
having uh sure dance on stage it's
really awkward and honestly just seems
entirely out of place for e3 it's almost
like microsoft views it as some kind of
award ceremony where they need to have
performances and some way to really kind
of get people energized without actually
giving us any real substance or
information now of course the whole
focus for microsoft conference wasn't
just on the games they did end up going
a little more in depth in some of the
new additions they're making the xbox
dashboard first off they're having a
little more integration of the few more
forms of watching television including
access to machinima and univision for
all of you telenovela fans now the two
big non-gaming announcements that
microsoft really pushed was the addition
of internet explorer to the xbox
dashboard as well as the new mobile app
called smart glass basically what smart
glass does is it allows you to turn your
iDevice or android tablet android phone
whatever into a new companion device to
go with your xbox some of the main
examples they showed off for the fact
that you could start watching a movie on
one device and then watch the rest of it
on your television through xbox now the
main idea is that how it would actually
help accent the Xbox itself for instance
while watching a movie your iDevice can
also display things like cast notes for
the movie little production notes things
to let you know the history behind the
development of the film I would also do
things like give you additional controls
in certain games like entering plays for
Madden a lot of just little thing
about how Microsoft wants to try and
integrate I devices and tablets and the
whole mobile generation into their
gaming system which in my opinion is a
really smart idea for them because
unlike Sony and Nintendo who are really
trying to compete against the mobile
market by having their own handhelds
their own touch devices adding apps to
them Microsoft's just accepted them and
is trying to find ways to integrate them
into their own pre-existing system now
whether or not this idea proves to be
actually successful we'll have to wait
and see once it's actually released now
some of these new announcements aside
overall I will say the conference was
pretty lackluster there just wasn't a
whole lot of anything new or anything
surprising what new game announcements
we did get were barely touched upon like
the announcement of a few new games and
properties like matter which would be
used with the Kinect and another one
called ascend both games had interesting
little teaser trailers but we don't
really know anything about them other
than fact that they are coming out and
they have names now this is just the
start of all the e3 press conferences
we've still got Ubisoft EA and Sony
later today as well as Nintendo tomorrow
so now that Microsoft set the bar pretty
low in my opinion it's time to see what
these companies can do to really try and
show them up make sure to stay tuned for
the rest of today and tomorrow and later
this week as we cover more of what's
going on you three and if you haven't
