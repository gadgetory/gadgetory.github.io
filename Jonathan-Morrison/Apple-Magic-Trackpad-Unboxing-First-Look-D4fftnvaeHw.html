TLD I got the unboxing to the Apple
Magic Trackpad day late but nonetheless
let's go and open it ups on the front
you can see Magic Trackpad wireless
multi-touch trackpad it does a show a
picture of the unit itself as we flip it
over we get into the picture of the
magic trackpad with the hand kind of a
wing showing you how it's going to be
used and then it tells you let your
fingers do the clicking scrolling and
swiping just as you would on a macbook
so this is bringing the macbook macbook
pro trackpad over to a desktop feel so
we'll see how it works and then gives
you all the gestures that come with it
so far so point click double click right
click click and drag to finger scroll
rotate pinch zoom screen zoom page back
forward and it's also for safari photos
switch applications and activate expose
take a breath and you guys can see it
comes in at sixty nine bucks same price
as the magic mouse i will be doing a
full in-depth comparison between the two
letting you know which is more practical
which one it's better for yourself so
now without further ado let's go ahead
and open it up I've got a dangerous
butter knife I can do some damage to the
box and making decision in that plastic
wrap so that's about it as we unbox this
part there is a track pad itself so
there's not much else in the box
basically the whole box is the size of
the track pad so it's actually bigger
than you would find on a macbook pro or
macbook obviously let's go ahead and
bring it out and see if there's anything
else behind it sent that right there and
it's pretty bare you just get the
trackpad and limited warranty and then
the instruction manual so I do believe
there is a software firmware update
you're going to need to put on your back
to run this but that is it right there
so it looks like it's you guys have the
wireless keyboard same little design
right there it looks like it she's
actually an extension to that so I'll
definitely get into that in the review
in the comparison
and because of this and I just said I at
first didn't know you can click but
right away it does have the cliq so that
kind of actually scored some points to
me I was curious if you would be able to
click or not compared to the magic mouse
but you are able to so I'm interested in
comparing this it is a little bit bigger
space and a little bit bigger real
estate than the magic mouse you don't
need a basic mousepad anymore and then
with programs such as better touch tool
I'm looking forward to see what this
thing can do so that's been the unboxing
it's very simple very straightforward
but like I said stay tuned to the full
review of this and I also compare it
with the magic mouse so thank you guys
for watching as always feel free to
subscribe and I will catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
