bringing you my full review of mass
effect 3 for the xbox 360 and ps3 now
this game has been a long time coming
ever since the very first mass effect
came out back in 2007 with the promise
of a trilogy that would give players the
ability to import decisions they made
that would affect the entire series now
that we finally have it there has been
some mixed reception from some of its
fans not for what the game is but what
they think it should have been from a
gameplay standpoint mass effect 3 is a
direct growth from the second featuring
much of the same poor gameplay and a few
enhancements and a number of new options
players now have a more advanced cover
control system long for easier
navigation towards targets and also now
have a new strong melee attack that can
make several enemies pretty easy to kill
once the distance is closed alongside
these new general options olive
Shepherds available classes as well as
his teammates have one new power in
addition to what was available in to a
lot of these new abilities follows
special rules separate from the usual
such as grenades that don't activate the
global cooldown but require actual
ammunition or the vanguards Nova ability
which allows them to use up their
barrier for a powerful area of effect
attack all of these new powers are
welcome additions and add new strategies
to what was available in 2 but where we
really see a difference now is in weapon
variety back in mass effect 2 there are
roughly two to three different weapons
per category after DLC whereas now and
three we're hitting four or five choices
before any DLCs even added in and if
someone were to make use of all the
different special DLC options currently
available they can get as many as 11
different assault rifles to choose from
each gun works an X just different
enough to offer an interesting choice to
players and on top of this the game has
brought back a revamped version of the
weapon mod system allowing players to
customize their weapons with mods that
fit their play style like more ammo
capacity damage or adding a scope all of
these additions together bring what I
feel is one of the best combat
experiences in the Mass Effect series
albeit noticeably easier from prior
installments now of course this could
just be due to the fact that you have so
many more weapon options and powers and
the fact you can import your Shepherd
data from the second game keeping your
same level making you so much more
powerful right from the start but it
does detract quite a bit from the game's
difficulty making it very easy it just
doesn't feel like it has quite the same
level of challenge when you can clear
whole rooms by yourself even when
playing on higher difficulties now while
the combat has seen an overall upgrade
in Mass Effect 3 the narrative has taken
somewhat of a downward turn the game's
opening is strong
and the major quest lines that you take
part and act as powerful conclusions to
the issues and events that were set up
earlier in the series side quests have
died down a lot this time around though
with only a few major ones which mostly
serve as cameos for former squad mates
or as ways used to introduce the maps
and multiplayer a very large number of
the now have been reduced to a minor
fetch quests requiring Shepard to fly
around space to find some random item to
then give to a person on the Citadel and
cash it in for more money experience and
a war effort score which basically
determines how good of an ending you can
get this can get a little tedious
especially if you only want to enjoy the
single player game in which case you
need to do pretty much every single side
quest possible if you want to get a high
enough war effort score for a good
ending otherwise you'll have to play a
lot of multiplayer to make up for it now
this is helped out a bit by the fact
that import data can contribute a lot of
war effort score based on your prior
actions and there are a number of major
events that can only end happily if you
accomplish certain things back in mass
effect two or even one now I don't want
to give away any particular spoilers for
the plot of the game but one thing that
must be said is that one of Mass Effect
3's greatest weaknesses is its ending it
just Falls very flat on its face
especially after all the build-up for
the past five years now it's not the
worst ending ever written but it just
feels really odd and out of place and in
my honest opinion a little rushed
compared to some of the plot details we
saw in other games it also signifies a
very noticeable shift in the style of
storyline that was present in the first
two games when they had a different lead
writer now this ending alone doesn't
ruin the overall experience of the Mass
Effect series but it is just a little
disappointing for those of us that have
been playing through each and every game
waiting for this moment the narrative
also takes a bit of a hit due to the
cast of lead characters with all the
returning squad mates being more than
welcome but each of the new additions
feeling very weak whether due to
uninteresting character backstory or
development or by having very
unnecessary and odd subplots that add
little to the games overall experience
in addition to the game single-player
there is now a multiplayer component
styled after a four player co-op horde
mode players are able to pick from one
of the six traditional player classes
each of which has three different race
options that offer different ability
sets as players level up their online
character they can improve their
abilities as well as use credits to
purchase random packages that add new
character options more guns and mods and
one-time use items like rocket launchers
and med kits to help in tight situations
matches themselves revolve around
players taking down waves of enemies
as well as occasionally completing
special objectives it's surprisingly a
lot of fun albeit a much better
experience with friends than with random
teammates and something any fan of the
series should try out even if you don't
usually play online and like I said
earlier it does also help out the
single-player game by increasing what's
referred to as a galactic readiness
score which basically improves the
effectiveness of all the war assets you
accrue making it much easier to get a
better ending overall mass effect 3 is a
great third person shooter with a fun
balance of both guns and special power
use but when it comes to the narrative
it must be said that it is the weakest
in the series now it's not a bad game by
any stretch of the imagination and it
deserves a playthrough especially if
you've stuck with the series so far but
I have to say that is the shortest game
in series and the weakest in terms of
narrative and those of you that are big
fans of the plotline may find yourselves
just a little unsatisfied at the end
