off the announcement of the brand new
iPhone 10 but also the iPhone 8 and 8
plus as well I got a chance to go
hands-on and extensively cover that from
10 so if you missed that video I will
drop a link down below but today I want
to focus on both the iPhone 8 and 8 plus
and hopefully make it a little easier
for anyone who's potentially on the
fence about buying one of those phones
or even waiting for the iPhone 10 now
hands down the iPhone 8 and 8 plus
naming scheme was purely a marketing
move they very easily could have been
probably should have named these the
iPhone 7s and 7s plus but honestly I
can't really hate on them for that
because business-wise it was a super
smart move everybody up until the point
where essentially everything got leaked
would have assumed that the iPhone 8 was
Apple's giant big flagship release this
year but as we've seen that is clearly
the iPhone 10 and because these phones
are more than a month apart in release I
think it's safe to say it's gonna be a
pretty big end of the year for Apple
now one thing different with the iPhone
8 and 8 plus is the iPhone 6 the 6s and
7 all shared aluminum bodies whereas
with the iPhone 8 and 8 plus those
feature and all glass back which not
only change it to look in the field but
also introduces wireless charging so for
anyone out there who thought that maybe
wireless charging was exclusive to the
iPhone 10 nope you get that across the 8
and the 8 plus as well and I just sort
of see throughout this video these three
phones share more features than you
might think
now as far as the colors go gone is rose
gold so no longer not to argue about
whether it's pink or rose gold we are
now simply left with silver gold and
Space Gray honestly after seeing is in
person I think I'm gonna have to say
gold is my favorite it just looks the
nicest by far and surprisingly I'm gonna
say that silver is my runner-up and a
Space Gray out of these three was my
least favorite now as far as the
displays go there definitely are some
improvements nothing drastic though the
iPhone 8 is still rockin a 4.7 inch
display with the same resolution whereas
the iPhone 8 plus is rocking a 5.5 inch
display with the same resolution as well
upgrades that both these phones share
are improve stereo speakers surprisingly
both the iPhone 8 and 8 plus share the
exact same a 11 Bionic chip found in
that phone 10 so maybe you're not ready
to give up that home button or the
iPhone 10 really isn't doing it for you
it's nice to know you're not gonna have
to sacrifice performance so if you miss
my iPhone 10 video crazy name aside that
11 chip is supposed to be stupid fast I
think there were some preliminary
benchmarks that leaked showing that it
was just as fast as a 13-inch MacBook
Pro which is kind of crazy if you think
about I for one am super excited to get
this in
house check it out test out for myself
and there's anything as far as
performance goes you guys want to see
let me know as a comment down below now
as far as the cameras go the iPhone
eight is rocking a single 12 megapixel
shooter it is supposed to be an improved
sensor with what Apple is calling deeper
pixels not sure exactly what that means
but it's supposed to translate to more
accurate colors that of course swapped
to see once I get one in house now as
far as the iPhone 8 plus that again is
rocking a dual lens configuration like
we saw in the 7 plus but if you're
curious what's different between the
iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone 10
obviously one we have a vertical
configuration in the iPhone 10 but the
biggest difference between the two is
the iPhone 10 actually has OS on both
the lenses where the iPhone 8 plus only
has OS on the single main shooter just
like the iPhone 10 though there are of
course improvements to portrait mode on
the iPhone 8 plus as well on top of that
what Apple is calling portrait lighting
which essentially gives you the ability
to manipulate different lighting
elements and environments either pre or
post photo it's kind of cool too on top
of that beyond the ability to tweak
things in post you could just shoot a
regular portrait mode photo without any
portrait lighting effects and still
decide to add it in later
now from there hands down one of the
biggest upgrades to come to the f-18 the
8 plus and the 10 this is one feature
that all three of these phones share is
video these phones all shoot at 4k 60
frames per second might be a little
crazier for me is 240 FPS slow-motion at
1080p GoPros don't shoot 4k 60 none of
the Canon shoot 4k 60 I think the gh 5
will get you 4k 60fps but that is nearly
2 grand
so hopefully that should put things into
perspective so from there for anyone was
kind of on the fence between the iPhone
8 and 8 plus or the iPhone 10 I think
one of the biggest questions is are you
ready to give up that home button both
the iPhone 8 and 8 plus still have that
comfortable familiar touch ID home
button where the I from 10 obviously
does not essentially you're almost kind
of Guinea pigging a first generation
product with the iPhone 10 because do
you trust face unlock is it going to be
good enough we've already seen some
controversy so that is something you
definitely have to ask yourself for me
what draws me most towards the iPhone 10
is you're essentially getting all of the
plus features in a smaller form factor
you're getting a bigger screen you're
getting dual cameras with OS on both
lenses so for me that's kind of almost
the way to go I will say though if I had
to guess between these three phones I
would think the iPhone 8 plus would
still have the best
her life had three followed by the
iPhone 10 then of course lastly the
iPhone eight ultimately features aside
though it comes down to pricing do you
want to pony up the cash for the iPhone
10 the iPhone 8 starts at $6.99 the
iPhone 8 plus starts at $7.99 and then
we of course have the iPhone 10 which
starts all the way up at $9.99 so for
those watching right now there's a good
chance you may have just pre-ordered an
iPhone 8 or a plus or you could be
holding out for the iPhone 10 let me
know what you went with and why I would
love to hear what you think aside from
that thank you guys very much for
watching if you enjoyed this video if it
helped make sure you guys drop a like
