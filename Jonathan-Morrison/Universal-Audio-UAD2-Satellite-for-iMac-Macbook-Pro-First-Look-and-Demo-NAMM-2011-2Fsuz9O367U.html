tlz this is a little bit different I
know we usually cover the consumer tech
stuff a lot of you guys know I do do the
music side of it so this is something
that really was cool to me I'm stoked
with it so you guys have to buy IMAX the
MacBook Pros Universal are there just a
quick overview they make sick plugins
preamps and stuff like that so we got
left he's actually the senior product
manager he's going to show off this new
device for you guys hello I'm dude
really great thanks for covering us we
really appreciate it
like you said we're really well-known
for making the best analog emulation
plugins for all the audio software
applications that are out there up until
now we've been limited to the PCIe
machines the big tower machines where
we've been out to the show is we have a
firewire 800 you 82 product it's a u 82
satellite
so yeah that's awesome for you guys
because before you are limited to Mac
Pro some of them older MacBook Pros that
have the Express set but now since Steve
Jobs don't care about that no more
kind of left some people in with us so
this is for iMac users most of the
MacBook models I need to tell you guys a
little more about that right so you know
when you look at you know those laptops
the IMAX Mac minis that are out there
they've all got firewire 800 is only a
couple models of donuts and so it means
that anybody with that machine who wants
to do production on the go or maybe
that's their primary music making
machine they can now run the full
library of you 82 plugins so anything
like the Studer is the Manley's the
needs all these classic emulations that
we've done can now be run on an iMac and
what we've got here is just that we've
got the neat channel strip the solid
state logic or the SSL channel strip
we've got our newest plugin which is the
Studer 24 track multi-channel tape
machine it's winning all sorts of awards
everyone's really really diggin it
because it's accurately modeling a 24
track a machine it's about yay tall that
big and it sounds amazing and we've got
it now perfectly emulated in a plugin so
those of you who don't really know about
this so essentially this is going to
help take some of the stress off of
their computer that's right so we did we
do two things with this product and this
is the box right here down in the corner
it'll do two things really well it'll
take all of the CPU processing off the
computer because we have DSP in the box
that handles that
and the other thing that it does is we
have higher quality algorithms than
you'd find natively on the host so it's
really a bang for the buck thing also
one thing I really thought was cool was
the fact that they do have multiple
firewire input so if you guys have
external hard drives for scratch disks
or you have a FireWire 400 interface
they do accommodate that right so one
might tell them a little more about that
yeah totally so we've got three firewire
ports on the back two firewire 800 ports
and then a firewire foreign report and
you can use any of them to either
connect to the computer or daisy chain
so that all totally works and we know
that a lot of our customers are using
those products and we wanted to make
sure it all work so you get a nice hub
on the back you guys saw it right now
this is kind of one of the coolest
things I've seen at NAMM so far I want
to thank love first time we're going to
jump to a couple of audio clips so you
guys can see the difference of on an
office and really what it does to sound
thanks so much
after after any
drive you crazy
somehow we shave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
