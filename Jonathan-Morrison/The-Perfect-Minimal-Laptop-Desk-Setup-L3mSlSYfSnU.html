guys johnathan here and this is my take
on a perfect minimal laptop setup that
you can plug in and dual functions as a
desktop so there are three main
components to this setup the laptop the
desk and the monitor the centerpiece is
the 2018 14 inch LG gram which is
portable crazy life but also packs a
surprising amount of power inside is
intel's eighth generation i7 cpu a
gigabytes of ram and a 512 gigabyte SSD
unlike most laptops and phones these
days that seem to get rid of every
single port this packs a ton and
specifically a really crucial element to
this setup this USB C port this supports
data video and power and that allows it
to connect the laptop to the monitor and
even charge it with a single cable which
is awesome on top of that you have a
fingerprint reader a beautiful display
that also doubles as a touchscreen so
you kind of get the best of both worlds
there's a backlit keyboard fantastic
audio when you want to rock headphones
and as impressive as all that is again
what stands out most to me is how
lightweight this thing is when you pick
it up you kind of almost got to do a
double take it is that light plus you're
gonna get crazy long battery life out of
this guy up to 17 and a half hours which
means you won't have to worry about
being stuck to an outlets so when you
combine that portability with the power
and flexibility that kind of rounds this
out as the perfect laptop to take on the
go we of course are not just on the go
so dive in a little deeper into the
setup the desk is a combo from Ikea like
usual I'm most likely going to butcher
these names this is the Girton tabletop
and that is paired with the odbald
trestle legs this combo is simple but
also very satisfying those dark legs
with the light wood top contrasts really
well together and I'm gonna tell you
that is some seriously solid wood now
from there that beautiful monitor
sitting on the desk is LG's 27 UK 850 W
which is 4k features HDR 10 and USB C
which makes all the magic happen for a
second though can we give a thumbs up to
that wallpaper it is beautiful and yes I
will drop a link to that down below this
is a gorgeous crisp display with super
accurate colors but again the magic here
is that
USBC port which connects the gram and
allows us to do everything with a single
cable
so again data powered video all through
a single cable and that's really
important because it allows us to leave
everything but the laptop at the desk
the keyboard and mouse which is an
ergonomic combo from Microsoft run off a
USB receiver so instead of having to
leave that plug in the laptop
potentially worrying about losing it I
could just leave that plugged in at the
monitor and because everything is sent
to that single cable again that's why
everything is so simple and so
convenient touch it back on the keyboard
and the mouse this is my first time ever
using or trying something organ Amin it
was a little weird at first but after
getting used to it I could definitely
see where the benefits were and if
you're someone who types for hours and
hours every single day I would
definitely consider checking these out
now to throw in a variation of this the
display will also rotate vertically so
the instance where you potentially
wanted to use your LG Graham as your
main display and take advantage of that
vertical real estate you can also do
that as well now this looks awesome but
for me I've never really used a vertical
display or been a fan but if you rock
one and you're set up let me know with a
comment down below now initially when I
asked you guys on Twitter what this
setup might need the number one answer
was a chair unfortunately this chair
cannot do this but the good news is it
is not 399 it is much cheaper in fact
it's around 60 bucks on Amazon it's
insanely comfortable complements the
desk legs really well inside note it's
what allowed me to grab some of the
shots in this video
now potentially the most interesting
thing about this setup has got to be the
speakers which is actually LG's sj7
sound bar but comma Iowa this is the
sound bar actually is split off into two
separate stereo speakers so you can use
them in a multitude of ways for this
setup it allowed for a really unique
vertical look which i think looks
awesome but why it works so well with
this is the fact that can connect
wirelessly through bluetooth to the LG
gramm there's also a subwoofer which
kind of rounds out the sound gives you
that oomph at low end and even though
these speakers weren't meant for desktop
they work amazingly well and I think
round out the entire experience that
again follows the idea of leaving
everything but the laptop at the desk
that way when I come back I have a
keyboard of a mouse of a beautiful
display and amazing sounding audio
lastly I have no idea where I found this
plant but if I find it I will drop a
link down below that also includes a
salt lab because I know you were
thinking about that thank you guys so
much for watching this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
