some pixel games today is the mission to
find a pixel actually a pixel XL for me
pixel for me for mr. Evans I have a
pixel coming later today my excel isn't
going to come until sometime next week
so I'm trying to find that right now hey
another vlog bro is that camera hi how
do we look at your news so you guys may
have heard of Linus tech tips we just
discovered Austin vlog tips oh yeah it's
basically always hold the camera above
you cuz no one wants to be looking up
your nose don't I'm fighting yours right
now to grab Google Maps out of my phone
right now
because I know it's here but I don't see
it so my instinct is we're going the
wrong direction but I'm like sounds like
a no tech challenge
so buh-bye
guys we made it judging by the massive
line inside it is relieved now oh haha
that's like we are like 30 minutes late
well I read that the 128 gigabytes sold
out of the XL of the XL
yes gee I wonder what we can get I
wonder if we can find a blue one the
blue I like the blue
yeah I'm really down for finding the
blue so if you guys are excited for the
pixel drop a like and let me know which
one you got it's time to find one
so I came in for an Excel they have the
blue one I like the blue it's very ipod
touch but mission successful
yours walking on crack right sorry I'm a
little excited right now
I came in for an Excel but they had the
blue pixel like grab I also got a very
blue pixel and you're right it looks
just like an iPod touch like very very
ipod touch esque but I like it let me
know which color you guys dig quick
update though for any of you guys
following me on snapchat
I just want to report in that Austin
Evans is a changed man right now
boom black socks Austin reasonable this
is a reasonable decision to make with my
life
don't judge me no
sorry I'm taking over the unboxing so
inside you have oh look it's the phone
hey that's my unboxing sorry spoilers
check out my brand new 2016 iPod Touch I
actually really like the blue it's a
really kind of interesting design with
the aluminum and the glass kind of
two-tone almost but seriously regardless
of how good of a phone this is you can't
argue that look like iPod Touch so we
look at the black XL versus the white
you'll notice that the bezels here look
enormous and that are actually enormous
this however does a much better job of
hiding it I will say that camera
the lack of hump is awesome I never saw
that one before the lack of hump camel's
needham yeah
camel cameras on phone don't the one
hand feels really nice four five inches
in one hand for just about a half inch
Evans
well it's XL Evans so right now I'm
gonna go to nad my fingerprint and if
you notice this action on the back we
got a timer on this No
that was it quick setup yeah drop test
caught on camera
yeah damn you wind just cut that up that
was an accidental drop test thanks to
mother nature but luckily after my heart
dropping down to my stomach everything
seems to be okay hey John are you mad
that the pixel features aren't coming to
the Nexus I am me personally not really
but I can totally see the frustration if
you've been a nexus user because
honestly up until this point that had
been the end-all be-all Android
experience latest features the latest
software and now things kind of changed
a bit with a pixel and pixel excel on
the flip side though there actually may
be some positivity with this which I
know may be hard to accept but if you
think about it as awesome as the Nexus
lineup was it was almost as elite
underground exclusive club that not
everybody knew about to most people out
there if you were to ask them about
phone it's either an iPhone a samsung or
a droid and that's just reality with the
pixel and pixel XL Google's promoting
this they're advertising it everywhere
and honestly I think the pixel is a
little friendlier and more mainstream
and the idea with this if it can catch
fire then the idea is to bring pure
Android to the masses which is a great
thing hey Jonathan the question I have
is since the pixel and pixel X L don't
actually have oh is how does the
stabilization compare to other phones
that do so far yeah the image
stabilization as far as this video goes
was really good you could definitely
tell that it was more software base as
opposed to hardware and upon initial
impressions I still think the iPhone 7
and 7 plus take the edge as far as that
goes
but I will definitely be testing it
further weak pauses video Berkley a
person they can tap where's the pixel
man I want to see pixel bro what video
you watch this entire video so far has
been about the pixel so I know the
phone's not waterproof but is it
water-resistant at all are you and are
you going to do a water test sadly no
and that was one of the biggest things
that left people scratching their head
at that price point why isn't the pixel
and pixel XL at least water-resistant on
the flip side of that question even
though it's technically not
water-resistant there's a little part of
me that is tempted to at least try and
see if it could withstand that so does
something you guys want to see maybe if
this video hits
thirty thousand likes and we will do a
Google pixel water test how do you think
the pixels camera is going to compete
with the iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy
s7 camera because those two are very
hard to beat so far yeah the camera is
no joke I'm not gonna go as far as to
say it's the best smartphone camera the
year yet I obviously want to test it out
some more compared against different
phones but so far I am beyond impressed
it's fast it's snappy in the initial
images I was pulling out of the pixel XL
we're sharp tons of clarity tons of
dynamic range so as far as the camera
goes yes the hype is real
so we're closing the video out with a
front-facing camera test let me know
what you guys think of the quality so
far I think it looks really good stay
tuned obviously for more pixel coverage
subscribe if you haven't yet and I will
catch you guys later hey John what's up
quick question how do you think Android
KitKat would run on the pixel XL
what's up Jonathan I just wanted to say
hey guys this is Austin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
