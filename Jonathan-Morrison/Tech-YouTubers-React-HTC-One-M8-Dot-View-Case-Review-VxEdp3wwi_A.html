Plus for a free extended to a trial head
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD hey
guys johnathan here with TLD so this
weekend we got together for quite
possibly the biggest tech collaboration
of all time helping out Lou from unbox
therapy for his upcoming fanboy rap
video as you can see there are tons of
familiar faces and I got to say some
crazy stuff went down so if you want to
stay posted and stay up-to-date on when
that officially comes out make sure to
follow Lou and myself on Twitter and we
will keep you guys posted now as a
result of all of us getting together
afterwards we ended up eating dinner and
I had just gotten in the HTC One m8 dot
view case and I wanted to see what
everyone thought of it so enjoy look at
this flappy thing
oh my doing out here
am i making a phone call that's not a
phone you know I understand people want
to pretend they're carrying around I
don't know some kind of laptop there's a
phone first
this hand is happy run a Samsung stuff
slipcovers what's the wisdom enemies
please explain because how is that and I
don't scratch my screen yes I always
pass my screen ever the screen is find a
most durable element of these homes is
great isn't it
for scratching I don't have the screen
is it cancer I don't paint blue quick
information there's no that yeah that's
it they don't like because they see
glass and they automatically assumed
fragile I don't even look at that as a
way to protect my Julie how is it quick
coloration you have to type all right
those no longer the word is it well I
guess the Rose oh let it would be better
but yeah but this is the coolest gimmick
in a while that's it but to call it
anything else because listen we all got
that nostalgic with the hey we all
will get that feeling inside
does that mean I'm actually providing
like that is awful bother when you
taking a picture it just looks cool but
but again this look it looking cool in
exchange for the loss of utility he's
not a fair trade as far as I'm concerned
I'm not gonna be that guy with the
photos taking photos I'll get an iPad
take some photos with that first
you already here first now everybody
went out and buy that damn things about
the heat on this you can't use the one
hand you have to flip it over like this
and you want to open up the camera can't
see and you have to hold it like this
that's this show I had with I mean it's
no different than terrible
implementation it's no but no sense
cover but it looks nice with the a
bitter it's like flappy bird you know
yeah that's exactly why it's a gimmick
it's that quick formation I know I also
see the point sorry for 50 bucks
and you're the phone guy I'm not even
foam buff you know we should assume that
you should listen to him this down take
a seat what do you what do you like
about it better say that need to see
that far enemy I don't disagree with you
cumbersome having to take a picture with
it is your phone better or worse with it
on there's other people tell me there's
things I like about it like what the
fact that I'm here swipe down but you
could do that without it I understand
you can't even like take a call with it
yeah okay so call me
yeah there's no new function now me and
Luke spilling bezel oh yeah the phone
without the team hey what's it your
screen I just think it's neat that's all
I think Luke's Pierre that's that's
where I stand
hey that's it slight bright not a
novelty yeah yeah
you swipe up
you know
all right load support I think you
because you can call them yeah they are
to extend that's why I want to use a
good hold it
then they seem weird did how much time
do they spend on the R&amp;amp;D for the dam
Tobiah I'm making it polished over here
and fancy over there and then why no I
don't like volume volume down yeah
that's all I did
I don't disagree with you for the fight
guys think it's neat how many engineers
concepts and the other problem I had
with it is that it takes all the
sexiness away that's the biggest Oh
second point but it's like an athlete
product no Bernardo mate the one like
that's the best thing about it is fill
in the medal yeah it's gone well
wonderful free is fun it is very
slippery
oops out of my hand let me see man it's
the the new the image way more slippery
than the the m7 yeah feels like yeah
it's stainless steel I mean oh my god
slippery oh my god that's dangerous
yeah
oh my god do you know how many of these
gonna be smashed in the next week and
one but you know they have they have the
HTC advantage I don't know about that
about legitimate people real human
beings not free they're offering free
screen replacement or one in over six
months that's why you selling like hey I
can fight if I loosen the squeeze per
second it's miss diving yeah you know
Ari listen the phone is very slim all
right I know I was upset I'm trying to
bring it down a notch right now
I just held the phone with no case as
 ain't right very very slippery
4,600 bucks and you probably would drop
it without a case so look at the damn
case man ow
he hurts me to say it I mean they
designed it that way
couldn't they need the back a little
more grippy what happened I whenever I
got a third-party gripping service dad
like a grip to it you want to make it
look good but I have the it actually
does protect it because it is slippery
it looks good that's why we all like it
okay well case a genetically it's good
yeah and you know the HTC One opponents
office looks good but the phone is
slippery so you have to cover the case
anyway it's a weird thing man like
everybody wants the high-end material
everybody wants the brushed legitimate
thing but do you really want it no deep
down this is deep man would you
hold this without the case it is it is
very slippery
all right let's get the case okay
but the case I mean what do you think
about the case is it adding
functionality for you $50 is it worth a
dollar
is it more good than bad is it I totally
just picked it up alright I better say
it first is the most collaborative you
have to say I like how being able you're
able to see like the weather and are you
but if we told you you could see that
without the case would you care about
that okay you can do that without the
case dude I know baked looks cool right
now looks and the case actually feels
pretty reasonable like as far as like
the don't vol or not like fairness or
whatnot it's the best case ever I love
it I take it off down see if you like it
that's the case it's slippery although
I've got to say butts metal does feel
great but it feels like a refrigerator
like the chef series from Samsung no
yeah that's that's better than plastic
no yeah it's not that bad I'll actually
think it's fall I'm gonna come and hit
your arm yeah I think it's actually it's
not insane okay yeah it's not bad to
name a phone that's more slippery
doesn't I can't
oh yeah no yeah these guys is not bad
the guy that went away no
I think it's not too bad the case
definitely adds a little bit more to it
but that Mellie who look nice like that
it feels nice yeah the whole like that
curve actually feels nice but all mental
it's all right but I mean take a picture
that's a good football if you hold it
like this well you do with one hand yeah
another thing I don't like is there's no
volume going out with a camera that was
weird opponent there's no inline control
or anything all right one-handed yes
wait you can't change the song oh yeah
yeah that's another thing that's another
good point there's no music controls or
mind control with like if you're playing
music you can't skip or how you or
whatever
oh yeah are we serious right now
cover I got bigger promise all right
here now you have to hold it like weird
oh that's awesome
that is JJ Abrams just took over they
you know yeah it's a it's a freaking is
actually kind of insane no you know you
know what that happens right it's it's
because a the lens elements suck on that
camera and B if you get it the tiniest
smudge on the lens elements but B it's
because they suck though that it does
that so I think the cases look like I
think that there's some legitimate value
if you're buying a case for it that's
not a bad idea
I'm not a guy who really likes these
cases on my phone like what would you be
worried about dropping the phone without
the case no not really I don't drop
phones like I just don't do that like I
don't mean let's be honest you we make
videos we sit in one room with
carpet on the ground yeah yeah maybe
we're not on the battlefield lifestyle
there they come on your train during the
subway this is me what we can't really
compare to a regular lifestyle we can
try all the field testing we want
doesn't work it's not concrete but it's
definitely better than just I'm okay
here actually is looking wrong here wait
okay I'll show you my case I have a case
on my HTC One alright and this is my
case it has a nice rubber grip around
plastic is his Chi like that field so
you know that case for like $10 so right
compared to like oh yeah I've dropped it
with that actually legitimately and it
did it protected it objection this feels
speaking that's actually it's it's not a
matter kind of makes it go striations
and phone to a Samsung phone like this
man like this is just like cheap
I just gotta stop protecting I would use
that yeah but I still think they should
see what I think for thine is easy yeah
it's hard like tonight I don't worry
about that I would not get a kiss I mean
like the docq case is all right but it's
just such a nice phone all right I think
but I don't know in terms of donkey
casing at the concepts rule but I think
my biggest promise it is on hand to make
a bird noise you know whatever we want
to do I keep my phone's on like a table
oh wow yeah that's a good point yeah but
it'll rock back and forth if you have if
you don't have the case on yeah that's
your rock he doesn't really straight he
doesn't even scream hey you scratch that
I'm gonna kill you you kind of break for
one night come on but manikin
functionalities there
hangout the hangouts or YouTube voice
I would never expect it to them I mean
just because they don't care doesn't
care but I mean I think I think the
features on here have potential just the
fact that it doesn't leave flushed and
taking cameras taking things and taking
photos is more than a joke I don't think
I can recommend the case
Marco Polo the darkest door doing sir
okay so this is the HTC one and this is
the HTC dot case for the HTC One my bat
we only have these things on tablets why
because you have two hands and this you
cannot you're so eloquent with your
words it's not very good I mean it feels
nice and I think it looks good and I
think the functionality of this looks
kind of cool and it's really retro style
like the dot matrix display unlike one I
guess come you're always found out the
leaders are like feel old screams
through buds as the case I can't
recommend is really slippery having a
social but use the phone of advocates
and then if you drop it you have six
months to say HTC advantage if you drop
your screen to a place in two three four
up to six up to six months ago how many
times car there on one-to-one
yeah the case is fine if you if you
really want it by Jane thank you it's
not the first time a sec did that yeah
you know what that's good man
way to go but they know they've hit a
slippery foam what they didn't sell any
more because they put it on they all get
to create that my voice is good but also
horn you see advantage kind of goes too
soft or too good man who talked about it
the event I think they're gonna have
kids bet you that's the additive HCC
apps on the Google Play Store kind of
Motorola today and up the all their
software we get up there yeah I think
that's that's part of HD CNN is jarred
why is it on Saturday green one Illinois
my having to manage well it's it's I
think everyone is moving towards yeah I
mean it's a good movie for Android
instead of fragmentation and so much
difference between software nobody's
okay I'm surprised that the bat feels
very different than I expected I
expected until more
the front where it has like a texturized
feel this is actually really smooth I'm
actually surprised there but cases like
this the functionality definitely does
stop when you're trying to get like damn
well why something in landscape and
kinda have to fiddle your fingers in
between like your fingers get caught in
between and gotta hold it like this
but overall considering that the phone
is as slippery as it is I don't think
that's a it's a bad add-on one thing it
seems I don't know does the original HTC
one have the volume rocker on the left
side yes so I'm sure they had this in
mind and kind of found the right side
does anyone have an argument for having
a switch on the top I hate it because I
keep wanting to hit there's no reason
that the volume down at the screen I
think is the perfect spot I mean yeah I
agree
you know doing the right side is perfect
what's playing that that's why I don't
like is you can't there's no inline
controls yeah I didn't even know
something was playing until I actually
saw the volume for me overall I mean the
feel is nice I wish it was a more
uniform feel rather than the slip
I mean it's baby box I justify it but
chicks probably won't buy that phone
chicks will but yeah probably not
but chicks would buy that case but maybe
that case is making chicks wanna buy the
phone
that's it so it's it's not a stuff
really into the whole I think that
chicks think that looked right there is
huge right maybe I'm wrong I think that
chicks would think that was cute right I
don't know I mean the whole I think
chicks like cheeks like the iPhone 5c in
the doc case those are dogs ears it's
hopefully you guys enjoyed this giant
uncut raw collaboration video if you did
