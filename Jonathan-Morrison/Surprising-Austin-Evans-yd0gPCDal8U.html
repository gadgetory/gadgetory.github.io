out of that house and spoil the whole
damn thing I know but it's just like you
get one chance at this I called them all
right five minutes ago it's gone there's
nothing they can do now
oh my god Oh
so I'm sure most of you already knew if
not now you know that unfortunately this
past week Austin Evans who is a fellow
tech reviewer here on YouTube had his
condo completely burned down in fire I
mean he lost everything it was
completely obliterated now what I
initially saw what happened and I saw
the pictures I was completely devastated
and gutted for him because if he met
Austin he is one of the nicest human
beings on the planet has a good heart he
works hard he deserves everything that
is good in his life and to see that
happen for him was a little hard so I
got the idea to get together with the
tech community we're actually gonna
surprise Austin when I first saw the
video I was out of town and you tweeted
me right away yeah it's like this is
some and let's make a move and
so I was you know trying to we're trying
to think of what to do yeah because I
didn't meet your reaction how can we go
immediately and that's that ideas what
you know is what brought us out here
but truthfully neither of us have ever
been in this part of the country before
I really don't know
when we we saw me we sort of know this
is his location
concretely either of us have been here
before
concrete
this could be a disaster so anyhow a
huge chunk of what has been called the
tech community of YouTube
has jumped in on this date to help out a
fellow youtuber and I think the
responses just been really cool and
we're lucky enough that opportunity
opportunity to be the ones it's a sort
of bigger set to actually enjoy the
reaction in person and so then that was
enough that was a bird that was a
bird that was like a turkey that was
some kind of wild bird tells you because
it had feathers
it won't be a turkey what if what would
he know it would be an eagle
glad I didn't hit it again
all we did whatever it was look at this
is pretty cool man
I didn't when when I'm looking at
Missouri on a map I did it at mad and I
thought I'm picturing all flat the whole
way we'll look check this out
we got awesome
yep six
right this is close as possible as a
very original Eurasia is it well what's
his original he got the six floor but he
upped it to 512 gigs story
okay so
we got an authority getting rap kids
right
because I'm to expand
all right right I'll grade that you can
upgrade that down the road
the ramekins
people's brain shift in the
that's right thanks kids gift card
yeah I think so that's his house right
there and right now we're trying to
figure out a way to place the Mac Pro in
front doorstep and record his reaction
without him seeing us standing there or
whatever I mean this is an angle but
you're gonna see this you're gonna see
the car sitting right here then if we
stay here someone can come out of that
house and spoil the whole damn thing I
know but it's just like you get one
chance at this one chance
honestly his reaction just seeing us
being here alone he's gonna be huge so
if we're just knocking ignored sticky
camera in his face again are we keeping
the knife Pro here though I think we
might have to keep the Mac Pro in here
in keep this stuff in here and then and
then bade him out and go listen we just
we came out here one thing your friend
dinner Sam you know yeah let me we will
say listen we just want to come take
y'all for dinner we have we brought a
message from all these other people that
plan yeah and then he comes with us and
then someone gets him away from the
table or whatever and we plant the Mac
Pro there okay so we're gonna do it a
dinner I think that's what we should do
right now because that I'm telling you
right now I mean I could sneak out and
put this camera down somewhere we could
I could try that but he's gonna see the
camera that's the problem and then what
like it would it there's no real place
for me to put it where I'm gonna catch
his face and he's not gonna see it
let's drive woman let me take one more
look at that alright doorstep like are
there any places off to the side like
where he won't see it peripherally on
that nun that little I just need nothing
man it's not the only place to capture
his reaction is one get fogged up it's
from right here we run up with a Mac Pro
out there okay
again fog will help dog in we want to
put the Mac Pro there at the front door
ring it run back just run back and we
duck down in the cost of the cars there
but we're not in it but then worse ones
you where to go from that will we need a
Mac Pro record the reaction then take
off let's just go knock on a damn door
now you put me right in the snow over
here should we wait let's go talk to it
okay
might be better heavens
you don't know us we're friends with
Austin he had no idea we're here we're
surprising him okay is he uh is he home
lovely y'all need to Boosh yeah so we
got together to a goodwill of care
package we have Austin's dad involved
now so he knows what's going on and he's
gonna help us surprise him so we're
gonna place the math pro at the front of
the house he's going to go and get
Austin tell him there's something for
him on the front step and we're gonna
wait around the corner on this side of
the house over here right on the side of
the house and try to capture his
reaction in complete secret so we got
lucky his dad came outside without being
prompted so how we're all set up you
gotta get that little note though yeah
where is it oh no oh dinner do I have it
no I don't man was on the coaster let's
me forgot it we forgot it it's all right
well now we don't need to we don't need
to true yeah so make sure to put it

right there ah let me check no put it a
little deeper a little further out right
