bringing you guys an unboxing of the
Denon ahc 710 in-ear headphones want to
say a big thanks to Eric for sending
these out to review really appreciate it
these retails for about 150 bucks on the
front of the box we got acoustic luxury
we see the headphones themselves we got
Denon and the model number and then we
got a nice and warm and fuzzy message
from Denon for 100 years Denon has
passionately engineered some of the
world's most acclaimed components for
the audio professional and enthusiasts
alike
now that audio passion can be yours
personally so do you promise that denim
I'll have to find out on the back side
would get specifications we got the
barcode and again in the model number
let's go and get into the box and dig in
quit making you guys wait just some
small tape here so we're going to do
some doctor work slice that open all
right it's got it got it got it got it
good easier there I'm a scratch my desk
don't do that kids don't scratch the
desk let's go ahead and open the top
side just from looking at these kind of
the first impressions it looks like they
got a little angle to them and they're
giving me some problems
see there we go nope just a illusion
really came out very comfortably so fix
the box make it all pretty again
and get these open so it's like a box
within a box how many times you guys see
that open that up and okay so got the
headphones and we got some additional
things in here looks like a carrying
case this is actually really cool it's
like it's pretty padded this is neat so
Denon little magnet flip open I dig that
that's really neat that they included
that this looks like pretty pretty solid
definitely cool on Dan's part to include
that in that that's heavy-duty one of
the better cases I've seen include with
a pair of headphones and I'm gonna be on
that we got some literature boring stuff
this is gonna tell you don't blow your
ears up warranty all that good stuff and
we got some looks like probably
additional ear tips
and some audio adapters go ahead and rip
this open just a little plastic and tape
and they include one two three three
additional sets of ear tip tips tips
can't talk and an audio adapter it looks
like an arrow right angle Jack let's go
ahead and bust it out actually this is
an audio extension cable not just a
right angle adapter so this is gonna
give you a little more juice a little
more length if you want that that's what
she said just kidding and last but not
least we got the headphones themselves
let's go ahead and zoom up for you guys
so you guys can see they got a slight
angle right here this is similar to the
clips that I reviewed what this is gonna
do is gonna allow it to sit in your ear
at a better angle so off to see the
sound quality next go to stay tuned for
the full review overall these feel
pretty good they look pretty good I will
let you know what I think in the full
review this has just been the unboxing
and I will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
