hey guys johnathan here with TLT hope
you guys are having a fantastic day or
night whenever you may be watching this
and today we are talking I phone six and
one would think I phone the number six
that logically this would be the sixth
iPhone but nope that will give us not
one crap about making sense believe it
or not this is actually the ninth iPhone
now I know there's gonna be that one guy
or maybe it's a girl and I'm talking to
you that's gonna argue with me well we
got to go way back to the original
iPhone which was followed by the iPhone
3G to the 3GS
then the four then the 4s then the five
then the 5c which you probably forgot
about and then of course the 5s which
makes eight and then the iPhone 6 which
of course would make the ninth iPhone
which for me is a little crazy to think
about in the sense that we are now
approaching the ninth iteration of the
iPhone so the combination of how quickly
time has gone by along with how far
technology has advanced to me equals oh
now I'm sure by now for most of you who
have even remotely been following the
internet have probably seen the leaked
iphone 6 dummy mock-up which is flooded
YouTube was flooded the tech blogs and
it points us to a larger 4.7 inch next
generation iPhone so vampa not that
there are things we can more than likely
expect with the next iPhone but at the
same time I think we've gotten to this
points in technology where there's no
surprise anymore every single thing gets
leaked and we're all kind of like that
kid who peeked at its presents night
before and there's just no surprise
element for us anymore so because of
that I want to do a top 5 features wish
list and what that means is it could
include things that we will more than
likely see like I talked about and it
can also include things that we may
never see but the point of that is it's
something I want to see and it's my wish
list so feel free to let me know your
wish list as crazy or as realistic as
they may be and I'm gonna kick number 5
off with something that kind of got
discussed last year pre iPhone 5s with
all the touch ID sensors and that is LED
notifications in the touch ID
fingerprint reader aka the home button
now like I just mentioned this is all
speculation and rumors pre iPhone 5s a
kind of died down after it didn't happen
I personally forgot about it and
recently mr. Marquez mkbhd tweeted about
it and it kind of rekindled my geek love
for the idea of having that anybody
who's used anything outside of an iPhone
can agree with me that LED notifications
or a lack thereof on the iPhone aren't
very good at all so imagine if Apple was
able to implement not only
LED notification but also
color-coordinated ones as well if you
were to get a text or iMessage that
would blink green maybe an email will be
blue simple voicemail or phone call
could be white but that could vary off
the pulse pattern on the LED so to me
there could be a ton of opportunity and
potential with this but unfortunately I
think this is one of those features on
my wish list that more than likely won't
happen so jumping into number four I'm
gonna kind of sammich two things
together because they really go hand in
hand and that is solar charging and a
better battery
now obviously solar charging is not a
sure bet by any means but there have
been reports of apples upcoming sapphire
crystal technology that if it's built
into the screen in addition to resisting
the scratches it'll also have solar
charging capability built right into the
screen so what that would mean obviously
if you're in daylight's or even an
adequate amount of light where you can
get that absorbed into the screen at the
very least even if you're not getting a
full charge out of it maybe it's even
combating the battery discharge so that
way you're not losing battery life
throughout the day because for me and I
think most of you would agree in terms
of how far technology has advanced with
smartphones battery life just hasn't
caught up there yet so far to me the
biggest advancement in battery life in
terms of technology was back with the
2013 MacBook Air release those suckers
jumped like four or five hours with a
generation and we really haven't seen
something that drastic in terms of a
smart phone usually they maybe go an
hour or they stay the same but increase
the power so we really haven't seen
advancements in that regard so at the
end of the day will we see solar
charging capabilities built into the
next iPhone I think just like the LED
notifications it is possible but more
than likely not probable so I would not
bet on it it's a very least though I do
want to see a better battery life period
and thumbs up if you guys agree so
jumping in to number three and for me
that is NFC to finally come to the
iPhone I know this is gonna be a touchy
subject because it's been on Android for
so long and even other Windows devices
in no way shape or form is gonna be
innovative or revolutionary even though
Apple might call it that but the good
thing is when Apple does something it
becomes more widely adopted and then it
will then open the doors for everybody
else right now NFC payments really
aren't widely accepted and they are
possible but a lot of people really
don't use them or even feel comfortable
using them if Apple can implement this
make it secure make people feel more
comfortable using it and make it more
widely adopted I think everybody wins
and whether you love Apple or hate Apple
I think you can agree with that I've
read reports that the NFC chip will be
set
much like we saw on the m7 coprocessor
on the iPhone 5s so that actually worked
out really well and I hope it'll do the
same in terms of NFC technology for the
smartphone market as a whole so moving
up the list and throwing deuces that you
number two for me would be sapphire
crystal technology you might be thinking
wait we already talked about that now
it's actually in regards to the
possibilities of solar charging whereas
now I'm talking about the implementation
into the actual smartphone screen I
think most of you alongside was what we
talked about the batteries would also
agree that in terms of smartphone
advancements actual durability really
isn't quite cut up there either I don't
care if you're talking about the iPhone
the Galaxy s5 the HTC One m8 the Nexus 5
whatever you're talking about if you
drop your phone right it's gonna break
or even scratch sapphire crystal is the
second hardest material to scratch
literally right behind diamond so for us
as smartphone users that would obviously
be a tremendous benefit in terms of
durability and anti-scratch the problem
with this though however is the way app
will set themselves up with the sapphire
technology this is not something that's
gonna benefit the smartphone market as a
whole
they've been able to drive the prices
down which is good for them but they've
also at the same time kind of lock it
down to where they're gonna be the only
ones that have this technology I guess
in the sense that it might drive other
manufacturers to improve upon what they
have or even copy and make something
similar it might be good in that sense
but in the meantime I think there's some
that you're only gonna see on iPhone
devices at least for the immediate
future so coming in at number one and I
think there need not be a drivel for
this because the consensus agrees we all
want a bigger screen on the next iPhone
there has also been rumors and
speculation of a larger 5.5 inch model
but to this day we still have not seen
any concrete proof or evidence of that
for me anywhere between 4.7 and 5 inches
is the ideal smartphone screen size I
really enjoyed it with the original HTC
One I enjoy it now on the m8 i enjoyed
it on the galaxy s4 and of course I
enjoy it on the Galaxy s5
so don't get me wrong having something
along the lines of the Galaxy Note 3 in
terms of that screen size is awesome but
for me once you get into that territory
it makes you want to move towards a
tablet so for me I think a 5.5 inch
iPhone would be a little too big and
probably pushed me towards an iPad Mini
and I think the 4.7 inch iPhone will be
the ideal sweet spot for me screen sizes
aside though the interesting part to me
is what will the resolution on the next
generation iPhone be 9 to 5 Mac and I
use
them because they are probably the most
bang on in terms of Apple rumors it's
reporting that the next iPhone will
boast a resolution of 960 by 1704 and
actually my good buddy dumb over at Mac
mixing who also works for nine-to-five
Mac created a simulation of what iOS
would look like on a 4.7 inch display
now based off Apple's track record in
terms of scale Eon apps and things like
that this seems to make most sense I'll
be the first to admit I would love a
super-dense ridiculously high resolution
screen but I don't think that's gonna
happen and I think this is more likely
at the very least though a bigger screen
super-crazy resolution or not is welcome
to me because it just makes the
smartphone experience much more
enjoyable we live in a world where we
consume consume consume and consume on
our smartphones so whether it's Netflix
Instagram or you're playing games the
big your smartphone screen is to me the
more enjoyable it is for those who did
catch my HTC One and made impressions
video you guys saw that for me one of
the most enjoyable experiences on a
smartphone is to watch a basketball I'm
on the go a lot so I'm not always able
to be in front of a TV or catch it real
time so to be able to catch up and watch
on a bigger screen smartphone experience
that is super enjoyable for me so I'm
sure by the hat you guys can guess I am
a Bulls fan so definitely take it easy
on me they got eliminated by the
Washington Wizards I've been getting
crap non-stop from my friends hey John
yeah parity bills lost don't you mean
the Bulls yeah
that's what I said you can cry bet you
don't even watch basketball definitely
internet look I just make sure I'm not
gonna have another one of your hosts
Steve Jobs Apple fanboy as a moment's on
us again
after what you did last time I am still
having nightmares
but come on seriously was that not the
closest shave you ever had before even
if it was and it was that's still nasty
I don't know man you look like you're
rocking a little bit more than a 5
o'clock shadow there are you sure I
can't help clean you up stress my
brother I'm positive you're only a
couple bucks a month I have my own on
its way your loss
so I think we can agree buying razors
sucks you got to go to the store you got
to talk to people and then you dish out
