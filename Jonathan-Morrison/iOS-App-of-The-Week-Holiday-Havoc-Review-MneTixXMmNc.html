happy december today i'll be doing a
quick review of holiday havoc so let's
get into it so i thought seeing is this
december i should review a fun Christmas
related game for you guys this week and
well get it out of the way now if I'm
playing any Christmas game this year is
going to be holiday havoc I usually
don't play holiday themed games at all
but I couldn't pass up the Pixley
awesomeness of this one now though a
little repetitive the chiptunes music in
this game brings back memories of
awesome game boy color games like
Pokemon and the graphics and gameplay
give this game and arcade feel it's a
very simple game though you play a Santa
armed with a snowball gun which you are
using to fend off present thieves tap on
screen where you want to fire and reload
when necessary just make sure to avoid
the elves who are returning presents to
the pile and if you're knocked down
three elves all that one person gets
stolen it's game over now in all honesty
when I first started playing the game
didn't quite grab my attention but the
longer you stick in there the more
challenging and fun it gets as the
difficulty increases one thing I hope
the developers could add is a sound
effect for when the gun shoots snowballs
it's currently no sound when this
happens and I just think it would top
off the game all in all if you're
looking for a simple game that's great
for short bursts of entertainment this
is probably great for your commute to
work or school also I wouldn't limit
this game two children but I definitely
recommend it the kids especially if you
have any around you like to steal your
iPhone and play games on it for 99 cents
you might want to check this one out on
the App Store alright guys well I hope
you enjoyed this video as usual if you
feel like being awesome make sure to
give this video a thumbs up it really
helps the channel out also if you like
my style of reviews or maybe just my
awesome Australian accent then make sure
