perfect iMac pro Seto
so yep that is an iMac Pro on a desk
outside you're not crazy the reason
behind this is I thought it'd be fun to
take this outside shoe take a raw and
then use that to test on this iMac Pro
so with the set up I want something
clean something simple but most
importantly I want something to
compliment and match that beautiful
space great finish so the centerpiece of
this setup is without a doubt the iMac
Prout for those who love talking specs
get some wet-naps ready this is the 10
core three gigahertz model 128 gigabytes
of ram AMD Radeon Pro Vegas 64 graphics
with get ready for it 16 gigabytes of
HBM to memory last but not least this is
packed with two terabytes of flash
storage which should be insanely fast
now these go on sale this Thursday
alongside the 10 core there is the
baseline 8 core a surprise 14 core model
and it will max out at 18 freaking
course now for the desk one with the art
of Fox desk 0-2 this is their limited
run black edition it's very simple but
also extremely well thought-out and
complements the iMac pro perfectly now
this comes in both sit and stand
variations it what's awesome is it's
extremely modular so you go simple like
I've done here or you could deck it out
with a ton of different accessories to
complement your setup now a couple of
really smart things that come with this
desk out of the box is one give a little
cable drop towards the back so in my
case I throw a wireless charger here
drop that cable right through and it
keeps things nice and clean and for
those curious about the wireless charger
this is from chroma Wireless and I will
say on the Amazon page it looks like
it's Space Gray clearly it's not as much
as I would've loved Space Gray this is
still a really nice accent and the best
part about it is that it's under 15
bucks
now the second really smart thing with
this desk is towards the front you have
hooks on each side you can probably hang
a ton of different things but in this
case it works amazing for a pair of
headphones so that phones are the folk
al listen close back over your
headphones and these were perfect for
two reasons one aesthetically it is
complemented the entire setup really
well more importantly - they sound
amazing though Kel makes some crazy
high-end gear but these are under 200
bucks and honestly they're probably one
of the best headphones you can get under
that price point and for the keyboard
the mouse and in this case the trackpad
I didn't have to look elsewhere because
they all came with
I Mac Pro the Black Keys with the
spacecraft finish on the keyboard look
beautiful across the desk honestly I'm
not the biggest fan of the Magic Mouse
but in that finish it was hard not to
include with this setup lasted that
space great Magic Trackpad - no
complaints there works flow and has the
looks to match now as far as the
speakers go I don't think I could have
planned this out - any better they
weren't tweaked modified or customized
the can't oye to power desktop speakers
come in this matte gray finish that is
nearly a perfect match for the space
grey iMac Pro they're small but they
pack a surprising amount of punch and
what's cool is you can take them
directly via a USB to the iMac Pro so
the size pair with the finish and more
importantly how it fits on this desk all
work perfectly now jump to the back of
the Mac Pro this thing is pretty decked
out you'll be 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and SDXC card slot with UHS to
support for USB 3 ports and then for
Thunderbolt 3 ports in the USBC flavor
which is double what you get on the non
pro iMac last up is the Ethernet port
but the big thing here is that it's 10
gigabit which is a pretty big deal now
as far as performance goes over the next
week I will be putting this thing
through its paces but to get the
obligatory Geekbench score out of the
way on the single course ID we're
looking at five thousand four hundred
fifty but more impressively on the
multi-core size that is thirty seven
thousand four hundred and thirty-four so
on the outside it looks like an imac
throat with a spacecraft finish but on
the inside it is clearly a different
story from there if you're looking for
some more insight on the mi pro my good
buddy marques a.k.a mkbhd also spent
some time with one you can check out his
impressions here or link down below if
you have me at definitely make sure you
subscribe for more imac pro coverage
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later the design the stand the
display the bezels it's all the same but
what makes this iMac Pro an iMac pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
