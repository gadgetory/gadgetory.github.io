brand new just released 2019 13 inch
MacBook Pro specifically this is the
lower tier entry-level 13-inch MacBook
Pro which now features touch bar and
prior to this you dish out a minimum of
eighteen hundred dollars to get touch
bar on a macbook whereas this comes at
$12.99 and that's huge it's also packin
a t2 chip which is super underrated a
quad core processor and more importantly
the MacBook lineup finally makes sense
after they sadly caught up to 12-inch
MacBook and put the non-retina MacBook
Airs out of their misery so when Apple
finally updated the MacBook Air last
year I thought it made the baseline
13-inch MacBook Pro look a little silly
on paper the MacBook Pro looked faster
and everyone gave the MacBook Air so
much crap for the lower clock CPU it was
low voltage in a reality performance
between those two was nearly identical
yes the MacBook Air had a lower clock
CPU yes it was lower voltage but in
reality that was a newer 8th gen chip
versus the seventh gen processor in that
MacBook Pro that hadn't been updated
since 2017 on top of that because of the
low voltage CPU and it's baby charger
that equated to much better battery life
which i think is way more important for
most people looking at a laptop at that
price point and the inclusion of t2 was
bigger than most people give it credit
for so t2 awesome touch bar can be cool
it's not a game changer but what I was
most interested with this MacBook Pro
was the processor specifically this is a
quad core chip with a really interesting
1.4 gigahertz base clock yes Taron I
know you're water-cooled rig is super
fast but slam the brakes on those sweet
cherry MX is this CPU I promise you
might surprise you and that measly 1.4
gigahertz base clock turbos up to 3.9
gigahertz so I've said it before I'm not
the biggest fan of synthetic benchmarks
so you just like to dive in and see how
it performs in real world tests but at
the very least I like to start in
Geekbench 4 because it'll
give you an idea of what you could
expect and in this case clearly that
multi-core performance wipes the floor
with the previous Jan 13 inch MacBook
Pro but what was surprising is even with
that measly 1.4 gigahertz base clock it
outperforms it in single core as well
it's also worth noting as of now this
processor technically doesn't exists or
it didn't until this video it's not an
Intel site but it's the i5 82 57 you
which is a quad-core chip it does have
hyper threading which surprised me
because I figured at a price point of
$12.99 Apple was gonna cap it off or at
least limit performance in some way
additionally for one more point of
reference we also compared this MacBook
Pro against a 2016 i7 15-inch MacBook
Pro and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro
outperformed it now jumping into
real-world performance naturally got to
open up Final Cut Pro 10 and what I did
was take one of my older projects
it was a comparison of two of the newest
21.5 inch IMAX and one of those honestly
is hands-down the best value for a Mac
you can grab right now so definitely
check that video out but in a nutshell
the project's over seven minutes long
it's ProRes HQ in 4k the whole nine
yards in this tiny brand new 13-inch
MacBook Pro with that measly 1.4
gigahertz chip dished out that h.264
file in three minutes in 16 seconds that
is bananas and for reference when you
smack that side-by-side against the
previous generation 13-inch MacBook Pro
that dished out that file in four
minutes and 40 seconds which is still
impressive but the performance jump on
this MacBook Pro the new one especially
when you factor on everything else
you're getting is super impressive from
there moving on to dumb ideas I talk a
lot of talk about that t2 chip it slept
on and now I'm gonna put it through its
paces and transcode all of the footage
that you should have watched by now on
this macbook pro in do HEV c and then
edit that in Final Cut Pro 10 so part 2
of dumb dot JPEG what's going on here is
I have all that footage again that you
hopefully should have watched C fast on
going to
not only in jest but transcode without
HEV acceleration into this MacBook Pro
directly through compressor so let's see
if this works this is also gonna be a
good little tutorial in sight for those
that maybe want to transcode into a GBC
to edit if you have a t2 equipped
macbook shoutout to ck ID Terry Warfield
CJ knows Tech you guys pay attention so
I'm going to add the file I'm looking
for that C fast card and I believe this
was around 200 gigs give or take I
created a custom high bitrate HEV C file
so hopefully it's a very least it should
one cut my footage size in half but
we'll see
got all that footage selected I'm going
to add that here I'm going to select
that custom HEV C profile I'm going to
set the destination
I'm gonna go documents into this MacBook
Pro folder I'll go ahead and call this
footage create that and compressors
going to do its thing
it's gonna generate each one of those
files on the C fast card and in a second
I can kind of batch transcode everything
directly off the C fast card so I'm not
duplicating the media I'm not
transferring this first I'm doing it
directly off the car so looks like we're
good I'm going to hit start and see if
this was a terrible idea initially so
far that looks like it's flying through
this transcode and again that is thanks
to the t2 chip now the real meat
potatoes test is going to be this last
clip right here that is 44 minutes long
in theory that should decimate this
machine so while this is flying through
that I'm gonna throw up activity monitor
and just check out those cores and
showcase that the t2 chip should be
doing that heavy lifting so that is
graphics that's not going to be doing
nothing right now
and then all this course let's see if
they're going to work or they're just
kind of hanging back so here it looks
like they're actually putting in some
work they're not maxed out they're not
completely taxed but they're working in
tandem with that t2 chip and it is
crushing this HEV C and code
it is worth noting that the HEV C
acceleration is limited to 8 bit not 10
bit but it is still impressive
nonetheless so kind of checking in here
this first clip here that took 20
seconds to transcode from ProRes to HEV
see that's a 31 second clip so it is
doing this in faster than real time on
what should be a slow machine kind of
midpoint checking in here it's also
worth noting this MacBook Pro does also
feature the fourth-generation butterfly
keyboard if it's going to fix the
problems it's still a little too early
to tell off to wait and see but it's
nice that Apple didn't leave this one in
the dark so we're on the final boss
level this super long 40 minute talking
head clip this is the ultimate test and
if you did this on a machine without a
t2 chip it would be pretty ugly so tons
of credit here again not only is it
doing a touch bar touch ID hey Siri
you're getting secure Enclave which is
huge and if you use a Mac without that
you actually have to verify Apple pay on
a phone whereas with this it's all done
on that t2 chip so we're done and that
entire transcode for all 200 gigs of
footage took a total of 33 minutes and
again mind you that final clip which was
over 40 minutes
4k ProRes that was done essentially two
times as fast as real time which is
crazy now what I'm really curious is to
see the file size of all that footage
that we just transcoded 200 gigabytes
and we're going to squash that down into
43 gigabytes so for contrast on exactly
how impressive that is running the exact
same task on the previous 2017 baseline
13 inch macbook pro that took an hour
and 27 minutes so it shaved off nearly
an entire hour from there this is maybe
a little unorthodox but I wanted to take
that a TVC footage and see how it
performed in Final Cut Pro 10 now I had
a theory with this that if it would
transcoded to a TVC directly from the C
fast card and then edit that was in
Final Cut that it would help take some
of the load off of the CPU off the
integrated graphics and if we play this
timeline which is actually full quality
its unrendered that's got a color grade
on it I can even go
full screen if I want that is handling
it like a champ and if we go back to
Activity Monitor what's interesting is
the CPU usage is right around 77 percent
67 percent if you look at those cores
there's not a lot going on so be
interesting to see is most of that work
being done with the integrated graphics
or is that t2 chip helping not only
acceleration for transcoding but editing
HEV C as well so this could be a pretty
interesting workflow speaking of that
workflow and again this isn't
necessarily an orthodox way of doing
things going from pro res to HEV C and
then going back to h.264 but the entire
project excluding this voiceover was
just under 10 minutes long and the
export was 6 minutes and 45 seconds so
faster than real time and that showcases
again don't necessarily judge specs just
by looking at them on paper this is a
pretty impressive little machine so that
is the surprisingly impressive
entry-level 2019 13-inch MacBook Pro
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
make sure you guys drop a like down
below and definitely subscribe turn on
applications is not only for more
coverage on this comparisons but to see
what I'm gonna do with this giant PC
behind me see on the flip side PC boys
