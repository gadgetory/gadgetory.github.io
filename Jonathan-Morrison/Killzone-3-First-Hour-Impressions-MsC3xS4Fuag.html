lunch and dinner with our first our
impressions of Killzone 3 for the ps3
first off it must be said the game's
visuals are absolutely astounding give
them the game a great gritty cinematic
feel the single-player campaign so far
while being fairly standard for an FPS
setting sets up the storyline
interesting in a fashion nelsa does a
great job of introducing new players to
the game in terms of not only controls
but also helping catch you up to speed
on the main story as well the game
relies on a first-person cover mode of
play that can be a little awkward at
first but allows for players to use
cover effectively while still having the
accuracy afforded by first-person view
point online modes feature the standard
team deathmatch as well as a mission
mode and war zone mode which has teams
compete over a series of varying
objectives such as projecting or
assassinating particular player as well
as controlling zones or just trying to
get a larger kill count in a set amount
of time players are able to use five
different classes online which can grow
with more matches allowing them to
unlock new weapons and abilities for
each class now this is only what I've
experienced after one hour of gameplay
and once I've sent a lot more time into
it I'll let you guys know more about the
campaign mode and any other features I
discover online as well as how fun the
game ends up being overall till then I'm
coming for tldtoday thanks
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
