TLD with an unboxing of the Galaxy Nexus
this is the LTE verizon version and you
can see they went for quite the
minimalistic look on the box at first
glance it looks completely white but if
you look really closely up towards the
top you can see the verizon logo and
down near the bottom you can see Galaxy
Nexus on the back side it lists a
package contents but I will take you
guys through that so we got a little
sleeve that slides off then upon opening
the box there is the galaxy nexus with a
little verizon read behind it on the
back side of the phone we can see the
Verizon 4G LTE branded logo and below
that is the Samsung logo beyond that we
get a slew of literature which covers
everything from your warranty to your
user's manual we then have a samsung
branded USB wall charger in addition to
that so we have the micro USB to USB
cable and last but not least we get
these Samsung headphones included in the
box on the front side we have a 1.3
megapixel front shooter and on the back
side it is 5 megapixels with 1080p video
recording for a quick tour the hardware
on the left side we have the volume
rockers up and down on the right side we
have the power button and on the bottom
we have a microUSB port as well as the
headphone jack and that's pretty much it
this is running Android 4.0
alternatively known as ice cream
sandwich and there is no custom skin on
it is is pure Android 4.0 you guys can
see towards the bottom we have phone we
have people which is your contacts we
have the application launcher we have
messaging and we have the internet
browser below that there are no physical
buttons completely touch base we have
back home and this will bring up task so
you guys can swipe in and out of
applications and the last thing we're
going to look at is the insanely awesome
