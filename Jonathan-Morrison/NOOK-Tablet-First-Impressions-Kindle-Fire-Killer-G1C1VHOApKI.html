guys John here was TLD and that is what
the upcoming Nook Tablet said to the
Amazon Kindle Fire and I gotta say on
paper the just-announced nook tablet
looks pretty slick 249 bucks comes at an
8-inch form factor with a 7 inch IPS
display is sporting a resolution of 1024
x 600 so it is a pixel packing son of
a-- it also features a dual core 1
gigahertz processor 1 gig of ram which
actually is double that of the ipad 2
and the kindle fire which both feature
512 megs first or just going to have 16
gigabytes of internal storage you can
also attack on 32 more gigabytes via
microSD card slot so with a simple math
calculation we can see carry the two and
there is a maximum forty eight gigabytes
of total combined storage on the tablet
now they're gearing this as an
all-around multimedia device so you can
do email web browsing obviously read
books because it's from barnes &amp;amp; noble
it's gonna come pre-loaded with Netflix
Hulu Plus Pandora just to name a few and
it will also be gaming capable with
games like Angry Birds for example so i
won't just yet call it the kindle fire
killer there's a lot of good things on
paper but there's also a lot of things
I'm looking forward to with the kindle
fire such as the cloud based storage and
the accelerator web experience with
their so based browser so let me know
what you guys think with a comment down
below if you pre-order the Kindle Fire
will you be canceling that in favor of
this or you're gonna stick with that or
are you an iPad person aside from that
I'm going to hit that like button I'll
give you a high five if you are new feel
free to subscribe BAM and lastly make
sure to check out my unboxed and the
motorola moto active later
