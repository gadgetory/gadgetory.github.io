sucks cyber monday is here though things
are looking up and I'm kicking today's
deal list off with potentially the
greatest cyber monday deal of all time
in human existence barrel monkeys for
$3.82 and that my friends for that price
you cannot build yourself a custom
water-cooled gaming PC from there if
you're looking to pick up a Galaxy S 9
but have been holding off for that deal
that deal of the year this one caught my
eye you get a Galaxy S 9 unlock but it's
not stopping there you get that plus an
echo spot for five hundred and nineteen
dollars they are basically giving these
things away
PSA though these deals these prices they
will change they will sell up faster
than these fingers can eliminate
existence and what's also cool is this
Infinity Gauntlet is also on sale for
Cyber Monday link below link below not
up there down here I don't feel so good
so next for those that caught the Mac
Mini set up again one of the best things
about two Mac Mini is the fact that you
can build it out any way you want and at
your pace so maybe you're not about that
thick life maybe you want something a
little more low-key a little more
reserved there's an ace or twenty three
point eight inch monitor on sale for $99
right now and maybe that's not your size
that's not your flavor there's a ton
more on sale link below next from there
coming in a potentially the
second-greatest Cyber Monday deal of all
time second only to barrel of monkeys
Jenga for $9 that's a cheap way to get
your kid off a tablet and Jenga is fun
edge next from there if you're looking
to step into the smart home game the
echo dot is currently on sale for $19.99
that is cheap as hell for that price you
could grab 10 you can grab two for your
brother for your sister for your friends
for your family two people who you
mildly like it'll make a great gift from
there you guys know I love philips hue
it's what creates that beautiful splash
of color behind me and today as the
hodgetwins would say there are all kinds
of philips hue and amazon echo deals
just sandwich together in different
configurations so I will drop a link to
everything in the description
that said I realized Philips you can be
a little on the pricier side so if you
don't want to dive into that ecosystem
just yet there's a singlet multicolor
smart LED kit with two bulbs for 49
bucks try and beat that next from there
speaking of smart home items if you're
looking to upgrade your Wi-Fi system
this is the or V it's actually what we
use here in the office but we paid $2.99
for ours like suckers and you don't have
to be a sucker it's currently on sale
for $1.99 next from there if you like
your USB sticks looking badass my friend
I got the one for you this is a 64
gigabyte Kingston Elite g2 on sale for
9+10 I know it's crazy a smartphone
prices go higher and higher and higher
it seems like 4k TVs go lower and lower
and lower as JD tech TV said it's
essentially the normal now and there's
never been a better time to buy one not
only can you grab a 43 inch 4k TV for
249 dollars there is also Amazon fire TV
built into this guy granted it is
Toshiba which isn't the best brand in
the world but again it's a 43 inch 4k TV
with pretty solid reviews for under 300
bucks TV people it is now your time to
shine if you have a nice TV maybe you
want to upgrade your sound package well
this is my package there's this pretty
sweet Polk Audio sound bar with a sub
and the icing on the top the cherry on
the cake is that there is built-in
Amazon Alexa compatibility so we just
got like text sandwiches just piling in
our faces right now Ram boy laptop boys
you guys looking for a deal potentially
end or an upgrade there is an 8 gigabyte
kit from crucial on sale for 48 bucks
and in time war it was looking a little
dark for PC upgrades where those prices
were just skyrocketing this is actually
a breath of fresh air in terms of PC
deals next from there if you were pissed
off at the 2018 MacBook Air release and
that really wasn't your jam the 12-inch
MacBook actually isn't a terrible idea
and currently it is $200 off at Best Buy
so you can scoop up this little dude for
1099 camera people if you've been
looking to grab something to get into
the game without dropping a ton of cash
I got the deal for you v canon
six is on sale for 399 but you get two
lenses so that's essentially everything
you need to get started out of the gate
making some crispy content alpha watch
people if you be looking a grab one but
don't want to spend all that Apple cash
you can pick one up for under 300 bucks
right now it is Series three but I think
that's a fantastic deal if you're just
looking to grab an Apple watch for the
first time ever and I realized this is
an older model from 2015 but B&amp;amp;H has a
pretty solid deal on a 15-inch MacBook
Pro for $15.99 and I realize you're
technically supposed to pay tax and I'm
not telling you how to live your lives
but I'm just saying there's a good
chance that if you check out you're
probably not gonna pay more than $15.99
newsflash got that fresh tech TV Gloria
Borger update there is a canon 60-32
item pack with seven lenses on sale for
twenty four hundred dollars cyber monday
is shaming black friday you get an ND
filter you get an SD card you get it
lens you could just buy the pack and
give away lenses to your friends or you
could use them your choice
speaking of crazy package deals B&amp;amp;H has
the Mavic fly more combo for 280 George
Washington's off crazy that's quite a
bit of deal as hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure you
guys smash that like button if you
missed it I recently dropped this
beautiful Mac Mini set up with that
ultra wide thick boy this Jonathan and
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
