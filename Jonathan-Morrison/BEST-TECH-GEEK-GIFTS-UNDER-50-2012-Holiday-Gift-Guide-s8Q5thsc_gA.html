with the best tech gifts under 50 bucks
you guys really enjoyed the under $25
series so we're back in action taking a
look at that $50 price point let's go
first up on the list we got these cyber
acoustic CA 3602 2.1 speaker set these
come in at 35 bucks you get two speakers
a sub and a volume control that you can
control from your desk if you check out
the reviews I'm not really sure there's
a better set of speakers you can get for
the money following that we got the
Logitech Bluetooth tablet keyboard and
this is not going to just be limited to
tablets so if you want to use it with a
smartphone iPhone Android it is not
limited to a particular brand anything
with Bluetooth it's gonna work in under
40 bucks it's gonna make a fantastic
gift next up this is for the Android
peeps in mind we got the Andrew Android
USB wall charger at first look it just
looks like Andy the Android dude take
them apart and bam you got a USB wall
charger this is coming at 25 bucks and
we'll be linked with everything else
down below the next item on the list we
got the new Trent I dual NT 5200 5200
milliamp hour external battery now I
personally own this and can
wholeheartedly recommend it it is not
limited to one device so it's gonna work
on smartphones tablets I've personally
actually recharged twice from my phone
on one single charge and the best part
is it comes in under 35 bucks and this
is definitely one of my personal
favorites jump it back to Apple for the
next item we're taking a look at the
iPod shuffle the newest model brings a
few new colors to the table and actually
as of making this video a few of them
are actually discounted down to 39 bucks
they usually sell for about 50 so if you
guys are watching this video and you
check out the pricing and they are 39
bucks that is a fantastic price make
sure you jump on that now the next item
up I didn't really think I could find a
good set of over ear headphones for
under 50 bucks but these have insanely
awesome reviews they're pretty much 5
stars across the board the JVC h8r X 700
over ear headphones come in at 35 bucks
not going to be the flashiest or the
best looking but for the price they're
probably the best set of over headphones
you can pick up following that we're
taking a look at one more set of
headphones this time we're taking a look
at the King Nebo bth 220 bluetooth
headphones so there's stereo you can
either use them for music or for
hands-free calling and for 30 bucks with
the reviews they are getting they're
gonna make a fantastic gift option for
pretty much
anybody with a piece of technology the
next item up is the Belkin conserve
power strip with remote again this is
one of my personal favorites it's not
gonna be a flashy gift but it's neat and
the fact that you have a wireless remote
that you can stick on your wall and
actually shut everything down at once
instead of manually having to shut
everything off at your desk moving down
the list the next item up is the Apple
earpods and I usually would never ever
ever recommend a set of headphones from
Apple but the ear pods actually sound
pretty damn good for the price of 29
with a microphone and volume controls
and if someone has like the iPhone 4 the
4s the older iPods this would make a
great gift to go along with their
current piece of Apple gear coming in at
third-to-last if you are looking for a
gift for someone with an iPhone 5 this
is probably the best thing you could get
them the SGP glass TR is hands-down the
best iphone screen shield you can get on
the market not only is it gonna protect
against drops and scratches but it is as
close to fingerprint proof as you could
possibly get now coming in at
second-to-last I know this could have
fits under the under $25 video but I
actually missed that when I was making
that video and this was too awesome not
to include in this video and I can't
think of any Android fan that wouldn't
like this it's the Android eats Apple
shirt and it comes in at 15 bucks now
closing out the list we have the Samson
go mic USB microphone this comes in at
40 bucks you can use it to improve your
audio for Skype calls or maybe you're
just a youtuber and you want to get into
something cheap that's not gonna break
the bank but still give you solid audio
quality again every single item featured
in this video will be linked down below
if you guys did miss my under $25 video
that is linked right here go ahead and
click that to check that out and I will
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
