tech debuting in 2019
and this past weekend
I got a chance to check out something
really exciting.
Specifically Oppo's 10x
Lossless Zoom camera tech.
Which kind of blew my fricking mind.
(upbeat music)
Yo guys, Jonathan here.
This past week I got to
hang out in Barcelona Spain.
Huge shout out to Oppo for sponsoring
my trip out there.
Got to attend the key note
where they showcased 5G, their
10x Lossless zoom camera tech.
Which gave us a really good idea of
what to expect in their next Flagship
which they said should
appear sometime in Q2.
Speaking of flagships,
Oppo teased everyone
essentially that was at the event
with a prototype of their next 5G Flagship
that was pretty much embedded into
a table Ala King Arthur.
And honestly I think the only person
that may have been potentially
able to rip that out of there
was Cristiano, Qualcomm President,
because that dude is jacked.
(explosion)
So if you're looking forward to that
next Oppo Flagship you probably want to
keep your eyes peeled on Qualcomm.
They're working really closely together.
They're a huge part of that 5G movement
and as cool as that is, what really
caught my eye was their 10x Lossless Zoom,
which is crazy.
So with the camera tech
that Oppo showed off
you have a triple camera set up.
The main lens is a
ridiculous 48 Mega Pixels.
You then of course have your 120 degree
wide angle lens, equivalent
to 60 millimeters.
Then you have the big mamajama.
The Telephoto lens,
which with optical zoom
gets you all the way
up to 160 millimeters,
which is bananas.
(upbeat music)
There is a ton of really
crazy tech packed inside.
They essentially have this little mini
para scope just jam packed inside there.
The way it plays with light, there's
optical instillation, the software
talks with the hardware.
And as impressive all that is
none of it matters unless it works,
and the crazy thing is it does.
So Oppo had these giant miniature sets
that looked like something straight
out of Thomas and Friends.
Shout out to Thomas the Train,
bringing me back to my childhood.
But the idea was you could take the phone
take a photo, see how wide it was,
and get really freaking
close to take these
mind blowing telephoto shots.
And I got to tell you
it did not disappoint.
(upbeat music)
So in this shot here I got
JD standing across a table in this wide
angle should give you an idea
of how big the room is and also
how far JD is away from me.
So hoping over to the actual photos
taken, here is that telephoto shot
of JD which is no doubt impressive.
It's clean, it's crisp, but you really
don't appreciate how ridiculous this is
until you go back to the wide.
What the actual heck?
Trying this again with Oppo showroom
I'm zooming in to their logo
at 10x it maintains the clarity
and again you don't really appreciate
this until you go back to the ultra wide.
(dance music)
Now this last shot where things
started to die down a bit
we really got a chance
to test out this camera
and shout out to JD for modeling
through this chaos.
He is about, really freaking far away
from me, science.
And with that telephoto shot it is
essentially a waist up
portrait, which doesn't
really make sense because again,
when you go back to that wide angle shot
JD essentially turns into an ant.
(upbeat music)
So if that doesn't blow your mind
I have no idea what else will.
All I can say at this point is that
I hope Oppo delivers and brings this
into the next Flagship, because it is
seriously exciting.
It you guys wanna learn more
on this or 5G, make sure you guys
check out the link below.
Thank you guys very much for watching.
This Is Johnathan, and I will catch
you guys later.
I like feel myself getting cold. (laughs)
- (Camera man) are you shivering?
- I don't know man.
It's like outbreak.
I get life nothing happens to Mill house.
So very very cold.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
