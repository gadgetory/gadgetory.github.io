unboxing and honestly just a heads up so
nobody buys these headphones is the
Entune by monster collaboration with
Nick Cannon I guess they're his
signature headphones that should have
been red flag number one red flag number
two if you look closely towards the
bottom left-hand corner it says high
performance in-ear headphones I don't
know about you guys but no way in hell
are these fitting inside my ears things
are clearly on your headphones so
hopefully that's a typo if not
somebody's talk to these guys so
obviously we can see what the headphones
look like personally I think they are
but ass ugly they look even worse in
person but that's just me as we flip it
over they give you the complete rundown
of the marketing spiel and how amazing
actually I'm sorry how incredible these
headphones sound but I will get into
that a little later in this video so
it's going to slide everything out and
as a forewarning no exaggeration
honestly these are one of the worst and
I mean worst sounding set of headphones
I have ever listened to first thing we
can see is the incredible sticker that's
kind of the catchphrase or slogan behind
these headphones the only thing these
are incredible is incredibly V sorry -
Canon so we're gonna lift the plastic
off and like I said personally honestly
I think these are one of the most
repulsive looking set of headphones I've
ever seen I can understand kind of the
aesthetic or fashion appeal that beats
bring I'm not saying they sound good but
at least like the beats mixr's they look
decent these on the other hand they look
kind of like a ripoff of these solo HDS
except weight cheese here this kind of
reminds me almost like a toy car rim
just really really flimsy you guys can
hear that it almost feels like if I
sneeze the wrong way I'm gonna break
these so I don't think these would last
too long as far as a stress test or
everyday use so aside from that getting
back to the sound quality or actually
lack thereof I knew they were gonna
sound good but I had no idea they're
gonna sound this bad these retail for
about 150 US dollars so there are so so
many other headphones that blow this out
of the water probably at half the price
if you want bass check out the sony MDR
XP 500 extra bass headphones there's a
sennheiser HD 428 if you want equivalent
price i just reviewed the audio technica
ath em 50 over headphones and those
absolutely obliterate it so I do not
recommend these at all if you guys for
some reason want to see what else comes
in the box just because I did say this
was an unboxing Odin bring everything
else literature cleaning cloth
and the audio connector cable if I can
get it out of the box so like I said
this is more of just of a heads-up
warning just in case any of you guys
were considering buying these do not
check out the other headphones I posted
in the link in the description
those will absolutely dominate in every
single way shape and form over these
incredibly not good headphones so thank
you guys for watching if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to leave it
a thumbs up as it does help the channel
out it is much appreciated aside from
that if you have not subscribed feel
free to do so and I will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
