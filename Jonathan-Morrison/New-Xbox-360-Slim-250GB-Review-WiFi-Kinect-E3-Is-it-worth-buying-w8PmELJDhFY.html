to you about the new Xbox design the
360s what's different what's better and
whether or not it's worth your money to
make the upgrade or not so the new Xbox
360 is going to set you back 300 dollars
it comes equipped with a 250 gigabyte
hard drive built-in Wi-Fi spit if and 5
USB ports 2 of which are located in the
front and the other three are found on
the back it also runs a lot quieter than
past 360s the new design is made to be
more compatible with Microsoft's
upcoming accessory the Kinect which is
due out this November making it easier
for players to get in some good game
time flailing their arms around like
their Darwinian ancestors taking a look
at the front side we see the disc tray
power button and a hatch where a pair of
USB ports are hidden underneath on the
back there's AV component HDMI out
auxilary input for the Kinect Ethernet
and three USB ports power source and
spit if optical audio connector and for
those of you who aren't fans of tech
specs just like how damn shiny this
thing is I mean come on who doesn't love
a shiny object that can put pretty
pretty lights on a screen for our
entertainment and as opposed to the old
bulky harddrive designs from previous
versions the 360 s comes with a sleeker
hard drive that can easily be removed
from a hidden slot located at the top of
the console and as you can see here even
the internal components provide the
shiniest for your consumer pleasure no
key features that people are gonna care
about the tuner 50 gigabyte hard drive
built-in Wi-Fi connect readiness and the
fact that it's gonna be a quieter system
that will supposedly not revving with
the current console now if it's worth
your money or not that depends on the
buyer if you don't have a 360 yet and
you're thinking about it especially with
Kinect coming up in November then it's
worth your money if you don't already
have an Xbox you're thinking about
grading then your needs may vary now
something to take note of is that if you
live nearby Game Stop the doing a deal
into the middle of July where you can
trade in your current Xbox and
accessories for at least under dollars
so that mallcop about a third of the
cost so if you really want a shiny new
xbox then it's worth the money otherwise
if you're happy with your old console
there really is no major reason to
upgrade the Kinect will work with the
old Xbox you're just gonna need an extra
cable to use it so all the new 360
is nifty but not necessity we hope you
found this review of the new Xbox 360 to
be helpful i'm coming from TLD today
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
