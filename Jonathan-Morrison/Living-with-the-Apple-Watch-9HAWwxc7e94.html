is what it's like living with the Apple
watch now let me start by saying as
smart watches as a whole right now
aren't a game-changer this holds true
for Apple Android and even something
like the pebble they're extensions of
our phones and without a doubt add
convenience but are they necessity or
life altering not yet visually speaking
I'm not quite sold on the Apple watch
regardless of how Apple typically brings
that one factor or aesthetic appeal with
the Apple watch it's not quite there if
we're talking solely looks
I much prefer something like the Moto
360 unlike the Moto 360 though which
features a circular display the Apple
watch sports a rounded rectangular
display and I understand why
functionally Apple went that route but
it kind of just looks like they stuck an
old iPod Nano on a strap slap a new
interface on it and call it a day build
quality though and looks aside it's
really well made it has a tremendous
attention to detail and the screen is
beautiful I picked up a 42 millimeter
sport on day one within about an hour of
mess around with the settings and menus
I was already a little bored with to
watch faces I thought for sure I'd roll
with Mickey but that ended up feeling a
little unpractical modular is definitely
the most tweakable out of the bunch but
I ended up enjoying and using solar the
most still though even though we can
tweak these to a degree I would love for
the ability to do something as simple as
changing out the wallpapers like we can
on our phones
another uncharacteristic thing about the
Apple watch is it's a lack of
intuitiveness out of the box that's a
big thanks in part to the digital crown
the main point of control and Apple
knows this or they wouldn't have 354
how-to guides and a novel of a user's
manual just to learn how to use the
Apple watch we've grown accustomed to
touch swiping pinching zooming it's
almost second nature to us and if you
had a tablet or a phone to a kid within
minutes they got that figured out both
the Apple watch it's a little bit
different I'm not saying the digital
crown is a bad thing but I'm not
convinced that it's what a SmartWatch
needs to excel it is however a big fat
reminder that navigation on such a small
screen is not natural it's a little
cumbersome and that Apple is banking on
us to adjust to them and train ourselves
to make it natural
now while the digital crown may be
something Apple implemented from a
traditional watch battery life on the
other hand isn't not to say that battery
life hasn't been as advertised because
it has and then some but for the most
part it's something that we need to
charge every day and it's one more thing
to think about or conversely forget
about
so now not only is it damnit I forgot to
charge my phone but it's also damnit I
forgot to charge my watch on the
positive side though charging works
really well with the magnetic charger
and it only takes around an hour for a
full charge if you forgot to do so so
this for I think it's pretty safe to say
I've been pretty critical of the Apple
watch but I think it's due to a couple
different things one I'm not really a
watch guy so just wearing one whether
that's the Apple watch a traditional
watch or something like Android wear it
feels uncomfortable for me and to a lot
of the added convenience and
functionality that the Apple watch
brings to the game I've already
experienced with Android wear but that's
where I want to stop you you got to
remember some people are in the Android
ecosystem and some people are in the
Apple ecosystem some might use it
because it's easier to iMessage their
kids so this is their SmartWatch option
right now does it make them a bad person
or an idiot so don't go watch it and say
the Moto 360 is automatically better
because it's Android you got to remember
for each person each scenario is
different so with that as I point out
positive things and things I liked about
the Apple watch just take that in stride
and for what it is just because the Moto
360 may do that that's fine and go enjoy
your Moto 360 or whatever other device
you're using but this might relate to
somebody and that's what I want to bring
across by far the most enjoyable feature
on the Apple watch for me has been Apple
pay it works fantastic on the iPhone in
this case since I don't need to pull
anything out of my pocket to pay just
place the watch near the reader and bam
it's done it's a prime example of
convenience added not something you
can't live without but definitely useful
the second most enjoyable aspect of the
watch is definitely the fitness portion
and in terms of smartwatches Apple
excels in this department the heart rate
monitor is solid the step tracker is
accurate and really for me having a nice
clear easy-to-read stopwatch helps me
when working out if your weight training
there's a certain time window that you
want to keep it in between sets and
visually having something attached to me
keeps me on track so a I don't let too
much time pass in between sets and be
keep the workout timely and efficient
now again is this revolutionary note but
it's an example of how I found it useful
and how it might benefit you whether
you're getting into weights or just
doing something as simple as walking or
running on the daily for those curious
about them kicks these and the ones you
saw at the beginning of the video are
from great
a brooklyn-born company that blends
high-end materials and dope designs into
shoes at start under 50 bucks and the
first 100 TLD viewers can snag 10 bucks
off by checking out the details and a
link down below so for the most part
that summarizes how I feel about the
Apple watch and honestly I'm not sure in
a month's time if I'll still be using it
so if you guys are looking forward to
maybe a 1 month later or 2 months update
definitely let me know I'm not going to
get into things like digital heartbeats
or sketches because really but on that
same note I think those who did pick up
an Apple watch on day one probably
didn't need to watch this video to
convince them on the other hand though
if you're asking me what I recommend it
and I honestly couldn't because I'm not
going to go run to my mom my brother my
friends or family and say you need to
buy the Apple watch yes it's going to
add convenience but it's not going to
change your life
