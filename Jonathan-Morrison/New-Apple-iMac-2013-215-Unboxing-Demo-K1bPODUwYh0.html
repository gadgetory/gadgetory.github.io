Squarespace the quickest and easiest way
to create your own professional website
or online portfolio for a free trial and
20% off go to squarespace.com and use
the offer code TLD 9 hey guys johnathan
here with TLD with an unboxing of the
just released 2013 imac this is the 21
and a half inch model so it was going on
unbox it set it up and get you guys a
closer look
so we'll begin by slice and open the box
and dating back to last year's 2012 iMac
redesigned they also updated the box for
the better as well so now you just
simply push it open no more flipping it
upside down throw in the shake and bake
at it it is much easier to open up
jumping over to the accessories first up
is the Apple wireless keyboard which
connects via bluetooth do note though
that you have the option to opt for a
wired keyboard with a number-pad we
happen to configure your order online
following that we have the Apple Magic
Mouse which also connects through
bluetooth this features multi-touch
gesture capability and in terms of a
stock mouse that comes with the computer
it is definitely a nice touch we'll
follow up by getting rid of some
styrofoam proceeding to take the iMac
out of the box and set in this guy up
so again this is a 21.5 inch LED backlit
IPS display featuring a resolution of
1920 by 1080 P and if you've never seen
an imac display in person they are
absolutely beautiful so being the base
model this is going to start out at
$12.99 us that's going to get you a 2.7
gigahertz quad core i5 CPU but you can
configure this all the way up to a 3.1
gigahertz quad core i7 CPU and these are
all based off Intel's fourth generation
has well processors now as far as memory
does come standard with 8 gigs around
which honestly is enough for most
everyday applications like photo editing
video editing but if you're looking to
do heavier things like Adobe After
Effects Premiere Final Cut Pro 10
definitely bump that up to 16 gigabytes
because unlikely 27-inch model you
cannot upgrade the RAM after the fact on
this one now in terms of the hard drive
you're getting one terabyte of storage
but it is at 5400 rpm speeds so if you
look at the speed test we're getting
around 95 to 100 megabytes per second
which isn't bad by any means but if you
were looking to do one upgrade towards a
Mac I would heavily consider going
towards a fusion drive because at the
bare minimum you're looking to triple
possibly quadruple your speeds that's
gonna help with boot times loading
applications and overall just a better
user experience and those are based off
my tests for last year's fusion drive
the new ones are supposed to be even
faster so if you want a little more info
and a demo on that I will have that
linked down below now something that
piqued my interest and got me really
curious about the baseline 21 and 1/2
inch mom is the fact that Apple opted to
go with solely Intel iris pro graphics
and not a dedicated GPU now granted the
iris pro is Intel's cream of the crop in
terms of integrated graphics but I am
extremely curious to see how that stacks
up against a dedicated GPU regardless of
how low-end it was flipping over to the
back we see the headphone jack SDXC card
slot there are four USB 3.0 ports two
Thunderbolt ports and a gig Ethernet
port there are also stereo speakers
bluetooth 4.0 and we now see 802 11 AC
Wi-Fi on these new iMacs now
aesthetically these iMacs look exactly
the same as last year's 2012 redesign
they're still thin as hell but all the
changes happened under the hood now
obviously that is important and speed
and performance are one of
reasons why you would upgrade so I did
get some initial benchmarks so running
Geekbench 3 we saw a single core score
of 3143 and a multi-core score of 10000
193 now Geekbench 3 is relatively new so
I did not have it when I was testing out
last year's iMac but in order to give
you guys some sort of reference and
comparison I went back and looked at
that Geekbench to score and that was
about 90 100 and I went ahead and
downloaded Geekbench 2 on the 2013 iMac
and that pumped out his score of about
10,000 100 so that about wraps up this
unboxing and demo hopefully you enjoy
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to gotee
healthy style on that like button if you
guys have any questions on the imac or
