TLD with my top five paid and free games
optimized for the new iPads Retina
display now the first game we're looking
at is yes angry birds space HD and less
you've been living under a rock most of
you guys know angry birds is this is the
latest iteration where they're obviously
in space so we got birds that are angry
Fighting Gravity floating around
aimlessly and knocking stuff over so
this is currently two dollars and
ninety-nine cents in the App Store you
get 60 levels of gameplay the graphics
look great on the new iPad and overall
for the price tag I'd say go for it is
definitely a fun time killer next up is
diamond dash this one is a
straightforward kinda quick case fast
reflex super addictive games where
you're trying to find at least three of
these same color diamonds grouped
together as many times as you can racing
against the clock again the graphics
look great optimized for the retina
display and the best part about this app
is the fact that it is free next on the
list is bike Baron which was just
recently optimized for the new iPad I
actually hadn't played this game before
but it has quickly become one of my
favorite ipad apps period gameplay is
super super addictive and the controls
are intuitive they're easy to move
around and maneuver there's a ridiculous
amount of levels with objectives within
those four you're racing against the
clock collecting coins performing back
flips front flips and honestly half of
the fun is actually wiping out
and by the way this is 99 cents in the
App Store numero four on the list is
pinball HD collection which is currently
free in the App Store now this is one of
the most realistic pinball games I've
played on the iPad and now it's
optimized for the retina display this
wild-west setting you guys can see on
screen is fully functional it's not a
demo or trial this comes completely free
with the game if you do want additional
settings you can purchase them as in-app
purchases but if you don't want to spend
any additional money again this is
totally free fully functional it's
pinball it's free it's HD it's awesome
and last on the list is modern combat 3
fallen Nation which is an awesome first
person shooter there's a full 13 mission
campaign you can play multiplayer you
can play online the game plays extremely
smooth and fluid looks great on the
retina display and while 699 isn't
exactly cheap as far as an ipad game
goes for the quality and the amount of
gameplay you get with modern combat 3
the graphics look fantastic these sounds
and audio quality is great I definitely
would recommend picking us up so
