excited for tomorrow either Google is
playing the entire internet and about to
reveal potentially what is the greatest
tech troll of all time or they're about
to set themselves up for massive failure
a pixel can't stop leaking we pretty
much know everything there is to know
about a pixel 3 as well as the pixel 3
XL we have a very clear image now of
this pixel 3 all pretty much everything
about it no matter how hard you try you
literally can't get anything past the
Internet so that clip that just roll
right now was tweeted from an official
Google account with the caption so you
think you know tune in tomorrow to find
out for yourself are you kidding me
Google if you tug on our heartstrings
and set us up like that and don't
release the pixel 3 ultra the entire
tech community is going to flip that
notch out now unless you've been living
under tech Rock the pixel 3 and more
specifically the pixel 3 XL it's got to
be the most leaked smartphone of all
time like at this point it is just silly
John processor the mad lad of front-page
tech not to be confused with John
Prosser that guy's kind of a dick has
covered this extensively in
chronological order from A to Z so if
you want the entire breakdown I'll drop
a link down below to the pixel 3
chronicles go to leave a comment with a
heart hashtag Joe crow and tell him TLD
Sencha to give me the cliff note version
of that though the leak started all the
way back in June which kind of leads to
the question how is Google been that bad
about keeping a product a secret there's
no way they did this on accident they
have to be trolling us if you've seen
the pixel three XL knotch it is probably
the ugliest notch of all time like to
the point where I'm not even sure the
pixel 3 excels own mother would like it
me personally the tech fan inside is
praying to Korean Jesus that Google's
playing us and they're about to
bamboozle the entire tech world tomorrow
and unveil something cool like the pixel
3 ultra with that no not beautiful
display so I'm curious what you guys
think is Google about to bamboozle us
and trick the tech world and drop that
pixel 3 Ultra tomorrow or are we stuck
with the pixel 3 XL and that not you
guys can vote with the pull up here or
comment down below either way if you're
excited and still hoping for that
beautiful and no notch display on the
pixel 3 ultra let me know by punching
that like button in the face or the
knotch if you're a pixel three XL
updates pew news poppy Harlow is
reporting there's a leak today showing
the pixel 3 excel has a 1080p display
which makes me question everything maybe
Google is going the Apple route a la the
iPhone 10 are lowering the pixel density
lowering the price and then like hey you
won a 1440p display you want those
pixels fork out the cash for that pixel
3 Ultra or maybe someone just printed
out some notes and some numbers on a
paper and a website posted it for them
sweet sweet views now it kind of debunks
that whole 1080p pixel 3xl leaked I just
talked about is two days ago and gadget
posted the hands on of a pixel 3 XL that
was sold early in Hong Kong which is
just about as sketchy as that Russian
leak earlier this year and the thing
that was super odd and super strange to
me is every leak so far that is posted
this year there hasn't been one single
photo or camera test leaked out online
which just seems weird if that was me
and I had the pixel 3 that would be like
the first thing I would do as we know
the pixel 2 camera is arguably the best
in the business
even clearly when it's taken on the
iPhone 10s shout-out to everyone that
watched that video if you missed it the
comments section it's a fun one grab
your popcorn and check it out that aside
though this whole thing just has me
questioning everything I know from the
Engadget video the fact that they didn't
post photos or samples back to the
Russian league
almost look like they staged this video
to look like a YouTube unboxing the
whole thing just screams weird to me the
logical part of me and honestly every
reliable text source out there is pretty
much same don't get your hopes up we're
not gonna see that pixel three ultra but
that kid in me that hopefulness part of
me really wants to see Google shake up
the world I think if anything the tech
world is in a place where we need
something awesome like that to happen
either way though by the time you guys
watch this video the pixel event is
about 12 hours away so definitely make
sure you guys stay tuned subscribe we
have it for a future coverage on
whatever it's gonna be the pixel 3 the
pixel 3 XL and potentially fingers
crossed that pixel 3 ultra I'm excited
stay tuned
this is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
