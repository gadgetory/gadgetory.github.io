with texas lunch and dinner bringing you
a quick unboxing the kind of first look
to the pv amp kit lengths cool little
device that will allow you connect your
guitar to your iPhone iPod Touch or your
iPad just want to make a note that it
will work on the iPad but it is geared
for iOS 4 and the iPhone on the iPod
Touch so you guys can see it's got a
nice little velcro opening right here
gives you a little overview of what the
app looks like it was just actually
released today there's two versions
there's amp kit free and then there's
amp kit plus which is 20 bucks we're
going to review the free version so you
guys ought to pay for that does retail
for $39.99 I will post links to where
you guys can pick this up and I'm really
kind of excited to take a look at this
looks kind of like there's nothing else
like down the market
this is double-a battery powered so
hopefully it's going to take some strain
off your iPod your iPhone save some
battery life can also increase the
performance so it's very basic this
plugs into your iPhone and the matrix
wire plugs in here and then you
headphones speakers or lineout is
located right here so let's go to jump
into a couple quick sound so you guys
can hear what this sounds like and what
it does alright as we jump right into
the app you guys can see like I said
this was the free version we're gonna
review the Plus version so if you guys
want to check out make sure to stay
tuned for that review and have that
posted on our music channel but this is
just a free version so you guys can go
ahead and download this from the App
Store and check it out so they have two
options you can either tweak your tone
and it was a lot of guitarists out there
who like to tweak their guitar tone
their sound
there's your own setups portion of the
app right here then there's the presets
that already built-in so if you just
want to jump in and get a good sounding
tone right out of the way you can just
select one of those so I'll get to those
in a minute there's two more or three
more tabs actually those recordings so
that looks like they actually have some
backing tracks you guys can hear those
right now
anything from ballad to jazz to even
metal super metal beat for you guys out
there going to stop those and then so
that's to two things in here you have
backing tracks and I believe you can
also upload your own if you have drums
that you program in your
Cubase or whatever it is you can upload
those there and then you can add gear
there's also a store right here if you
want to download the free version maybe
you only want to buy the 6505 plus you
can do that you have to pay the
20 bucks I do believe you get a discount
but just in case you don't want to pay
the 20 bucks for that you can just buy
individual amps and effects and there's
an info that has helped topics and
everything like that from the output and
presets and basically how to optimize
your setup with the amp kit so now I
started going to get into the sounds I
have Josh on the guitar right now I'm
gonna jump into their first one which is
a crunchy type sound so probably like a
vintage classic rock type sound let's go
ahead and see how that sounds
so it looks pretty common you can change
the the microphone this is based off
lesson 57 and then we got like it looks
like an ointment right here so let's see
if we can hear a tone difference I'll go
and switch back and forth for you guys
yeah so I mean that's really responsive
even a lot of amp simulators that you
find on your computer don't respond that
well as far as changing the tone but you
do hear a difference as far as changing
the dials the EQ even the amp and the
microphone itself so you have let's go
to check out a couple more sounds so it
looks like if you alter it automatically
puts it into your my setups portion
which is cool if the case you
accidentally like come up to a sound
that you like and you don't worry about
losing it cuz it's gonna be there so P V
I know there's a lot of metalheads out
there who play P V let's go to jump into
the nu metal sound and see how that
sounds
so that sounds pretty good I mean this
is pretty amazing to have this all on
your phone it's kind of really like I
said amazing how far we've come from
computer reporters I remember five years
ago you can even get this idea computer
so the noise gate actually works pretty
damn well you got humbuckers you got
active pickups like an EMG it kicks in
it takes that noise away so very well
from an app especially for a phone and
keep in mind this is free all you got to
do is buy the amp kit link which is 39
but like I mentioned in the unboxing it
is double-a powered so it's gonna take
some of the strain off of your phone
your iPhone your iPod Touch and it's
gonna do some of the processing there so
let's go and get a clean sound for you
guys who don't to hear the metal all the
hard stuff so well here nice clean with
some reverb and see how that sounds
go ahead and tweak it real time I'm
gonna bump up the volume a little bit
so there you go I mean there you guys
have it you guys can see like this is a
free app all you got to do is buy the
amp kit link which is honestly worth the
money considering the price should pay
for an interface you can record on it
you have backing tracks that come with
it you can upload your own and overall
I'm definitely impressed with what PV
and agile have done with this app so
that's been our little mini review stay
tuned for the full in depth review with
the Plus version on our music channel
I'll post a link right here when we get
that up that will become active but
other than that I want to thank you guys
for checking it out again I want to
thank Jack and Bradley over at PD for
hooking us up with this and allowing us
to test it out and we'll catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
