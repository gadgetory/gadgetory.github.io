lunch and dinner bringing your review of
gears of war 3 for the xbox 360 taking
place roughly a year and a half after
the events of gears war to humanity is
scattered and constantly under threat
from the lambent who are the new main
antagonist in this game the locust are
still around but they're kind of pushed
aside because the laminar is such a huge
threat now constantly attacking all
human civilization the writing for the
storyline is solid although in my
opinion a little weaker than gears two
not that it's bad it's just that there
weren't as many oh crap moments as we
saw in Gears too although it was still
solid and durable throughout the whole
way and provides a strong finish for the
trilogy now as far as gameplay is
concerned gears 3 continues to use the
same formula we saw in the first two
games I'll being with a few tweaks here
and there those aside it does feel very
much the same now of course this isn't
necessarily a bad thing because the
gears formula is really good it works
and it's still very enjoyable some of my
personal favorite new additions to the
game include the use of Silverbacks
during the main campaign which are
basically like small mechs you can use
to just devastate whole groups of
enemies as well as the addition of the
retro answer it's basically an older
version of the standard Lancer that uses
an old style bayonet instead of a
chainsaw that allows you to perform a
charging melee attack to instantly
execute enemies it's really awesome or
my personal favorite weapons in this
game both on campaign and multiplayer
the main campaign now allows for full
four player co-op rather than standard
to allowing a full of group of friends
to tackle hardcore or insanity modes the
missions during the main campaign are
varied enough to keep the experience
feeling fresh albeit with the occasional
repetitive section involving item
collection those few missions that also
have to break up this repetitiveness
though include the use of vehicle
missions suppose in a car or submarine
as well as even an air balloon combat
section one mission in particular that
stands out as a lot of fun is the pen
anvil gate where players work together
to defend one of humanity's main bases
from oncoming horde of locusts overall
the campaign leaves players is a very
satisfied feeling the storyline gives
you enough little plot twists and fun
moments to be playing as well as two
Commission's feeling fresh enjoyable
hallway for multiplayer overall feels
like a great improvement over gears two
versus mode is a lot of fun although you
still need to be very careful around
opponents or shotguns especially the new
sod off which can basically wreck
anything in point-blank range though it
has such a long reload time you have
plenty of time to punish anyone that
fails to use it right as players level
up online they can lock a number of
different player and weapon skins along
them to customize their all in persona
as they see fit in addition to standard
vs. online multiplayer also consists of
the returning horde mode and it's locust
equivalent beast mode in these modes you
take the form of a cooperative group of
players taking on waves and waves of
enemies thinning out their numbers and
proving your defenses with money gained
for good performance this has been an
actual personal favorite mode to play
I've been doing it non-stop recently I'm
actually waiting for some runs my to get
back in town so we can actually do a
local match and just wreck all kinds of
have it with proper teamwork rather than
random online papers over all gears war
three doesn't do too much change of what
we've seen from the first two games but
it finally Tunes the formula that we've
all come to love offering a solid
campaign experience both offline by
yourself or with friends locally and
online as well as a great multiplayer
experience both cooperatively and
competitively gears or three masters the
formula that we saw introduced in the
first game anyone who is a fan of the
first two games if you haven't picked it
up yet do so now and for those you that
haven't this one might actually serve as
a justification to jump right into the
series offering a great experience while
they're looking for a single player
campaign something to play cooperatively
with friends online or even just for
standard vs matches I recommend it to
anyone who's a fan of third person
shooters that's our review of gears war
three make sure to stay tuned on Tuesday
when I give you guys my first looks of
Dark Souls and rage till then I'm coming
for TLD thanks for watching
