iphone 7 release date gets closer and
closer the more leaks and potential
parts we see and specifically the one
that dropped today shows off a few
different things one the deeper and
deeper we get into these leaks some more
and more it kind of confirms that the
iPhone 7 is gonna look very similar to
the iPhone 6s which we know of course
looks just like this 6 so whether you
like it or not
there's not gonna be a whole lot of
change design-wise to the camera cutout
is bigger than any iPhone we've seen
today which in that light is positive
news because ultimately a bigger cutout
equals a bigger sensor which ultimately
leads to a better camera unfortunately
regardless of this being a great angle
or not it does still look like there's
gonna be that damn camera hump in 3 it
kind of Alba confirms that if there's
gonna be a dual camera iPhone that's
gonna happen on the bigger model what
this picture doesn't show us though is a
clearer look at the bottom of the iPhone
so there's no additional insight on
whether or not the headphone jack is or
isn't gonna be there honestly I kind of
think that sucker is dead I'm getting
emails and seeing more and more
lightning clip headphones announced
which is not a good sign if you are a
fan of 3.5 millimeter audio now even
though the next iPhone will have a
bigger sensor I would not expect him to
make a jump as far as megapixels go the
iPhone 6s is currently rocking a 12
megapixel camera which we should see on
the next iPhone but once again
megapixels are not everything and I'm
personally more excited for the bigger
sensor over a bump in megapixels now
with all that information combined this
is where it starts to get a little
interesting for me because it definitely
adds merit to the rumor of Apple moving
toward a three-year upgrade cycle as
opposed to the current two-year one
we're used to so for example the 4 and
4s shared the same design the 5 and 5s
were upgraded the 6 and 6s were upgraded
in contrary to that pattern this is
where it looks like that is gonna change
now jumping back to the dual cam this is
also where the naming scheme gets a
little bit muddy like I mentioned
there's a ton of evidence pointing to
the dual camera only happened
exclusively on the bigger iPhone so is
the naming scheme gonna be the iphone 7
iphone 7 pro or is this finally the year
where Apple ditches the number system
and simply reverts to iPhone and iPhone
Pro eventually and especially as we draw
closer and closer to double digits it's
gonna get ridiculous it almost becomes a
question of when and not if as far as
the rest of the rumors go there's a lot
of speculation that the next iPhone is
going to be water-resistant
but not waterproof and not sure how big
of a deal that is for you for me
personally I would love to see them go
full waterproof the galaxy s7 was able
to achieve a waterproof design without
covering up ports or sacrificing looks
so there's no reason why we shouldn't
see that on the iPhone 7 I know most of
these rumors have kind of fallen towards
the negative side but on a positive note
it does look like Apple's finally
getting with the times they realized
2016 and the 16 gigabyte base model
should be no more and it should start
out at 32 gigabytes as far as the rest
of the capacities go that is also still
up in the air but I think we could see
as a lineup is 32 64 and 128 gigabyte
models and while there's a lot of talk
and potentially maybe more hope of a 256
gigabyte model I think if that does
happen that would land on the iPhone Pro
model so no while the iPhone 7 or
whatever they're gonna call it may not
be a major upgrade over the 6s it may be
a really solid jump up from the 6 or
obviously anything prior to that now
based off these leaks if the iPhone 7
really isn't doing much for you you
don't want to wait or you simply just
want an iPhone 6s now if this video hits
50,000 likes I will give away a 6s or 6s
plus in a video later this week
obviously if you're not subscribed you
probably want to do that and if you want
to take it one step further I think it's
time to join a notification squad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
