with tea Helsinki shout out to Mike Oh
ex big ex 10 for leaving a comma in the
last video it's funny because if you use
a why it's Tec if you use an I it is
food today I'll be reviewing the book
book for iPhone and what had happened
was is iPhone case said what's up to
wallets cue the babies making music and
now came the book book for iPhone which
essentially is a hybrid iPhone 4 case
slash wallet cleverly disguised a little
leather book I know right - blown now
this is made out of real leather so it
does have that awesome smell to it what
you do is you slide your iPhone name 12
South claims you can fit three to four
cards I was actually able to fit my ID
in four cards with a little bit cash no
problem now I will say the cash she had
a fold differently than he normally
would in traditional wallets let's use a
monopoly money so that was one of the
things I didn't like about it I've been
using this for the past week and it was
a little different for the first couple
days because I'm used to carrying three
things my phone my wallet and my keys so
I did have a couple oh shit I forgot my
wallet moments only to realize I didn't
because it was part of my case once I
got used to it I personally loved the
idea of carrying one less thing and when
it comes to my wallet I'm actually an
airhead there's been a couple times when
I've lost my wallet for days at a time
never lost my phone but now that I think
about it's probably cuz you can call the
phone you can't call a wallet now as you
guys can see from the design you guys
are probably wondering how do you take
pictures with this because there is no
cut out for the camera hole what you got
to do is actually slide it out which can
be a little bit annoying because it does
get in the way of the screen so if you
do take a lot of pictures with the
iPhone I would suggest either taking it
out or maybe this case isn't for you
typing and texting wasn't too bad if you
hold it a certain way in portrait when
you flip it over to landscape there's
absolutely no difference whatsoever I
will say the reactions when you pull it
out as a wallets are different from when
you use it as a phone because when you
bust it out as a wallet it's like oh my
god it's so cool your iPhone case is
your wallet but it does look a little
funny when you're talking on the phone
dude is talking to his wallet either way
aside from a few minor things like the
camera cutout which really didn't bother
me too much because I don't take too
many pictures on the iPhone if you do
this case might not be the one for you
but if you like the idea of having one
less thing to carry like I do I would
definitely recommend you pick up the
book book for iPhones so hopefully you
guys enjoyed this review if you have any
comments questions leave me a comment
down below I'll post a link to pick one
up in the description feel free to
follow me on Twitter as well as
subscribe and I will catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
