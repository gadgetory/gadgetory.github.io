here with Texas lunch and dinner sorry
for the re-upload on this video I found
a little default studying bug that was
causing the IMAX to boot up slowly it
was taking him really about a minute so
let's go ahead and see how much faster
it is on the left side it's ti5 on the
right side of CI seven looks like
they're just about even right now and it
looks like the i7 pulls ahead and the i7
does boot up faster so this is about 18
seconds for the i7 like I said it took
about a minute yesterday so let's go
ahead and jump to the fix if you guys
are having the same problem now I've
heard of this problem on 2009 and 2010
imax
what happens is there's no startup this
selected solar does it keep spinning and
searches for what to boot up for so it
doesn't know what exactly to boot up
from and that explains how long it takes
so if it takes longer than 30 seconds
for your iMac to boot up go to System
Preferences go to startup disk and make
sure that the startup disk is selected
if there's nothing selected chances are
that the main problem of why your iMac
is booting up so I just wanted to post
those little quick fix for you guys I
took mine really from about a minute
down to about 20 seconds I think I was
like 18 on my i7 and then it was about
23 24 on the i-5 so helps me I hope it
helped you guys and I'll catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
