13 inch retina macbook pro which
features a massive 2560 by 1600 display
sammich into a 13.3 inch form factor and
the awesome folks over at the verge calm
got some hands-on footage with it but
I'm not completely sold on it yet they
ran some stress tests they had
GarageBand running while playing 1080p
video simultaneously they talked about
how it didn't really lag didn't really
stress the CPU but one of the big things
that disappointed me on the new macbook
pro the retina 13-inch that is so they
don't offer quad-core graphics or
dedicated graphics at all it's
completely integrated it's cool that you
get SSD flash storage is a base
configuration but to me it's almost a
better value if you go up to the 15-inch
retina macbook pro for 500 bucks more
you get a bigger screen more pixels a
quad-core cpu and most importantly to me
dedicated graphics so what do you guys
think after seeing some footage does
that read a display justify the 1700 our
price tag or is it too much for a
dual-core cpu no dedicated graphics
laptop let me know with a comment down
below I will be picking up to unbox and
to review so make sure to subscribe if
you haven't already so you don't miss
that and if you guys haven't checked it
out yet I'm also given away a brand-new
iPad Mini that was also just announced
today for details and info on that go
and click this video right here and I'll
see you guys in that video with a chance
to win a brand-new iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
