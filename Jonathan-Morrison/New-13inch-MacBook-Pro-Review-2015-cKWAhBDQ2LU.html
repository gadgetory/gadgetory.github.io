faster has beefed up graphics and a
completely redesigned trackpad
so let's check out if it's worth picking
up so what's up guys Jonathan here with
TLD and this is my review of Apple's
2015 13 inch MacBook Pro now I'll get
you look at comparisons versus last
year's model this year's i5 versus i7
and that includes video editing gaming
speed tests and more but let's start
with something that is completely new
for 2015 and that is the force touch
trackpad it's a trip but with this
trackpad you aren't actually clicking
anything below the trackpad is a taptic
engine which creates a have to click
back at you which makes it feel like
you're clicking to really understand
what I'm saying if you own one or can
check one out in store shut the MacBook
Pro down and then try clicking since
it's software controlled you can adjust
it from light to medium to firm
depending on your preference and that
was always a tap to click kind of guy
but now really enjoy clicking on this
new trackpad it's strange yet satisfying
it takes a little getting used to at
first but once you do you can really
tell the difference compared to last
year's model again since its hardware
and software control you get even
consistent clicks at any point on the
trackpad conversely on a non force touch
trackpad the money clicks happen right
in the middle and then closest towards
you you move all the way towards the top
of that trackpad and the click game
suddenly isn't so hot on top of that you
can then push down to engage a force
touch the sensors gauge how much
pressure is being applied and then from
there gain more control over your Mac if
you force click a file on your desktop
you can then quickly preview it in
QuickTime when you're playing a video
the deeper you press the faster at fast
forwards or the faster it rewinds and
lastly if you're reading text you can
force click that text to get more info
on it now design wise aside from the
trackpad this year's model looks exactly
like last year's and it isn't
sacrificing anything like the new 12
inch macbook it's equipped with a mac
save - connection twin Thunderbolt 2
ports USB 3 a headphone jack and dual
mics on one side and on the other an
SDXC card reader HDMI and the second USB
3.0 port the display is also the same
but it's beautiful it sizes in at
thirteen point three inches and rocks a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 before that
guy out there shouts through his
keyboard there's no point of anything
past 1080p on a notebook display worst
laptop ever
yourself Timmy this is how it works by
default with the 2560 by 1600 resolution
you're getting a screen real estate that
looks like 1280 by 800 but since there's
twice the pixels vertically and
horizontally
you're really getting four pixels for
each pixel of real estate which results
in a super sharp and oh so crispy image
but sweet though is that an apps that
support Retina scaling it won't scale
things like video so in Final Cut Pro 10
for example I can have a full 1080p
window plane at a one-to-one pixel ratio
and the text and UI elements come in at
4 to 1 you can also adjust its
system-wide if you need more screen real
estate so it looks like 1440 by 900 or
up to 1680 by 1050 which is usually what
I have mine set to so obviously it's
newer MacBook it's gonna be faster but
how much faster for testing I busted
through three versions last year's 2.6
gigahertz
I 5 this year's 2.7 gigahertz i-5 and
also this year's 3.1 gigahertz core i7
model in Geekbench 3 they were pretty
evenly stacked up and there really
wasn't a huge difference across the
three multi-core there was a little bit
bigger of a difference but again nothing
crazy especially even comparing this
year's i-5 all the way up to the i7 next
up is black magic disk speed test and
this is going to test how fast the flash
storage inside the macbook pro is the
2014 model was just about 500 megabytes
per second on the right side and just
around 675 megabytes per second on the
read speed and keep in mind this is the
128 gigabyte model the 2015 i5 model
which has 256 gigs of flash storage was
much faster nearly 1,200 megabytes per
second on the right side and almost
1,300 megabytes per second on the read
side do note though if you're testing
this out and you see slower speeds more
than likely because you have the smaller
128 gigabyte model that is perfectly
normal and nothing to freak out about
lastly this year's i7 model which is
packing 512 gigs of flash storage that
was fourteen hundred megabytes per
second on the right side and 1350 on the
read so really really fast so numbers
and benchmarks are cool but what does it
actually mean I thought it'd be cool to
give you guys a behind-the-scenes look
at shooting a video and then editing it
on the MacBook Pro and I got to hang out
with Kevin
aka fit man cook who was absolutely
killing it on Instagram so we shot an
entire video for his channel
and if you're drooling over that food
I'll have a link to his video down below
but what I did from there was take it to
my macbook pro lay the chopped down and
then from there copied this project to
the two other MacBook Pros so I can see
how fast each of them exported this
video and the final cut ended up being
around 3 minutes 1080p imported from my
fs7 the 2014 i-5 MacBook Pro dishes out
in 1 minute 10 seconds the 2015 i-5
MacBook Pro did the same thing in a
minute and five seconds and finally the
3.1 gigahertz i7 MacBook Pro did the
exact same thing in one minute flat now
I also created my own TLD Final Cut Pro
10 benchmark which you can download and
try it out for yourself this involves a
little more rendering and text elements
in the 2014 MacBook Pro the i-5 did this
in one minute 29 seconds the 2015 i-5
MacBook Pro is only a couple seconds
faster and where we saw the biggest
difference was only 3.1 gigahertz i7
2015 MacBook Pro real quickly the
Photoshop tests around the 2014 and the
2015 i-5 were pretty much identical and
again we saw a bigger difference with
the i7 2015 model now as far as a real
quick gaming test just to see how much
better the integrated graphics on this
year's model are compared to last year's
I went ahead and ran Tomb Raider last
year's MacBook Pro was just under 12
average frames per second while this
year's jumped up to just under 17 so
definitely a little bump there and as
far as this year's i-5 versus i7 in
terms of gaming for this tester really
wasn't a big difference not even a full
frame per second lastly in Cinebench r15
you can see these benchmarks line up
pretty much identically to every other
benchmark I've run so far the 2015
MacBook Pro whether it's the i5 or i7
has a pretty nice bump in the graphics
department and a decent but not great
bump in the CPU department aside from
that regarding battery life Apple is
going to claim you're going to get 10
hours out of this machine which may be
true you might push 10 but realistically
eight to nine if you're doing light
things like web browsing but if you're
really going heavy and using Final Cut
Pro 10 Adobe Premiere After Effects
Photoshop you can probably realistically
expect to get somewhere in the 5 to 6
hour range I didn't really notice too
much of a battery dip on the i7 versus
the i-5 but what I did notice is that
the fans on the i7 kicked up a lot more
and a lot
easier than the i-5 which kind of was
annoying to me overall bang for buck I
really don't see a whole ton of value
going for the i7 if you're looking for
shear power I would actually put that
extra money towards a 15-inch model
which is actually going to get you a
quad core model versus dual core and
possibly even dedicated graphics as
opposed to integrated depending on the
model you pick up overall I think the
force touch trackpad is solid and I
really enjoy it but I don't think it's
necessarily something that you're going
to have to go run out and sell your 2014
MacBook Pro and it's going to make you
have to buy this if you're rocking
something from 2013 or prior than yet
it's going to be a really nice jump and
I would totally recommend it but again
unless you go in that Apple Store and
you really really really love that force
touch trackpad then I would probably
hold off until 2016 aside from that
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you're feeling like being
awesome make sure to go Chuck Norris on
that like button and in return get a
virtual high-five actual face if you
have any questions or need buying advice
on these new MacBook Pros drop your line
or actually the best way to get ahold of
me is on twitter at TLT today pricing
and availability everything you could
possibly need to know is linked down

this is Jonathan with TLD and I'll see
