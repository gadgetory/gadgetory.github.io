TLD and right about now yes right now I
wish I was in Germany and no not for the
beer cuz I don't drink or so I could
dress up my dog like this although that
would be awesome but if you guys haven't
heard some early iPhone 4s orders have
already shipped and delivered to some
customers in Germany there are a few low
res pictures you can see what the box
looks like if you guys want to check
that out link in the description and
aside from that if you are German give
me a high five you guys got the iPhone
4s early now with early arrivals comes
benchmarks and from what we can see the
iPhone 4s is in the same dual-core a5
processor as the iPad 2 which we
expected but it is slightly under
clocked at 800 megahertz as opposed to
the full gigahertz on the iPad 2 and it
is sporting 512 Meg's of RAM now Timmy
don't be sad cheer up the African 4s
actually scored extremely well it was a
little bit slower than the iPad 2 but we
should expect that was the slightly
lowered clock speed but for those of you
guys on the rope not sure about
upgrading from the iPhone 4 to the 4s
you guys can clearly see the speed
difference moving on to the gaming and
graphics benchmark you Android guys
aren't gonna like this but the iPhone 4s
absolutely destroys the Samsung Galaxy S
2 as well as the Droid Bionic and
graphics and for you Android lovers I
know this is tough it's hard to accept
but remember that is the first step he
asked me to talk I'm here I'll post a
toll free number in the description box
below you guys will get through this now
the last thing I want to talk about is a
hands on Siri demo Apple's new voice
assistance software if the videos about
8 to 9 minutes long here's a quick clip
so you guys can see how awesome it is
what time is it in New York now the best
part of this whole video is the do tell
Siri I love you check out what happens I
love you so I'm personally extremely
excited for the iPhone 4s I'll be
getting mine Friday in white 32
gigabytes on AT&amp;amp;T if you guys preorder
one let me know your configuration your
size your color and your carrier if you
guys planning on getting up but a surly
or camping out so let me know as well
it's always fun hearing your stories and
again if you guys want links to the
stories in this video those are down
below in the description other than that
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you like me and all 'some feel free
to subscribe and I will see you guys
is laid up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
