apple product this is the brand new Xbox
one X and here are five things to know
before buying so first up I'm the kind
of sandwich three things together in one
name pricing and availability prior to
today's announcement this was known as
project Scorpio and now we have the
official name Xbox one xB now Big
Brother to the Xbox 1s although this
technically isn't born yet it doesn't
come out till November 7th so does that
make it the little but better brother
anyways it cost $499 so next up at
number two even though this is the most
powerful Xbox ever it is also the
smallest Xbox ever which is kind of
crazy if you think about it also
strangely enough there was a ton of
people who really really wanted a black
finish from the Xbox one task that of
course has not happened yet and it's
debuting here with the Xbox one X so if
you're holding out for that that may
have made your decision for you now even
though this looks very similar to an
Xbox one as the only component that they
shared that is the exact same is the
blu-ray drive everything else inside
this is completely different now one
thing that was particularly cool with
this is even though it's more powerful
in the Xbox one F even though it's
drawing more power something like 125
Watts more if you look on the back the
power cord is exactly the same and it
take that even further the layouts and
the outputs are the exact same as well
so in theory if you wanted to unplug and
pop your Xbox 1s out and replace with
this it is going to be seamless now the
next type of number three is for those
who want to get down and dirty and know
the specs and what is inside this Xbox
1x this was back in a sixth teraflop GPU
clocked at one point one seven two
gigahertz 12 mega bytes memory what's
nice with that is none of those are
going straight to game so it's kind of
refreshing to see even though they're
packing in the spec from the hardware
there's a good amount of allocation
going to the gaming side when that
memory you're also getting 326 gigabytes
per second of memory bandwidth so the
key message here is true 4k game playing
yes I guarantee you one guy out there is
going to say I'm just going to build a
gaming PC and that's fine you can do
that but the fact that there is this
much power packed inside a console I
think is awesome here e3 they debuted
for seven which is pumping out 4k 60fps
gameplay and I don't care what side of
the fence you put yourself on whether
it's
console game or PC gamer if you enjoy
tech that is a really great thing now
next up at number four is backwards
compatibility all Xbox one accessories
will work with the Xbox one X of course
your games are going to work they're
gonna look better but what was special
today is on top of the backwards
compatibility with Xbox 360 games
Microsoft announced compatibility all
the way back to the original Xbox and
tons of loud beeping to is on top will
work with the Xbox one X now last step
number five is even if you don't own a
4k TV but still want to pick up an Xbox
one X that's okay firstly game play is
going to look better and the best way I
could describe that from a video
standpoint it's very similar to where if
you shot in 4k and then outputted in
1080p it's still going to be crisper
still going to be sharper and that is
definitely not a bad thing on top of
that you're going to get much better
frame rates on the Xbox one X simply
because there is more power so maybe
even holding out you haven't bought an
Xbox one s yet this is definitely going
to be the better future proof option
lastly something I haven't talked about
is there is a faster harddrive pack
inside the Xbox one X it's going to ship
with a one terabyte option and what
that's going to equate to our faster
load time all in all the Xbox one X
looks really good I am NOT a crazy gamer
by any means but this looks really
really tempting if you guys are excited
for this let me know by dropping a like
down below as far as where you could
pick one of these up I am not sure yet
Amazon may have leaked it but I'm not
sure if that link is still there that
will also be down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
