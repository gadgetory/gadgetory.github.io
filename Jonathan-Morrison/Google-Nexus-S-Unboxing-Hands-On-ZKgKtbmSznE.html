a quick unboxing of the nexus s from
google and samsung on the front of the
box you guys can see we got the nexus s
right there as we flip it over on the
bottom Google and Samsung Nexus S on the
sides let's go to pop the cap open if
you guys are interested in picking this
up it'll set you back 529 bucks plus tax
outright that means without a contract
if you want to pick it up with a
two-year contract a new two-year
contract will set you back 199 but you
do have to actually go through
bestbuy.com to set that up you can't
just go into a store waltz in there and
pick that up for the deal I don't know
why I do that it's kind of pain in the
butt but I just want to let you guys
know that so we see the phone right here
sit down the side and go through all the
other stuff that comes in the box we got
the sim card right here push to eject we
don't need to do that right now so this
is t-mobile I've been reading that will
it will work on AT&amp;amp;T swap to wait and
see how that goes the health and safety
warranty guys that's kind of interesting
I know they could have health on a on a
phone booklet here but there we go terms
and conditions return policy and limited
warranty and then we got all the
accessories looks like we've got a phone
charger USB there we go for phone
charger adapter two USB set of
headphones right here probably nothing
special but it's cool if they do include
these in the box there we go look a
little bit nicer actually than you what
you get with a pair of apple ipod or
something so kind of cool dig the food
goes in there and then we get the USB
cable and the battery to the nexus s so
that pretty much wraps it up let's go to
get the tape off nexus s very light
without the battery let's go ahead and
pop a zoom up there for you guys so you
guys are get a better look at this so
this is running a 5 megapixel camera we
can see that on the back I've been here
in the video actually isn't that good
it's running latest android 2.3
gingerbread OS so what to see how it
goes and some further reviews has just
been a quick unboxing stay tuned for
some more videos reviews comparisons
other than that hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
