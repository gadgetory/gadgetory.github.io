dinner giving you our view of crysis 2
for the xbox 360 ps3 and pc now I have
to admit that I'm not really the biggest
fan of the FPS genre overall and those
games reviewed thus far I acknowledge
the merits of but was never a really big
diehard fan the end prices to proves to
be an exception to that rule I must say
that we're playing both a campaign and
the online matches I absolutely love
this game campaign mode is of decent
length and while not offering the most
original or complex of plots the solid
gameplay alone makes it well worth
playing with the variety of Nanosuit
abilities and multiple ways of choosing
how to tackle different situations the
game really doesn't feel like a
run-of-the-mill shooter players are
allowed to take on enemies the way they
want to whether that involves running
out with armor mode active with a
shotgun or machine gun or sneaking
through an entire level with a silenced
weapon and stealth killing every enemy
you encounter while actual level
progression and the story itself are
very linear the way in which you can
tackle each individual level gives a lot
more power and choice to the player
controls for crysis 2 are tight and
offer a number of useful abilities such
as high jumps charged melee attacks
power slides armor camo and a technical
advisor for not only scoping out enemies
but also for hints and tips about useful
weapon caches and strategic locations
for ambushing or sneaking past enemies
players were able to customize their
nanosuit with a number of upgrades and
are even allowed to switch between
different ones when a particular style
doesn't suit the situation these
upgrades vary from more efficient energy
use and stealth or armor to more
interesting abilities like a landing
ground pound your Nanosuit isn't the
only thing that can customized either as
the game progresses and players collect
different weapons they will also find
themselves being able to switch out
various attachments for different guns
sights grenade launcher attachments
extended clips and silencers are all
available and once found can be switched
off and on whenever the player feels a
certain style is necessary this is a
great deal customization of the player
for an FPS game and while only being
able to carry two weapons at a time in
the main campaign the ability to switch
out different attachments allows you to
adjust those two weapons to fit a number
of different circumstances online
gameplay is solid and while it offers
nothing original to the FPS genre it
executes the standards are very well
players can customize their characters
with weapon loadouts as well as ability
setups and players are awarded for their
play style by unlocking attachments for
their favorite weapons or new modules
for the Nanosuit abilities they use most
weapons seem pretty balanced overall and
players can succeed with a number of
different load outs provided they learn
how to play
smart enough with their weapons of
choice online is fast paced and while
cover is useful it rarely is seen as a
central strategy and is usually used
more as a safe place to recharge your
now suits energy levels all the popular
standard modes for online are available
including deathmatch and capture the
flag well no this is really entirely
original i must say that crisis to
balances and fine Tunes all of them to
make it very enjoyable overall overall
Crysis 2 is an excellent first person
shooter now to the many FPS games have
been released in mass these past few
months i must say that Crysis 2 is my
favorite by far if you're looking for a
solid enjoyable FPS game that allows for
various play styles and offers all the
standard match types you are used to or
even if you just want a fun
single-player campaign to run through
crysis 2 is an excellent choice and well
worth purchasing for any FPS or action
game fan i'm kevin for Tod thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
