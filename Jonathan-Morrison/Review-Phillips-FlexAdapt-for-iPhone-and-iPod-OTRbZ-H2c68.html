TLD back with the review we are taking a
look at the philips sync charge and
stance was kind of a weird name but it
does job i picked this up from my iphone
but it does work on a wide array of ipod
models i will post all compatible ipods
down below in the description if you
guys are curious about checking that out
you can pick this up for about 30 George
Washington's I got mine at target they
use what they call flex adapt so you can
adjust this not only portrait or
landscape but actually the viewing angle
of the iphone after a few days of using
it did job just what i was looking for
my only complaint with it as it can't
eat is a little bit so you got to make
sure your iphone or ipod a securely in
place in the 30-pin dock because if it's
not and you push it or you move it maybe
you swipe the screen open sometimes it
tends to fall over if it's not securely
in place but in white screen works
perfectly you don't have to worry about
it falling over being able to adjust the
viewing angles was huge plus on this
like i said it does work very well with
the bluetooth keyboard so if you guys
are looking for kind of a cheap cool
little doctor throwing your desk for
your iphone your ipod touch you guys
probably want to check this out so hope
you guys enjoyed this review thank you
guys for watching make sure to check out
our latest video with a cool iphone 4
and a transparent house thing that's
going to be right here next to my noggin
other than that i will catch you guys
later see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
