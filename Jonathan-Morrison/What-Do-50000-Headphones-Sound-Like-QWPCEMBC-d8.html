they compare gets beat with us what's up
guys johnathan here and this is Orpheus
Sennheiser's 50-plus thousand dollar
pair of headphones
the thing is though you get to put
yourself outside of the mindset that
these are just headphones they on
experience alongside the headphones is a
spring-loaded marble health amplifier
that no joke comes to life as the tubes
warm up the tubes rise in this glowing
mesmerizing can't help a picture epic
music in your head soared away and then
shortly thereafter BAM the headphones
are revealed
so obviously presentation 10 out of 10
what exactly do fifty thousand dollar
headphones sound like whoa the sound
stage is insane I'm right it's like the
audio gods are licking my ears just
everywhere the Tom says like what's up
John a I'm taking off fart ruined
everything else for myself that was
awesome that was okay so that's what
music sounds like I never knew what
music sounded like now I know what music
sounds like these are not crunchy in any
way whatsoever has anyone had those
lollipops were you sticking in your
mouth wow this is amazing it's like that
like the drums went from this year to
this year
it's insane you can tell the difference
compares like regular headphones peasant
headphones but masterrace have folks
don't listen to them it's a bad idea
unless you want to 50 does not don't
listen these headphones I can never
listen other pairs of headphones the
same way so that was definitely an
experience potentially
once-in-a-lifetime that I personally
really enjoyed wanting to share with you
guys
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you or feeling like being awesome
make sure to go austin crunchy evans on
that like button

have any questions definitely drop me a
line down below if you haven't yet feel
