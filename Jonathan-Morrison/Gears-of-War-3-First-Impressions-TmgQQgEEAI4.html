lunch and dinner bring you our first our
impressions of gears of war 3 for the
xbox 360 now so far the game is handled
a lot like the prior gears of war games
so far I've only been doing the campaign
but it's been a lot of fun so far it's
been a pretty quick reintroduction into
the series you jump right back in the
action really quick but they do a good
job of still giving you enough time to
kind of remember the controls and get in
the swing of things what I really like
is that right off the bat there's
already a pretty good number of
different weapons to pick up and swisher
tweens you can already have sort of a
starting set up based on your play style
as far as new things the weapons do feel
a little bit different the hem reverse
rifle is actually a lot of fun I've been
using that one a lot one of the biggest
most northern parts though early on is
you get to make use of a special mech
called the silverback it's a little
personalized domecq that you can ride
around and which can be used to deploy
portable cover you can fire missiles
from it or you can just wreck everything
in front of you with machine gun blast
it's been a lot of fun so far the plots
pretty enticing takes place two years
after the end of gears war two and
there's quite a few things that have
been explained right away but there's
enough questions and enough action going
all at once that your feel like you
really want to kind of get in the game
and get through the rest of it so I'm
having a lot of fun right now I'm going
to keep on playin let you guys know what
I think in my floor of you later on
until next time i'm kevin for TLD thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
