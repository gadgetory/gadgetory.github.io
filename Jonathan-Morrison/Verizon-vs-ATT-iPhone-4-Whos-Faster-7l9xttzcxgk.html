with TL Deegan I just want to answer the
question of who is faster the AT&amp;amp;T
iphone 4 or the verizon iphone 4 so what
do you guys think AT&amp;amp;T verizon mmm
actually the AT&amp;amp;T gsm network was
clearly faster than the verizon cdma
network in my test it consistently got
about two down whereas the verizon was
about mid to high ones now as far as
upload speeds the AT&amp;amp;T version was
consistently above one whereas the
verizon version was consistently below
one so obviously in all the reviews I've
seen the AT&amp;amp;T network is clearly faster
as far as 3G goes now 4G is another
story but obviously does not apply here
from what I've seen the verizon iphone
got a better consistent stronger signal
as far as full bars so it's probably
going to lead to better call quality and
less drop calls and it seems to be that
80's faster but the verizon network is
overall better and more consistent so
hope that answer some questions for you
