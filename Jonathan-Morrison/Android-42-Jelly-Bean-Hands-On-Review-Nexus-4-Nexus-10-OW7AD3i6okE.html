TLD over the past couple of days I got a
chance to spend a lot of time with both
Nexus 4 and the Nexus 10 which both ship
with Android 4.2 jelly bean so I want to
give you guys a tour of the OS and show
you exactly what is new we're going to
start out with lock screen widgets
obviously once you are on your lock
screen you can either swipe left or
right to access them if you want to add
a new one just simply tap the plus
button and then you can choose from a
handful of different widgets to add to
your lock screen from what I can tell
you're not limited to just either one
left or right you can keep adding them
so let's go to unlock the phone and see
what else is new now that we're in the
phone we can check out quick settings so
what you do is you swipe down like you
normally would for notifications tap
that button and boom you got access to
things like brightness settings battery
Wi-Fi airplane mode and bluetooth which
I found extremely convenient the next
thing I want to show you guys is
multi-user support so unlike the iPad
you can actually add multiple users so
here's a quick look at it it's really
simple to add a user once you're on the
lock screen you just tap in between
profiles you can unlock that and bam you
are in the new setting now as of now
this is tablet only but I don't really
see a need or want to have something
like this on a phone maybe unless you
got split personalities but nonetheless
this is definitely a very useful feature
next we can go and take a look at
daydream which is a fancy word for a
screensaver they have a few different
options you can choose from clock colors
which is self-explanatory you then have
currents which essentially is kind of
like Flipboard but in screensaver mode
now I don't have any photos on here yet
but you can also choose from a photo
frame or a photo table and this will
engage either when it's docked or
charging I'm going to go to jump back to
the Nexus 4 for this one and this is
probably one of my favorite updates
about 4.2 and that is pinch to zoom on
gmail is freaking awesome one of my
biggest complaints with Android email is
the fact that it never properly rendered
it or scaled it so this is what it looks
like before do note though that by
default it is actually set to look like
this they actually have to go into the
settings select this and boom it is a
million times better look how smooth it
is I cannot tell you how much I love
this feature next we're going to go to
jump back to the Nexus 10 to show off
gesture typing which isn't new or
innovative what you do is you swipe from
letter to letter to spell out words it's
not innovative but it definitely works
well and it's nice that it is included
for free on android
4.2 there are also improvements to
Google now which even before Android 4.2
was awesome I'll even go as far as
saying I prefer it over Siri now you can
do things like check out movie times or
even track a package which to me is
fantastic lastly we're going to talk
about the camera software improvements
which is packed full of awesomeness it
is really easy and intuitive to access
settings all you got to do is tap and
hold then you can swipe to access things
like white balance exposure flash or
even built in HDR what you guys can see
an example of right here it's not
amazing but it definitely works well
android 4.2 also went a little hipster
on us with built-in instagram like
filters as you guys can check out right
here obviously we're going to see
panorama but Google is one upping that
with photo sphere which is essentially
panorama on steroids so how it works is
you essentially take pictures in a
360-degree environment and then stitches
everything together and kind of gives
you like a google map experience on your
picture which is definitely one of the
coolest features on Android 4.2 so thank
you guys for watching this video I'm
sure there's a few I missed out on let
me know what your favorite new
improvement is with a comment down below
if you guys did enjoy this video make
sure to hit that like button I am also
hard at work on the reviews for both the
devices so if you have not subscribed
make sure you do so so you don't miss
out on any of that coverage thank you
guys again for watching and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
