getting around to doing the clean
install of mountain lion on the
partition that I created in today's
first video with a USB stick like I
created in today's second video so if
you missed either those they'll be
annotated up towards the top corner of
this video and for now now we have the
USB Drive plugged in the first thing we
want to do is shut down the Mac like so
now once it's powered down we're going
to go ahead and press the power button
again but we're going to hit the option
key a couple times then hold it we're
going to look for a couple different
boot up options so you can see we have
the macintosh HD we have the recovery
hard drive and then we have the mac OS
USB drive that we created that's the one
we want to enter and boot into so go
ahead and double click that let it load
up now once we're to this screen
obviously we're going to select our
language that's corresponds to whatever
language you speak I obviously use
English and then we're going to want to
go over to Disk Utility first because
this will apply to if you're doing a
fresh install not just the partition
that I'm doing so let's go and select
that continue and you can see right here
I have a couple options selected because
I created a partition so I actually want
the mountain lion boot drive partition
that I created earlier if you were doing
a clean install without the partition
you'd want to select your hard drive
head over to the erase section make sure
it's formatted to Mac OS extended
journaled and then name it whatever you
want for this instance mine is already
set up just to make sure to troubleshoot
it and double check it make sure to
check to Mac OS extended journaled it's
already titled so we're going to hop out
of here now you just follow those
procedures if you wanted to do a clean
install so since mine is already ready
I'm going to go ahead and jump into the
reinstall section the OS 10 hit continue
so now we can see the OS 10 Mountain
Lion install screen we're going to go to
click continue then we're going to read
through it amazingly fast agree now if
you can see I have a few different
options here I have the mountain lion
boot drive partition and the Macintosh
HD if you don't have a partition you
won't see this option but since I did
that and if you're following the first
video you're going to want to select the
corresponding drive and make sure
installs on the proper drive so for this
instance I want to do mountain lion boot
drive if you're just doing a clean
install this install up to the available
drive that you see so let's go to and
click install right here your computer
is not connected to a power source
I should be fine I have a hundred
percent battery if you want to plug it
in just for the peace of mind you can do
so and now we just wait it should be a
little quicker here since we're using a
USB 3.0 flash drive so I'm just going to
let it do its thing and then I'll catch
you guys back as soon as it finishes up
alright so we're just about wrapping it
up we've got just under a minute left if
you guys are just doing a clean install
and not doing a partition you're pretty
much done so go ahead and exit this
video and enjoy mountain lion if you are
doing the partition with me go to keep
watching because I'm going to show you
guys how to select which drive to boot
on to so for now let's go to hit restart
and boot back into Mountain Lion for the
first time now if you want to control
where you boot up from if you hit up to
the options tab the little Apple logo
System Preferences then we're going to
select the startup disk right here and
by default it looks like it's set to
Mountain Lion so that's cool with you
you're good to go if you prefer to boot
into line for the dual boot option as a
default setting just go and select this
and like I said if your cool mountain
lion you're all set to go so for now I
think I'll leave it here as default if
you want to choose where at the boot up
you can always hold down option upon
power up and that'll give you the boot
up options like we did in the install
section but aside from that that's
pretty much everything you need to know
if you guys enjoyed this video and you
found it helpful make sure to hit that
like button if you have not subscribed
feel free to do so and other than that
go enjoy mountain lion I'm gonna go mess
around with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
