Kingston why drive wirelessly add up to
64 gigabytes of storage to your iOS or
Android device hey guys Jonathan here
with TLD and the biggest things of the
week is the possibility of a 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro that is rumored to be
out sometime before the end of this year
earlier this week a 13-inch MacBook Pro
geekbench score surfaced with a model
number that was different than the
current one but followed similar traits
to the 15-inch retina MacBook Pro which
leads us to believe that there is a
smaller retina MacBook Pro floating
around out there now on a 13-inch model
we're looking at a resolution of 2560 by
1600 which is twice the linear
resolution of the current model but
actually four times the total pixel
density of the current 1280 x 800
resolution now I've seen some of you
guys out there ask why in the hell what
I want to resolution that big on a
screen that small and the way it would
work is everything would be rendered at
2560 by 1600 then it would be scaled
down to look like 1280 by 800 and in
actuality for every pixel on that screen
there would be four pixels packed in
there so that equals the ultra crisp
text vivid pictures really all around
awesomeness that we've come to see on
the 15-inch macbook pro now the analysts
say we might see this in October this
year but me personally I don't see Apple
doing two major updates in the same year
suck balls for those who just bought the
13-inch MacBook Pro so realistically I
would say look forward to this in 2013 I
really don't believe the hype that it's
coming out later this year in iOS news
for you Tiny Wings fans version 2.0 has
hit the App Store to free update if you
currently own it if not it's 99 cent but
it has 15 new levels and for birds where
you can actually race against each other
and they also released the
much-anticipated and long-awaited tiny
wings HD for the iPad which is rocking
retina graphics and I can wholeheartedly
recommend checking this app out it is
one of the best iOS games of all time so
thank you guys for watching let me know
what you think about the possibility of
a 13-inch retina macbook pro with a
comment down below as always if you guys
enjoyed this video and you're feeling
like being awesome make sure to hit that
like button and a huge thanks to
Kingston for making this video possible
if you guys would like to learn more
about the Y Drive it's actually pretty
sick it comes in 16 32 and 64 gigabyte
options that allows you to stream your
photos your music your movies not only
to your device but three devices
simultaneously a lot of movies come with
digital copies so just drag and drop
that from a computer to the Y Drive
which we got kids
BAM Jimmy Timmy and Billy cannot watch
the same file on three separate devices
it also works great if you take a lot of
photos and videos and want to store them
elsewhere but still be able to have
access to that at all times or even on
something like the Nexus 7 that doesn't
have micro SD card slot now you can
store movies music and photos all on
there and increase your storage
capability so if you guys want to check
this out for pricing and what a purchase
one I'll link down below or you can find
out more at kingston's website
