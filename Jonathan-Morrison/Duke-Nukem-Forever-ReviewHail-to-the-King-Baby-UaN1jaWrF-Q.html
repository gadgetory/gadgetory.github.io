the assumption dinner bringing you my
review of duke nukem forever for the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc after having weighed
12 long years for a proper duke nukem
sequel it's fair to say that the game
has not aged one at all it seems as
though gearboxes lead intent with the
game's try and pump up the character of
duke as much as possible but spend
almost no time refining actual gameplay
the controls themselves and consular
terrible not due to button layout but to
how awkward the right stick works it
seems as though even with adjusting
sensitivity you never quite turn or look
in the direction you feel like you
normally would making long-distance
aiming really annoying this is not
helped by the fact that enemy hit boxes
at times make almost no sense as you can
fire a shotgun into melee sometimes
dealing no damage and other times you
can aim at a foot and just see the whole
enemy explode even melee hits sometimes
don't connect in the way they feel they
should causing massive frustration when
you die not because the game is
difficult but because that crucial melee
hit just misses for no apparent reason
this hurts even more when the xbox 360
version has terrible load times
sometimes taking as long as a half a
minute and this is every time you die or
reach a new level though they did do a
good job of making some funny loading
screen comments to make up for it to
help try mix things up every now and
then the campaign offers a few breaks
from standard FPS play including turret
and driving missions turret missions are
decently fun while driving missions can
vary between okay and outright painful
Duke's truck controls just as awkwardly
as his ability to aim and the game's
physics engine appears to be
non-existent players will also be
occasionally shrunken forced to deal
with navigating their way through large
objects fighting other crunkin enemies
and sometimes even dealing with
full-sized ones one thing the main
campaign did that I do like however was
the stealth bomber ego
as Duke does more awesome things his max
health will increase which not only
includes to feeding bosses but also by
interacting with different objects such
as lifting weights or even playing a
game like pinball it was a fun concept
to reference back to Duke's massive ego
and making him better at surviving due
to how awesome he is just fits the style
perfectly alongside the campaign Duke
Nukem Forever also offers an online
multiplayer mode which consists of most
of the FPS standards like death match
king of the hill and the duke version of
capture the flag and titled capture the
babe in which teams compete not for
flags but for girls stationed at each
base who while being carried will try to
cover your eyes and you have to smack
them to make them stop the bad FPS
controls carry over and online making
some weapons all-out superior thanks to
a lesser necessity for aiming such as
the shotgun or rapid-fire weapons like
the freeze ray most of the people that
were really excited for the release of
duke nukem forever we're more excited
about the actual personality of duke
rather than the gameplay itself yet even
that doesn't come through as well this
time around while occasionally throwing
up references to pop culture into action
movies from the 90s sometimes it seems
as though the game is trying too hard to
be funny and will oftentimes provide
over-the-top characters that end up
being more annoying than actually
entertaining I admit I had a good laugh
here and there throughout the story but
what little made me laugh is not worth
playing the rest of the game to be
honest II got to the point where playing
the game almost felt like a chore and
the only thing that could be playing was
the fact that I wanted to make sure I
knew for sure that the game did not get
any better after the first hour the
strange thing about Duke Nukem Forever
is that while it did take 12 years to
make albeit it changed hands between
many developers several times it still
feels as though it was a big rush job at
the end I'm willing to forgive
out-of-date graphics for a game that's
taken this long to make especially since
it started back in the 90s however this
does not forgive the fact for bad
gameplay or even bad attempts at good
humor the other problem is the fact that
duke nukem itself was a perfect fit for
the 90s it was a parody of all those
major action movies ever coming out at
the time and for its time it was perfect
the style of comedy the way the game
worked it was very much a game for its
time being pushed back 12 years didn't
work in its favor the problem is that
wallet still tries to cling to these old
action movie jokes they also try to
attempt to do things about modern-day
humor and it just doesn't mix well at
all and really it just feels completely
out of place the game may be worth
picking up for those of you who really
just want to be hardcore fans and pick
up
game or just want to reminisce about the
old jokes from the first one but overall
the average gamer should not really be
interested in this at all and even if
you are really interested picking it up
I'd suggest waiting for a price drop or
something because it is just not worth
the full 60 bucks right now that's my
review of duke nukem forever in case you
guys didn't get a chance yesterday John
released a whole slew of videos and file
Cut Pro 10 for its release I also did a
first look at dungeon siege 3 if you
want to take a look at that until next
time I'm coming for TLD thanks for
watching
