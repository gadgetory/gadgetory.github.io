your overview of battlefield 3 for the
Xbox 360 ps3 and pc now first off I have
to open up this review with just a
little bit honesty FPS games are not my
forte it's not that I don't enjoy them
it's just that I've never been exactly
the most skilled with them and as a
general rule for myself the more
realistic a shooter tends to be the more
my skill level is going to plummet down
to the ground so I just wanna apologize
these are not going to be some of my
best gameplay shots but I do enjoy the
game and I'm gonna be able to give you
guys a good fair review on it now one of
the first things i want to talk about is
the graphics for the game which there
was some debate about after i put it my
first impressions of it for the xbox 360
version now i did install the HD pack
for the 360 and i will say that for a
console shooter the graphics are great
however people are noticing a large
difference between what is on console
and what is possible on pc honestly i'm
not surprised by this most people really
shouldn't be dice made no claim that
they were going to put any focus on
consoles pc was there originally
intended target audience and they made a
console version for us to be able to
play on so the graphics are great for a
console game is just that anyone who
watches gameplay or saw the previews for
the pc version you're going to notice a
difference now accompanying these
graphics are absolutely fantastic sound
effects the game places a very large
emphasis on the sound and doesn't really
use much in terms of background music
you'll hear bullets whizzing by you
people shooting the distance explosions
everywhere it really makes you feel like
you're right in the middle of a chaotic
war zone now the game does have a
campaign mode which at this point more
or less is an ancient relic for most
modern day PS games it's in there out of
a sort of Nod - yes we need to have this
to keep the game going but it's
definitely not the shining point of the
game the storyline for it is very basic
and cliche it's your standard go army
let's take down the evil terrorist plot
Michael Bay explosions pretty much it
not the best storytelling ever but it's
in the game and there is some
justification for playing through it by
completing campaign missions you do
unlock co-op missions that you can do
online which when completed will unlock
more weapons to use in multiplayer so
there is a reason to play through the
campaign it's just definitely not the
main reason why you purchased this now
of course the main focus of this game
and the main reason
most people will go out and buy it or
think of buying it is the multiplayer
multiplayer matches are divided into
three major types conquest which
involves capturing and holding territory
rush mode which works on two teams
fighting over objectives one stays in
the defense of protecting locations
while the other side is trying to
destroy them and move on to new areas
and standard deathmatch which is just
everybody kill as many people as you can
in these matches players armed able to
make use of four different classes
assault which works as a sort of
frontline medic engineers who can repair
vehicles and also come armed with good
anti vehicle weaponry like rocket
launchers support which you're able to
resupply their allies of that munition
and make use of explosives and recon you
can act as scouts that point out enemies
to their allies as well as be capable
snipers now as players compete in
multiplayer matches they do gain
experience for both individual classes
and for their overall rank when you
level up your whole rank you have locked
things like weapons to be used by all
classes special perks and appearance
options whereas when you level up your
class that unlocks specialized benefits
for that particular class such as a
weapon built for their play style or
special gadgets that they can make use
of now one of the first very noticeable
things that a lot of people see when
they start playing multiplayer is that
while the maps are a few a number to
begin with right now the sheer size of
each map is gargantuan one mode that
really helps to stress this particular
aspect of game is a rush where after
blowing a particular objective players
will then move on to a new objective
location to try and take down you'll be
traveling through each of the maps and
actually just get to see how large the
scaling really is that help players
coordinate in these large maps the game
makes use of what are known as squads
basically you're able to join small
four-man groups which will then be
highlighted to you so you know who your
particular squad mates are that way you
guys can stick together work on your own
tactics and you can even spawn nearby
your squad mates even if they're inside
of a vehicle so that way are always
nearby each other
now speaking of vehicles this is one of
the major signature aspects of the
battlefield series the game makes use of
both conventional land units like tanks
as well as air base units like
helicopters and jets for raining death
from the sky now I will say that while
the controls for land vehicles is fairly
simple it takes a little getting used to
air vehicles it's not that they're
impossible to control or anything like
that I mean it is possible to get really
crazy pro players going on in air units
it's just that it feels really wonky at
first and not very intuitive new players
will definitely have to
with air vehicles a few times before
they really get a decent grasp of how
they're supposed to control right
another aspect of multiplayer that was
done really well was the use of
destructible environments and really
forces teams to adjust their tactics
when you're inside say a closed building
but then all of a sudden a wall is just
completely blown down and there goes
some of your cover especially teams on
the defensive side really need to work
on where they position themselves
because as soon as certain walls or
buildings are gone there goes a lot of
your important cover you are using for
overall battlefield 3 is a great example
of fine-tuning a realistic shooter it
really forces players to work together
as teams in order to accomplish their
goals and then not just run around
wildly in a free-for-all you really do
need to be careful about how you pace
yourself in this game because if you're
just running around sprinting you're
doing it wrong you're just asking to get
headshot by the first person that sees
you if you're a fan of competitive
first-person shooters and this is
definitely one you're gonna want to look
into especially if you're a fan of the
use of vehicles as well as large sized
maps and team focused combat if you're a
bigger fan of the Mors free-for-all
smaller scale skirmish type tactics that
are more popular in games like Call of
Duty it may not be your flavor as much
but it's definitely one worth looking
into and at least trying out it's
definitely going to be interesting to
see what happens with modern warfare 3
gets released and we get to see a lot of
fan Wars start to erupt currently just
from what I've played of battlefield I'm
definitely loving this one more from
what I've seen for modern warfare 3 but
we're still going to check that one out
once it's released and give it its fair
shake in comparison to till then I'm
Kevin for TLD thanks for watching
