with TLD got another MacBook Pro
unboxing for you guys my brother
actually picked one of the new 13-inch
models up this is a 2.4 gigahertz
13-inch base model that comes with a 250
GB hard drive 4 gigs of RAM so it's
going to be pretty similar to the other
unboxings but obviously the MacBook Pro
is going to be smaller so let's go ahead
and open this up not much to this
unboxing if you guys have seen that one
before there's a tons of MacBook Pro
unboxings out there but I want you guys
know I now have access to an i5 and i7
and now the 13 inch Core 2 Duo so let's
go ahead and bring out the MacBook first
remember the i7 or the i-5 in this arm
take it out alright let's go ahead and
set that aside for just one second and
of course we have the Apple nice a power
adapter and the extension and right here
is all your documentation so that's it
besides that go and open this up and we
have the usual everything maxims if
you're brand new to a Mac it's going to
let you know all the ins and the outs
it'll cover it anything from changing
the memory to the basic like I said they
include a cloth to clean all your grimy
fingerprints off there and then
everything else with that what's
included in there is you get a couple
max stickers the warranty agreement and
then your install this so if you're
ready to restore it or reinstall this is
what your going to go to other than that
let's go ahead and hit the MacBook back
up here so like I said this is a 13-inch
model it is a pretty much the same as
far as the 50 inch model goes as far as
all the ins and the outs here's a power
adapter connector the Ethernet firewire
800 mini DisplayPort 2 USBS SD card and
the only thing different actually is you
only have headphones so on the MacBook
probably have in and out there's only a
headphone so no input there
other than that you have a super disk
right here for your DVDs for your CDs
now just about does it open it up take a
look at the keyboard the plot the graph
off and this doesn't have the same
backlit display on the keyboard as well
so let's get you guys one more look at
it and go ahead and stay tuned for
everything on this I'll have a review
benchmarks between the i-5 and the i7
and this should be some fun so hopefully
you guys enjoy this video I'll catch you
guys later and feel free to subscribe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
