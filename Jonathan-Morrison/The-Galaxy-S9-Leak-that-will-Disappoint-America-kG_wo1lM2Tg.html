league that will disappoint America
you guys Johnson here that's a title of
a headline I am not even kidding as many
of you know the galaxy s 9 it's getting
closer and closer and with that we are
starting to see more and more leaks but
what have been more interesting or at
the very least more entertaining for me
it's not the leagues themselves but the
headlines surrounding them without a
pick a few my favorite the first of
which has got to be Samsung
disappointing America like can you
imagine Samsung up at the keynote doing
their thing this is the brand new Galaxy
S 9 that America is like now I'm good or
could you imagine Donald Trump on some
Twitter rants about the Galaxy S nine I
could picture that tweet in all caps
disappoint some over us which was fake
news but the rumors were true
America is disappointed so that has me
curious what exactly about the Galaxy S
9 it's going to disappoint America
specifically and as we jump into the
article not but two words in we are
smacked in the face with the typo one
more once more the world turns to the
FCC certification team to find out about
an unruly smartphone today it's the u.s.
variant of Samsung's upcoming Android
flagships the galaxy s 9 and Galaxy S 9
plus models The Listening confirms the
differences seen in previous galaxy
machines we'll continue with the s9
family so one paragraph in and not the
slightest hint or clue at what might
disappoint America you would think maybe
the second or third paragraph of tell us
and nope it essentially goes on and tell
us at the International Galaxy S 9 will
feature an X and O's processor while the
US version will feature a Snapdragon
processor in this case t Snapdragon 845
where's the juicy hook comes in though
is that fourth paragraph what the FCC
doesn't tell us in this release is any
more details over the rear camera the
assumption is that the s9 is getting the
single lens and the s9 plus a dual lens
camera
neither Canon answer the question over
the availability or the otherwise of the
leaked super slow-mo video which offers
4k video at 120 frames per second that
is currently reliant on the code inside
the Exynos 9 series 90 810 chipset will
the u.s. chips that be able to offer the
same feature and that essentially is the
entire article in one I don't think
super slow motion video or lack thereof
is going to single-handedly disappoint
America into like five more minutes of
research would have showed you that the
Snapdragon a 45 will actually support
slow-motion video at 720p up to 480
frames per second which is amazing
so here's the aftermath of the egg
sho'nuff 480 fps shout-out to rich for
that very accurate throw only one egg
was harmed in the making of this video
sorry people so next article first off a
little bit of a lazy title Samsung leek
delivers galaxy s 9 bad news second off
there's so much negativity like they are
banking off that guy who's excited for
the Galaxy S nine to see that headline
and then click through to see why he's
gonna hate his life over a smartphone
there's more because well there's always
more on Sunday almost every galaxy s
nine feature was leaked and it left us
with only two pieces of missing
information the battery size and the
release date the second paragraph is
kind of amazing because it essentially
says the good news out of the situation
is you're not gonna have to wait long to
be disappointed from there in a nutshell
goes on to say that pretty much we've
known for a while the Galaxy S line is
going to be underwhelming and the final
punch to the face of disappointment is
battery capacity the galaxy s 9 based
off those leaks is slated to have a
3,000 million power battery whereas the
galaxy s 9 plus slightly higher at 3500
but neither of those are really
disappointing
yeah I'm sure like most of you out there
I also would have loved to have seen a
higher number maybe 3,500 on the galaxy
s 9 4000 on the s 9 plus but again one
big thing to remember is with that
snapdragon 845 that's supposed to be up
to 30% more efficient which in turn will
lead to better battery life so really I
just wanted to focus on positivity as
opposed to negativity especially in text
or whatever reason the media is
programmed to feed and pray off scaring
people about tech but there's a lot to
look forward to still even with the
galaxy s 9 so what has me excited for
the Galaxy S 9 aside from that
Snapdragon e 45 performance improvements
non disappointing slow motion has got to
be one stereo speakers these are
allegedly gonna be tuned by AKG and
really that's a marketing term but
nonetheless having stereo speakers on a
smartphone is a beautiful thing and I'm
excited to get that on the galaxy s 9
especially with the fact that they have
such a beautiful display with basically
no bezels to it looks like they fixed
the awkward location of the fingerprint
reader on the galaxy s 9 on the galaxy s
8 it was in this slightly awkward place
where you never really felt comfortable
with an intern made you not want to use
it with the galaxy s 9 allegedly it's in
a much nicer location underneath the
camera lens so for me that's actually a
big deal so based off that leak that
kind of confirms that Samsung is still
opting to go with the fingerprint reader
mein former security yep you will be
able to unlock your phone with your face
but it's not gonna be full-fledged like
Apple has gone with face ID now I talked
about before it would be amazing to get
a fingerprint reader built into the
screen especially with how beautiful the
Galaxy s8 was and potentially the galaxy
s 9 will be we in fact actually saw that
technology at CES this year Bebo had a
smartphone with the fingerprint reader
built into the display looked amazing
but unfortunately seem to be not quite
ready for primetime yet it's a little
slow a little gimmicky so would not
expect that on the galaxy s 9 or s 9
plus now what also has me excited for
the galaxy s 9 is the alleged variable
aperture which will switch automatically
from F 2.4 to F 1 point 5 so what that
does is when you're switching to F 1.5
that lets more light into the land so
it's gonna help with low-light photos
and also that's gonna give you that
beautiful blurred out background now
this is not an apples to apples
comparison and yes a smartphone sensor
is much different than something like
this camera you're looking at here but
here's a shot at F 2.4 I purposely
underexposed it and then moving that to
1.4 you can see how much more light we
have so it's cool that tech is that is
gonna be built into these single lens of
the galaxy s 9 of the galaxy s 9 plus
that will allegedly have two lenses that
kind of gets confusing in terms of why I
think the S Plus and the note series is
a little bit weird but that is a
different discussion for a different day
either way though you can see there's a
lot to look forward to with the galaxy s
9 and s 9 plus maybe if you're an s8 or
sa plus under not so much but I am
excited to check this out
if you guys see any more ridiculous tech
headline articles out there let me know
with a comment down below hopefully
enjoyed this video if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to go disappoint in America on that like
button this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
