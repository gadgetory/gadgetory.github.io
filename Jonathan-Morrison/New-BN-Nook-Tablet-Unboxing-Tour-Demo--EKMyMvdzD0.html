a quick unboxing tour and demo of the
all-new nook tablet from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
and it has been tablet crazy this week
if only had a buck for every tablet I
picked up actually I'd only have two
books so scratch that now if I strictly
did the unboxing this video would be
about 30 seconds long as pretty
bare-bones you get the nook itself you
get a USB wall charger which is pretty
cool looking and then you get a Nuke
branded USB cable so I do add some
flavor to that quickly looking at the
nook tablet itself 7-inch display 1024 x
600 resolution this is running a
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor with a
full gig of ram compared to the 512 megs
on both the ipad 2 as well as the kindle
fire now i will say it has one of the
most epic unlock screen sounds you will
ever see and quickly before we get into
the OS we got a physical power button
we've got the headphone jack we got a
volume up and down which the kindle fire
does not have flipping it down to the
back we got the speaker and below that
is the USB port so far I'm digging the
physical nut button once you press that
that'll take you to the home library
shop search apps web and settings and
then above that for the normal layout
way of books newsstand movies music and
apps so far everything feels extremely
zippy and I'm not not going to kindle
fire but this does feel a little
smoother so far you can see if you're
looking at a quick magazine trial the
screen looks good scrolling through
pages left and right like butter and so
far so good on that jump it over to
Netflix you guys can get idea of how the
video quality looks and if you guys have
not to watch breaking bad stop what
you're doing will actually don't stop
watching this video but after you're
done go check that out because it is
amazing and the last thing we're going
to look at is angry birds for the Nook
Tablet so you guys can see it runs
extremely smooth this will actually give
you idea of how well the speaker's work
which are pretty loud and i got to say
so far just my first impressions i am
enjoying this more than the kindle fire
i will be testing both out extensively
to look out for both of yous and a
comparison aside from that make sure to
check out our latest two videos if you
guys are feeling like being awesome hit
that like button feel free to subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
