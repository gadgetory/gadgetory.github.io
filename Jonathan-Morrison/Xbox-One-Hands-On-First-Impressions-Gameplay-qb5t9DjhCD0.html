e3's been over for a couple of days now
and i've been collecting my thoughts
regarding what we saw at both the press
conferences and what i got to personally
try out on the show floor and i figured
we'd start off by getting one of the
most controversial ones right out of the
way microsoft's xbox one now to say that
the xbox one has not had the most
favorable response from the internet
overall is a bit of an understatement
all gamers around the world that's
gather around and let's until Microsoft
do you cook a piece of fish let's come
up and while they don't want to rent too
long on what many of you already know I
do just want to summarize three of the
biggest concerns people have for those
of you that don't first off even if you
purchase a game physically you're still
limited to it the same way a digital
game would meaning that you're limited
only using it on one xbox live account
what this means is that once you buy a
game you can't give it to a friend sell
it yourself or do anything of the sort
outside of trading it into pre-approved
retailers by Microsoft second off the
system requires you to check in once
every 24 hours to the internet in order
to keep playing your games offline or
once every hour if you're not on your
own console now if you live in one of
the 21 supported countries this really
isn't that big of an issue unless you
move around a lot or if you live
somewhere else I want to have a system
imported in which case the system
basically serves as a
five-hundred-dollar paperweight now last
but not least is the fact the system
must be bundled with Kinect that must be
plugged in for the system to operate and
has the optional feature of always being
in standby mode meaning that the camera
and mic are both always actively
listening for certain command words now
almost fears related to the fact that
you haven't always on camera in your
living room are somewhat conspiracy
theory related it's not that hard to
imagine in this day and age and is
definitely something for a lot of people
to feel awkward about having in their
living room now most of these measures
are related to the fact that Microsoft
is trying to find some kind of middle
ground between going pure digital or
physical media and what we've really
ended up with is a system that is
basically all of the drawbacks of having
digital products without any of the
benefits of physical outside of owning a
box to look at now with those issues out
of the way let's talk about some of the
things that we actually saw at e3 and
some of the things that might actually
somewhat redeem the system from what
we've seen so far and the biggest
strengths currently our console
exclusive titles now while a number of
multi-platform titles were shown at both
our floor show and press conference the
actual exclusive titles that were really
enticing included games like dead rising
3 Forza 5 rise son of Rome a new halo
project with a yet to be confirmed
titanfall a new world building game
called project spark and the most
pleasantly surprising to me killer
instinct which I actually got a chance
to play on the floor just a little bit
and is just as button mashi as ever now
what a lot of these titles really got to
show off to us is how cinematic a lot of
games are going to be on the next gen
particularly games like ride son of Rome
which had a lot of combat it looked like
something out of a full cinematic
cutscene in older games or Forza 5 would
show just how photorealistic a lot of
the cars can be now personally the ones
that I'm most excited for so far include
dead rising 3 which is making the move
from being just inside of a mall to a
full city which if done properly with
the right implications could be simply
amazing and well not the biggest fan of
first-person shooters my love of robots
has got me really intrigued by titanfall
I'm also just a little curious about
project spark although I really want a
little more info in terms of what you
can actually do for world building and
how you can explore through it before i
get to fully into it now one last thing
i wanted to touch on that i did get a
chance to try personally was the new
xbox one controller which does look very
similar to the original one albeit the
overall shaping is a bit different first
off they've gotten rid of that really
annoying webbing on the d-pad which
makes it a lot easier to use also the
triggers are a little more shallow but
still deep enough to give you a
satisfying trigger pull for first-person
shooters now one change I really did
like was then moving away from having
one single Rumble feature that makes the
whole controller shake like a madman to
having four separate parts the
controller that shake based on what's
happening in the game so for instance if
you're playing a shooter and get shot on
the right side only the right side of
the controller will shake it's also not
nearly as abrasive so it feels a lot
more comfortable when you're in a game
and it's just giving you little impulses
to let you know what's going on in terms
of the overall shape of the controller
it's very similar to the old one
although it does have slightly thinner
grips which actually felt more
comfortable for me once I got used to it
now one of the things I did not like
about a controller is that overall feels
a lot lighter to me I feel as though it
doesn't have as much depth as older
controllers and if I were to throw it it
wouldn't take nearly a solid of an
impact although this isn't exactly
something i could have tested on the
show floor overall while the xbox one
has done quite a bit in terms of
publicity to anger a lot of gamers i
will say that what they showed
specifically at e3 was a step forward
and was really happy to see a press
conference that didn't just have kinect
titles and random dance performances in
the middle of it now microsoft still has
a long way to go to repair the image
they've built up for the console so far
and the best thing they can do to help
it at launch estab as many strong
console exclusive titles as they can and
what we saw at e3 was a decent start now
we
need to see what they still have in
store well that was just my response to
what I saw it from Microsoft this year
at e3 make sure to keep an eye out for
more videos coming from me on my
thoughts from other things including
Sony Nintendo and my overall thoughts
for the battle between the ps4 and the
xbox one as always guys thank you so
