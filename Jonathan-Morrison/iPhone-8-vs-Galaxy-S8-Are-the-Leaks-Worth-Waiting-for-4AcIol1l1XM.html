wireless charging will be amazing yo
guys Jonathan here without a doubt the
Galaxy s8 is one of if not the best
smartphones out right now it's put in a
ton of pressure on Apple for the next
iPhone release and that poses the
question is the iPhone eight worth
waiting for what motors should Apple
launch next should it be the iphone 7s
iphone 7 s plus and the iPhone 8 or the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so while
we don't officially know Apple can we
call in the next iPhone I think they
pretty much need to go with the iPhone 8
and 8 plus and that really comes down to
the galaxy s 8 the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
were unique in the sense that they
pretty much shared the exact same design
of the iPhone 6 and 6s and for me when
it comes down to I think if Apple were
to release the iPhone 7s and 7s plus
they're automatically be this mental
connection at these seven would be
inferior to the eight of the galaxy s 8
I don't think Apple would want to go
that route Daejeon woke up just now and
saw your Instagram story wanted to ask
which has got a better fingerprint
sensor positioning is it the iPhone 8
leaks or this absent Galaxy S II so that
is a very interesting question my friend
I want to preface by saying I really
really really really really like the
Galaxy S a is an amazing phone with
amazing features but the fingerprint
reader location is not one of them now
with that but what makes us interesting
is for the first time in a really long
time we are actually playing the
guessing game
I guess because this will be the 10th
anniversary of the iPhone allegedly
Apple's testing like 10 different models
which is crazy
that leaves us in the dark which I like
but the end result is two possibilities
as far as touch ID goes the first
location which would be ideal if
applicable this off would be underneath
the displays very similar to what
Samsung deal with their infinity display
in their virtual home button it would
just take it one step further with the
fingerprint reader on the front of the
phone not fortunate Apple to move it
towards the back that though does not
seem to be an easy task at all Samsung
could not pull it off the galaxy s 8 and
reportedly Apple is having a ton of
problems implementing this on their own
with the iPhone 8 if that's the case is
going to force them to place on their
second option on the back of the phone
right below the Apple logo now either
way based off those rumors I think
a colonnade is going to have the better
location as far as the fingerprint
reader goes and it honestly comes down
to almost a case of winning by default
because the placement on the galaxy s 8
is so bad unless Apple completely match
that and copied that they will
inherently have a better location but
with that said if Apple does go the back
route I'm going to say the LG G 6 has a
better spot in both these phones hey
Jonathan my name is Nathan from Jakarta
in Asia and here's my question for you
what is your favorite feature on the GS
8 because I see a shape that augusta's
in half that is pretty much a no-brainer
hands-down my favorite feature would be
big
I'm serious note though what I think is
really cool and sometimes a little
overlook of the Galaxy s8 is Bluetooth
5.0 and it's not aware what that allows
for is for the Galaxy s8 to send two
separate Bluetooth streams to two
separate devices we can then control
them separately and independently hi
John the son hope you're doing well what
would you like to see in the next time
shut up to your baby I think he might be
hungry but as far as what I would like
to see on the next iPhone I think I'm
going to reiterate how cool would be if
Apple could successfully implement touch
ID underneath the screen I would have
loved to see Samsung do that with the
galaxy s 8 so if Apple could do that
with the iPhone 8 it would be amazing
now beyond that something that maybe is
an iPhone 8 feature specific but rather
a chess move that Apple could do for
Samsung including higher and head phones
with the Galaxy s8 would be to include
air pods with the iPhone 8 and a plus is
that going to happen more than likely
not because Apple's got to make those
margins but I think that would be a huge
selling point and a really attractive
feature of the iPhone 8 and 8 plus hey
man this guy wants to know if I like
sunsets you see that yeah hi so I'm just
wondering what do you think Google's
doing right now to compete with the
latest phones on the market like the
iPhone 7 and of course the galaxy a8 so
I just want to know that so switching
gears for a second from the galaxy s 8
and iPhone 8 as far as what Google is
doing to compete with Apple and Samsung
honestly I think the release of the
pixel and pixel XL was there move into
the game sure it was missing premium
features like wireless charging water
resistance but they made a huge impact
with their camera as many of you know
the galaxy estate has a phenomenal
camera but I'm willing to bet there are
plenty of pixel owners out there that
would put their camera up against the
Galaxy s8 any day of the week and there
is a reason why so back about the fact
it is a pure Google phone with a pure
Google experience has kept people
satisfied and so much in fact they
haven't felt the need to jump over to
the Galaxy at eight how do you feel
about the wireless charging on the
upcoming iPhone so for real talking
about wireless charging and I've talked
about this before if Apple does
implement wireless charging which I
think they very well might with the next
iPhone they're going to have to do it
right what I mean by that is taking
wireless charging up enough because if
we're being honest you know is we'll
have I do wireless charging right now is
not that cool he's filling the dock or
pad which is then connected to a wire
and then you need to perfectly place
your phone on that dock or pad or if you
don't you might not charge your phone
what would be amazing is Apple could
implement a charging radius where let's
say you place your phone maybe in a five
foot vicinity anywhere on there but it
is still getting the charge that way
maybe say you're going to bed in your
whole nightstand becomes that charging
zone instead of fiddling a messing
around with place and it perfectly you
just toss it on there anywhere and you
are getting a charge through the night
yo what's up Jonathan it essentially Pro
on YouTube and I was just wondering how
much of video games do you think the
iPhone able to be getting especially
with the leaked rumor of the flip the
vertical lenses so thanks now as far as
those video games which you can get a su
of peril calm right now
up you haven't seen there's a rumor of
apples switching the orientation of
those dual cameras from horizontal to
portrait now the reason behind that
switch actually has more to do with what
apples could potentially do with augment
of reality as opposed to an improvement
in video and picture quality what I
would like to see however as far as
improvements go is a better secondary
lens right now portrait but on the 7
plus is awesome having the ability to
switch between two focal lengths is cool
but when you do that you definitely
notice a quality difference between the
two lenses what it comes down to is the
secondary lens on the iPhone 7 plus
simply isn't as good as the primary in
terms of low-light that has an f-stop of
1.8 whereas the secondary lens has an
f-stop of two-point it's sort of a huge
difference as far as light goes with
that being said though if Apple can
match those two on the next iPhone so
there isn't a huge difference witching
back and forth that would be awesome
besides that thank you guys very much
for watching if you want a chance to be
featured in a video just like this hit
me up on Instagram and keep an eye out
for the next QA also if you want to see
how the current iPhone stacks up against
the Galaxy s8 check out this video here
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later I hate the Big C button man I
just want to change the volume and hit
