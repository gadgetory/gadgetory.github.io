I actually think it's not going to be
too crazy in terms of actual physical
heart where there's no way we're seeing
the iphone 6 we're not going to see the
Iowa we're not going to see the Apple TV
maybe we might see some new mac minis
because it's been so long since they
updated those I would absolutely love
travel to finally release a fork a
thunderbolt display that would
absolutely make my whole month but I
think the primary focus is going to be
on iOS 8 and a next iteration of OS 10
hey guys john here with TLD hope you
guys are doing well and i am back
kicking off a new QA style series of
videos that we're gonna call ask tlv
because that seems to make most sense
now I've been meaning to get around to a
video like this for a long long time and
the funny thing is while putting this
together actually remembered about three
years ago exactly back when I was pretty
much new to YouTube I actually got
together and asked TLD video got all the
questions as a matter of fact I still
have the document in my dropbox so if
you happen to see your name right now
and you're still an active watcher and
subscriber that hats off to you because
you are one of the most awesome people
on the planet regardless though three
years later we're here or answering
questions and if you want to get in on
the action and ask me anything shoot me
reply on twitter at tldtoday using the
hashtag stld and it might be answered in
a video like this one now real quickly
before I jump into the bulk of the
questions I quickly want to answer this
because with WWDC beam tomorrow I've
been getting tons of questions asking me
Jonathan where can i watch it how can I
stay updated so the official date is
June second 2014 and it will kick off
live at ten a.m. pacific standard time
so that's California time my time 12pm
central or one o'clock eastern and if
you're anywhere else in the world i will
have those linked down below now the
good news is Apple will be live
streaming it so we can watch it follow
along if you happen to be at work or
school or something and you can't watch
it live I will be watching it myself and
tweeting updates if you guys want to
stay filled in on that information make
sure to follow me on twitter at tldtoday
so with that said let's going to kick
off the first episode of ask TLD what
are your thoughts on the LG g3 think
that pretty much sums it up it is a
beastly looking phone and that display I
dig what they're doing with the software
and keep it at minimal
yeah you guys can expect coverage on
that as soon as I can get my hands on
one what is your typical day when you
are working on a review besides the
Bulls games and picking up girls so
first off I'm actually happily engaged
as of last December and I couldn't ask
for a more caring supportive or just
awesome person in my life and I don't
think I would be where I'm at today
without her so ya know picking up girls
for me now on the flip side of that
question I think what you're trying to
ask is what do i do when i'm not making
videos and besides actually watching
basketball i love playing basketball
that's actually a really cool bond that
my brother and i share we got to play in
a league this year and I could literally
play for hours on him because I just
love playing basketball on top of that
is being at the gym spending time with
family and I really really lately got a
passion for eating for health that is
something that fascinates me to know and
then I get super geeked out over the
concept of what we put in our body and
how it affects us so whether i can
improve myself or help someone out that
is something that I really enjoy outside
of actual tech videos what video gear do
you use as of right now I am shooting on
the Panasonic gh4 so thumbs up for 4k
quality and as far as my microphone goes
but you guys cannot see in the image i'm
using a sennheiser MK h 4 16 which is an
absolute killer microphone so just as an
example this is what the gh4 onboard mic
sounds like and it's crap and we are
back to the MK h 4 16 word sounds
amazing do you have the no sleep team
band as a matter of fact I do so ty
thank you brother for sending me one out
and actually right now as of recording
this video it is just before 3 a.m. in
the morning so that bracelet definitely
applies what do you think about mkbhd I
think marques is an awesome human being
he's got a super hard work ethic but I
think I respect most about him he's an
awesome friend super humble and from
watching him way back when when he was
literally little kid and how far he's
come and grown and earned all of that is
just awesome when did you get your first
phone and what was it so I'm not sure
the exact year but my first smartphone
was the moto q now my favorite memory of
that phone because it's funny now it
wasn't at the time but I remember the
first day I got it and I was so just
geeked out and jazzed up that I can
actually browse the internet on my phone
we happened to be going in the store
with my then girlfriend now fiance she
went into the fitting room to try on
some
clothes I was just literally on my phone
looking at ESPN one of the employees of
course here's a female came up and
started asking me questions by then
girlfriend now fiance walks out I got my
phone out she's talking to me and it
just doesn't look good needless to say i
got the silent treatment for the entire
rest of the night so I was not happy
then but it's a pretty funny story
looking back on it obviously years later
we're here we're engaged everything is
good if money wasn't an issue what will
be your dream setup or gear so since for
the topic of money not being an issue
I'm gonna actually take that one step
further of reality not be an issue
because my dream setup does not exist
yet as much as I love the gh4 absolutely
love the c100 the problem is that caps
out at 1080p and I'm not ready to drop
the cash on c500 so for me AC 204 k
recording that would be my ideal camera
setup so canon make it happen captain
what do you expect from the HTC One
Prime so what we were expecting is a
possible 5.5 inch display with a 1440p
resolution but unfortunately it looks
like all plans for that Prime have been
canceled at this point so sad face
top.jpg heat or spurs and in how many
games now of course me being in Bulls
fans it is in my blood to root against
the heat but I gotta say they were
definitely the most dominant team in the
playoffs this year the Spurs look really
good there were times when they looked
unbeatable but I think at points they
definitely showed their age so I'm a
little bit worried for the Spurs but I'm
gonna make a bold prediction and say
Spurs in six which courier service are
you using to send me my voigtlander lens
that happen in Dave what will be your
favorite video game console or video
game of all time I don't know if I could
narrow it down to one console or one
game with the one that brings me the
most nostalgia I would have to say is
the Sega Genesis I grew up on sonic lion
king toy story Battletoads you name it
that was my childhood what made you
start making YouTube videos I've always
been into technology and I remember
being into music production before video
and with that I remember getting my
first mac and falling in love with it
from there I ended up watching guys like
soldierknowsbest and john for lakers on
youtube back when they only had like ten
fifteen thousand subscribers and that
inspired me and said you know what i
think i can try making something like
that and look now here we are how did
become a Bulls fan if you're from LA and
this actually goes back to when I was a
kid I was probably four or five and I
always loved basketball I remember being
like two or three years old watching my
dad shoot a basket me trying to emulate
that so when I was maybe like four or
five they ended up getting me a Michael
Jordan Jersey and from there I was
instantly hooked and watching them ever
since i am now 27 and still a die-hard
Bulls fan is a macbook air good for
video editing for example editing and
uploading to youtube so that's kind of a
mixed bag I think the macbook air is a
very capable machine and can handle
things like 1080p no problem so if
you're just doing basic edits and 1080
and things like that then it makes a
fantastic option however if you do plan
on shooting anything like 4k on
something like the gh4 like I'm shooting
on now there is no way that little
macbook air is going to handle that so
again for 1080p and basic stuff like
that yes for anything higher than that
or more advanced stuff like after
effects I will definitely recommend
check it out a quad core macbook pro or
even an imac I'm from the deep what is
your excuse for being a Lions fan so I
know my sports teams are completely all
over the map and off the radar but as
far as the Lions go my dad was actually
a huge Detroit fan so Pistons Red Wings
Tigers and the Lions and I ended up
watching a game with him when I was
probably about seven years old and from
there we watched lying games every
single Sunday it kind of just became a
tradition and I became a Lions fan so I
think that about wraps it up it is
getting late I think I need some sleep
now but hopefully you guys enjoyed the
video if you did and you want to see
future videos like this definitely let
me know by hitting that like button it
is much appreciated again if you have a
question and you want to see an answer
on a video like this one just hit me up
on Twitter at tldtoday using the hashtag
ass TLD and I might answer it aside from
that if you guys missed it last night I
posted an iphone 6 vs galaxy s5
everything we know so far video so
you've been kind of on the ropes and
you're not sure if it's worth waiting
for the iphone 6 definitely checked it
out i think it'll help you out I've link
right here and also linked it down below
aside for that I'm going to get some
sleep and i will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
