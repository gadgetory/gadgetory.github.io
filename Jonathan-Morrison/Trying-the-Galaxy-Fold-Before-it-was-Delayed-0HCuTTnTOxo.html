- So the Galaxy Fold
is officially delayed,
but before Samsung pulled it,
I got a chance to check one out.
(fast-paced music)
Now if you've been following
the Galaxy Fold fiasco,
it's been a little bit of a rollercoaster.
First, you had review units go out.
Things were magic and rainbows
and unicorns and puppies
and &quot;Oh my God.
&quot;This thing was the amazing feature
&quot;that we never knew we needed.&quot;
And then, things took an ugly turn.
Got real dark, real quick.
And devices were just breakin'
and bustin' left and right.
On one hand, you had an incident
where the Galaxy Fold has
this very thin protective,
almost screen protector-like layer on it
that you weren't supposed to remove.
And honestly after messing
with the Galaxy Fold,
I wouldn't say my first reaction
would be to pull this off,
but if you get any dust
or if you look at this thing
in bright, direct sunlight,
I can see where it would
look like a screen protector.
With that you then had a group of people
who were dramatically jumping
to defend the Galaxy Fold screen,
&quot;User error.
&quot;That's your fault dumb[Bleep].
&quot;You break your device,
&quot;you can eat your $2,000 and like it.&quot;
But really though,
if something that fragile
can potentially brick a $2,000 device,
you might need to rethink things.
Now on the flip side of things,
there were a couple cases
where that protective layer wasn't removed
and the Galaxy Fold still
ended up like Linguo.
- Dead.
- You then of course
had that dramatic group
defending that saying,
&quot;What are you freaking out about?
&quot;It's only four devices.&quot;
But you gotta think about it.
There was like a total of 12 out there.
So if your dentist was like,
&quot;Yo, don't worry about it.
&quot;Only four out of my
12 root canals go bad.&quot;
You would be a little worried.
So regardless, it's nice to
see Samsung take a step back
and hopefully fix this.
Because regardless of
whether you weren't supposed
to take that screen protector off,
again the fact that
something so small and simple
could potentially destroy a device
could have been disastrous
if this got into consumers' hands.
So problems and delays aside,
actually getting to use a Galaxy Fold,
I could see where there's
a huge potential future
with this because honestly
Samsung is kinda lookin'
at this as a phone first
that then turns into a tablet.
But I kinda feel like
it's the other way around
where it's a tablet that then folds
and can fit in your pocket
that can also act as a phone.
Seriously the biggest benefit of this
is having this much screen real estate
that you can then fit in your pocket.
Like imagine doing that with an iPad mini;
it would not work out so well.
(smooth music)
The main reason why I feel
like it's not a phone first
is that front screen when it's folded up
leaves a lot to be desired.
On one hand, there is some positive
where I get this one-handed, old school,
smaller smartphone vibe
whether it's the Galaxy S4 or the Nexus 4.
So I can kinda see that merit
and honestly imagine
if you had like the iPhone SE form factor.
Something that flipped open, transformed,
and then gave you tablet-like size,
that would be amazing.
And this is,
until you realize how
much screen real estate
is left at the top and the bottom
and that feels like they're
definitely wasting some of that.
Again I get it.
It's a genuine product from the fact
that we have self-driving cars
and a tablet you can
bend and flip and fold
and put it in your pocket is amazing.
So if they can take better advantage
of that screen real estate,
it's going to be incredible.
As far as the crease goes,
I'm not gonna lie and say it's
some magic, wizard sorcery
to where you just don't see it,
it's invisible,
&quot;Oh my God. It's amazing!&quot;
It is definitely there.
You notice is, but it
doesn't bother me at all.
I also love the fact that you're getting
all the major features from
something like the Galaxy S10.
Wireless power share.
USBC.
Although, they did remove
the headphone jack.
You have a giant battery pack inside.
Well over 4,000 milliamp hours
and really great cameras.
I will ask the question though,
is this too far or what is the line
for where it's acceptable
to take pictures with this,
especially in tablet mode?
Like is that gonna make taking
pictures with iPads okay?
I don't know yet, but either way
having a view finder that big,
that nice is awesome.
One really clever design
that I appreciated
with the Galaxy Fold is
that it doesn't matter
whether you're folded up
or in full on tablet mode,
you're going to get stereo audio
which is a really nice touch.
Reading and watching videos is hands-down
the most enjoyable thing
with the Galaxy Fold.
And again, the fact that
you can fold this up
and fit it in your pants,
that makes it feel like it's
straight out the future.
Like imagine trying to fit an iPad mini
in your gym shorts.
That's not gonna work.
With this, you just fold it up,
pack it in there,
whip it out.
That's gettin' weird.
Get on the treadmill.
Bust out a solid 60
and have a beautiful viewing experience.
Sign me up for that please.
Maps also look amazing.
And the fact that you have
that kind of screen real estate,
multi-tasking is also a
beautiful, beautiful thing.
The one thing that I will say
might come at a question
with this is longevity.
Like how will it last
and perform over time
assuming Samsung fixes
these initial problems?
Like how is this gonna hold
up after like six months?
So I'm curious to see:
one, if Samsung can fix this issue.
Then also, they can get
it back out the gate,
how this thing will hold up over time.
Now I've only spent about
a day with the Galaxy Fold
and I was curious to
hear thoughts on someone
who spent a week with it.
The one, the only, Jon Rettinger.
- I dig the Fold.
I've been using it for a week.
I think it gives you multiple
form factors in one device.
The Fold itself is inherently flawed.
What it represents as
the future of mobile,
changing shapes,
I'm totally for.
If Samsung would have
just called this phone
like the Galaxy Fold developer's edition,
they would of avoided I
think 100% of the drama
that came along with this.
People would have known
that it's not for everybody.
It's a beta device that
you can buy and try.
But making it an actual product,
and then a super expensive product,
and then have it break and peel.
It was a bad PR move.
- So there you go.
Thoughts from two Johns.
A lot of respect.
Make sure you guys drop
a like for the GOAT,
the old school Jon4Lakers.
I will drop a link to
his coverage down below.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
This is Jonathan,
and I will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
