lunch and dinner here bringing you our
full review of LA noire for the xbox 360
and ps3 now regrettably this time around
we're not going to be showing you any
actual gameplay the reason for that
being is that we saw a lot of other
youtuber viewers putting up videos
showing LA noire that ended up getting
taken down now we do believe that for a
review showing gameplay is fair use
however we decided it was better to play
safe than sorry this time around so
instead i'm going to give you guys a
quick synopsis of what i thought of the
game and then we're going to link you to
our tumblr account where you can read
the full review if you'd like LA noir is
a fantastic game with a much greater
emphasis on narrative than most games
today which are usually about guns and
explosions the game does a great job of
depicting 1940s LA and rock stars new
motion capture technology has some of
the best facial animations we've ever
seen in a video game in fact while
playing the game you'll often times
recognize actors from different
television shows or secondary roles and
movies and to be honest and sometimes
downright freaky how real it looks you
can sometimes forget you're almost
playing a game during the long cutscenes
now all the core gameplay is a lot of
fun including investigating crime scenes
interrogating witnesses the game is not
without its flaws a lot of fans of
rockstars other games like Grand Theft
Auto and red dead redemption are really
used to having a strong free room
mechanic which usually involving to just
shooting randomly in crowds to cause
havoc and have a lot of fun this time
around in LA noir because you are
policemen you're not really allowed to
do a lot of those things anymore there
is free roam but you can't really do
much other than find hidden cars except
side missions which should only take
about five minutes since just a single
thing like one gun fight or one chase
scene there's really not a lot going on
outside of the game's core storyline not
only that but while the core storyline
is still really enjoyable and very
engrossing it's also very easy the game
immediately tells you when you pick a
wrong answer for someone and you're
allowed to quit and re-enter just to try
again you're given a little tone
whenever you find all the clues in an
area and you can even ask the online
community for the correct answer in a
situation and in fact it's even possible
skip action situations such as chase
scenes or gunfights if you lose often
enough if you've died enough times in a
row the game actually gives you the
option to skip ahead and go to just the
next narrative scene now these problems
aside the game being a little easy and
not much free roam the core game is
still excellent really awesome game very
engrossing I really
commended to anyone who likes narrative
in video games now that's just sort of
the short version of my review if you
guys want we do have on our tumblr the
full version so you can check it out
read more reasons why the game can be
considered a little easy or why the
narratives really strong I'd really
recommend checking that out and if you
haven't gotten the chance yet check out
our two latest videos I'm Kevin for TLD
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
