now for those you that normally watch us
know that I normally review console
games only however app games are
something that we've been looking into
getting into and there's been a recent
example that I've been playing non-stop
the past couple of days since it came
out on Thursday nimble quest now this is
a great example of taking a classic cell
phone time killer kind of game in this
case snake and revitalizing it with some
RPG mechanics to make it have some more
long-term interesting goals aside from
just trying to get the highest score
possible the basic idea is that you have
a marching party of Heroes that are
constantly running around in attacking
enemies near them and while you can die
from losing too much health you can also
instantly get a game over by having the
party leader directly collide with an
enemy or wall just like in snake each
hero has their own attack style with
some similar but offering differences
like a range and attack speed and as you
get farther in the game you unlock up to
15 different ones to form your conga
line of death and destruction as you
kill enemies that can drop power-ups for
short-term benefits like increased
attack speed or instant use effects like
freezing all enemies on the screen
enemies can also drop two different
kinds of currency that can also be
gained as in-app purchases gems which
can be used to boost the effectiveness
of power-ups or can be used to help your
heroes giving them better stats new
appearances and sometimes unique
abilities like life gained on hit and
exploding upon death or coins that can
be used to purchase one-time use
benefits like increased movement speed
or helping you navigate levels faster
like skipping to the second part of the
stage you've been to or letting you
retry stage without going all the way
back to the start although each
successive use of retry doubles its cost
so it should be used lightly what's
really great about this game is that not
only is it free to play but while there
are some in-app purchases none of them
are for exclusive content or anything
that makes the game instantly winnable
they really just save you time all you
can really do is purchase currency or
one special upgrade that makes more
expensive gems appear the selling you to
get money faster that's it
there's nothing completely unique or
exclusive to people willing to pay money
everything can be earned by just playing
it as much as you can this combination
of simplicity and nostalgia makes this
game exceedingly hard to put down as a
time killer as this difficulty Rises
more and more with each level featuring
newer enemies that make it not only more
important
to have your conga line avoid direct
collisions but also think about which
way to approach to minimize the damage
taken from attacking enemies seeing as
how it's free-to-play I really can't
think of a good reason for someone to
not at least try it as even people that
don't like fantasy based games will find
themselves entranced by it's easy to
learn but hard to master mechanics and
how short a quick game can be played on
the go well that was just a short review
