- Yo, guys, Jonathan here
headed out to NAB 2019,
which is this huge tech show
for everything camera-related,
and with that, I thought it'd
be cool to take you along
with me and showcase what's in my bag.
So for the past six months or so,
this has been my go-to bag.
It's amazing, you can fit pretty much
your entire life inside.
But the problem is when
you do, it weighs a ton.
So I wanted to lighten things up,
and that's where this
comes in, the Air GO Pack.
So this bag is lightweight,
it looks great,
and that makes it a great
option to carry with you,
but it also dual functions
in the sense that you can
actually pack it into a
suitcase or a carry-on
and really keep things minimal.
Hands-down though, my
favorite feature with this bag
has gotta be the quick
access compartment up front
because it has this
super neat magnetic lock.
First and foremost, it's
going to make sure that you
close up and secure all
your valuables inside.
And secondly, there's just
something really satisfying
about hearing that click.
(clicks)
So inside there, I have
my MacBook charger.
Gen two AirPods.
There is the dot don't judge me.
My go-to monster 7.6 terabyte
external SSD from Glyph,
a CFast reader, this
really cool battery bank,
and an eighth inch
audio cable that goes to
these Focal headphones.
I showcased these headphones
a couple videos back,
and for the most part I
use them in conjunction
with this Lightning V-MODA DAC,
which is a game changer.
It sounds amazing,
but I also keep that
eighth inch cable with me
just in case I wanna use
it with my MacBook Pro
and edit on the go.
Sound quality is phenomenal,
and even though these technically
aren't noise-canceling headphones,
on a plane these things are incredible,
which is perfect because
as much as I love AirPods,
even the second generation,
on a plane, those things are trash.
Now this battery bank is freaking amazing.
One, it self charges, you
just plug it into a wall.
No cables needed.
And two, it also packs wireless charging,
which makes it perfect for
the second generation AirPods.
Now in the spirit of lightening things up,
I usually rock a 15-inch MacBook Pro,
but for the most part, I
shoot everything in ProRes,
not raw, final cut is super optimized,
and now the fact the
13-inch MacBook Pros have
a quad-core option, switching
to one has been seamless.
Now one trade-off with
this bag is because it's
so lightweight, there isn't a
ton of padding or protection,
so I would recommend grabbing
some sort of sleeve or case
with your laptop.
This one in particular is from Incase.
It's simple, it's minimal, but adds a ton
of protection and padding.
It gives you quick access,
and I am definitely not the most
careful person on the planet,
so having that extra peace of mind
makes this worth picking up.
Continuing the theme of
lightening things up,
the main camera we shoot
with is an Arri ALEXA Mini,
which you absolutely
cannot fit in this bag.
What you can fit in this
bag though is the brand new
Blackmagic Pocket Cinema 4K,
which is a mouthful,
but it's an amazing camera.
I have this paired with the
Metabones Micro Four Thirds to EF adapter,
so I can throw Canon glass on here.
I didn't really find the need
to go the speed boost option,
and honestly, this has
been an amazing combo.
Don't get me wrong, I
still love the A7 III,
it's an amazing camera,
but there's something
just super cinematic about
this camera.
And honestly, for the price,
if you don't care about stills,
you are not gonna get a
better image for the money.
Now when I'm traveling I
usually like to carry some sort
of portable light with me.
This one in particular from
Aputure has a ton of features,
it's waterproof, more than
anything it is just a really
bright, high quality LED.
Aputure, if you're watching,
if you're listening,
we gotta talk because there
needs to be some sort of
official way to mount this
into the Light Dome Mini II.
That would be incredible.
Now the main reason I'm out
here in Vegas is to edit
this video that you're watching
right now live on stage
at the LumaForge Faster Together event.
If all goes to plan, this
was done like an hour ago.
So if you're watching,
we did it, thank you guys
for your support.
Thanks, everyone that came out.
Love your faces.
This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later.
