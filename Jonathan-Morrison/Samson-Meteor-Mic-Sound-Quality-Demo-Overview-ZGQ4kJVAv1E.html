TLD just doing a quick little voice demo
with the Samson meteor USB microphones
going straight USB from the back into
the iMac that I'm also using the
built-in headphone output to monitor
myself with a set of headphones now if
you guys are wondering what this is
below it's just a little bit of studio
foam just to pick up any vibrations and
absorb that so it doesn't come through
on the recordings this isn't the full
review it's just kind of a quick little
overview and test of the microphone so
what you were hearing right now is being
recorded with the meteor mic it's going
to retail for 99 dollars I'll post a
link in the description if you guys want
to pick one up yourselves it's got three
adjustable legs right here one two three
and you can actually angle this to
better suit your record it's a pretty
cool feature
now this little dial right here I kind
of wish it was a gain control to control
the sensitivity or the input on the
microphone but it actually controls the
output for the headphone so my only
complaint so far if you guys are
wondering where the unboxing is it's
actually over on our gear gasm channel
you can click this video right here if
you want to check out the full unboxing
to see everything that comes in the
package other than that make sure to
check out our previous TLD video I hope
you guys enjoy this video again leave me
a comment down below of how you think it
sounds and I will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
