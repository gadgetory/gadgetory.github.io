TLD doing a couple quick final cut pro
tests on one of the new imacs for this
year quick run down to the specs this is
the 3.4 gigahertz core i7 model for gigs
around this is using an AMD Radeon 69 71
gigabyte card not too and a one terabyte
7200 RPM hard drive so the first thing
we're going to do is actually transcode
a 30-second 60d clip into pro res LT let
me just show you guys this is using the
candy one plug in and there you go pro
res LT so let's go and do that we're
going to drag this down throw in some
music wall does this and we'll jump to
the next test
so you guys saw that did that pretty
quick next thing we're going to do is
drop that into the timeline right here
yes next step we're going to do we're
going to add some little color
correction then we're going to do maybe
a Vinny a just add a couple different
effects and we're going to go to render
this out so you guys saw the e1
transcode I work pretty fast it does
take advantage of multicores this is a
quad-core CPU but it does take advantage
of the hyper threading sort of total of
eight threads at the computer seized and
utilizes that so we'll go in here color
corrector not going to really take too
much time and make this precise we're
just going to do a couple of things and
kind of bring up the blacks bring up a
little saturation and that kind of does
it lets go we added effect us go to
native and yay that's a little more
intensive as far as processing just
going to do a standard one like that
let's go to drag this over cue the music
and we'll go ahead and render this one
out
you
you
okay so we got the render done now keep
in mind this is going to be actually
faster in real life because I do have
ScreenFlow capturing the entire 2560 x
1440 screen so that it is going to take
a little bit from the cpu so I actual
performance in real life will be a
little bit faster but I wanted to use
something that we can test because I
want to be the same thing with the 2011
macbook pro so next thing and final test
for this video's we're going to do an
export to a 1080p let's go and set that
up so there we go export folder is
already set up we're going to change the
size 1920 x 1080 the interlace settings
will go and do leave it at high i'm
going to change the sound to AAC 44 256
and we'll do best so that should wrap it
up i'm gonna leave you guys here with
some music playing at the end along with
a couple links to some more imac videos
i hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you guys have any questions with the new
models feel free to drop me a line down
below in the comments section or you
guys can send me an email i'll post a
link to that in the description so again
thank you guys for watching as always
feel free to subscribe and i will catch
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
