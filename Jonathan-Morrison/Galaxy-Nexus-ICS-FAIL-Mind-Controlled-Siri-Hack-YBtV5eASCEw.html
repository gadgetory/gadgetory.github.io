have none cuz I'm gonna eat it cuz I got
the ice cream San what up guys Jonathan
here with TLD that may have been a
little bit too old of a reference for
some of you guys but if you guys did
catch that give me a high five so for
those of you guys were Google's upcoming
flagship phone the Galaxy Nexus will be
rocking their much-anticipated OS Ice
Cream Sandwich and one of the features
on ice cream sandwiches facial unlocking
so basically you hold your face up to
your phone and it will only unlock with
your face but this dude decides to take
a picture of his face hold that picture
up to the Galaxy Nexus and it unlocks so
that's a pretty huge fail so let me know
what you guys think with a comment down
below if you guys want to see the full
video and all of its Ice Cream Sandwich
fail awesomeness that link is also in
the description I thought it was pretty
hilarious but Google better get on this
and fix it ASAP another awesome times to
tech news a few dudes working on this
project codenamed project black mirror
busted out some Criss Angel stuff and
hacked Siri where it can read your mind
now it is limited right now and it is
still in the early process but basically
they hook it up where it reads your
brainwaves sends that into a voice
synthesizer and then tells Siri what to
do it's actually really awesome as you
guys want to check out that full video
it is also in the description so there's
just a couple texts stories this week

like being awesome make sure hit that
like button if you guys haven't
subscribed already feel free to do so
