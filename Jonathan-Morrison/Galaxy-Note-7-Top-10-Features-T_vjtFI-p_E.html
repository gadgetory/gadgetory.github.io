galaxy note 7 is official so let's go
and check out the top 10 features now
firstly no you are not crazy and no you
didn't fall into a deep sleep and
somehow missed the galaxy note 6 samsung
simply decided to jump up to the note 5
up to the note 7 and what that does is
keep the branding between the Galaxy S
series and the Galaxy Note series
uniform as far as features go number 1
on the list is the note sevens iris
scanner which allows you to unlock your
phone with your eyes so there's an
infrared sensor that works in
conjunction with a camera which allows
the phone to then scan your eyes setup
as quick fast and honestly it works
really well now this is by no means
meant to replace a fingerprint because
oftentimes that is going to be much
quicker to unlock your phone this is
simply another option and an extra layer
of security where this does work well
those if you wanted to unlock a picture
or a document that's located inside a
secure folder or you can even use this
to store passwords to log into websites
the only downside of that is it does
require Samsung's web browser to work so
if you're into Chrome or anything else
for that matter you're out of luck but
if you're cool with using the stock
browser then it works as advertised next
up at number two just like the galaxy s7
the galaxy note 7 is also
water-resistant
now hands-down my favorite thing about
this is the fact that Samsung was able
to do this without sacrificing design
there's no ugly port covers just a
really good looking phone so because
you're able to get that added protection
without having to add a bovie case or
have it look like the galaxy s7 active
which is one of the least attractive
phones this year that is a giant win
next up number three the note 7 s-pen is
better than ever now for sure the
biggest feature with the new S Pen is
this time you cannot stick it in
backdoors and effectively wreck your pen
that was one of the biggest problems
with the note 5 and what was weird is no
one seemed to believe it until they
tried it for themselves it was like Nick
that's a lie let me put it oh my god
what did I do
so it's a small thing but the fact you
cannot do that on the note 7 is a plus
on the technical side the note 7s S Pen
is more precise than ever with notify
the tip on its S Pen came in at one
point six millimeters
whereas with a note 7 its s-pen is only
0.7 millimeters what this translates to
is a more precise and more responsive
experience whether you're drawing or
writing and if you've never used the
s-pen on the note 5 you would of course
think it works really well but it's
really when you compare them side
outside that you see the huge difference
lastly and this is probably my favorite
feature period on the note 7 and whether
your team gift or team jiff
you guys Duke it out in the comment then
the less you can create one from a
YouTube video with a note 7 the next up
at number 4 is the note 7s display it's
a 5.7 inch Super AMOLED panel with a
resolution of 1440 by 2560 and you
guessed it it looks good now one giant
feature that Samsung is going to be
pushing is HDR video and don't get me
wrong that is awesome when software
works with hardware but the problem is
as of right now it's only going to work
with Amazon and it's not out yet so
we're really gonna have to wait and see
until we get excited beyond that there
really isn't anything to complain about
with the display the phone itself feels
great in your hands it's a great size
and whether you're watching video or
playing games it all looks fantastic the
next up at number 5 is Samsung's
always-on display
and what's really cool with the Galaxy
Note 7 is that it combines its always-on
display with its screen off memo so this
allows you to whip out your S Pen and
quickly jot down a note or a list but
what's read is you can then pin it onto
your screen and then view it with always
on display for up to an hour following
that at number 6 is the Galaxy Note
sevens camera now as far as the front
shooter goes note 7 is rocking a 5
megapixel front shooter and in addition
to a solid megapixel count you're also
getting a nice wide field of view which
is awesome for selfies where the Galaxy
Note 7 is going to shine though is its
rear camera which features a dual pixel
12 megapixel sensor it's going to be
nearly identical to the galaxy s7 and I
know a few people freaked out when I saw
Samsung jumped down from 16 to 12
megapixels but again I will stress
megapixels are not everything the galaxy
s7 is hands down one of the best
smartphone camera options out right now
with note 7 you're going to get that
exact same quality next up at number 7
with this new note comes in much cleaner
and visually satisfying UI I think we
can all agree as far as Samsung and
TouchWiz goes they never had the
cleanest or the prettiest interfaces but
with note 7 there's actually a pretty
solid improvement it's softer it's less
clunky err there's subtle nice touches
like being able to change the colors on
your folders and on top of that even
little things like your lockscreen being
able to change color when you rotate it
so overall this is a much welcomed
improvement the next step number eight
is free storage junkies out there get
excited because the note 7 features
micro SD card
Antron so this is blended riding with
the sim tray this is going to allow you
to expand storage up to 256 gigabytes
now so far we've seen a ton of
similarities between the galaxy s7 and
the note 7 but number 9 is something
completely different that is the
inclusion of USB type-c unfortunately
USB type-c is not going to bring quick
charge 3.0 to the note 7 it's still
going to be quick charge 2.0 but
regardless I am a fan of the movement
towards USB type-c it's much easier in
the sense that you can plug it in either
way and I cannot wait until all I need
to carry around with me are USB type-c
cables lastly number 10 is the note
sevens battery which sizes in at 3,500
milliamps honestly I wish Samsung maybe
would have reached a little higher as
far as battery life goes maybe somewhere
in the four thousand milliamp range but
nonetheless it's the biggest capacity on
any note and should get you through the
day on top of that Samsung has also
introduced a deeper level of control
over battery life so no longer do you
have just a couple basic modes you can
actually really dive in there dig deep
and fine-tune it to your needs aside
from that hopefully you guys know the
video if you did if you're excited for
the note 7 make sure to smash that like
button this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
