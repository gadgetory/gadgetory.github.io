with TLD we got a very cool unboxing for
you guys today i have a kingston ssdnow
be plus 256 gigabyte SSD so this thing's
a monster and i also have eight gigs of
laptop memory replacement for my new
macbook pro this is from crucial so
there's not much to these unboxing the
boxes are pretty plain not much going on
with them so i decided to do them both
in there since they're similar i will
show you guys how to install both of
these and i will also show you guys
differences of the performance as well
so let's go ahead and start with the
kingston drive and initially I was going
to go with the Intel but these are
really good drives and I was really kind
of tempted with actually persuaded with
the actual storage size 256 is a lot
more than 160 especially all the
programs i have going on so right that
you guys can take a look at the box not
much to it it's a very well packaged got
a nice design to it on the back gives
you all pacific specifications a
different language this is a 2.5 inch
form factor kingston pads is very well
it's got a nice little plastic enclosure
and then it is a nice little protective
wrapping put open that up there's the
drive itself so you guys can see there's
a 256 gigabyte that says the size right
there there's the v plus logo on the
back it's pretty plain it's got a nice
brushed aluminum look you guys can see
there's a SATA and power connectors and
it does about that does just about wraps
it up for the drive itself here's the
owners manual it's got a lot of chinese
and korean japanese everything but
english indie arabic i don't really not
too much i needed no in here but just so
you guys can check it out alright let's
set that aside and move on to the laptop
memory so this will work on all 2010
macbook pros and i believe it'll
actually work on the imax as well so
want to bump up your memory this is
actually relatively low price comes in
at about four hundred twenty bucks now
Apple will let you upgrade for on the
same price but the plus of going this
route is that you can actually sell your
old one remember their save that did
wasn't the easiest thing to open up but
we got it all right there we take a look
at the memory itself so these are two
four gigabyte memory modules and for the
imax they have four slots so you can
actually do for these for a total of
sixteen gigabytes of memory so like I
said these are going in my macbook pro
that's pretty much it for this unboxing
we got that and we got the Kingston 256
gigabyte SSD now B plus series so I'm
going to take one more look at that I'm
going to do a review on both of these
i'm going to do how to install them and
i will also do performance benchmark
tests so stay tuned for all those videos
i got a lot ahead of this i'll catch you
guys later and if you like this video
