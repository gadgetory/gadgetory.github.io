TLD was sort of like a holiday gift
guide it's going to be 10 tech gifts
under 50 bucks so I'm thinking of doing
this for fifty dollars hundred dollars
and tuner 50 bucks so if you guys like
that idea shoot me a comment down below
first two items will be closing then I
got both Android and Apple fans covered
so we have an Android for the wind
shirts the little android dude eating an
apple and then we have a hello i am a
mac shirt for the Apple crowd so the
Android shirts 20 bucks and go figure
the apple shirt is a little more pricey
at $27 next up is for you nintendo fans
which is a badass nintendo monopoly set
which comes in a 40 bucks i have a link
to that down below and then jumping back
to the android crowd for 10 bucks we
have a little mini collectible android
dude doll well actually I won't safe
doll it's not manly so we'll called a
figurine but it's relatively cheap and
any android fan will love it now for the
fifth and six items we're going to look
at headphones so for over ear headphones
I know a lot of people look at the beats
by dre they're a little pricey and for
44 bucks you guys can pick up a pair of
sennheiser HD 428 headphones which
honestly sound better for a fraction of
the price if you're interested in any
ear headphones the sixth item are Clips
s2 in-ear headphones those are 29 bucks
and they're a huge improvement over
those crappy white apple headphones or
really any stock mp3 headphones in
general next up is for you iphone users
