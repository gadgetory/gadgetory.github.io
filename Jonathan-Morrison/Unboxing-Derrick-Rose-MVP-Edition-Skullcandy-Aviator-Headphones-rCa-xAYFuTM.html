TLD for those of you guys that follow me
know I'm a huge basketball fan and a
huge Bulls fan so I depict these
headphones up and today I will be
unboxing the Derrick Rose Skullcandy
limited edition one of 500 made aviator
headphones you can actually only either
pick these up in Chicago Best Buy stores
or if you're outside Chicago if you want
to pick these up you can order them
either on best buy online or nba.com I
will post both those links down below if
you happen to be in Chicago you can head
straight down to your best body to pick
those up so here is the packaging the
box that was a box this is more of a
plastic enclosure we got skull candy up
on the top rock nation aviator let's see
if there's anything Derrick Rose on the
side of these so really I would have
liked to see something else I mean as
far as packaging wise at least to see
Derrick Rose up there the youngest MVP
in NBA history looks like we got a
little tape right here
that's slides right open let's go to
bring it there so you guys can see that
and let's see what they will work with
the iPhone iPod Touch got the controls
right here and let's carefully bring
these out and we've got one little tab
right here to pull off and they should
pop right out okay
first step down contents inside all
right so we're gonna swing this out to
get the headphones out of place and we
we have it got one more little slip
right here come on only get these out of
here so looks like we're gonna have to
pull this ah all right how to do it now
to do it got one little twist tie right
here gonna undo that and we can finally
bring these headphones out these are
$1.99 I forgot to mention the price and
those of you guys are probably yelling
through your skin why did you boys
school candy headphones
I'm not buying these strictly because
they're skull candy not really a huge
fan of skull candy but like I said I'm a
huge Bulls fan these are limited edition
they're one of 500 made so I wanted to
pick these up more as a collector's
edition just because I'm a huge Bulls
fan been one since I was like four or
five years old on the top you got
see here rock nation on the top it's
kind of like a metal enclosure aluminum
enclosure on the top on the side Derrick
Rose NBA MVP this is 495 of 500 so
that's cool rock nation on the side and
the Bulls logo right here Skullcandy
logo right here
first impressions in my hand they don't
seem like they're the best build quality
so obviously these aren't going to
necessarily be a 200 arcs that I
headphones as far as sound quality or
build quality and like I mentioned
previously this is more of a collector's
edition thing for me so stay tuned for
the full review hope you guys enjoyed
this unboxing if you guys are a Bulls
fan or basketball fan in general make
sure to follow me on Twitter we got a
little bet with me and soldier knows
best going back and forth he's a Heat
fan I'm a Bulls fan so check us out on
Twitter and you guys can steal the
details on that I did forget to mention
this is the carrying case kind of looks
like a little leather pouch
so overall the headphones look good I
wish there was more kind of Derrick Rose
thing going on it's just kind of the
headphones and that's it I wish they
would have included something they just
kind of throw in the standard owners
manual which I would include is
something with that to kind of
commemorate the whole MVP thing of the
headphones are cool I just wish they
would have included something else to go
along with these since these are limited
edition they do pay 200 bucks so again
stay tuned for the full review check out
our two latest videos make sure to check
out all the links down below and I will
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
