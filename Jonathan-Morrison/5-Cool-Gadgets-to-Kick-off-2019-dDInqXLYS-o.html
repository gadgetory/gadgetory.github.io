video is sponsored by LG.
(calm electronic music)
Yo guys, Jonathan here.
2018 is gone; January freaking flew by.
So, before we dive too deep into the year,
and before the tech gets crazy,
I wanna showcase five really cool gadgets.
First up is the larger than life,
but somehow still compact
and portable 17 inch LG Gram.
This is packing a massive
2560 by 1600 resolution,
and even though the screen
is big, it is the anti-thick.
It almost doesn't make sense
how light this thing is.
That makes this a perfect
laptop to travel with,
whether usin' it for business, for school,
and on top of that, you
get monster batter life.
Up to 19 and a half hours.
That is a lot Simpson videos.
Now even though the laptop is lightweight,
you are not sacrificing power.
Inside is a Quad Core Intel
chip, dual channel memory,
and up to one terabyte of
M.2 Solid State Storage.
That is freaking tasty.
You got ports on ports on ports.
Everything you could possibly need
and a brilliantly located
finger print reader.
So overall, this is a
really well rounded laptop.
Next up from there, we can all agree
there are roughly 864,000 battery
banks on Amazon right now,
and for the most part
they all look the same.
Which is why I really like this one.
Normally when you have a gadget like this,
they look cool, but they're
not the most functional.
How many banana USB drives
have you seen on Amazon
and then realize,
&quot;Crap, these are USB 2.0&quot;
and nobody's got time for that.
You're not getting anchor
style quick charging,
but you're also not getting
bang you head into a
wall one amp charging,
which nobody has time for.
The cherry on the cake though,
is this has a lightning port
which most battery banks don't.
So you getting a little
but of USB-C flavor,
a little lightning,
and this kinda just has the perfect recipe
for that gadget that you need to pick up.
From there, we are rapidly
entering the world of USB-C.
More and more things are adopting it,
but the problem is there is a lack
of really good USB-C
headphones and Razor was like,
&quot;Yo, we can fix that.&quot;
Not only do these things sound good,
they got a name that would rival, Mufasa.
Okay, the name's actually not
that cool, it's a little lame,
but they really do sound freaking amazing.
Build quality is on point,
I love the fact that you
have inline controls.
For that, if you have that
with a pair of headphones
that just makes things
so much more convenient.
Using your voice is cool but sometimes
you don't want to be that
guy or girl out there saying,
&quot;Hey Google play Lit Poppy.&quot;
This way you can rock that incognito.
Pretty much every single device
out there minus the iPhone,
I am looking at you Tim Cook,
has USB-C, so if we can get to that point
where we can charge, transfer data,
and have really good
sounding USB-C headphones
that is the win.
Now next from there, I am a
huge fan of Logitech mice.
So if you wanna bring that quality
with a splash of wireless
into the gaming world,
the G903 is a fantastic option.
From there, what's even cooler
if you wanna turn on God mode
and never charge your mouse again
you can pair it with the
Power Play Mouse Pad.
Which charges the G903
wirelessly while you're using it.
Now, I'm not a gamer by means,
so Dave2D I personally apologize
for this mediocre Fornite footage,
but at the very least my
guy Stevie got wrecked
with really low latency.
Next up from there, the
Blue Yeti had been a staple
not only in audio but in Youtube
for a really long time now.
And recently they packaged it together
with this really sexy arm
that clamps onto your desk
and gives you everything you need
to record beautiful, crisp audio.
Whether you're trying to do gaming,
or voiceovers, or podcasting,
or maybe you're throwing out some gems.
This thing is extremely versatile
and sounds great with pretty much
anything that you throw at it.
For the money, I don't think there is
a better option out right now.
It looks great, it sounds great,
and again I sound like a broken record,
but having the ability to connect directly
to your computer with USB is super handy.
Sliding from that hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video.
If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome,
make sure you guys smash that like button.
One like equals one prayer for Stevie.
- It's cool.

video is linked down below.
Again, that you guys for watching
and I will catch you guys later.
You've heard Lit Poppy, right?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
