Jonathan with TLD bringing you the full
review to the newly released Apple TV
the little guy that's smaller than an
Xbox controller as I noted in my
unboxing I've heard some of you guys
joke comparing it's like the size of a
Klondike bar it is small you can really
throw it in your backpack and take it on
the go to be honest but I'm gonna run
you guys through the specs the features
show you guys how it works how it looks
set up the interface of the actual Apple
TV itself and let you guys know what's
worth picking up okay so the
second-generation Apple TV is available
now for you guys to pick up it hits the
shelves at 99 bucks taking a closer look
at the Apple TV itself you guys can see
aesthetically it's a little doesn't
really pop out to the eyes the actual
remote looks cooler in my opinion I
almost wish they went with that aluminum
look for the whole Apple TV unit but
then again it's gonna sit next to your
TV's so it's not a huge deal now on the
rear I all you guys can see the power
cable connection we got the HDMI out USB
slot for firmware updates obstacle audio
says that support 5.1 surround and in
the Ethernet port if you guys don't want
to do Wi-Fi now taking a closer look at
the user interface we'll start with the
movie section for the new releases in HD
they come in at $4.99 for the older ones
those are 399 overall it's still a
little pricey for me to rent a movie I
think I'd rather go watch a DVD writing
at Netflix or Redbox or something like
that and for the actual TV shows those
were a little better price those come in
at $0.99 for the HD and standard
definition so it's kind of no brainer
for the same price you get the HD
version and you're going to be hooked up
to an HDTV either way if you have the
Apple TV now I'm moving on to probably
my favorite part of the Apple TV is the
Netflix streaming which is 10 bucks
month if you guys haven't experienced
Netflix not only do you get dvd's sent
to your house but you get access to all
these TV shows movies they've really
worked it out you're getting a lot more
access to some of the newer movies and
TV shows so really I mean you guys could
cancel your cable bill it's not all the
newest shows but for 10 bucks a month
you get a huge amount of content so I'm
gonna give you guys a look of the actual
interface which is really impressive to
me as far as a Netflix goes some of the
interfaces on blu-ray players don't look
that good they don't work that well as
far as picture quality like I said
doesn't need 1080p but this is 720p
through a Samsung 46 inch TV
overall definitely impressed and it's
very acceptable for 720p
most TV shows are in 720p so it looks
very good now you can actually also
watch and view you
to bond here you can sign in the actual
interfaces okay you don't have that much
control you guys can see the top viewed
most viewed you guys can search for
shows now the quality actually looks
very good it's kind of amazing from
YouTube videos two years ago that looked
kind of left and crappy now it was 720
and HD everything looks good even on a
huge 46 inch TV you guys know who Philly
D is you guys haven't seen them go check
them out you can also do a radio
MobileMe podcast Flickr I'll take you
guys to the radio section right now
there's tons and tons of radio stations
on here keep mind these are all free for
you guys these are streaming on the
internet so that's very cool as well now
the remote app for the iPhone and the
iPad work very well very seamless I do
recommend this option if you can do that
over the actual remote that comes with
the Apple TV
so airplay as of now only does audio the
idea behind that is you can take music
or videos which doesn't work at the
moment from your iPad from your computer
from your iMac your MacBook Pro and
streaming it to your TV having those
come out of those speakers right now so
like I said only audio works right now
we should get that update
probably in November to do video so I'm
looking forward to that but that's just
a little quick rundown of airplay now
one thing I want to point out for you
guys is I see a lot of comments y can
buy a blu-ray player 450 bucks and play
blu-rays or I can buy an Xbox 360 or ps3
and the fact of the matter is you can do
that but like I said some people maybe
don't want a game or even pay the money
for blu-rays so if you guys want a
little small portable convenient package
that's not going to draw a lot of power
you can do Netflix at no charge that's
one thing I want to point out to you
guys with Xbox 360 you do have to pay
for Xbox Live now if you want to arm one
device to play games on maybe go for the
ps3 or the Xbox 360 but if you want
something small it's not going to really
break the bank it's not going to draw
too much power you can watch YouTube
Netflix for free like I mentioned it's a
great device and it's a great purchase
it's not gonna really break the bank so
like I said I win skeptical overall it
impressed me definitely would recommend
it if you guys are thinking about it
hope you guys enjoyed this review thanks
