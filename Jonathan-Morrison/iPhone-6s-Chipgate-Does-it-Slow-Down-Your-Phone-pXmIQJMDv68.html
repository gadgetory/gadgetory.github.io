wouldn't be a true Apple release without
a little bit of controversy and this
time it involves chips
not those kind rather the chips inside
enter chip game so when it comes down to
is your iPhone 6s or 6s Plus has one of
two processors there's a TSMC processor
or a samsung processor which is a
smaller die runs hotter and yields worse
battery life now if you're freaking out
wondering how you can check this out
there's a free option in the app store
called Liam so what I did was gather as
many iPhone 6s as I could tested them
out and out of the five to had the
alleged crappy Samsung processor and fun
fact one of them was mine so what I
wanted to do was put the two
side-by-side and test them in a
real-world environment and see if there
actually was a major difference between
the two processors the first thing I did
was take both phones starting with a
hundred percent battery same screen
brightness same settings and run a
30-minute time lapse once that was done
and after checking the batteries it
definitely seemed like it was falling in
place with this theory the Samsung
equipped 6s jumped down to 84 percent
battery whereas the TSMC 6s was still at
89%
what I did after that was shoot ten
minutes of 4k video straight and here
there really wasn't a significant dip in
battery the Samsung equipped iPhone
ended up at 75% whereas the TSMC iPhone
was at 80% and there I wanted to see if
there was any performance difference
between the two so what I did was take
the exact 10-minute 4k video file and
export them in iMovie
the Samsung was actually about four
seconds faster which really isn't
significant or a reason to worry as far
as the battery life after that test the
Samsung 6s was at 60% and the TSMC
iPhone was at 66% following that I ran
Geekbench 3 in a total of three times
for accuracy and consistently the tsmc
iPhone outperformed the Samsung and
multi-core performance now this makes
total sense if the Samsung chip is
running hotter and thus throttles down
but as we saw in the iMovie test there
really wasn't a huge real-world
difference following that to top things
off I went ahead and ran GFX bench metal
and performance was exactly the same at
thirty nine point nine frames per second
so after everything was said and done
starting with 100% battery on each phone
after every test you saw the Samsung 6s
ended up with around fifty five percent
battery and the tsmc iPhone was at 62
percent battery so that means there is
definitely a difference of battery life
between these two chips not so much
performance strictly battery if you have
an iPhone 6s or 6s plus let me know
which chip you have in your phone
hopefully you found this video helpful
if you did make sure to smash that like
button and share this with a friend who
may have this problem now if you guys
want a more detailed and extensive test
at how this affects battery my buddy
Austin Evans put together an awesome one
which covers not only that but a super
awesome explanation of the two
processors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
