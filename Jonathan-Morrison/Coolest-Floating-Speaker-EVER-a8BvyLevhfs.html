might be the coolest floating bluetooth
speaker ever so this is the Mars by
crazy baby weird name and not gonna like
kind of looks like a Mac Pro 3 Mac for
waiting gonna grow hey put it away man
this is what a legitimate Mac four looks
like oh my god that's the only things I
see what I'm about same way too
it's the perfect Mac Pro speaker 2 pro
don't you know anything about normal
problems this is clearly an inefficient
use of the Mac Pros cooling okay you
know that actually is my computer so I'm
gonna take this back that you use PC
shut up and how it works is you have two
components the base and of course a UFO
shaped Mars craft now the base is unique
in the sense that its sole purpose is
not just to help the speaker levitate
but it also doubles as a subwoofer that
works in conjunction with a speaker
while the music's playing on top of that
if you look towards the back you'll see
a couple of USB ports so once you charge
up the base you can then use said power
to charge your electronics now in
addition to the grey EC here which I
impulsively picked up off Amazon it also
comes in black and white and one thing I
did notice immediately is that it was
hands down way easier so than any other
floating speaker I've messed around with
hello
Adele before a levitation setup please
make sure your smart device is already
connected with Mars craft by bluetooth
all right like a saucer sounds like a
marsh craft is connected a so step one
Center the craft on the pivot of the
base right on the middle okay
centered yep demain cool step to power
on Mars base step three the craft will
raise as a levitation indicator light
indicator will turn solid when the
levitation whoa is complete
step 5 enjoy your music guess who it is
yo dude you're on a video right now
what's up that's a much that I got you
the six milk yeah that is sure I killed
about two kids you know I died here
though probably going to jail
well if they find me obviously I never
find me yet I'm okay now one of the big
features touted with Mars is the 360
degree sound dispersion which in turn
should equate to an equal listening
experience no matter which side of the
speaker you're on
beat us often and he goes up where my
face
oh you wrecked it you wrecked it you
wrecked it there are instructions for
this if this happens to you do not panic
if levitation fails do not put it back
on the base immediately
you got to do it we did and wait a
couple seconds while the magnet goes
back down put it back on and it'll
automatically detect it and come back to
life just so that's the level man p33
ambient not bad at pack ball not bad
that's not the cool part what's the cool
that's not the cool part whoa okay it's
like The Lion King
waterproof you're thirsty man just the
disk is this is water just the crack is
water I see USB ports they don't look
very waterproof start ready for this
close up slow motion camping out
mechanical musica oh yeah that sub you
know it could be dead right now guys it
could be dead it's still moving air like
there's bubbles coming out of it as if
it's not really sealed like how far kind
of leave with this before it disconnect
why don't you walk out and thought time
you get out of here that's uncalled for
ting Rick's still here music still here
music okay I'm outside now 20 meters
Larry
look it I see water G huh oh hello get
low get low look at that that's pretty
cool yeah clean it real good you can
also control it with the app bring down
that's the lower function say bring it
back up don't lick it man now on top of
being waterproof the Mars craft is also
magnetic and they are not messing around
that magnet is strong as hell so if
you've been looking for a Bluetooth
speaker that you can smack and stick on
metal objects and get down to Little
John then your search my friend just
might be over so overall there
definitely are a couple wow factor type
features with this set up and well it
might actually seem like the coolest
floating Bluetooth speaker ever the
price is hard to justify it is currently
just over 300 bucks which will probably
shock you and don't get me wrong there's
a ton that I like about this but it's
hard to recommend unless you just have
cash to burn sound quality is good but
not great but again this is more of a
flashy product that you get to show off
and impress people so if you keep that
in mind you have the cash and those
reasons are enough to justify the
purchase by all means pick one up
because it is freaking cool but on the
flip side if your sole purpose is just
looking for a good Bluetooth speaker
there are definitely cheaper and better
sounding options out there all of which
will be linked below but aside from that
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go almost killing
Rick Grimes with a floating speaker on
that like button
no big shout up to Austin and Marquez
who just drops his newest episode of
dope tech which is all about speakers
you guys can check that out by clicking
here this is Johnson and I will catch
you guys later
