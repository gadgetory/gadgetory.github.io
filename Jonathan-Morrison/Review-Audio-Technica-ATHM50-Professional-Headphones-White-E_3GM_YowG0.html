lunch and dinner with my review of the
audio technica ath m50 close back
monitor headphones in white now I'm not
gonna go crazy in depth with specs or
anything like that it's more of a
kickback relaxed real world review where
we guys could honestly just geek out
over some close-up shots of the
headphones I decided to skip the
unboxing simply because there's not a
lot that comes in there I don't want to
waste two minutes of me fidgeting with
plastic you get the headphones
themselves a carrying pouch and a 3.5
millimeter two quarter inch headphone
adapter now as far as basic
specifications goat leads a rockin 45
millimeter drivers they have a frequency
response of fifteen to twenty eight
thousand Hertz and a thirty-eight ohm
impedance so you don't necessarily have
to use them with a headphone amp to get
a decent sound you can use them with an
iPod iPhone or really any other mp3
player and it'll do the job however I do
use these in tandem with an Apogee one
which is a fantastic audio converter as
well as interface for the Mac and to
simply put it a THM 50s plus Apogee 1
equals eargasm now aside from the sound
the 80 hm 50s are extremely comfortable
the ear cups are super soft padded
squishy it's almost like you got
marshmallows on your face I mean years
and the headphone man is padded as well
so you can use these for extended
periods of listening or monitoring and
in fact I'm using them to listen to
myself right now but they are also
awesomely portable due to the fact that
the ear cups swivel 180 degrees so even
if my backpack is jam-packed full of the
top of stuff just swivel swivel lay them
down flat and zip up but I'm ready to go
lastly because these are closed back
headphones are gonna do a killer job of
isolating the sound outside of you which
is why they're so popular for monitoring
as well as mixing and in addition to
that they're gonna minimize sound
leakage that way if they're out in
public listening to the beeps brosef to
the left won't even make fun of you so
jokes aside these are hands-down
awesome headphones whether they're using
them for music to mix or master or you
just want a good sounding set of
headphones to enjoy music with in
addition to white they come in black as
well as a limited edition silver color
so I've links to all those in the
description as well as the Apogee one
and a few other audio converters that
are cheaper or in case you're not using
a Mac aside from that if you're feeling
like being awesome one of the easiest
ways to help a channel out is by hitting
that like button it is much appreciated
if you are new and you're watching this
video for the first time feel free to
subscribe by hitting this button right
here and if you have questions on
headphones or converters or just tech in
general hit me up on twitter at TLD
today there's a link in the description
that is probably the best way to get a
hold of me and for that one guy out
there that's gonna ask are these better
than just don't say it don't say the B
word friends do not let friends wear
