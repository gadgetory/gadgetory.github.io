don't know how to do that
blue TLD for Daisy hey guys johnathan
here and yes these are USB shoes now for
those asking yes the 12 days of TLD is
coming so thumbs up if you're excited
for that and in preparation that is how
I found these so initially when I found
these in Amazon I was skeptical as hell
because we look at them without lights
you cover them up they almost look like
old people shoes if all of this was
velcro then it would look exactly the
same
another thing it's old people if any
elderly TLD fans out there are watching
right now I love you he loves the old
ladies but anyways I decided to go
against my gut and order these but once
I got them in and played around with
them I was actually impressed
now inside each shoe there's a microUSB
port which she used to charge these just
like you would your phone or your tablet
now as far as how these work is
essentially a button on the USB port so
you press that guy that's green that's
teal bro like my heel I have a problem
so when you see this from the side
that's when they kind of look cooler I
just wish honestly there were a little
better quality because the concept is
really cool but I would actually love
these if they were made by an actual
shoe brand dude they're like the coolest
old people shoes on the planet so inside
there's not really any branding the
brand according to Amazon is owed Emma
or oedema if you look on the bottom it
actually says fashion so that's how you
know you are cool I think the natural
next step is to try these on it might
give me like an inch
you may go look no I got this
it was a tight take in a chair they
actually don't feel that bad
what's the weight rated s whoa moonwalk
Karate Kid see now it's calm it's calm
you're just walking outside right now
comfort rating not bad I don't know how
they would hold up long-term but they
don't feel like they're murdering my
feet oh that lands a ten out of ten so I
don't know I think I'm pretty sold on
these I mean bill quality isn't exactly
outstanding but they're 60 bucks which
is a lot less than most shoes out there
these days and they're a ton of fun now
one thing I did notice that they seem to
run a little bit small so if you're
grabbing these for yourself or for a
little Billy as a Christmas gift maybe
get them a half size bigger so you guys
just got a sneak peak out one of the
items I'll be featuring the best pack
under 100 bucks and if you enjoy the
tech under series I just ain't up with
Amazon and release a bonus episode of
top 5 tech on our 25 bucks which you
guys can check out the link below
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you or feel like being
awesome make sure to go PJ Rose on that
like button
this is Jonathan TLD and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
