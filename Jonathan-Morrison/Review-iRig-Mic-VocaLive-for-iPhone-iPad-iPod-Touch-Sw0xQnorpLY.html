Brown I won't hit a girl in the eye but
I will review the arek mic and the iRig
mic is the first handheld microphone for
the iPhone iPod Touch and the iPad it is
a condenser microphone digging a little
bit deeper into that it's actually
electret condenser microphone not
electric electric try saying that five
times fast essentially meaning itself
supplies the power to itself so you
don't need phantom power pretty dang
cool this is going to retail for about
59 bucks I'll make sure to post the
cheapest link to pick this up down below
looks very similar to that of an SM 58
you have three gain input options on the
middle of the microphone you get low
medium and high
I found medium to work best for most
applications as far as applications go
if you're a singer you can use it with
vocal live if you're a singer songwriter
guitarist you can use both vocal live
and amplitude in conjunction if you're
not a musician you just want to use
speech or voiceover you can use this
with their free app iRig recorder the
iRig mic is built very well feels really
solid aside from the cable it feels a
little bit flimsy compared to a normal
microphone cable the jack is actually a
dual function jack so it sends audio
into your iDevice and it also sends
stereo audio out so you can real-time
monitor you can use these or headphones
or even if you want to hook it up to a
sound system or PA taking a look at the
vocal live application there's a total
of twelve effects you can use three at
the same time and customize any of those
not only can you adjust the presets
where you can store up to four favorites
on the fly
let's go and check out a delay so you
get that echo so we can crank up the
volume and we can basically tweak every
sound effect in here so let's go and
jump over to a reverb and that's going
to give you that Hall effect you can
change the tone the swell lots of
different customizations here
let's go ahead and turn that off the
pitch fix is what you heard earlier so
now I sound like t-pain even though I
can't really sing is another fun one hmm
what's up everyone its Jon Renji and I
black eyed so obviously those are more
the fun effects now if you're a singer
they do include a metronome and vocal
warmup tool so you can run through
scales you can also import your iPod
library and there's an effect that will
cancel out those vocals so you can sing
and warm up to that we'll go to take a
look at the choir effect now if you go
to the presets you can actually mess
around with octave up octave down and
harmonies of thirds 5th and 7th you do
need to know some basic music theory to
set this up we did have some fun with it
using it in conjunction with the four
track recorder and that's record a
little guitar demo you guys can check
that out here there's top of bag to be
applauded you're so cool so in decently
you treat me why do I put up with such
cool cool so you guys can see how we
used it in different applications to
record the acoustic guitar as well as
the voice used a little delay as well as
the choir effect now if I had any
complaints about this whole setup I
would say vocal live as an application
is overpriced and the reason I say that
is because for $5 you get the
full-fledged GarageBand app to 8-track
recorder guitars keyboard piano
everything for 5 bucks now as far as the
iRig mic I think that's fairly priced
for about 59 bucks you'll more than
likely find it on sale for about 39 40
bucks and I think that sounds very good
for the money it's not going to be the
end-all be-all studio microphone but you
can get some very decent recordings
whether you're musician singer
songwriter you want to use acoustic
guitars vocals drums or you just want to
use it to take notes or voiceovers or
you just want to have some fun and sing
along with some t-pain and some
auto-tune with your friends do some
karaoke I would recommend that I can
multimedia thank you for sending us out
it's a very solid product my only
suggestion just bring the price down on
the vocal I've app just a little bit
only because GarageBand is out there
other than that everything is really
solid sounds good it's built really well
really enjoyed the product so I hope you
guys enjoyed this review go ahead and
close it out have some fun with the
bloopers make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already and I'll catch you guys
later
stupid alien Luke I am yours
egg father I sound like Astrid ace
