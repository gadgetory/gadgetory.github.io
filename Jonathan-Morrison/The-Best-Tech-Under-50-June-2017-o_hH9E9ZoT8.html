of the best tech under 50 get excited
because today it is back and it is
better than ever I clean up with color
we're not only to showcase my favorite
skin of the month but also to give one
of you guys a chance to win everything
featured in today's video so that sounds
good you're excited make sure you drop a
like down below and definitely feel free
to subscribe internal implications of
you having it so you don't miss feature
videos like this so this once again from
color is dubbed a tracer this is
brand-new it is stealthy it is
futuristic it is unique to say the least
here I have on the pixel XL which looks
super clean and if you own a pixel and
you haven't been a fan of that glass
panel this is actually a fantastic way
to cover it up and give it a super
unique look now maybe you don't own a
pixel maybe you're on teen Galaxy s8
maybe you're on Team iPhone 7 it doesn't
matter because this is available for
those as well which I will link to down
below so first up for those that caught
my Galaxy s8 desk setup video I featured
that bright orange keyboard right there
behind me and the reaction was either
holy crap that is amazing where can I
get that bright bold beautiful orange
rectangle of squares or stop it man it's
like I'm looking into the Sun get it out
of my face so with that said for those
of you who aren't a fan of Sunny D
that's where this guy comes in the Anker
ultra compact bluetooth keyboard which
is budget-friendly and comes in at just
20 bucks
before we continue I'm not afraid to
address it it is no secret where they
took their design inspiration from this
looks and feels like a cheap Apple
keyboard it's almost like Johnny I've
took vacation and Phil Schiller filled
in now while this may look like an Apple
keyboard the good news is that it's not
just limited to Mac it's going to work
on iOS Android and for those who bleed
green red blue or red again in any of
those combinations it's also going to
work on the PC master-race side of
things as well so all that is fantastic
but if there were any downsides with
this keyboard I would say it comes down
to build quality the plastic does leave
a little to be desired it's not going to
break by typing on it but you definitely
don't want to slam this thing around
pass that though it is super lightweight
which makes it a great option for
traveling aesthetically is clean as hell
you also get stellar battery life at
around six months and if you've been
looking for a great inexpensive
Bluetooth keyboard that is under
twenty-five bucks this is a solid pickup
so next up number three is this little
guy right here and if you want an Apple
watch which is one of the coolest
gadgets I've come across what it is is
this tiny compact portable battery bank
but what's awesome is there's a built-in
Apple watch dock smash
inside this guy so say it's the end of
the day maybe you forgot to charge your
Apple watch last night but you need just
a little bit more juice to get you
through this is all you need also I got
to give this thing some brownie points
for the built-in keychain which allows
you to pay homage to the great Dwayne
the rock Johnson now this is going to
work with both series 1 and 2 and what I
thought was a really nice touch was the
built-in LED battery indicator so that
way at any given point of the day you
know how much charge you have left now
if there were any downside that would
say it's a fact that this does require
microUSB C if it did have lightning that
would have taken over the top and made
this absolutely perfect but for the
price it is not a terrible thing to deal
with it's relatively inexpensive it
works as advertised and if you're
someone who's ever had a problem with
not charging their Apple watch this
could come in super clutch so next up
speaking of Apple boxes and tiny small
objects this is the logo w3 stand which
is amazing for any way into that classic
Apple design what that essentially is
turn your Apple watch into the super
tiny compact original Macintosh it looks
awesome it is not new by any means but
the reason I'm featuring today is that
even though this is the best tech under
50 right now this is on sale for 10
bucks how long is that going to last I
have no idea so if you want one make
sure you jump on it but at the very
least it is a super fun piece of tech to
have now if I were to describe this the
words that come to mind would be heavy
thick beefy even not going to say you
could knock someone out with this but
you probably could and it's going to do
all of that without scratching your
Apple watch now aside from looking cool
also been a potentially great object to
chuck at someone there actually is some
function with this it will work in
nightstand mode with your Apple watch so
you could have this really cool vintage
set up to charge your watch at night and
for 10 bucks it is a no-brainer so next
up number two are the fatigue hf1
headphones and I get it you probably
seen your fair share of wireless
Bluetooth headphones on budget episodes
but the thing is these don't look like
250 bucks and more importantly they
don't sound like they're 50 bucks so
right off the bat bill Claudie what
these things are fantastic they are made
with lots and lots of metal they look
great they feel great more importantly
they do all of this while still being
lightweight now one of the more
impressive features with these
headphones in fact you can expect around
12 hours a battery
you combine that with the fact that they
are really lightweight like I mentioned
that makes these a super solid choice
for a pair of traveling headphones now
on the website they definitely hype
these up but they claim they feature a
tasteful zinc alloy matte accent which
is fancy talk for a pretty cool matte
finish
now as for our sound quality goes they
sound really good not amazing I
definitely wouldn't take them over a
pair of Sony's and say that $100 price
point I think the biggest thing lacking
for them is the bass most people might
feel it needs a little bit more but if
you can only spend 50 bucks for a pair
of headphones and you need them to be
wireless I would seriously check these
out so last up once more on my head with
a little bit of that nostalgia this is
the 8-bit tho SNES 30 which is this
really cool little Bluetooth controller
that looks just like the original Super
Nintendo controller so this connects
wirelessly via bluetooth but just in
case you're right smack in the middle of
a game and your battery starts to die
you can still use this connects to a USB
cable as well now just like that sweet
anchor keyboard took a look at earlier
this also works on Mac Windows iOS and
Android but more importantly and the
reason I'm featuring it today is that it
now works with the Nintendo switch so
it's a switch it makes for a really
great retro throwback companion you get
these really awesome tactile buttons now
on one side if you're playing more
complex games like Zelda you probably
want to check out they're more expensive
Pro model which is still under 50 bucks
but on the other hand if you're doing
simple games like Mario Kart it's going
to work perfectly
now speaking of switch this amazing
custom theme switch yes this one right
here I am also given away along with a
chance to win everything featured in
this video details on that are down
below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
