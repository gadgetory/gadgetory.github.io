some breaking news on the upcoming ipad3
the awesome folks over at macrumors have
busted out some detective work they
obtained a leaked ipad 3 screen they
threw that under a microscope now it's
the same 9.7 inch form factor same as
the ipad 2 same as the ipad 1 but what
had happened was is they found double
the pixel density and what that means is
normally where you would see two pixels
by two pixels now you see four pixels by
four pixels so here's a quick visual
representation of that so you guys can
see that a little bit easier that I
whipped up for you guys now what that
means is we'll see a resolution of 2048
x 1536 exactly doubled out of the prior
1024 x 768 and I don't know about you
guys that is awesome to hear if you guys
are feeling like keeping that trend up
your feeling like being awesome feel
free to give this video a thumbs up as
it does help the channel out it is much
appreciated aside from that there's
speculation that the ipad 3 will be
announced on mark 7 that's not concrete
that it just rumors at this point as far
as the specs go I would expect to see a
quad-core ipad 3 with beefed up graphics
that I can hit you so hard your
grandmother's Mother's gonna pull it
1080p video recording on the rear facing
camera 720p front-facing HD camera on
the front side that's a mouthful and it
is also expected that we will see 4G LTE
versions for both verizon and AT&amp;amp;T so
that is it and he'd not show hopefully

our latest two videos and I will see you
