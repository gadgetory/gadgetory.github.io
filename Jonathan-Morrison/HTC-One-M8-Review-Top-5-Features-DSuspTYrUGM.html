the original m7 one of my favorite
smartphones of 2013 and improved upon it
it's got a bigger display it's faster
and has some new features so gonna kick
back relax and find out what stood out
to me today's video is powered by
Dollar Shave Club hey guys johnathan
Morrison here yep that is just like Jim
hope you guys are having a fantastic day
evening or whenever you may be watching
this I am back some coverage on the
brand new HTC One otherwise known as the
HTC One m8 so I'm currently in the
preparation stage of my review testing
it out using it as my daily driver and
pretty much just getting a feel for the
phone but I have used it for a couple
days now so I want to share with you my
first impressions and also what stood
out to me and I'm going to do that by
breaking it down into my top five
features now if you're brand new to the
channel definitely feel free to
subscribe that way you'll be notified
once I do upload the full review and you
can do that by either clicking the
YouTube button right here or we'll have
it linked down below aside from that
let's go to Jim right into it and kick
it off with feature number five and that
is motion launched now briefly touching
upon impressions I am NOT a huge fan of
the sleep/wake button placement on the
new m8 for me by instinct I keep wanting
to reach for what actually is the micro
SD card slot up down on top right hand
side and actually on Twitter myself
Detroit Borg and Danny widget who both
by the way make killer tech videos all
seem to agree at the sleep/wake button
placement is a little bit cumbersome and
for us the ideal placement would
actually be where the volume down button
is located now if you happen to have
picked up one of the new HTC One m8 I
would love to hear your opinion on
whether you agree or disagree with us
now getting back to motion launched
there was some reasoning behind that
little ramble and because I do find the
sleep/wake button cumbersome that makes
me appreciate and find motion launched
that much more useful now quick
disclaimer this may seem very similar to
some of LG's features so I'm not saying
by any stretch of the imagination that
HTC invented the wheel but regardless
these are useful so for starters when
the phone is asleep and in portrait
orientation you can actually double tap
the phone and that will wake it up
taking that one step further you can
swipe left and that will take you to
your widget panel which essentially is
your homescreen swiping right will take
you directly into blinkfeed which I'm
not a huge fan of but it's there and if
you want to access that quickly that's
how you do it
now swiping up will unlock the phone
completely and if you're curious what
the difference is between up and
because they seem very similar if you
swipe up that will actually take you to
your last open application as opposed to
the home widget panel now conversely
swiping down while she activate voice
calling so if you want to quickly make a
phone call when your phone's asleep just
swipe down and then from there it'll
prompt you to say call and then the name
of the person you want to dial and then
lastly if you do want to quickly access
the camera on the m8 from sleep all you
got to do is turn it landscape so
sideways and then press either of the
volume buttons and voila so you can see
they're not revolutionary by any means
but definitely useful and that brings us
to feature number four that is micro SD
card expandability so jumping back to
last year's HTC One the m7 one of the
biggest complaints and drawbacks was a
lack of storage expansion that was
something the galaxy s4 offered and for
a lot of people that was a make or break
feature in terms of actually buying a
phone but this year that completely
changes and what makes it more
impressive is that HTC has proven that
you don't have to sacrifice build
quality in order to get expandability
now upon first glance you might not even
realize there is a micro SD card slot on
the ma because it kind of just looks
like a sim card slot right there on the
top right hand side but the SIM card
slot is actually on the left side now
because it is a unibody design the bad
news is you do need a tool to access
that slot the good news is though it's
just a sim card ejection tool so you're
not going to have to have a separate
special adapter or tool or anything like
that it's the same one you'd use for
your sim card now you can expand up to
an additional 128 gigabytes by a micro
SD on top of that if you don't need that
much storage you can actually pick up a
64 gigabyte card for less than $1 per
gigabyte right now they're floating
around 40 to $45 and I'll have current
pricing and various models and sizes
linked down below just in case you are
interested in picking one up so moving
on to feature number three and that is
the duo camera now in the back of the m8
you might be wondering why are there two
cameras those are actually two separate
for ultrapixel cameras that take two
separate pictures simultaneously and
then give you access to the various
depth of field information that you can
then tweak afterwards now there has been
some controversy on whether this is
useful or if it's gimmicky but for me
more than anything it's a step into the
future into the right direction and it's
actually nice to see HTC taking a chance
and trying to be innovative as opposed
to just keeping the same or boring now
from my initial test and it's not
perfect in every situation but if you
kind of know when and how to use it can
actually
cool so here you can see my lovely dog
miss melody posing for the YouTube
camera and this is with no effect turned
on and you can see if we focus on her we
can actually create that blurred
background effect so in this case it
actually looks really nice this is Big
Mac in a similar scenario and again it
looks pretty good here and this is based
off what they call you focus you can
change either the foreground or
background focus they also have
foreground ER which gives you four
options sketch zoom blur cartoon and
colorize this shot of Big Mac right here
was created using the foreground ur
sketch effect and in this case I think
it works really well
there's also seasons which will give
your photo almost a video like effect
with various elements there's Sakura
dandelion maple leaf and snow now
dimension plus is pretty trippy because
there are two focal points with the two
cameras if you actually tilt the phone
it will give you a pretty tripped out 3d
effect which I don't know how useful it
is but it's kind of cool and lastly
sticker doesn't really have anything to
do with the dual camera per se but I
thought why wouldn't you want to see a
picture of Big Mac in a hat so again
it's not perfect in every situation but
I think a lot of consumers who just want
to have fun with their camera and aren't
really trying to be a pro photographer
are going to find some use out of this
and again even though it can be
conceived as gimmicky I think it's a
step in the right direction and also
something we'll see on future
smartphones to come and following up the
dual camera at number two is Bill
quality and the display and I'm kind of
just a matching these together because
they are both awesome and kind of both
go hand in hand
now the original HTC One m7 by all means
was a beautifully crafted beautifully
designed extremely premium feel and
smartphone but HTC has found a way to
even improve upon that
so the m7 consisted of about 70%
aluminum in terms of bill material
whereas the m8 bumps that up to about
90% so with that it does make it heavier
but it feels extremely solid and there's
very little plastic and just like the m7
something I really like about the m8 is
when you pick it up in the morning
because it is aluminium and gives you
that cold metal feeling which is
something I just personally enjoy now
alongside the build quality the display
on the m8 is also just as awesome so it
is still 1080p just like on the m7 but
it's slightly larger now coming in at 5
inches which for me is just about the
sweet spot in terms of a smartphone
screen display size and on top of that
just overall image quality brightness
and color accuracy is outstanding
so whether you're watching YouTube
Netflix playing a game or even just
reading for me having a large sharp
display is something I really enjoy
now as awesome as the display is for
consuming media this takes me to my
number one feature which is boom sound
which takes consuming media to that next
level so again jumping back to the
original HTC one the m7 boom sound was
one of the features that kept me using
it as my daily driver for as long as it
did it is honestly loud enough and
sounds good enough to where if you
didn't want to use a Bluetooth speaker
in certain applications you'll actually
enjoy listening to music off of it now
HTC is claiming that the new m8 is 20%
louder compared to the m7 and I'll
actually go all out and test that out
with a decibel reader for my full review
but in the meantime for reference here
is what the iPhone 5s sounds like
and here is that same track at the same
volume level on the HTC One m8 so you
can see there is an absolutely huge
difference between the two and it is
beyond me why this is not a feature on
every single smartphone or tablet
because it completely enhances your
experience not only does that apply to
YouTube or Netflix but if you're
actually playing a game you get more
immersed into the content because it
sounds that much better and for me I
watch a ton of NBA League Pass on my
phone so the bigger display combined
with boom sound makes my geek slash
sports heart very happy and thank
goodness the Bulls turn it around this
year they're making me proud but they
did have me a little bit worried when
Rose went down again the MRI confirms
it's a torn meniscus the right knee of
Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose
which will sideline him remainder the
season yet again the Bulls struggles
continue since losing Rose for the
season
dropping 11 out of their last 14
you
what the hell man been texting all day
make whipping a bitch what's up no
better already
thanks man you're welcome wait that's
your razor yeah but you can beard yeah
everyone smoother so I think we can
agree buying razors sucks you got to go
to the store you got to talk to people
and then you dish out way too much money
for shape tech you don't even need
fortunately Dollar Shave Club is doing
away with that craziness and they make
it stupid simple for a few bucks a month
Dollar Shave Club ships killer razors
and other bathroom goodness to your door
one wipe Charlies anybody they tingle in
a good way they also have dr. Carver's
ez shea butter which I really enjoyed I
have sensitive skin but they use bad ass
soothing ingredients to make yo shape
buttery smooth so shave time shave money
