yo guys johnathan they're back with a Q
and a big shout out to everyone across
Twitter Instagram for Smita the
questions and if you're not following me
there feel free to do so so you don't
miss the next video before we hop in
again big emoji hand to LastPass for
support in the channel so it's 2018
please don't use star boy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 as your password
Duncan 3 3 303 is also not accepted 1
whatever you do don't use the same
password across every single website
we're better than that
fortunately LastPass makes it super
simple to store complex passwords seen
enough to remember or write them down
yourself plus if you're worried about
creating a complex password believe me
some of the stuff they generate is like
matrix level stuff on top of that
there's also 2-step authentication so
you can breathe easy and not worry about
those hackers trying to steal your
precious info I've use LastPass forever
now it makes it a breeze jumping from
smartphone a smartphone from laptop the
laptop and I don't have to worry about
forgetting my password and entering my
grandmother's maiden name sorry grandma
so if you can do passwords the
old-fashioned way make sure you guys
check out LastPass again huge thank you
to them for sponsoring today's video and
now onto the qa1 stream desk 6 covered
dude that is amazing question and it's
been way too long since we've had a
dream desk if you're excited for the
next episode drop a like down below I
think I want to kind of bring it back in
the next 1 or 2 months if you guys have
any ideas or themes you want to see drop
a comment down below and maybe it'll
happen
m'kay VHD sounds like a promising
Channel do you lift or can shoot an
every week with a heavy camera on the
road and replace the gym so I don't lift
like Austin not Duncan does but I will
say using the Ronin to extensively over
the past couple weeks it does wear you
out use your core your legs your arms
your shoulders you don't really feel it
while you're doing it but at the end of
the day it's kind of like you got hit by
a bus they do make gadgets like the
ready rig that will help offsets I'm
alone but if you're doing this for hours
on end every single day it is no doubt
going to get you in shape what are your
thoughts on brands like supreme and
Gucci
lyft or uber honestly I downloaded eber
like forever ago in the same way you
google something to me it's like you
over somewhere I have tried lyft like
once or twice always went back to her so
it's not like I'm some goober fanboy
it's just been what I used and that's my
preference at what point did you realize
you need to hire employees did you hit a
certain subscriber number what level of
revenue could you justify having one or
were you just juggling too many projects
that having an extra pair of hands just
made financial sense
honestly JD tech TV kind of just
threatened to beat me up if I didn't
hire him and if you seen him he's huge
would you be interested in a YouTube
team Canada versus a YouTube team USA
tech marathon or competition I have no
idea what we would call a pond or we
would compete on however would be pretty
sweet video idea yes please but we got
to play basketball team USA YouTube
versus Team Canada I'm sorry about demar
derozan maybe you could use that as fuel
so if anyone up there wants to play some
hoops let me know and let's make that
happen
Stephen Williams asks what are the worst
ways to play fortnight's honestly I
still have not played fortnight to this
date but if I were gonna say what is the
worst way it would probably be on that
6700 hour MacBook Pro with a monitor and
that Blackmagic EGP you know one should
use that as a fortnight's setup it is
ridiculous and I see a lot of people
buying MacBook Pros for fortnight don't
do it
buy a gaming laptop you're gonna save
money and have a much better experience
what DxO marked you expect from the
pixel 3 probably like 168 it's gonna be
the newest greatest the XL mark of
all-time
everyone's gonna freak out and then
they're gonna get surpassed which is
your favorite brand of kicks can you go
through your entire shoe collection now
if you missed it I actually posted the
office tour which included this
monstrosity behind me which included
pretty much my entire shoe collection so
we've missed that video I'll drop a link
to that down below
Justine asks a 7-3 why do you love it as
you may have seen across Twitter
Instagram I have been non-stop talking
about the a7 3 it is my new favorite
camera of 2018 for the money there is
absolutely no way you beat that
2 grand full-frame 4k 120 FPS
slow-motion video it is just insane and
the color is phenomenal now I might
offend some people who are all about s
log 2's log 3 cent profile this and a
profile that before whatever reason PP 1
on the ACS I said pp grow up PP 1 on the
a7 3 is magic and it's all I've used if
you cut my galaxy note 9 video on the
road this was caught with the a7 3 I
think it looks super beautiful so if
you're in the market for a camera right
now you're kind of in that $2,000 price
range there is no better option
7:3 and to answer that that is why I
love it who are all the amazing
youtubers that are in the same building
as you so there are actually three
amazing youtubers all in this building
Austin that Duncan why don't I keep
calling that J's two cents in Kevin
Kenton the greatest video game channel
of all time I'm a little biased so if
you guys maybe a seen the windows and
how the sets kind of look a little
similar that's why we all work together
in this great building as one giant
dysfunctional tech family can you do
more what's in my backpack videos so
recently just dropped a video on the air
tech pack we'll just insane like the
amount of stuff you can fit in there is
mind-blowing recently on my trip for the
note 9 I packed pretty much an entire
studio in there the a7 3 batteries ronin
s extra lenses it was just kind of like
how do you fit that much stuff inside
there so that backpack has definitely
passed my test
as far as should I post it more often I
kind of try to keep them once every
couple of months but if you want to see
them more often let me know with a
comment down below MJ or James so as a
Bulls fan I've always been team MJ I
still think he is the greatest all-time
as a basketball player LeBron is an
amazing basketball player but what he's
doing as a human being is like on a
completely different level what he's
doing with the school and those kids
changing lives deserves to be commended
like in this world of craziness and
negativity he is making a difference so
as much as I love MJ as a basketball
player as a whole I am team LeBron right
now
when will the project with Cooper films
come out super excited to watch so for
those who have caught the
behind-the-scenes across Twitter
Instagram this is something that we've
never ever done before it's definitely
something outside of our comfort zone
it's not the normal YouTube shooting
it's a bigger more extensive project and
we're hoping to have this done I would
say in the next month or so if you guys
want to check out the channel early to
where this video is gonna drop you can
subscribe you ready for that I will drop
that link down below but I will say is I
am extremely extremely excited for this
Lakers or Warriors this year I'm sorry
if you're a Lakers fan and you think
they have any chance of beating the
Warriors you are delusional I am going
to pivot that question and say not the
Warriors the Celtics
mark my words mark this video at me drop
me a comment Celtics are taking the
Warriors this year Kyrie Irving Gordon
Hayward Jalen Brown can't forget about
Tatum just someone beat the Warriors
