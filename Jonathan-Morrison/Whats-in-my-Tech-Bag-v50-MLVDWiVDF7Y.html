sponsored by Sennheiser.
Yo guys, Jonathan here.
It is time for a brand
new &quot;What's In My Bag?&quot;
Got some new tech and, more importantly,
a really freaking cool backpack.
So this guy sitting on my back right now,
kind of blending into my shirt,
is the Herschel Supply Co. Apex Lawson.
If you love prime knit,
if you love fly knit,
or if you love yarn and
knitting in general,
you will dig this.
I've been a fan of Herschel
backpacks for a while now
but by far this is my
favorite in terms of looks
and aesthetics because it
is so unique from the rest.
It looks great, it's comfortable,
it's definitely held up
in terms of tossing it
around while traveling;
especially at the airport.
And I gotta say, as far as backpacks,
this is definitely the most
questions I've ever got
in terms of, &quot;what is that on your back?&quot;
Now as far as the backpack,
there aren't a ton
of compartments and
pockets, which I kinda like
for a couple of different reasons.
One, I generally don't
carry that much with me
in the first place so
it's not more than I need.
And two, because it's so simple
it keeps things nice and organized.
Now as far as the main compartment,
you got tons of room for activities.
This will house a laptop up to 15 inches.
I like the fact that
there's plenty of padding
and there's an additional compartment
for things like a tablet or, in my case,
I have a Nintendo Switch
sandwiched inside.
There's also a couple
additional slots I'm using
to carry a Samsung T5
SSD and a battery bank.
And, really, there's not much
that I dislike about this backpack.
So, next up, these as the
Sennheiser HD 4.50 wireless
Bluetooth headphones.
And I feel like I've
been on a plane, like,
every other week for
the past two months now
and these have been my go-to headphones.
First and foremost, these
feature active noise cancellation
which is so, so amazing on airplanes.
It's one of those things
you don't truly appreciate
until you have it and
then you don't have it.
But, regardless, it works
fantastic on these headphones.
On top of that, you are
getting stellar battery life.
So, without noise cancellation,
these will last about 25 hours.
But, if you do want to take advantage
of that noise cancellation,
you're still gonna get about 19 hours
which is crazy and pretty much long enough
for any flight out there.
You have super cushiony ear pads
which are gonna make
these crazy comfortable.
And they also fold up really nicely,
which is perfect for traveling.
More importantly, you guys
that know Sennheiser know
they make great, quality headphones.
So sound quality is also on point as well.
And combine that with
active noise cancellation,
I can't hear a thing right
now and that is the recipe
for a great pair of traveling headphones.
Make sure you guys check
out the link below.
So from there, I got everything
laid out from my backpack
and we will start with the
most boring out of this bunch
and that is the USB-C Macbook Pro charger
that of course goes along with
the 2017 15 inch Macbook Pro.
It's what I use to edit
pretty much all my videos
including the one you
are watching right now.
Got a sweet, leather dbrand skin on here.
If you guys want to check
that out for yourselves
I will drop a link down below.
Alongside the Macbook Pro,
this is the Samsung T5 SSD
which is easily one of my
most used pieces of tech.
It's compact, but this particular model
is packing two terabytes of storage.
So it's what I use to edit pretty much
every single one of my videos.
So the Macbook Pro combined
with these crazy speeds
makes it perfect for, not only on the go,
but also for your desk as well.
And, if you don't need this much storage,
they also come in a few
different flavors as well.
Next, this probably the
most interesting piece
of tech in my bag, this
is my Nintendo Switch
that I take on the road for
traveling, for gaming...
But when I'm back, it's
kind of become the office,
Frankenstein, guinea pig Switch.
In this case, whenever Kevin
wants to get a crazy tweak
or mod, this is what happens to it.
In this case, we got this crazy,
atomic purple, see through d-pad on here.
If you guys wanna learn more about that,
definitely make sure
you check out his video,
which I will link to down below.
Next, this is probably the
weirdest thing in my backpack,
because it is solely used just to charge
my Apple Watch when I'm traveling.
It is a duel purpose battery bank.
What's cool is, there is a
built in Apple Watch charger
right here, so it's almost wireless in
the sense that you pop your Apple Watch on
and you are magically charging.
Now this would usually get
me about four to five charges
with my Apple Watch, so instead of
taking something I plug into a wall,
this is actually all I take on the road
and it's perfect for
charging my Apple Watch.
Next, this guy right
here, from Native Union
is probably the best $50 that I've spent
in a really long time.
It's an extension cord, one.
So, it's super helpful
especially when you're traveling.
You got this nice, braided cable
and, more importantly,
it's like this multi-tool
where you got multiple
USB ports, you got USB-C,
and you actually have
two outlets; one here.
They're evenly spaced.
And it has actually become one
of the most useful things
I've purchased all of 2017.
So if you travel a lot,
this has been so, so useful.
I cannot recommend it enough.
And from there, kind of
rounding everything out,
we got this super tough, rugged
lightning cable from Nomad.
So if you travel a lot,
you're not gonna worry
about this thing breaking
or tearing or ripping apart.
This I use alongside this monster
ANKER power bank which is packing
26,000 milliamps of power.
What's also crazy cool
is there is a USB-C port
and enough juice packing inside this guy
to power a Macbook or Macbook Pro.
Now, it's not gonna be
your main source of power
but it's definitely useful
when you're in a pinch
or in an emergency.
And, definitely, if you
use the Nintendo Switch,
that's gonna be your partner in crime.
