surprisingly snappy and really
attractive but I don't think it's quite
ready for primetime and these are five
ways Apple's new MacBook could be better
so what's up guys Jonathan here with TLD
hope you guys are doing well the new
MacBook is out it's really attractive
it's stupid thin and even though you
shouldn't want one you kind of do now
the first thing that Apple could and
should have done to make this a more
justifiable purchase is a price drop
these start out at $12.99 us and I think
of Apple dropped at to $9.99 that would
be a winner especially considering the
amount of storage you get would be a
really viable alternative to an iPad
I've seen a lot of comments calling the
new MacBook an overpriced glorified
netbook and to an extent it is but you
got to remember you're getting really
fast flash storage even though it's an
Intel M processor it's pretty snappy for
what it is a gigs a ram a beautiful
display and overall a pretty capable
machine just think for the price point
it is too much money now the second
thing Apple could do is add a second USB
C port because aside from the headphone
jack that is all you got it's a little
bit scary for example one really cool
thing that you can do with USB C that
you couldn't on any other MacBook is
charge it with an external battery so I
have this huge monster 25,000 milliamp
hour external battery and that is
powering the macbook and you can charge
that for days the downside though is
because there's only one port with this
and no other adapters that is all you
can do and your alluded to that one poor
but if you had one more now we're
talking now the third thing kind of
segues from USBC and that is an apple
should include the freaking adapter in
the box for the amount of money that you
pay for this machine and the fact that
they are limiting you to one port they
should not charge you $80 for a multi
output adapter it is insane yes the
technology behind USB C is awesome you
can charge it like I mentioned you can
get input output display even but the
fact that they're making you pay another
hundred dollars on top of the already
priced MacBook is just crazy now the
fourth way Apple could improve this
MacBook is to throw out the potato and
put an HD webcam inside I'm not asking
for a 4k or 8k a simple 720p webcam
would do the job but nope Apple stuck a
480p camera inside this new MacBook
quick reference here is a video sample
of the new MacBook camera 480p in all
its glory you guys are watching a 4k
video right now so it's stretched out
but if I were to scale it back down to a
hundred percent and its actual pixels
this is what you get and that's pretty
sad I understand yes there might be some
arguments for broadband or saving data
but the fact of the matter is we're in
2015 and whether you use in Skype or
Google Hangouts you should at least have
720p now the last thing Apple needs to
do is find some sort of MagSafe
replacement those that own a MacBook
with a mac safe power adapter no it is
an immensely valuable feature I know
there's been times when I've tripped and
kicked the crap out of my cable but
luckily with Mac's safe it pops right
out if you do this with a new MacBook
and that USBC cable you who are gonna
jack your new MacBook up now I really
don't see Apple adding that Mac safe
port back to this new MacBook so I don't
know if they're gonna need to adjust or
mess with the USB standard or they could
do something crazy and that's been like
wireless charging which would be an
absolute killer alternative to Mac safe
on top of that one big gripe that I have
with the new MacBook is there is no sort
of LED indicator to show you that your
MacBook is charging again that was
something that was really useful on that
MagSafe adapter because you don't know
if you didn't plug it into the wall
properly that connection might be loose
the cable might be messed you could be
thinking you're charging your MacBook
and in reality you're not and that is
not cool so that about wraps up today's
video definitely stay tuned and
subscribe if you haven't yet so gonna
miss the full review I think I might go
for something along the lines of a
30-day challenge or living with a new
MacBook so if you're excited and you
want to see that make sure to smash that
like button aside from that if you guys
have any questions drop me a line down
below or the absolute best way to get a
hold of me is on twitter at TLD today
other than that this is Jonathan and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
