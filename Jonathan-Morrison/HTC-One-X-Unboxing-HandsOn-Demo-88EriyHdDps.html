an unboxing the HTC One X now this is
the global version so it's rocking a
quad-core CPU once the LTE version rolls
out that will sport a dual-core CPU so
the first thing we're gonna do is get
you a note to a close-up look at the box
and TLD vision so you can see every my
new detail in 1080p here on the side way
of the HTC quietly brilliant slogan on
the front there's not a lot going on we
just get a backside shot of the phone as
well as the HTC One X logo on this side
we got nothing going on and towards the
back it gives you a complete rundown of
all the specs but you guys can see those
online so let's go to begin this
unboxing we have a very minimalistic
approach to the packaging we've got a
little paper cover right here we're
gonna slide off and beneath that it
almost reminds me of kind of like an egg
carton type of cardboard feeling texture
gonna pop the top and there is the HTC
One X I am the one you've been waiting
for that is soon to be determined so
we'll go and flip this out so we can get
the phone out set that aside just for
one minute we'll go and go through the
accessories before we power up the phone
and kind of get a little first
impressions of that your HTC One X
there's a little quick guide on
installing your SIM card most of us know
how to do that but in case you don't
it's nice to include that here we have
some serial number information I will go
ahead and leave that blurred out see you
guys can't see that next up we got some
contact us literature a lot of
literature going on some more literature
boring stuff this is most likely the
warranty statement the safety and
regulatory guide all stamped with the
HTC logo and what do we got here more
cardboard and the accessories so this is
the international charger that did
include a u.s. adapter in the box which
I have somewhere else not sure where I
put that next up we have looks like some
headphones and I also read a article
that's they are no longer shipping these
Beats Audio equipped HTC phones with
these headphones so that's not gonna
really make me lose any sleep so this is
just a generic set of headphones I'm
sure they'll do the job if you want
better audio I'm sure you're gonna have
better headphones anyways
lastly we just got a simple USB cable
and now through the magic video we could
hop over to the HTC
one X all set up so now we have
everything powered up ready to go this
is running the Android 4.0 however it's
not running stock Ice Cream Sandwich
it's got a custom HTC Sense 4 skin on it
so one of the first things I've noticed
differently as opposed to using like the
Galaxy Nexus is the way it handles app
switching so if we go down here these
are all touch capacitive buttons no
physical buttons on there whatsoever but
if we hit this you can see if you
remember on the Galaxy Nexus it wasn't
full screen like it is now so we can
swipe through apps this way I'm not sure
if I like that better or worse but you
guys can get an idea of how that works
so if we want to go to the internet
browser you can see everything runs
smooth and seamlessly the display looks
fantastic 4.7 inches 720p display
I'm sure the video does not do it
justice so we're just loading up the
verge calm fantastic tech website get a
little pinch and zoom action see you
guys can see it's running smooth like
butter we're gonna go back to the home
screen give you guys a little swipe
action so you can see how fluid
everything works again this is a
quad-core CPU once the LTE version rolls
out that will be rocking a dual-core CPU
with LTE of course now go to the back
side get you guys a little tour of the
hardware it definitely feels solid and
well built so let's get a closer look at
the camera this is shooting at 8
megapixels 1080p video recording one
thing I noticed though it kind of lips
out so I'm not sure if you guys can tell
by the video but there's a lot of room
kind of leaves it vulnerable if you bump
that or it could mess it up not sure if
I dig that we have the HTC logo a little
side action shot you guys can see how
thin this phone is it might be a little
big for some people we can see the USB
port right here definitely got a little
curved glass action going on like the
Galaxy Nexus but it does feel a lot
better built here we have the volume
rockers up and down and towards the top
just so you guys can get a front shot of
this we have the sleep/wake button power
button as well as the headphone jack
right here so there's been a quick tour
of this I will definitely be testing
this out for the next week and bring you
guys the full review so if you guys just
