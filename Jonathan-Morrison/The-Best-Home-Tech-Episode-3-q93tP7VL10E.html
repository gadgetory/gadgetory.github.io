welcome back to the best home tech
episode 3 kicking off the list is the
amcrest pro HD Wi-Fi security camera
which packs a ton of features now first
and foremost with this being a camera
none of those features matter at the
video quality isn't good but fortunately
for this it is now my weapon of choice
for shooting crispy video is a sony fs7
so the fact this has a Sony sensor is
awesome you're getting 1080p video with
a super wide 90 degree viewing angle but
what's awesome is it's pan and tilt
feature through the app you can
literally adjust and move the camera
which covers a ton of ground
it also has really solid night vision
you can of course up for cloud recording
through AM crafts but what I found
really useful was the fact that you also
have the option to record to microSD for
those who prefer a physical means of
storage now one thing to keep in mind is
this runs off a 2.4 gigahertz Network so
you may need to create a separate one
when setting this up aside from that
this thing is solid you get a built-in
mics or two-way communication audio in
and out plus the ability to integrate
into an alarm system and all those
things make this a killer choice for a
security camera now after the last
episode of home tech drop I got a ton of
questions regarding lighting behind the
TV and for those curious I'm using
Philips hue
it's actually a combo of two light
strips and two of their bloom lights
which not only beefs up the brightness
but also allows for that awesome
multicolored lighting the light strips
are pretty straightforward they're
adhesive strips that you can cut and
stick pretty much anywhere and then the
bloom lights give you that spotlight
effect and a little more freedom to move
them around and bounce off the wall
there's crazy things you can do like
sink to music or the TV shows but really
I've just enjoyed that ambient vibe it's
added for shooting products mixed
lighting bokeh and crispy footage is a
dangerous trio so the only real downside
of these are the price and there are
definitely cheaper alternatives out
there but I've been extremely satisfied
with these and if you're looking to
spice up your lighting these are hard to
argue with so next up is for those
looking to have a little fun with tech
and this is Anki overdrive
but ANCA did here was take gaming AI
robotics and toys to make this crazy
tech sandwich topped off with magnets
yeah magnet oh so what the magnets come
into play are the tracks themselves
they're fully modular so you can keep it
super simple or go bonkers with your
imagination you're able to control these
mini robotic cars through your
smartphone and battle in real life
versus friends or go head-to-head with
different AI characters which is nuts
because each character has a distinct
driving style and personality and that
right there is what makes Anki overdrive
awesome it bridges the virtual aspect of
gaming with something physical and is a
great way to bring people together
there's also a ton of configurations
between the cars the expansion packs and
the accessories and I'll drop a link
below to all of that for those who want
to check it out aside from that thank
you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to go Jos on that like button
and I'm also giving away an am crest Pro
8d camera the details on how to win are
below and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
