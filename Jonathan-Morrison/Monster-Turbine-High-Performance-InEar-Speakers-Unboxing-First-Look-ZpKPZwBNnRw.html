with Texas lunch and dinner bringing you
an unboxing to the monster turbine high
performance in-ear headphones so I want
to take my buddy psy over at monster I'd
actually monster themselves for hooking
me up and sending these out for review
so I'm gonna bring you guys the unboxing
right now test these out for a couple
days and actually bringing the fool or
if you let you guys know what I think of
them so let's go ahead and quit yappin
see what's inside the box it doesn't
look too crazy as always with monster
they're gonna package it really well so
just gonna basically cut the little
plastic wrap off and then it should be
pretty easy to open up beyond that so
I'm pretty excited to check these out
some actually have the Apple in their
headphones right now inner headphones
excuse me and I'm curious to try these
out compared to that so those so there's
the outer part of the box this gives you
an overview and the features of the
headphones some testimonials right there
nice packaging as always from Monster
and then we get Monster turbine there
and it should just kind of slide open
the see if it does okay there's a little
tab right here here more and then the
tab should pop open so life is too short
to listen to bad headphones got agree
with that and again here's for the love
of music a little kind of overview of
the headphones the message from the main
guy at Monster no elite pretty cool a
little nice little read there then it
looks like we got a nice little carrying
case which is cool that's actually
something that you can throw in your
pocket is gonna not be too over-the-top
not too big you can throw it in a
backpack whatever you're doing a nice
little addition from Monster we also get
a carrying pouch so I guess we got that
kind of the classy one if you're rocking
those at the office and then we got more
just a little pouch same little saying
right that life is too short to listen
to bad headphones and then we have the
headphones themselves and some extra
earbuds it's going to go to the
accessories first so it looks like
they're gonna custom tailor to fit your
ear more ear buds always cool to have
those and we got the warranty
information an important message not to
blast your ears and go deaf and on a
QuickStart guide
more warranty info for the turbine
headphones so they give you a lot of
content with this let's see what's in
here what we look at the actual
headphones themselves so again more
testimonials and kind of everything
going over the headphones themselves and
then we have the headphones actually
pull these up see what they look like
got a nice little velvet enclosure right
here so we can slide these through there
alright so I switch camera angles real
quick so you guys can get a little
close-up of these you guys can see
here's the gold-plated Jack with turbine
right there you guys can see that
clearly as we take a look at the actual
Yurbuds themselves you guys can see red
and blue right and left so I'm curious
to see how these are gonna feel how
they're gonna sound I'm pretty excited
like I said but other than that let's
the unboxing go and stay tuned for the
full review to these I'll have that out
posted shortly so as always feel free to
subscribe and I'll catch you guys later
