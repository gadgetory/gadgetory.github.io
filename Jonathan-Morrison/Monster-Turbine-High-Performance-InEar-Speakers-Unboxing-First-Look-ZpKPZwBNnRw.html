with Texas lunch and dinner bringing you
an unboxing to the monster turbine high
performance in-ear headphones so I want
to take my buddy sigh over at monster
I'd actually monster themselves for
hooking me up and sending these out for
review so imma bring you guys the
unboxing right now test these out for a
couple days and actually bringing the
fool review let you guys know where I
think of them so let's go ahead and
knock what you happen see what's inside
the box doesn't look too crazy as always
with monster they're gonna package it
really well so just gonna basically cut
the little plastic wrap off and then it
should be pretty easy to open up beyond
that so I'm pretty excited to check
these out of them per actually have the
Apple in your headphones right now in
your headphones excuse me I'm curious to
try these out compared to that so those
so there's the outer part of the box
just gives you overview of the features
of the headphones some testimonials
right there nice packaging as always
from monster then we get monster turbine
there and it should just kind of slide
open to see if it does okay there's a
little tab right here here more and then
the tab should pop open so life is too
short to listen to bad headphones got
agree with that and again here's for the
love of music a little kind of overview
of the headphones the message from the
main guy at monster no elite pretty cool
a little nice little read there and it
looks like we get a nice little carrying
case which is cool that's actually
something that you can throw in your
pocket is going to not be too
over-the-top not too big you can donate
a backpack whatever you're doing a nice
little addition from monster we also get
a carrying pouch so I guess we got the
kind of the classy one if you're rocking
those at the office and then we got more
just a little pouch same little saying
right that life is too short to listen
to bad headphones then we have the
headphones themselves and some extra ear
buds it's going to go to the accessories
first so it looks like they're going to
custom tailor to fit your ear more
earbuds always cool to have those and we
got the warranty information an
important message not to blast your ears
and go deaf on a quick start guide
more warranty info for the turbine
headphones so they give you a lot of
content with this see what's in here
before we look at the actual headphones
themselves so again more testimonials
and kind of everything going over the
headphones themselves and then we have
headphones actually pull these up see
what they look like got a nice little
velvet enclosure right here so we can
slide these through there alright so I
switch camera angles real quick so you
guys can get a little close up of these
you guys can see here's the gold-plated
Jack what turbine right there you guys
can see that clearly as we take a look
at the actual yurbuds themselves you
guys can see red and blue right and left
so I'm curious to see how this is going
to feel how they're going to sound I'm
pretty excited like i said but other
than that lets the unboxing go and stay
tuned for the full review of these i'll
have that out posted shortly so as
always feel free to subscribe and I'll
catch you guys later
