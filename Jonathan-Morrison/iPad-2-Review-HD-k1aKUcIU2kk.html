with TLD bringing you quite possibly the
most important meal of the day today I'm
bringing you the full review to the
brand new iPad 2 which comes in two
different flavors white or black you can
pick this up 16 32 or 64 gigabytes and
you can either choose Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi
plus 3G and choose your poison with AT&amp;amp;T
or Verizon the iPad 2 features a
resolution of 1024 by 768 across a nine
point seven inch LED backlit display on
the inside of the iPad we get a
dual-core one gigahertz a5 apple
processor now along with the new
dual-core CPU we get dual core graphics
processing apple claims is to be nine
times faster
according to benchmarks it's actually
about 6 times faster than the previous
iteration in the iPad the biggest thing
here though it's actually almost four
times faster than the new Motorola Xoom
very impressive nonetheless the iPad 2
is insanely thin come in at 0.34 inches
thick weighs under a pound and a half
and is actually thinner than the iPhone
4 on the bottom of the iPad you get your
traditional Apple 30-pin dock connector
and to the left of that is a much
improved speaker you don't get so much
of a volume increase but it definitely
is clearer from left to right we get the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack the
built-in microphone the rear-facing HD
camera which shoots at 720p 30 frames
per second just above that is the
wake/sleep button into the right of that
is the mute button alongside with the
volume rockers up and down on the front
of the iPad we get the front-facing VGA
quality camera which you're going to use
for FaceTime video chat or photobooth
which will open up right now so you guys
can get an example of how it works the
camera isn't great by any means don't
expect to replace your Canon or your
Nikon but photo booth is actually a lot
of fun you guys can see me looking like
a goofball right here oh yeah you can
also look like the YouTube sensation
beater Kiki 199 52 now that we've seen
some of the pictures go to check out the
video quality right now we're filming
off the front-facing VGA camera in
landscape mode using the built-in
internal mic got a little bit of wind
going on the background so you guys can
see how that picks that up let's go to
move it to portrait this is kind of an
idea of how to look and sound kind of in
a FaceTime environment let's go and jump
over to the rear-facing HD camera
alright so we're on the rear-facing
camera this is a
720p this is melody slip doggy get a
super close-up say hi to the TLD viewers
you're going to be watched on YouTube
bless you so we are shooting 720p 30
frames per second like I mentioned if
you have a good lighting situation it's
going to look pretty decent to be honest
the camera is kind of stuck in low light
but if you have good lighting like I
said it's going to look pretty good
alongside the HD camera comes iMovie for
the iPad this is a $5 paid application
totally worth the money though very
nicely laid out what you're seeing right
now is footage from Matt's Macintosh he
actually used nothing but the iPads
camera and iMovie for the iPad to create
one of his reviews I will post a link to
check out that video as well as his
channel he puts out some great content
next up is GarageBand for the iPad this
is also a five dollar application that's
a lot of fun it's also a eight track
multitrack recorder so you can see how
easy it is to adjust levels on the fly
you
here's an example of smart drums for
GarageBand on the iPad you can
manipulate the drums get random patterns
pretty cool for songwriter you can move
the kicks and snares changing from
simple complex loud and quiet overall
had a lot of fun playing with GarageBand
definitely go pick this app up if you
got the iPad
the iPad 2 ships with iOS 4.3 here's a
quick snippet of multitasking how easy
it is to adjust brightness on the fly
alongside the improved graphics on the
iPad 2 you get a 3-axis gyroscope with
an accelerometer so gaming is absolutely
awesome on the iPad 2 and there's tons
and tons of apps in the App Store one of
the best parts about owning an iPad
here's a quick example of smart covers
for the iPad I think they're awesome
they snap on via magnets you can wake
and turn off your iPad just by closing
the cover overall I'd say the iPad 2 is
definitely a worthy upgrade if you own
the iPad 1 I wouldn't necessarily go run
out and sell your iPad to go get this
one unless you really look forward to
the front facing of the rear facing
cameras for FaceTime or you do a lot of
gaming because the graphics has
definitely improved the iPad is super
light it feels really good in your hands
you can pick this up in white or black I
would personally recommend it really
enjoying the iPad 2 so far thanks for
watching this review feel free to
subscribe if you haven't already make
sure to check out a few different videos
covering the iPad the unboxing if you
missed that and I'll catch you guys
later
