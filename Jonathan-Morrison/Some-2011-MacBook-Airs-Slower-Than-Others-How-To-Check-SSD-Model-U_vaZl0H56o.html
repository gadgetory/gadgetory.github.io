tle with some not so good news for some
of you macbook air owners if you watched
my video yesterday on how fast the new
macbook airs are for 2011 you'll notice
for the read/write speeds I got some
pretty impressive numbers for the write
speeds I got about 250 megabytes per
second and for the read speeds I got
about 270 megabytes per second so that
was the 11 inch model this is the
13-inch model that you guys are
witnessing right now so go ahead and run
this test and see if anything looks
funky or off so right off the bat you
can see that is significantly slower
let's see we're at caps off at 150 759
megabytes per second so that's nearly a
hundred megabytes per second slower and
for the read speeds cap out a 208 that's
about what 62 megabytes per second
slower so what is a huge difference I
did some research and found out there's
actually two different SSD models that
Apple's thrown in these macbook airs so
i'm going to show you guys how to make
sure which SSD you got so we're gonna
have to about this mac tab more info on
this looks a little bit different
because we are in line right here so
we're going to head down to system
report this will bring us back to the
more familiar screen I'd head down to
serial ata and from here that's going to
show us the model number so right here
Apple SSD TS 128 see that is the slower
toshiba model that's the one from the
test you guys just saw right now now on
the other 11 inch macbook air that i
tested that model is the sm 128 see that
is the faster samsung model with the
read speeds about 250 270 so i just
wanted to make this video to let you
guys know if he did pick up a new
macbook air if you could please check
out which model number you have let me
know in a comment down below to see if
this consistent with the 13 inch models
or it is on both the 11 and 13 inch
models from what i've seen so far most
of the 11 inch models have the better
faster SSD from samsung and most of the
13-inch model seems to have the slower
toshiba model so if you guys enjoyed
this video if you found it helpful make
sure to please tweet this out so it
helps others that link is down below
feel free to subscribe if you're new to
watching and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
