with TLD last week I unboxed a new quad
core i5 27-inch iMac this week I got my
hands on a new core i7 iMac 27-inch so
this comes in clocked at 2.9 3 gigahertz
overclocked to 3.2 I ordered it at stock
it as a 5750 a terabyte hard drive space
and also four gigs around I'm gonna
upgrade that later so other than that
let's go ahead and jump right into the
unbox so we have this thing flipped
around let's go ahead and make the
incision but we go in this up if you
guys saw the last time box seems to be
pretty similar you're not going to be
able to tell any of the internal
differences just from the unboxing but a
lot of people want to see this so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that this is the
keyboard the mouse let's go inside that
aside we're going to go ahead and do
this backwards oh I saw her last week
with the accessory the iMac
they always pack this really well it has
a styrofoam for these in there so that
way like I said last time with the EPS
guy is a d-bag and misses your throat
your box around its gonna stay very well
protected so very nice on Apple's part
let's go ahead
so like I said in Prior videos this
27-inch screen 2560 by 1440 resolution
is an axe absolute beast and looking at
it after a while instead of mind blowing
and I really do enjoy working on the
screen this size as far as screen real
estate
I am productivity so put this guy around
there's the iMac itself here is the
power cable and here are the accessories
so let's go ahead and open this up so if
you guys don't know by now I optics you
order the wired keyboard just because I
do prefer that now it does come standard
with the wireless but I chose to get the
wire just because of personal preference
and it does come again with the magic
mouse standard back phone up let this
come loaded up with batteries so very
nice I have a big fan of the Magic Mouse
but I do prefer the wired keyboard not
because of the wired obviously but
because I do like the number pad so
other than that you have your everything
back which comes with your starter guide
quick guide and then all your install
discs if you ever need to reinstall and
then you have a cleaning cloth to wipe
down your iMac and then besides that you
have a little QuickStart guide on the
finger gestures for the Magic Mouse so
that's a quick unboxing hope you guys
enjoyed it like I said this is me real
quick whenever some quick specs with you
but I haven't have a full review of it
compared with the i-5 a lot of videos on
this so stay tuned for those I
appreciate you guys to check out the
video and I'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
