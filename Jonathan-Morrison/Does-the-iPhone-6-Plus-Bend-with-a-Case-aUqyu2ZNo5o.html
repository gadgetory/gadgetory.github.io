you guys are doing well so just last
week there were two potential problems
with the iPhone 6 design one was the
lack of chamfers which created a
possibility of dropping your phone
making a slippery lack of grip and the
second was a protruding camera lens
where if you would lie your phone flat
on the table it's gonna wobble around
like crazy and now there's a third
potential problem that is the
possibility of a 6 plus actually bending
so we're here to find out if a case is a
solution so a lot of people have
actually been reporting that this
problem started with their front pocket
so I got my buddy Austin No Pants
evidence who's wearing skinny jeans
right now and we're gonna go ahead and
put the six plus with the case in my
front pocket now it might seem like a
pretty easy test or eventually broken a
phone it was the original Moto X in my
front pocket before my G was go-karting
but with some real extreme sitting so
close now before I have Austin stood I
just want to quickly show you guys this
is the spigen tough Armour for these six
plus the whole point of this is to add
some rigidity to the six plus so
hopefully we'll be able to prevent that
bending as you guys can see if we bend
this a little bit it's going to add some
pretty solid housing to what is
obviously not so solid on that aluminum
all right I think the extreme sitting is
done phone looks pretty decent I don't
see any major damage to the case so
let's pop it out and see what looks like
no I don't see anything
looks pretty much untouched so looks
like my extreme sitting
wasn't quite extreme enough so now I got
my buddy Judd raike hey Quinton we're
moving on to round 2 which is going to
be even more extreme than extreme
sitting this is the back pocket that's
what we were surprised to learn a lot of
people actually put their phones in
their back pocket die phone six is a
pretty sketchy phone throw in your back
pocket but since people are doing it
we've got to test it out
and heard a little crack there hopefully
it's just a case
a little skier to check that out I gotta
have that crack I don't know there's no
cracks to the screen Rodan case let's
climb heel it out
hopefully my heart drop a little bit at
first well either way it looks like it
has survived test 1 &amp;amp; 2 so now we're
going to go to the extreme tests so
earlier if you missed it loo from unbox
therapy started this entire band craze
and I was genuinely curious to see if a
case would solve it you didn't miss his
video though I'll have it linked down
below but now we're going to recreate
that fend test but with a case and see
if it solves a problem
that's Benny
who you that didn't sound good
I'm really sorry about this I'm sorry
too serious I'm sorry to Siri
that's been part like a possibly bending
please try to get it a little while okay
sir we're gonna take it out that was
painful
how's people and I'm thinking not even
the case solved it just from taking it
out of a case I mean I mean it's not
actually okay if we look at it that's
not terrible it's not as drastic as a
loose video and I was going as hard as I
possibly could so you can see there's
definitely a little bit of a bend but
for a fact it definitely looks like at
least adding the case will remedy that
to some extent it's not going to
permanently fix it or be the end-all
be-all but it is going to help that so
there you guys go it's not going to 100%
solve the problem but I think for
everyday situations not all of you guys
are going to Hulk smash or try to bend
the crap out of your phone it's going to
provide the protection that you need I'm
actually teaming up with spigen to give
away 50 of these cases either iPhone 6
or 6 plus you guys can win one by
checking out the link below I'll have a
slew of different iPhone 6 and 6 plus
cases all you got to do is go find out
which case you want come back in the
comments tell me which one that I will
select 50 random winners aside from that
if you guys have any questions
everything will be recapped
in the description thanks again this is
Jonathan with TLD and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
