got a chance to take a hands-on first
look that apogee is upcoming one for iOS
and Mac as a follow-up to the original
one which I actually currently own and
really enjoy the second gen features an
improved die cast aluminum body as
opposed to a plastic body on the
original one then you also get new
circuitry and a new mic capsule which
both ultimately lead to improved sound
quality now I know the original one can
be hacked to connect to an iPad with
Apple's USB camera connection kit B also
missed important things like phantom
power for condenser mics and it also
drained battery insanely quick now the
second gen one is designed from the
inside out to work with iOS devices so
it'll actually charge your iPad iPhone
or iPod Touch when you're using the ones
DC adapter or you can even run it
remotely off of a couple double-a
batteries now like the original one you
get a built-in condenser microphone so
you can get high quality recordings
without even having to buy an additional
microphone if you didn't want to you
also get two analog inputs via a
breakout cable so you get a quarter-inch
Heisey instrument input with up to 45
decibels again and then you also get an
XLR mic inputs with a stellar mic pre
that gives you up to a massive 62
decibels again now unlike the original
one where you could only record one of
those inputs at a time on the second gen
one you can now record those two inputs
simultaneously which is definitely a
welcomed improvement so you combine all
thats with Apogee 24-bit 96k low hertz
atd and d2 a conversion you get arguably
the best audio interface for under 400
bucks on the market for both iOS and Mac
which also doubles as a high-quality DAC
now like I said I do currently own the
original one so I'm extremely excited to
get my hands on the new one test it out
review it do some comparisons and some
demos so if you guys want to see that
you guys can let me know by a hitting
that like button or you leaving me a
comment and then B you guys can make
sure to subscribe so you don't miss the
full review and obviously more tech
content to come aside from that thank
