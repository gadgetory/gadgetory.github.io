mean Tim Cook and by Demi wrong I mean
there was no redesigned iphone 5 all we
saw today was the iphone 4s I told you
guys about yesterday a lot you guys
argue with me I was gonna be wrong but I
wasn't always thought was the iphone 4s
so I got all my notes from the event
today so it is dubbed the iphone 4s same
right and display same glass back but
it's all new internal so we saw that
dual-core a5 processor dual core
graphics so that's going to lead to a
two times faster cpu seven times faster
graphics we're gonna get eight hours of
talk time but it's 3g only confirming
that there is no 4g iphone this home is
gonna swing both ways and by that i mean
it's going to be both gsm and cdma
compatible so you can switch back and
forth between AT&amp;amp;T Verizon that's
actually cool on another up note it's
going to have an awesome 8 megapixel
camera with a resolution of 32 64 x 2448
with a 2.4 f-stop as far as the aperture
goes will actually see 1080p video
recording along with image stabilization
noise reduction one of the cooler things
is wireless airplay so no longer do you
need that hdmi cable you can actually
play a game from your phone to your TV
so that's actually pretty awesome now
the big thing Apple push was Siri their
voice control and I got a mint it
actually looks pretty awesome it's kind
of weird at the same time basically you
talk to your phone to set a text your
calendar anything you can talk to your
phone and can set it up you can ask
questions supposedly it's going to
recognize your voice so my question for
you iphone 4s is where is the iphone 5
there's a ton of information on Syria so
if you guys want more info on that
there's a link down below in description
other than that it is available on
october fourteenth it'll be available
for AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and Sprint so they got
its but there was no exclusive iphone 5
there was no iphone 5 at all if you guys
have found a little bummed not to worry
it has 14 hours of to gtalk time as well
as they got rid of the death grip so
it's all awesome stuff but in all
seriousness there was a little bit
disappointing I wouldn't pick it up
because I have to review it so I will
more than likely be picking up I 32
gigabytes white iphone 4s with AT&amp;amp;T
since there is no 4g anywhere let me
know if this halts your decision of
picking one up or if you still will be
buying one to shoot me a comment down
below other than that make sure to check
out my first look at NBA 2k12 I was
actually up all night actually haven't
slept made a pretty cool video and it's
a good and check that out here and I
will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
