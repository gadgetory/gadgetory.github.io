TLD back with a review of the spigen sgp
neo hybrid IX for the iphone 5 which in
terms of uniqueness and given your
iphone a different look this has
definitely been one of my favorites that
I've got a chance to check out so far
now this case is two parts one piece is
silicone which is all squishy like and
is going to protect against shock
absorption and then the second piece is
polycarbonate which feels more like a
hard plastic and that's going to
actually protect against the scratches
these are interchangeable as well so if
you get bored with the colors you can
actually swap these out and mix and
match those pieces now once everything
is all installed you can see it does
provide a really nice lip so once you're
setting the phone doubt on either side
there's going to be no contact on the
screen or the back now to top that off
not only do they include a front screen
protector but they also include a back
protection film as well the front screen
shield works fantastic although if you
do have oily hands or you want better
protection I'd probably check out the
glass tea or glass TR in addition to
this because that pretty much resists
fingerprints and is probably the best
iphone screen show you can get your
hands on the back shield works solid as
well although on the black iphone 5 you
can see there's a little bit of a halo
effect going on which is slightly
annoying but if you do want to rock a
bumper style case and make sure you
don't scratch your iphone this does a
job as advertised now if you're curious
about this color at home button they
include a three pack of these and this
kind of add to the uniqueness of the
case look and also protects it and then
raises it up slightly so it gives a
little bit better feedback response
overall it's a solid case and in terms
of uniqueness I would get tons of
questions but I would bring this out in
public in terms of what is that because
you can't find it and Best Buy or
anything now if you're not a fan of
bumper style cases in general you're
probably going to want to look elsewhere
of a few different links to my favorite
case options down below but if you do
like the idea of a bumper style case and
you like how this looks I can definitely
recommend checking it out I'll have
links to the pricing availability where
you can pick these up as well as the
color options link down below as well

appreciated and I'll see you guys
