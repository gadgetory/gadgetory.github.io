Squarespace hey guys john here with TLD
hope you guys are doing well I am back
with some 4k content now initially when
the Mac Pro came out I really wanted not
necessarily needed but wanted a 4k
display to go alongside it simply
because I had fall in love with higher
resolution gadgets whether it's a
smartphone tablet or laptop the more
pixels there are the more I seem to
enjoy it now the problem with the Mac
Pro at a 4k display is one prices war
and obviously still are crazy expensive
in - there really wasn't still is an
officially support out of the box but
the upcoming 10.9 that three version of
Mavericks completely changes that now
before I jump into the fine details of
the video let me backtrack a couple
weeks back I'd actually found the Asus
PQ 3 2 1 q 4k display on an open box
discount for around 2,200 bucks on
Newegg which obviously is still
expensive but was about 1,300 bucks off
the actual selling price when the
monitor initially came out with that
said even with knowing that really
wasn't a whole lot of support for 4k
displays because the discount was so big
I really couldn't pass it up so I picked
one up so I could try it out for myself
so I got it in was super excited I got
everything set up got it running at 60
Hertz and after about 30 minutes to an
hour
I had it packed up and ready to go back
so by now I'm sure you're asking why why
would you return it if you loved higher
resolution displays and what I want you
to do now is actually make sure you are
watching this video full screen so go to
take a second click the full screen and
make sure you're doing that and this is
what it looks like running at the native
3840 by 2160 now don't get me wrong
high resolution pictures and obviously
4k video look amazing on the 4k display
and being able to have a full 1080p
video window inside the actual display
maxed out with tons more real estate is
awesome but if you're looking at any
kind of text or UI elements it is just
simply way too small you essentially
have to have your face glued up close to
the screen way closer than you should be
to make out the text and it really just
wasn't a good experience so I had
everything packed up I had the RMA ready
to go but I got busy and kind of lagged
on the return and sure and behold a
couple weeks later apples seated out the
10.9 dot
version of Mavericks which of course
includes support for 4k displays so what
I mean by that if anybody has used a
retina MacBook Pro you know that even
though it has a super high resolution
display it actually takes that real
estate and scales it down into a usable
area that's super dense and super pixel
filled so hopefully you're still
watching in full-screen mode and now in
addition to the native 3840 by 2160
there are four additional modes so first
up is 3200 by 1800 and the crazy thing
is is it actually renders the entire
image at 6400 by 3600 and then scales it
down to fit into the 4k display now
obviously you cannot see that screenshot
to the full potential in this video but
I will have an uncompressed full
resolution screenshot linked down below
just in case anyone is interested in
checking that out next up is a 2560 by
1440 mode so this actually renders the
entire image at 50 120 by 28 80 and how
it works as the text and UI elements are
actually drawn in at four times the size
to each way so essentially you got to
visualize it as there are four pixels
crammed into one pixel of real estate
now the cool thing however is with
applications that support this for video
and photo that's actually drawn in at
one time so you actually get the full
resolution so like I talked about you
could have a full 1080p window plane
maxed out at full resolution and still
have a ton more real estate to work with
there's also 1080p and 720p scaling
modes you can actually hack at 1080p
high DPI mode before this came out but I
really wasn't a fan of that something
about a 1080p scale on a massive 32 inch
screen just does not look good at all
obviously 720p is going to be even worse
now between the 1800 P and 1440p modes
for actually doing work I really really
enjoyed that 3200 by 1800 real estate
there was a lot of room it wasn't as
small as full native resolution but you
could still get a lot done now as far as
the 1440p mode I think most users would
end up liking this the best simply
because text and UI elements are most
enjoyable it's nice and big nice and
crisp and you don't have to sit super
close to your screen to read anything so
hopefully now you have a little better
idea of how it works and if you are
looking to pick up a 4k display in the
future for your mac pro you can rest
easy because there is solid support
coming very soon now myself I'm a little
torn because even with this that still
maybe a month or two away before the
official
so release comes out and even though I
really really really enjoy the high DPI
scaling modes on this I don't know if
the added real-estate is really going to
increase my productivity as far as the
price to productivity goes now another
reason I'm leaning towards returning the
ASIS mater is because with this support
it also gives us a hint and hope that
Apple should release a 4k Thunderbolt
Display very soon and one of the reasons
I am a huge fan of the Thunderbolt
Display is the fact that it acts as a
giant hub so in addition to being a
beautiful monitor it also gives you
extra Thunderbolt ports USB ports and
acts like I said as a hub for your Mac
Pro as many of you guys may have seen
with my setup video I have the universal
audio Apollo twins set up by a
thunderbolt into these under Bowl
display it's a nice clean quick access
to it and with the asus monitor it kind
of hinders my setup a little bit so
that's one of the reasons I am looking
forward to an updated Thunderbolt
Display with obviously 4k support aside
from that if you guys enjoyed the video
you found it helpful
or you just feel like being awesome make
sure to hit that like button it is much
appreciated and real quick before I hop
out of here I'm gonna have a huge shout

again thank you guys very much for
watching if you guys have any questions
on the Mac Pro 4k displays or tech in
general hit me up with a question down

YouTube comments as possible but it does
get a little bit hectic sometime so the
absolute best way to get a hold of me is
on twitter at TLD today I am on there
all the time and you will more than
likely get a response also let me know
what I should do with the 4k display
should I return the Asus monitor and
wait for Apple to hopefully come out
with one of their own soon or should I
keep it and cross my fingers that they
roll out the 10.9
update very soon again this is Jonathan
with TLD thank you guys very much for
watching and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
