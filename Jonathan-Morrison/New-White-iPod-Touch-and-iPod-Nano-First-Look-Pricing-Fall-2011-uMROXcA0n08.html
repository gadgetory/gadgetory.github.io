TLD and alongside the iphone4s
announcement Apple made some minor
tweaks to the iPod Nano as well as the
iPod touch when I say minor tweaks there
were exactly just that two minor tweaks
before the iPod Nano it actually dropped
20 bucks so the old a geek model that
was 149 is now 129 and the 16 gigabyte
model that was 179 is now 149 for the
tweaks on the iPod Nano they made the
icons bigger so supposedly it's easier
to navigate and besides that they added
16 new clock screens which are kind of
cheesy although I do kind of dig the
Mickey Mouse wanna cuz I'm a huge Disney
fan if you actually had over to Apple
site actually moves in real time which
is kind of cool I post a link down below
now from the iPod touch aside from a
price drop and a new white model they
pretty much stayed exactly the same all
the exact same hardware so we get the
same 720p video recording that we did
last year it's the same crappy camera as
far as pictures ago it's the same
processor same graphics so nothing new
has come there and more than likely we
will not be seeing Apple's Siri voice
enabled software on the iPod touch
pricing is as follows the 8 gigabyte
iPod touch either white or black is
going to run you a hundred ninety-nine
bucks that's down from 229 the 32
gigabyte model is gonna cost you $2.99
and the 64 gigabyte model will cost you
399 bucks
that pretty much wraps it up for the
iPod announcement there was no mention
of the shuffle or the iPod Classic they
haven't died yet there's Stone Apple's
website but there was no update to them
even if it was minor if you miss the
announcement on the iPhone 4s code and
click here to check out all the details
other than that feel free to subscribe
and I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
