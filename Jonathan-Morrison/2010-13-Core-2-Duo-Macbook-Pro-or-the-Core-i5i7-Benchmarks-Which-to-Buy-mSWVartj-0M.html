TLD I've had a lot of requests regard to
13 years core2duo macbook pro and if i
could compare it to the bigger brothers
the i7 and the i-5 now I'd love to be
able to get my hands on all three models
but unfortunately I can't at the moment
so I'm bringing you guys the next best
thing I got my hands on my girlfriend's
old Core 2 Duo 2008 MacBook Pro so I'm
going to do some benchmarks for you guys
the speed differences and you guys would
be surprised it is a big difference so
let's go ahead and check it out now
aside from the slight hardware bumps the
2008 MacBook Pro has the exact same Core
2 Duo processor as a new 13-inch models
let's go ahead and jump in and see the
differences initially you guys looking
at this it's not too much different the
Core 2 Duo has a 2.4 gigahertz processor
the same as the i5 now the i7 is
slightly faster at 2.66 but as we move
on you guys will see the difference the
Core 2 Duo has no turbo boost so it caps
out at 2.4 gigahertz whereas the Core i5
and the i7 give you a significant boost
when you need it now the same goes for a
hyper setting on the core i5 and the i7
the OS sees it as a quad core CPU with
two physical to virtual the Core 2 Duo
only has two cores and that is it the
2008 MacBook Pro which I'm using in this
video had a geforce 8600 GT this is very
comparable to the new 320 s that are in
the 13-inch models this way you guys can
get an idea of how it performs now in
Geekbench 64 the Core 2 Duo was smoked
by the i5 and the i7 with the i7 almost
doubling it as we move on to Cinebench
CPUs the core i7 almost doubles it again
and you guys can see the Core i5 is
still significantly faster than the Core
2 Duo as we jump over to the graphics
card Department the Core i5 and the core
i7 nearly doubled it as far as frames
per second this means smoother playback
for video games just in case you guys
are wondering that on the 13-inch models
now we get to a handbrake and you can
see the i7 and the if' I've absolutely
smoked it again the Core 2 Duo had an
export of 22 minutes while the core i5
came in at 15 and the i7 at 13
same thing in compressor four minutes
and three seconds for the Core 2 Duo
two minutes and 30 seconds for the core
i5 and all the way down to a minute 49
seconds for the core i7 for an iMovie
import the Core 2 Duo took 65 seconds
the
I 5 took 52 seconds and the core i7 took
41 seconds as we move on to the export
this is where you guys can see the huge
difference 11 minutes 34 seconds for the
Core 2 Duo 5 minutes for the i-5 and
only 3 minutes 43 seconds for the core
i7 alright now you guys can see there's
a huge difference as far as performance
goes between the Core 2 Duo the i-5 and
the i7 obviously the 2010 models are
gonna be slightly faster but you guys
have a ballpark of how they're gonna
perform compared to the other models now
I don't think the 13-inch model is a bad
place to go I think if you're doing web
email stuff like that it's a great
little portable computer plus it's
easier to transport because of the size
but if you guys are looking to do
multitasking heavier tasks the i-5 and
the i7 are much more future-proof I
definitely say it's worth the upgrade to
go that route if you can do it so if you
guys gotta save up for another month or
two to get the i-5 or the i7 I'd say do
that it's more future proof like I had
mentioned and it's just going to be a
better investment for you I hope this
helped I hope you guys enjoyed the video
like always feel free to subscribe I got
much more on the way
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
