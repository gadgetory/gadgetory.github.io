yeah tech fest luncheon didn't think we
can all agree that was awesome sauce so
hey guys this is Javed here with TLD got
the winners to the iRig mic contest that
we threw a few weeks back honestly hands
down this was the hardest contest we've
ever had as far as picking winners
because there are so many awesome
entries I personally want to thank each
and every one of you guys that enters
their almost a hundred and you guys are
all completely awesome with that being
said getting it to the first place
winner I think most to you guys would
agree if you saw his videos and that is
Matt's McIntosh come on now paint
strippers with iPods that is hands down
first place material actually Matt
though I had sent me a prior message
that for some reason if he had happened
to when he really didn't want the prize
you just want to do it for fun so what
I'm gonna do is actually hand it over to
Matt as a guest host he's gonna pick his
favorite for the first prize winner
what's up guys well in contests like
this it's always hard to pick a favor
just because you know people spend so
much hard work and effort to make their
entries but if I had to pick just one
it's going to be from youtuber Anton man
I really liked how his combined both the
musical talent with the harmonies with
the tech savviness of bringing those
tracks together and a sense of humor so
congrats Anton I hope you enjoy your
microphone now back over to Jonathan so
big shout out to Matt not only for
making an awesome video but for being
kind enough to give his prize away his
channel is down below he makes a lot of
awesome stuff on that same note the beat
formats video was created by King Atlas
89 he actually started a new show on his
channel called music Mondays where he
makes and produces beats for you guys to
use in your videos so go to give him
some love check out his channel his link
is also down below and let's get on to
the second prize winner and actually
narrowed it down to two people so I got
my notes here right now I'd rather than
pull my hair out to pick one of those
guys what I did was actually include the
irish monk they sent me for review as an
extra giveaway price for this contest so
to you guys are actually winning so
there's total of three guys that are
winning iRig mic so those two are AP je
l 389 i did a Gabe
and kind of twist with TLD and he did a
really good job singing I would like to
see him sing more so that's why I'm
sending you the iRig mic and the other
person is I'm so J Reid he actually did
his own rap which is actually really
good so I chose these two because I
think I got a lot of potential and I
would like to see them both sing more
hopefully the iRig mic will help them do
that but with that being said i want to
give kind of some bonus prizes and the
first person i want to give a shout out
to was Joe main Jeannie he was probably
hands down my favorite video as far as
making me laugh and I had our time not
picking him first I saw actually buddy
that you had a macbook pro in your video
so i wanted to do is send you this
Griffin elevator it's a little lift
stand for your macbook pro I red.mike so
I can sing on my bike John you better
pick me oh I will take away my life I
just giving you John I don't take away
that
but you know since you'll know that
we're here I could have my wife go pick
you up Luna now it's cheap so you guys
make sure to check out his contest entry
down below I also want to do some itunes
gift cards kind of as runner-up prizes
because I really honestly had a hard
time choosing so I'm gonna give for ten
dollar iTunes gift cards and those who
go to da ad 93 did a little Busta Rhymes

I'm giving you an itunes gift card for
ten dollars tech do for not actually

then last but not least for the itunes
gift card is dave 0156 date he actually
did a really cool beatbox with his kid
and I want to say date that was one of
my favorite you sent kind of a cool
message as well so you're getting a
ten-dollar itunes gift card as well and
there were so many other good things in
this contest we had snazzy q doing a
gangster rap we had appt chat dancing as
well as a shoutout to jo dietrich he had
a justin bieber song that was pretty
funny so i wanna give a shout out to you
and then a couple quick shout outs i
want to mention i don't have any more
prizes but i do want to give you guys a
shout out so PSP phantom obsolete next
week you made me laugh stephanie and

enjoyed we got somebody TLD me which was
also really good then we got 1100 sam he
did a John Legend cover which also
really good last but not least is Justin
McGraw he did a line sleep tonight cover
which was ridiculous he had a lot of
talent so check him out and then last
but not least his warp 43 he was a clip
you saw at the beginning of this video
so again if I don't mention your name I
apologize i wish i could pick all you
guys as winners i had a really fun time
at the same time had a hard time going
through all these videos and choosing a
winner obviously you saw that because i
wanted to give a little extra prizes as
far as runner-up so again thanks to star
and ik multimedia for making this happen
if you guys want some to make sure to
send me a private message and we'll
exchange info get you up the goods and
you guys can have your new prizes so
again as always so free to subscribe
check out our latest videos and i
encourage you guys if you have some free
time check out all the entries to this
contest down below there was a lot of
awesome ones the main reason i chose the
two winners for me was because they're
actually
original videos created towards the
contest they weren't made prior to the
contest so that's why they got a little
extra brownie points for me so again

time and super big thanks to all you
