giving you guys a little quick review of
star fox 64 3 D for the 3ds now I say
quick review because it is really just a
port of the original game there have
been some changes and some additions but
overall for those of you that have
played the original one you already know
to expect for those you haven't played
it yet there are plenty of people i'm
sure you can talk to who actually seen
some history of the game it's definitely
one of the more classic n64 titles a
really fun one now as far as this 3d
remake goes for the most part it does
feel a lot like a pork the game has
received a bit of a facelift one of the
places I noticed most was actually on
the water it looks more like little
shinier little more like water and
little less like just an amorphous blue
blob that rolls every now and then now
the controls for the game are fairly
simple and very similar to what they
were back in the n64 the only major
differences being that the thumb pad is
now used like the sea buttons you tap
the screen when you want to call for
help now alongside that the game does
introduce new gyro controls it's an
optional mode in which you can actually
steer your our wing by tilting the
screen certain ways the game actually
requires you to play in a special mode
called 3ds mode in which basically the
game's difficulty seems to be a brought
down a little to adjust for the fact
that gyro controls really aren't as
precise as just using the stick alone so
when you do play through the main game
or through any of the modes you can fix
play in 3ds mode which is little easier
or the proper n64 mode which is just the
original game and just as challenging
and tons of fun alongside the main game
there are also two other options there's
a battle mode in which you can't play
with friends to fight against them and
it actually supports a download and play
so you really only need to have one
person that owns the game it's not like
everyone has to have their own copy
however the game only allows for local
play there is no way to do online or
long-distance so you basically need to
have friends with 3ds if you want to be
able to do multiplayer with this or just
fight the computer and be alone and keep
playing alongside that there is also
score attack now this allows you just to
pick individual missions that you've
already completed in either the 3ds or
n64 mode and try to get the highest
score you can that way you don't have
just keep playing through the whole game
every time you want to do the highest
score you can like the last level now
you can just pick that level and play it
as many times as you want trying to get
a desk or you can overall it's fantastic
game I recommend it to anyone who has a
3ds and has yet to play the original
Star Fox and even if you had played the
original and you liked it it's
definitely worth picking up for the
forty dollars now my only complaint
gruben's really is that
the game did not support online
multiplayer and I also feel like it
could just be my childhood memory
playing tricks on me but I'm pretty sure
some of the voice actors have actually
changed in this one a lot of them
sounded like they were very close to the
original but some of the wording or the
tambor of their voices sounded different
seemed almost a little less quotable to
be honest because the original was just
so easy to quote so many cliche lines
that we're just hilarious and awesome at
the same time yeah it's a great game
check it out for those of you that of 3d
esas until next time i'm kevin for TLD
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
