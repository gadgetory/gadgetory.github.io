quickest and most compact recap of
today's apple event that you will find
on the intraweb it started out with
timmy cook walking on stage and he was
bringing it today he looked extra
confident maybe he slipped on a red bull
or two because he was pumped he briefly
talked about how awesome the iphone 5
was how quickly it's sold blah de blah
blah blah and then they wasted not too
much time and got straight into the good
stuff starting out with the new 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro now this essentially
looks like the 15-inch retina MacBook
Pro but in a smaller 13.3 inch form
factor it's thinner it's lighter it
loses the optical drive and starts out
with SSD flash storage as the base
configuration we're going to see a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 which is four
times the pixels as the current 13-inch
MacBook Pro now obviously I have not
picked one up yet so it's a little too
early to assess that but from first
impressions I feel the 15-inch retina
MacBook Pro is a much better value for
500 bucks more you get quad-core CPU
dedicated graphics obviously a bigger
screen and more pixels that is obviously
my opinion but if you guys are
interested in check out these specs and
configurations make sure to check out
the link below next up were the upgrades
to the mac minis and that wasn't a huge
update same form factor same pricing
just faster CPU is USB 3.0 not really
going to cover that too much because it
was just a minor spec bump nothing crazy
as far as redesigned so again if you
want info on specs and configuration
that is also linked down below now the
imax on the other hand completely
different story holy sháá these things
are completely redesigned their thin
there are only five millimeters 10 and
eighty percent better than the previous
imac so they make those old models look
like bricks they are going to feature
the faster ivy bridge cpu so not only do
we get faster clock speeds we get USB
3.1 new imacs we also see nvidia gpus as
opposed to AMD on the previous
generation there is no Retina Display I
don't think we'll see that till next
year so the 21.5 inch still retains the
1920 x 1080 resolution and the 27 inch
model retains a 2560 x 1440 resolution
apple also introduced fusion drive which
essentially is a hybrid SSD hard drive
it's not anything new but Apple of
course is going to deem it innovative
technology essentially what it does is
combines the caching from an SSD with a
hard drive so you get SSD like
performance on a bigger two terabyte or
three
bite hard drive that is a build-to-order
option however though and I get it for
pricing specs and availability check out
the link down below so now that we got
the max out of the way we're on to the
new iPads and yes I said iPads plural
there were two new models the ipad mini
and the fourth-generation ipad they
announced it early and even wait till
2013 for this one there wasn't any
design or form factor change to the
fourth-generation ipad adjust features
much faster internals the a6x processor
and the new lightning port so i wouldn't
say it's a have to sell your third
generation ipad to get this one but it
was a damn good upgrade next up is the
iPad Mini which is official we can stop
speculating we can stop putting rumors
out there Apple has launched a 7-inch
iPad called the ipad mini start net 329
and we'll start pre-orders this friday
now we will rock a 7.9 inch display and
the way Apple want you to remember these
two is the full-size iPad 9.7 iPad Mini
is 7.9 it is going to feature a 1024 x
768 resolution same as the ipad 2 so no
Retina Display on this model it will
feature LTE options the same a5
processor found on the 5th generation
ipod touch as well as a 5 megapixel
camera so you can look like a fool
taking pictures with your tablet so that
pretty much wraps it up in a nutshell
