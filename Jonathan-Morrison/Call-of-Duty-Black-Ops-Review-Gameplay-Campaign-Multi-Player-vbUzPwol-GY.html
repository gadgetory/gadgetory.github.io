tech post lunch and dinner with our full
review of call of duty black ops with
the xbox 360 ps3 wii and pc and as you
can see here on the 360 version the game
just plays beautifully weapon and
environment detail are both great and
the animation is extremely smooth with
rarely ever any minut signs of slow down
as far as the actual gameplay itself
goes black ops isn't breaking any
boundaries but does a good job at
attempting to protect the call of duty
formula multiplayer gameplay is for the
most part the same albeit with a number
of tweaks and balances as far as recoil
and timing bring some of the killstreak
rewards have changed as well including
the return of attack dogs and the
addition of a remote control car that
can explode all the games familiar modes
are still here however you must level up
in order to unlock new modes to play
free-for-all can get bogged down with
campers but the game really shines in
its team play where cooperation makes
all the difference where multiplayer
really feels its changes however are in
the form of character customization
players now have a much greater degree
of control over what kind of custom
classes that can make but the wealthy
assortment of primary weapons choose
from each with a number of attachments
to choose from parks have been changed
up a bit allowing for a different
combination of abilities and even go so
far as to affect the appearance of the
character in addition to the perks
appearance effect players can also
customize warpaint camo on guns and even
the appearance of their laser sights if
available players also have the ability
to customize their own emblem with a
large assortment of different symbols to
pick and a large amount of layering to
allow for an almost infinite number of
possible emblems all of this together
leads to an almost unprecedented amount
of customization for an FPS and as for
numerous strategies and play styles the
game's campaign is fairly
straightforward with a plotline that
while not entirely original is executed
well enough to be engaging for the
player the environments you travel
through our varied enough to hold
interest ranging from Cuba to Russia and
the large part focused on Vietnam
missions also try their best to mix
things up a bit by throwing in the
occasional vehicle mission which are
just long enough and action packed
enough to provide a lot of fun and a
good break from standard game the
campaign is also really short only
taking about 10 to 12 hours to complete
on regular difficulty and that's for a
subpar FPS player like myself last but
not least the zombies mode also makes
its return in this installment requiring
players team up against hordes of
zombies as they try to break in and
swarm them but most part this mode is
largely unchanged but i will say that
one particular map that needs unlocking
leads to one of the most hilarious
zombie situations i've ever seen overall
black ops is a solid addition of the
series
offering a good multiplayer experience
and a large amount of player fishing
today that being said however the core
gameplay is still very much the same and
as a result the game is basically going
to feel no different from playing a
prettier version of the last installment
if you're a fan of the series then
you'll love black ops just as much as
the others but if the series has never
really done anything for you and this
one will do little to change your mind
unless all you've been waiting for hours
customization on that's our view for
call of duty black ops i'm kevin for
tldtoday thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
