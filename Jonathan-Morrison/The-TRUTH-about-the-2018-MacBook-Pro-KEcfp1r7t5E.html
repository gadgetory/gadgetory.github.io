here and Apple finally
dropped updates to the MacBook Pro.
Here's the good, the
bad, and also the weird.
(upbeat music)
So, I'm actually gonna
kick it off with the weird.
And that was the fact that Apple
didn't update the 13-inch
MacBook Pro without touch bar,
or the 12-inch MacBook,
or the MacBook Air,
only the 13.5-inch MacBook
Pro with the touch bar,
which is cool, but kind
of leaves us wondering--
- Why did I have the ball?
- Now, stay with me, because this might
get a little confusing, but
what makes most sense to me
would be to drop the Pro name from the
13-inch MacBook Pro without touch bar
and then you have two options.
You have the 12-inch MacBook,
so you could then have
the 12 and 13-inch MacBooks side-by-side,
or the 13-inch MacBook
Pro without touch bar
gets a little thinner and
becomes the 13-inch MacBook Air.
With a 12-inch MacBook there is no need
for an 11-inch MacBook Air,
so the latter kinda
makes most sense to me.
You have the 12-inch MacBook,
the 13-inch MacBook Air,
and then finally the 13
and 15-inch MacBook Pros
and that's a pretty solid lineup.
Hopefully, that made sense,
but now on to the good.
The MacBook Pros that were updated
now have Intel's 8th generation CPUs
and if you listen closely,
you can hear Dave 2D smiling
all the way from Canada.
(screeching)
Now, what this does is kinda creates
the first major shift to MacBook Pro specs
in a really long time.
The 13-inch MacBook Pro is now quad-core
and the 15-inch MacBook
Pro is now six-core,
both for the first time ever.
There's now True Tone
displays on these MacBook Pros
and that's where the display will actually
change white balance based
off the color temperature
of the lights around you.
So, that's great for
everyday use and reading,
not so much for editing, but
definitely a welcome feature.
Now, I'm not 100% sure on
this, but it looks like
Apple is claiming also better audio
or speakers for these MacBook Pros,
but I will definitely test that out
once I get my hands on one.
There's also the brand new T2 chip,
which is gonna do huge
things for security.
I'll actually drop a link down below
on why it's so important,
but on top of that
it's also gonna be in that hey Siri
is ready at any given time.
Now, again, the 13-inch
MacBook Pro with touch bar
is quad-core all the way across the board.
So, every single
configuration you can pick
is quad-core, which is
something I wanted forever.
It feels like every time
they've updated MacBook Pros,
I've wished for a quad-core
13-inch MacBook Pro.
So, that is awesome news.
This ships with eight gigabytes or RAM,
configurable up to 16 and
as far as storage goes,
you can max this out at two terabytes.
So, a 13-inch MacBook
Pro with a quad-core CPU
and two terabytes of
storage, I can't complain.
The 15-inch MacBook
Pro, that's where things
get a little interesting, though.
And that's where I am most excited,
because it is now six-cores
all the way across the board,
from the entry-level 15-inch MacBook Pro.
That is configured with an i7 CPU,
but you can configure it all the way up to
a 2.9 gigahertz six-core i9 CPU
with turbo boost up to 4.8--
- Gigawatts.
- So, that is really, really,
really, really, really exciting for me
having a six-core MacBook
Pro with that kind of power.
Now, as far as what the biggest difference
between a 13 and 15-inch
MacBook Pro are, yes,
that i9 CPU is going to be insane.
But, the one thing to remember
is with the 15-inch MacBook Pro
you get dedicated
graphics across the board.
Whereas, with this 13-inch MacBook Pro,
you only get integrated.
Also, with the 15-inch MacBook Pro,
you can now finally configure
up to 32 gigabytes of RAM,
which I feel like is something
people has wished for forever
and a massive, crazy,
insane, mind blowing,
four terabytes of Pure flash SSD.
Now, speaking of the four terabyte SSD,
that has stirred up quite a
few people on the Internet,
because that upgrade alone is $3,200.
So, with that I've seen
people freaking out,
to losing their minds saying holy bananas,
the MacBook Pro costs nearly $10,000.
For starters, it's about $6,700
before tax, which is crazy,
but you still got a little
ways to go before 10,000.
And, secondly, and
probably more important,
you do not need to make that upgrade.
The model that costs $3,099
will perform the exact same.
It will be just as fast as
the model that costs $6,700.
The only thing you are
paying for is the SSD,
which comes down to speed and convenience.
You could pick up a two
terabyte Samsung external SSD
for under 700 bucks, so that's a
great way to save some money.
But, the one thing to remember,
is that it's actually must slower
than the internal SSD
inside the MacBook Pro.
Alternatively, you could
jump up to a four terabyte
external RAID SSD from Gylph,
but as you jump up in price
and performance, up goes the price.
This is 1600 bucks, so you can see
when you compare that to
the MacBook Pro, again,
it's fast, but it's still
about a third the speed
of the internal SSD in the MacBook Pro.
For those out there that are already
buying a four terabyte SSD
inside the MacBook Pro,
they don't need convincing, and ultimately
what it comes down to is convenience.
For me, anytime I don't have to
use an external drive is awesome,
especially if you're on the
road, if you're on a plane,
not having to plug anything in
and just using the laptop
by itself is amazing.
So, with that SSD craziness
and the price and people freaking out,
that makes a perfect
transition to the bad.
So, from what I've seen so far,
the biggest complaints
with new MacBook Pros
are one, it's the same design, it's 2018,
bezels are shrinking,
they're getting smaller,
they're disappearing on some phones,
so why is it the same on
these new MacBook Pros.
Personally, I will
wholeheartedly, with open arms,
take the spec bump over a
thinner bezel on the MacBook Pro,
but it doesn't mean I don't want it.
Next would be the lack of ports.
We still have USB-C ports and that is it
with these MacBook Pros.
I would've hoped for, at the very least,
maybe the return of the SD card slot.
That is still something
that is used very widely,
but let me know if there were any port
you could bring back to the MacBook Pro,
which would it be and why.
Jumping back to the
display, I would've loved
to have seen a bump in resolution.
These are Pro machines,
so we need more pixels.
We have 5K displays in
iMac Pros and the iMacs,
so at the very least I
would've loved to have seen
a 4K display on these MacBook Pros.
Finally, the number one
thing I've seen people
absolutely rip Apple for
with these MacBook Pros
is the butterfly keyboard.
They put a lot of press and a lot of talk
into them being quieter,
but there's no mention
of them being more reliable.
If you had to cut, when recently
Apple has gotten smacked in the face
as far as those butterfly keyboards.
And they've admitted that
as far as reliability goes,
they aren't the best.
Over time, for example, dust
will into your keyboard,
the keys would stick and
that became a big old mess.
And I think, overall on top of that,
people are really too happy with the
lack of tactileness,
the lack of clickiness
with those butterfly keyboards, so
it's not the most reassuring
thing with these MacBook Pros,
especially since you are
dropping a ton of cash.
Aside from that, the good,
the bad, and the weird,
this was a must, must, must-needed
update to the MacBook Pros
and I am stoked to get my hands on one.
If you haven't yet, definitely subscribe
for coverage on that, which should happen
in the next day or two,
an unboxing speed test
and everything you could
possibly want to know.
Thank you guys very much for watching,
This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
