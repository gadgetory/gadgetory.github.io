here with tle bringing you the unboxing
slash review to the latest 6th
generation iPod now this is the product
red version so I initially ordered this
on apple.com it was late got delayed
with the shipping from FedEx so that's
why I picked up one of the the blue one
the day it came out so I get three over
you guys so here we go to the FedEx a
little brown packaging box when toss
that aside so you guys can see product
red right on the side let's get that
glare out of the way for you guys and
there's one little tab we're gonna have
to get off right here a little arrow
pointing out would unwrap that get the
iPod out itself so pop that open set
that aside seal comes in the package
contents first I'm going to go ahead and
guess that these are going to be a
headphone and a 30-pin USB connector
looks like we get a little product red
tab a little bonus why that doesn't come
in the normal ones this is an Apple
exclusive so you can't get this at Best
Buy or Target or anything like that of
course we get the 30-pin USB dock and
the headphones so set those aside I
think you guys haven't seen before the
Quick Start Guide and like I said the
product read stating that as product
partner Apple will give a portion of
your iPod Nano purchase to the Global
Fund to fight AIDS in Africa so just
like I said there it is now let's take a
closer look at the new Nano alright so I
loaded up a couple songs couple pictures
so you guys can get an idea of the fill
of it this does rotate any way you want
because of the clip that comes on the
back what you guys can see right here so
it does say product red clear as day on
there so you do know it's product red so
this will clip on your backpack your
pocket whatever you want basically very
easy very into to the state 240 by 240
resolution pixel resolution TFT LCD
screen so to simply go back to the home
screen swipe left everything's really
responsive it's very bright it's got a
good view there is no video on this it
does do photos at the moment which you
guys can hook up to your TV right now so
you guys can get an idea of how it works
how responsive it is there's a couple
different pictures on there so it looks
fit it's very clear pops out the colors
are great there's a couple other
features in here such as the fitness
portion which will be used with Nike
products the clock which can be used
with the famous
I watched which I covered in my last
review like you guys can see again how
responsive the actual screen is again it
does look clear kind of dig in this red
color let's get to the iPod portion of
it so you guys can see the songs you
simply just hold it to scroll I do kind
of like this idea you go down the side
and you can see the letters come up and
honestly people were complaining about
the lack of click wheel on this compared
to the previous generation iPod Nano but
really to be honest I'm able to scroll
and get through songs a lot faster with
the touchscreen and I'm really enjoying
it a lot more than the previous gen iPod
as far as scrolling for the iPod portion
now just to bring it up here you guys
can see a difference as far as the size
like I mentioned we do lose the video
recording capabilities as well as video
playback but with jailbreaking and
things like that I'm sure we might see
that in the future maybe possibly with a
software update which brings me to my
next point is that there's a lack of
third-party apps on here so that's
something I would have liked to have
seen maybe some games but like I said
hopefully we'll see that in the future
with some upgrades software updates and
for those of you complaining that
there's no video playback really I mean
you're not going to be watching video on
the screen this small you're gonna be
watching on your computer your iPod and
if you want something as a media device
go for the iPod touch we just want a
nice little convenient music player go
for the iPod Nano so like I said this
comes in at 149 for eight gigs 179 for
16 there's seven different colors one of
these being the product ware which is an
Apple exclusive that's a quick little
review if you guys want a more in-depth
review check out my latest iPod 16
gigabyte version I'll post a link to
that right now so hope you guys enjoy
this video I'll catch you guys later as
