here with tech fost lunch and then
you're bringing you a very cool brand
new unboxing to the I clarity HD by
monster I was a micro bluetooth stereo
speaker to work with your iPad iPhone or
iPod Touch i'm sure many other bluetooth
devices so i didn't know this but
actually looks like comes with a
hands-free car kit which is cool for me
I'm always getting yelled at for
breaking the law and talk on the phone
so I'm curious to see how that'll work
and that's circumstance on the side it
gives you kind of run down the speakers
it looks like we get to 35 millimeter
full range drivers inside we'll go ahead
and see what's inside by the box not
going to read it to you guys on the back
we get some more feature list so it's
wireless wireless connectivity obviously
this portable is tribal runs on a
rechargeable battery so not gonna have
to waste money on batteries that's very
cool again on the other side goes over
the features tells you what color it is
silver and let's go ahead and get inside
this guy and see what this thing looks
like a close so again I want to thank my
buddy sigh over at monster for setting
this up to me for review just brand new
to hit the market like I said so I'm
pretty excited to check this out
especially I mean I have all the Apple
devices ipad iphone and like i said i'm
curious to see how it works in the car
situation so as always very nice
packaging by monster if they're always
well protected flip it over we've got a
little quick start guide it looks like
it's actually a user guide it with the
warranty info i'll set aside this looks
like a little caring cloth carrying
pouch with the drawstring so if you're
taking that on the go this is a micro
USB to USB I'm guessing this is going to
be what's going to charge the actual
device itself so very simple is not much
to the content in here minus the actual
unit itself and it's actually very small
a lot smaller than I thought it would be
so I'm curious to see how much sound
they can actually pack in this thing
I didn't jump over to a zoom interview
right now so you guys can get a better
look at this all right so you guys can
see this is pretty dang small we've got
I clarity HD right there monster on the
top there's a Bluetooth logo and on the
back we have yep on off charging and
audio and so besides a bluetooth if you
want to use it as actual speaker for an
auxiliary line in if you don't have
bluetooth it's going to work the same so
that's just about it for the actual
unboxing for this as volume up and down
as the phone feature try to answer the
call I'll get more into that in the
review but it's one to give you guys a
quick unboxing again thank monster for
sending this to me and I'll catch you
guys later and see you on the full
review
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
