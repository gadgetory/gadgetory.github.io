iPhone 10 that a clear things up but yes
it is spelled out i phone act the
correct pronunciation just like final
cut just like logic is iPhone 10 the
number now this was the first Apple
event of the brand new campus - it's a
little bit crazy honestly was probably
the hardest event to actually get your
hands on a device with the iPhone 8 the
A+ and of course the iPhone 10 so huge
shout out to Marc Marquez Gutner Justine
this was kind of like this little collab
tag-team to get any kind of footage we
can using all of our resources I did
manage to get some hands-on footage of
both the iPhone 8 and 8 plus so if
that's the compare so you want to see
let me know what dropping like down
below and also you guys maybe want to
see an iPhone 10 giveaway hit that
subscribe button so you don't miss out
on that so as far as the iPhone 10 it is
a really pretty phone there's two color
space brands silver I'm kind of leaning
towards silver right now it looks super
classy but regardless of whatever color
you go with both of them have black
fronts which makes sense with that edge
to edge display now as far as the edge
to edge panel it is a 5.8 inch display
packing site what is really closer to an
iPhone 7 now of course iPhone 8 body so
you're getting a much larger display and
much more screen real estate than even
the iPhone 7 plus or eight plus but it's
sandwiched inside a smaller container so
that's a little deeper into this display
it's what Apple is calling their super
Retina display is packin a resolution of
24 36 by 11 25 and for you pixel nerds
out there that is a PPI of 458 nothing
really groundbreaking here as far as a
resolution goes but it is pretty
impressive to the fact that we finally
have an OLED panel to the iPhone that
was maybe were to happen in 2018 so the
fact that it's here now is awesome and
if you've ever experienced all that it
is a beautiful thing and the one thing
you're probably thinking is that is a
giant display where is the home button
and unfortunately or maybe fortunately
depending on things work out that home
button is no more rest in peace that is
completely gone from the iPhone 10 so
the way you unlock your iPhone 10 is
simply just swiping up and it's also
double functions to go back home so if
you're inside an app swipe up and it's
gonna bring you right home now on top of
that if you actually swipe up and pause
slightly that's gonna bring you in some
multitasking mode it's a little weird to
get used to at first but once you do I
can see it being pretty fluid
conversely if you're not want to access
control center that is definitely a
little different it's actually a
downward diagonal swipe from the top
right hand corner again definitely that
takes some time to get used to but it
works really well at the bigger form
factor display from there you're
probably wondering how do i unlock my
phone now that touch ID is gone
apple's replacing that with what they
are calling base ID essentially it is
facial recognition to unlock your phone
trust me I fully realize this isn't
anything new I know Samsung pushed it
last year with a note 7 then this year
with the S 8's a plus and now no date
but if this was like Apple took some
time to really execute this well they
threw some number out there like the
chance of breaking through randomly
through touch ID was one of 50,000 and I
believe face ID the chance of breaking
that was like one in a million so if it
is that accurate it is definitely a good
thing now as far as looks packed inside
the iPhone test with apples calling
their a 11 Bionic chip which sounds
in a nutshell that is six total cores 2
and then 4 and that's paired with a
tricorder so this thing is supposed to
be really really powerful what's
interesting though is this is actually
the same exact processor packed inside
both the iPhone 8 and 8 plus so even
though you are kind of getting the
downgrade there at a lower price point
it's still nice to know that you do have
that power pack inside those as well
now as far as the cameras on the iPhone
10 this is a dual camera system laid out
vertically as opposed to horizontally on
the iPhone 8 + dual 12 megapixel sensors
but what's unique here and actually
isn't new because Samsung just rolled
this out with note 8 is both lenses
feature oh is now why that's important
is because it's gonna help in
stabilization obviously but more
importantly low-light and just get an
overall cleaner better image a really
big thing for Apple at this event for
both the iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone 10
because of those dual lenses is portrait
mode on top of the improved optics
there's also improved software so with
both the iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone 10
Apple's introducing what they are
calling portrait lighting it's kind of
hard to really explain and demonstrate
just with a couple minutes with the
phone but the general idea is you now
have control to mess with the lighting
and adjust it just like you would in a
studio and this applies both pre and
post photo beyond that there is now
portrait mode on the front-facing camera
which i think is actually a huge deal so
7 megapixel shoot is to get some
increased sharpness but the big thing
here is because they're true depth
technology for the facial analog that's
gonna reap benefits for the front facing
camera and photos as well so this is
also some that it applies to the iPhone
8 plus here's a quick demo of how that
looks you can see how you can adjust
things pose photograph and I'm actually
really excited to check this out more
detail from there with the power of both
the cameras and the actual power inside
these iPhones the big thing this year in
the focal point was augmented reality
got a little bit of a chance to check
things out it's a little bit crazy I've
never been a huge fan of VR but I can
really see myself digging in having fun
with augmented reality and both the
iPhone 8 8 plus and the iPhone pins seem
to pull it off really well because
they're all using that a 11 chip I don't
have exact specifics as far as the
battery capacity goes with the iPhone 10
but Apple is claiming two more hours in
the iPhone 7 so it's nice to know that
you're kind of getting iphone 7 plus
iphone 8 plus battery life on a much
smaller form factor but with that bigger
display you're getting the best of both
worlds now one huge implementation
across the board across all iPhones were
the exact corner eight eight plus or the
iPhone ten as a
Iceman Dwayne the rock Johnson Winstead
finally wireless charging us here
through the wireless cheese standard now
I get it
I am bracing myself for you keyboard
warriors out there who gonna yell at me
and say what the hell that's been around
for 58 years that's not new for the
record I am NOT stating this is new or
some kind of witchcraft or Apple
invented I'm just simply let you know it
is now available across all iPhones and
again the biggest thing for me here is -
Apple's slightly silly name was their
air power wireless charging mat which
allows you to charge everything at once
your iPhone your Apple watch
surprisingly air pod so it looks like
there's a wireless charging case coming
for that soon yes sir
but aside from that I think rather than
looking at this like a negative if you
are on that side of the team where you
feel like you've had wireless charging
forever this is actually a good thing
because it's gonna open up a wider
adoption and then it's always a good
thing
lastly kind of round out everything as
far as storage and pricing goes the
iPhone 10 is either coming in a 64 gig
or 256 gigabyte flavor unfortunately
that means no 512 but it's gonna start
out at 999 free deter starts October
27th and then it will finally ship
November 3rd so we've got a little bit
of time ahead of us so that is iPhone 10
in a nutshell thank you guys very much
for watching and hopefully enjoyed this
hands-on again if you have not
subscribed you probably want to do that
turn on notifications because there's
going to be an iPhone 10 giveaway very
soon I would love to hear your favorite
