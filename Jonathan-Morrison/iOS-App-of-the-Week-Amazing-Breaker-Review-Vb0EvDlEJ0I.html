TLD and I'm here to show you the iOS App
of the Week
and it is amazing breaker and it is
super addictive
anyway let's check it out it's kind of
hard to explain why amazing breaker is
so pill amazing but they've suddenly
done something right to be completely
honest though I almost passed this app
up when I first saw it because to me
from the screenshots this game looked
kind of terrible I guess they're saying
don't judge a book by it's cover is true
though because this app is super fun and
totally worth $0.99 at the moment there
are four stages each consisting of 20
levels if you're good at math you'll
know that's 80 levels all up you keeping
up with this a whole so it says new
levels are coming soon which is sweet so
how do you play this game well it's very
simple you have a slingshot or you're
playing bombs at the glass-like objects
I think they're meant to be made of ice
and there are four different types of
bombs one spike bombs simply aim and
shoot them to ghost bombs which fly
through the ice three helicopter bombs
tap them to deploy their explosive
crystals and four split bombs tap them
to split them into three explosive
crystals you usually need to destroy 90%
of the object to clear the level but if
you want to earn three out of three
stars you'll need to destroy the whole
100 percent of the object you'll need to
use a little bit of thought to destroy
things and strategy to do this which is
where the game captures your attention
it's also really rewarding when a bomb
explodes because for some reason it just
sounds really cool one object shatters
overall if you like a little bit of a
challenge and you're looking for an
addictive game as I mentioned it's only
$0.99 so check it out alright guys well
I hope you enjoyed this video if you
