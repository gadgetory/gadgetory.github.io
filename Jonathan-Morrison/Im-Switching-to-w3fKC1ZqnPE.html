johnathan here not too long ago did an
office tour which debuted the shoe wall
but since then there's been a couple of
key upgrades specifically one that might
be the biggest upgrade ever this is the
jellyfish by luma forage
so hopefully over the past couple of
months you've noticed a couple things
not only the increase in output of
videos but also the increase in quality
of videos and the only way that happens
is by building an awesome team so by now
some of you have probably made the Kevin
Kenton connection to the point where
some people think I'm stealing his set
and in actuality it's actually part of
one bigger project Sun squared media
which branches out into TLD my dumb face
and then Kevin Kenton which is led by
Matt aka Matt's Mackintosh rich
hypebeast Howe and mr. Andrew a spat man
so now we've finally started to build
out the TLD team instead of me being
dumb and obsessive and the first piece
of that puzzle is mr. JD Tech and then
rounding things out we are blessed with
mr. fresh aka chill aka Courtney and
young Stevie you kind of float in
between Kevin Kansas and TLD and add
their sauce to everything now recently
with some of the bigger TLD projects the
iPhone reviews the iPad pro review which
should release sometime with air power
that is currently sitting around 8
terabytes of footage so my storage life
was in complete chaos I have a giant
Pegasus drive which is like 16 terabytes
I have 50 billion Samsung external SSDs
I even tried moving that entire iPad pro
review to an external list C Drive that
was like eight terabytes in raid but it
was still slow it was like pulling teeth
so everything was just like out of
control enter the jellyfish by luma fort
which has completely changed the game
this is packing a hundred and twenty
terabytes of storage now because of the
raid setup 80 that is usable but the
beauty is is you have one blazing-fast
unit that connects to all of our
computers through 10 gig Ethernet in
this case we have five iMac pros 120 18
Mac Mini in the idea of not worrying
about storage or messing with drives or
transferring footage from computer to
computer is so freakin awesome so it's
about to get a little meta for a second
I'm gonna show off a couple things one
it's the first time setting up the
jellyfish on this Mac Mini in two the
idea is that we just shot a Kevin Kenton
video so I'm going to import to organize
set up a Final Cut library and then the
minute Mac can open it up on his iMac
and begin the chop so yeah that line is
server 5000 Pro June here is cool the
problem is though you need a bunch of
lionesses and Terrans run it around to
operate it and the idea here is that
even though yeah it does work with Final
Cut Pro 10
Adobe premier resolved to me it's kind
of like the final cut of shared storage
where I've never set this up before on
this Mac Mini I'm gonna go to auto setup
let it do its thing seconds later I'm
gonna just pop in the password and in a
second we should see everything which we
do so prior to this we have two
locations set up one for TLD and then
one for Kevin Kenton so with the Mac
Mini the idea behind this is supposed to
be kind of like the import organize
stations so I'm actually going to mount
both of these and you have an option
here you can choose to just mount them
every time or you can set them up to
mount every time we're gonna select Auto
so with this every time you turn the
computer off or restarted these will
auto mount every time which is awesome
so for this particular project we're
going to head over to me Kevin Kenton
share this is his predictions on the
future of gaming head over to the
projects folder
December 2018 create a folder 2019
gaming predictions I'm going to first
create an a roll folder predictions a
roll I'm gonna hop over to this view
just to make things a little easier and
there are better and I guess some more
secure ways we can do this in the future
for now we're getting better every step
of the way just by copying this way so
I'm gonna copy and paste that and you
can see I mean that is a crapload of
footage that is copying pretty damn fast
and the idea that we're not only storing
files and projects off one location we
were actively editing it on multiple
computers which is bananas so the aerial
footage is done I'm gonna hop in and
then transfer the audio today is a 24th
Christmas Eve so from there we're gonna
launch open Final Cut Pro and I'm gonna
show you guys how we would actually set
up an actual project in library to then
begin the edit so what I'm gonna do is
head over to new library we're going to
look for at Kevin Kent's and jellyfish
share jellyfish
Gemma Canson projects December 2018
gaming predictions
so that is a library and recently what
we found works the best is having each
video project as a library that way if
someone wants to open it up on that
computer or this computer we're not
running into each other or stepping on
toes so for here go ahead and rename
this event so from there there's a
couple things you want to do as far as
modifying your library so that's
actually if you hop over to the top here
go over to the modify settings tab and
storage locations we want to do two
things one we're gonna change the media
folder and create a new one in that
folder where we organized everything so
we're gonna find that Kevin share
projects gaming predictions and we're
going to make a folder called 2019
gaming predictions I can't spell
Protection's media next from there we
want to actually create a cache folder
as well now you don't have to do this
part but if we're going like the full
organized route this is going to be the
ideal way to do things so we're gonna
take one step back a new folder 2019
gaming prediction cache and then we're
going to change the emotion content to
in library you can leave backups the
same and from there we are good to
import now there is one important thing
you want to do here and that's to leave
the files in place because otherwise
it's gonna copy it and duplicate you're
just not gonna want to waste that much
storage in this case because I already
created that a role folder I want to
leave this keyword marker checked here
from folders and that's gonna
automatically create a keyword
collection and keep things nice and
organized so up here we already have
that Kevin Kenton share we're gonna hop
over to projects
Gaming predictions give me a little more
space we have that a roll and I'm gonna
want to import the actual entire folder
because again it's gonna create that
keyword collection and keep things nice
and tidy import selected and you should
see it's a really really quick process
because we're not copying anything over
to the drive it's already there in place
we're just kind of referencing things so
that's all done I'm gonna go ahead and I
always drag this all the way here just
because I like seeing everything in
place if I'm gonna be an extra nice guy
I'll actually sync the files format so
we can just open up on as iMac and start
shopping right away
so we're gonna give us a name gaming
predictions
we're gonna go to custom settings we're
gonna make this a 4k video Kevin is not
in 2 to 1 so we're gonna leave it at
3840 by 2160 okay so first up we're
gonna actually sync these together and
because the camera we shot out here does
not have any camera audio we're gonna do
it the old-fashioned way and use the
clap plus the waveform so in this case
I'm gonna actually have that turned off
for audio synchronization good there you
to drop it in the timeline I'm gonna go
ahead and find Kev's clap points or
actually it was matic clap in this one
alright
so marker 1 to drag these over so we got
those synchronised 2018 is quickly
coming to a close and what we had a lot
of awesome games come out on the
hardware side things alright I'm gonna
go one step above and beyond I'm being a
double nice guy and start this color
great format and see if that opens up
there's not a lot we're gonna do here
I'm gonna pull out a little bit of green
and there's actually a video that I did
with Patrick over on the luma Ford's
channel that kind of talks about the
backwards way I edit and why I do that
so make sure you guys check that out but
we're not gonna do a whole lot I'm gonna
pull some green out because we tend to
have a lot of green things the plants
the trees that come out everything in
life is a balance so it naturally adds a
little bit of green I'm gonna then add a
little bit of warmth in the mid-tones
which is skin cool off the shadow is
just a little bit
not that much and then from there I'm
gonna go and do what I kind of call like
the B saturation where I'm gonna pull it
up on both the shadows and the
highlights and then crank it down in the
mid-tones because that's where the kind
of like the skin tones live and this way
it's not gonna be like overbearing it's
looking pretty healthy I'm gonna like
pull the highlights down a little bit an
exposure that's looking clean maybe I'll
pop the red on his beautiful Christmas
sweater a little bit bringing that up
and overall I think that's looking
pretty good maybe you know if you want
to be artsy you can go throw on like a
color curves and kind of give it a
little bit like that that ludie look
that's that's too much that's clean I
feel like that's good so there we go
before after before after but if you
look at the horizon of what's coming in
2019 and it'll be on that there is a lot
of stuff going on all right so if I find
his first copper Cove because we were
there we know this is the last we got
this like beautiful smile we'll figure a
way to throw that in somewhere so we're
gonna take a look at what hardness will
be on that there is a lot of stuff going
on so we're gonna take a look at what
hard news we have what rumors have been
circulating and just look at the
theories people have but what these big
three companies have in mind for the
future of game sweet cut now the idea
here is I'm gonna close this up and Matt
should just be able to open it up on his
iMac and finish the rest all right so
we're just gonna open this up
projects folder gaming predictions
hopefully this is where the magic
happens in it uh actually he's already
in here so thanks to John my footage is
already organized and I don't need to
figure out the color grade it's awesome
the shutter not great no yeah I mean
that that alone is it was a mess so John
would start working on a project it'd be
on a drive then he passed the drive to
someone then that person would lose the
drive then we'd restart the project or
there'd be conflicting versions of stuff
out there yeah it was a disaster so the
workflow like that and the team we
started to build it has already paid off
immensely there have already been
instances where I start a project on my
iMac Pro Courtney then opens it up on
his I'm act as the base cut I open it
back up on my iMac Pro to finish it off
and the entire workflow is kind of
amazing the idea I've been able to work
on a video and then have JD work on a
second video having Courtney and Stevie
working on a third video and then
meanwhile the Kevin Canson operation
running completely independently rich on
one video there Matt on another video
there you're talking like five videos
being edited at the exact same time off
one device which is like mind-blowing
again though what it comes down to for
me is the convenience I don't want to
tweak things I don't want troubleshoot
things that's why I called it the Final
Cut Pro 10 of shared store
I just want to make videos like everyone
else here does as well so hopefully you
guys enjoyed the video if you did and
you're feeling like being awesome make
sure you guys go Linus server pro 5000
junior on that like but if you guys want
to learn more about the jellyfish I'll
drop a link down below as well thank you
guys for watching and I will catch you
guys later wake up get views and I make
an awesome Kevin videos and I got
sprouts
get that coconut milk what clothes is
that good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
