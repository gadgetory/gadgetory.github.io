from London shout out to Nick Crompton
the reason I'm here so I got a chance to
check out the brand new Nokia or should
I say Nakia eight and huge shout to
knock your mobile response for my trip
out here it's been pretty incredible got
a chance to check out the YouTube space
here in London which is amazing and
overall it's just been a really cool
experience so what that trip to London
comes an unboxing of the brand new Nokia
eight this is polished copper it's
pretty it's shiny and apparently it was
constructed from a single piece of
aluminium as far as what else comes in
the box we have the power brick this
time of the UK flavour headphones which
does of course mean there is a headphone
jack and last but not least the USB C
charging cable now I'm not about you but
I love me some USB see now for those who
are watching right now and thinking man
that looks pretty cool I kind of want
one I've actually teamed up with
knocking mobile to give one of these
away to you details and how you can win
it down below thumbs up are not required
but they are much appreciated
now with naki I wanted to break it down
into five things that you should know
before buying it is available for
pre-order now but just in case you
wanted to learn a little more sit back
relax and we will talk it out the first
thing I want to talk about is that this
phone is unassumingly powerful on the
outside yeah it is a pretty phone but on
the inside its packin a snapdragon 835
processor now something unique was not
created on the inside there is a copper
heat pipe running through the phone you
would probably never guess that just by
looking at it but they are paying homage
to the PC master-race bringing more
efficient cooling to a smart phone that
in terms would hopefully prevent
bottlenecking and overall give you that
buttery smooth performance give a 5.3
inch qHD display in terms of resolution
that is 2560 by 1440 and that's nothing
special well it's kind of crazy is this
is a ridiculously bright screen now I
guarantee you if you are inside you will
probably never need to have your screen
that bright on the not gate but if you
go outside a lot maybe you're in the Sun
and have a hard time seeing your screen
this might be a pretty cool option to
pick up next up number two is there are
13 megapixel cameras everywhere
everywhere what I mean by that is you of
course have your dual 13 megapixel
sensors on the back of the phone but
there is also a 13 megapixel camera on
the front of the phone now the reason
for that is naki is Google site
technology which essentially allows you
to use both the front and rear facing
camera simultaneously but because they
have that sweet 30 megapixel sensor you
are not sacrificing any quality this
will work with your taking a photo or
video so this is testing out the dual
side camera just on a cat hey little
buddy I'm gonna get hey good there you
go now the next thing going to talk
about most likely will excite you not
only is not yet running Android 7.1.1
nougat it is pretty much a pure stock
Android experience now from what I've
heard nokia is promising lightning fast
updates and I might get in trouble for
this because I'm not sure if it's
confirmed but I'm pretty sure I heard
this is one of the fastest ways you can
get to Android Oh next up number four
with the naki a you're gonna be able
capture some really really good audio
packed inside this guy is knocking as oh
so audio technology which is crazy
expensive and probably way too
complicated to explain thoroughly here
but in a nutshell there are three
microphones that captured 360-degree
audio I'm going to try to test out a
couple things one the ozo 360-degree
audio of course you're not going to hear
it back the same way I would through the
phone itself which is simulate that I'm
kind of walk around the phone as of now
I am directly in front of the phone I'm
going to circle back I'm also curious to
see how it does with the environment
there's a plane above me the wind is
pretty loud you should hear some
footsteps in let me rethink the video
quality and audio quality with a comment
down below now on top of the 360-degree
audio you are also of course getting
high quality capture so if you're
someone who's taking your phone to a
concert or to event you got home and
realized that sounds like it was either
exploding or taken underwater this is a
really cool option to check out last but
not least knocking eight has pretty much
every possible pork you could ask for of
course have USBC which again I love that
in turn gives you quick charge 3.0 and
for those curious packed inside this is
a three thousand ninety million power
battery from there again you have a
headphone jack so for those that hold
their wired headphones near and dear
this has you covered
you have microSD card expansion again
from the get-go year of pretty solid
storage capacities out of the box but if
you need that extra storage this has you
covered as well so overall was naki
eight might not have the craziest than
its bezels or an extra tall display
there are a lot of things to like about
this phone
it is a beautiful phone and one thing
that I really appreciate is the lack of
camera hump those dual cameras pretty
much just sit there flush and it is very
very pleasing to look at now looking
pretty is one thing but inside those
cameras are Zeiss optics and for those
are those lights as far as cameras go
you know that it's quality again Nakia
is not claiming to have the craziest or
most futuristic design out there but
across the board it is a damn solid
phone aside from that hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did I would
love to hear what your favorite thing
about tanake eight is huge shock you
mobile again for sponsor my trip out
here London to check out the phone it
has been incredible this is Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
