guys are doing well I am back with an
unboxing at Li just released and might I
add surprised announced iPad Mini with
Retina display which I'm sure some of
you guys are asking when the heck did
that go on sale most of us thought I
think because Apple said sometime later
this month that that meant the latter
part of November but Tim Cook had
different plans and said guess what yo
as of 12 a.m. Pacific Standard Time
November 12 2013 the iPad Mini is on
sale go get it
nonetheless I have both the silver slash
white and Space Gray slash black models
to unbox and compare just as I did with
the full-size iPad air which if you did
miss I'll have the annotated somewhere
up here and also linked down below just
in case you're watching on a mobile
device for your viewing convenience
now I'm sure most of you guys have seen
your share of iPad and boxing so I'm not
going to put you through the exact same
thing twice on both of these boxes one
is solely for reference and comparison
so it's going to move this off to the
side for now and focus on the Space Gray
iPad Mini with Retina display so we'll
begin by giving the Box
a little shake and bake pop the cap and
see what's under the hood we of course
have the iPad Mini up top Apple always
does an excellent job with their
packaging and presentation you just
simply grab this little tab right here
and we'll set that up to the side just
for a moment while we check out the
accessories now just like any iPad
unboxing there's not a whole lot of
content or accessories that come with in
the box but as far as what we do have we
can see there's a designed by Apple in
California packet which is going to
include some literature so we'll go
ahead and open that on up and know top
we see the iPad Mini Quick Start Guide
which is basically going to give you a
rundown if you're not familiar with the
device you're sleep/wake button your
switches your volume buttons everything
of that nature that is followed by the
iPad Mini info tab and last but not
least we have the Apple stickers which I
always like to ask how many do you own
fun fact actually don't have one single
Apple sticker placed on anything that I
own next up we have the USB to lightning
cable notes and you guys have not seen
before this simply plugs into your iPad
to sync to your computer or to charge
and like I note it in my full-size iPad
air unboxing there are also no signs of
headphones or ear pods in this as well
which is slightly disappointing
considering the amount of money you pay
for these devices I'm going to set this
back down and check out
last but certainly not least accessory
the USB wall brick which is actually 10
watts as opposed to the 12 watt version
on the full-size iPad air so we'll go to
get this out of the way and actually
move on to the meat and potatoes of the
video and we'll go ahead and check out
the iPad Mini and you guys are getting
me full on raw experience I wanted this
a little more live just because I'm a
really big fan of the iPad Mini form
factor but that screen before really
kind of killed it for me so I'm really
looking forward to the actual Retina
display and I actually want to give you
guys my initial impressions and
reactions of what I think so far so
we're going to address it if you will
I'm a huge fan of the space great color
as well definitely prefer that over the
slate on the previous iPad Mini we got
the five megapixel camera on the back
shoots 1080p Apple logo iPad down here
we got the Lightning port and we'll go
ahead and turn the sucker around and
power it on so you guys are getting me
full on boot-up and a walk through
experience it let me know what you guys
think of this style I tend to do more
polish videos but if you guys like the
more traditional laid back videos I
definitely can consider that and
possibly will do more of those as well
so let's go to slide to set it up we
want to go to English of course if your
language is different you're gonna want
to do something different this being the
United States we'll select that we're
going to go and choose a Wi-Fi network
and I actually don't have this memorized
so give me one moment
and we are good to go with the whiffy if
you guys have seen that new a commercial
let me know that as an awesome
commercial actually had a similar
experience in Best Buy today I asked
them do you guys have an iPad Mini smart
case in stock they looked at me and said
no but the iPad air case is the exact
same size and I kind of just wanted to
smash my face in the desk in frustration
because I really don't know how some of
these people can work there anyways
we're going to go to enable location
services set up as new iPad because I am
NOT restoring it but of course if you
are restoring it good and do that we're
going to skip the Apple ID for now just
want to move this video along so are you
sure you want to skip yes I do next up
we have the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions and you
guys really read all this let me know
with a comment down below who sits there
and reads all this even though I don't
we probably all should agree agree
create a passcode let's go one two one
two
eally high profile are you sure you want
to use this code yes I do reenter your
passcode 1 2 1 2 we want to use Siri
this as far as Diagnostics I usually
turn off so I put don't send you can do
the same as well I don't think we need
that and it's going to say welcome to
iPad so we're going to tap here to get
started and there we are all booted up
into iOS 7 so now that we have both
booted up we can do a little comparison
talk about the pros and cons of each
color and I got to say from first
impressions the Retina display on the
iPad Mini is much much much much nicer
from the previous non Retina display on
the first iPad Mini which was 1024 by
768 and we are now looking at 2048 by
1536 the exact same as the full-size
iPad air which is nine point seven
inches whereas this is seven point nine
so there's more pixels packed into a
smaller area the iPad Mini also does
feature the same a7 processor found in
the iPad air and iPhone 5s from what
I've seen though the iPad Mini is
clocked the exact same as the iPhone 5s
whereas the iPad air is slightly
overclocked giving it a little edge in
terms of performance but I'm willing to
guess those exact differences in terms
of everyday use isn't going to be a huge
difference we of course also do not see
a touch ID fingerprint reader on this or
the iPad air that is exclusive to the
iPhone 5s at the moment you do however
have a front-facing 720p FaceTime HD
camera on the front as you guys can see
right here it's a little easier to see
on the white model and as far as the
differences between the colors I've
always liked the classic look of the
silver and white it just looks really
nice and clean but I always tend to lean
towards the black model just because
when you're watching content consuming
media you tend to get a little more
immersed into the content because of the
black bezels whereas the white bezels
can be a little bit distracting these of
course do ship with iOS 7 which will not
completely sold on yet and in terms of
actual tablet OSS I think there's still
a lot of work to be done before I'm
completely sold on that so we do of
course have your notifications
everything runs buttery smooth because
of the a7 processor these also do
feature the m7 coprocessor although I'm
not really sure how useful that would be
on a tablet because it's not like a
phone we're going to be carrying it in
your pocket although you could
technically pocket an iPad Mini
so what you guys think what could an m7
processor be useful on on a tablet
especially more so the iPad air let me
know with a comment down low
low so real quickly we'll go to jump
over to a quick rear-facing camera test
so here we are with a quick rear-facing
1080p test it is completely dark outside
so thus we are forced to do this inside
it's also a mini desk tour I get a lot
of requests for that if you guys want to
see a full-fledged one let me know by
hitting that like button so this is the
Homer dome that you guys see in every
single video I honestly don't know where
I got them from it was actually a gift
final link I would definitely show you
guys most of the stuff you guys can find
linked down below this is the logitech
wireless keyboard that I use
solar-powered very awesome Logitech MX
mouse my favorite weapon of choice
completely obliterates the Magic Mouse
cannot go back to that we have the iPad
Mini smart case that is coming up for
review and these are the fou Cal XS
speakers best set of desktop speakers
that I've ever owned definitely check
them out if you haven't so that wraps up
this test let's go to jump back to the
video and there you guys have it there
is my unboxing and comparison hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to hit that like button is
much appreciated
and in return you guys know what's
coming a virtual high five at your face
I'm really excited to test out the iPad
Mini the only thing I am disappointed
with is the price I really thought they
should have stuck with the same 329
price tag it was kind of weird
paying 400 plus bucks for an iPad Mini
just kind of seemed wrong but I
definitely will put it through its paces
and bring you guys the full review so
definitely let me know if you guys have
any questions or what you want to see
covered in the review and also let me
know what your favorite color is and why
do you prefer Space Gray in black or
silver and white I would love to hear
your guys opinions and comments as
always if you guys have any questions
definitely drop me a line down below but
I know some of you guys really aren't
digging the new Google+ comments so you
guys can also hit me up on Twitter and
Facebook which are also linked down
below along with the gear that I use to
create these videos aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
