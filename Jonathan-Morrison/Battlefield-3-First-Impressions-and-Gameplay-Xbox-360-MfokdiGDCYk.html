bringing our first impressions of
battlefield 3 for the xbox 360 ps3 and
pc now i am playing on the console
version so that is why are going to see
a little less prettiness than you would
see on pc versions it was clearly
designed with pc and mine consoles as a
secondary so far i've been playing both
a bit of the campaign and a little bit
of multiplayer and i am once again
reminded of how terrible i am at
shooters however even though i'm dying a
bunch i'm actually enjoying enough to
where I'm feeling need to actually
better myself the campaign so far you
start off with a squad who basically
carries you that first level at least on
normal but after that you do play solo
for a bit so you get to actually kill
enemies and take the lead for a little
while as for the multiplayer I've got a
chance to play the vehicles a little bit
most the times that I wasn't filing it
blew up shortly after spawning inside of
it so wasn't too fun they're usually
either because the pilot was terrible or
we got hit by a rocket immediately but
yeah it's been a lot of fun I'm enjoying
it I just need to get better to really
get the full experience out of it so
once I played a lot more and improve my
skills least a little bit i'll let you
guys know what i think in my full review
any of you guys have got a chance yet
make sure check out our latest two bids
my review of Dark Souls and John giving
you guys an overview of the new macbook
pros till next time I'm Kim TLD thanks
for watching
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
