part backpacks all function the same
they have pockets and compartments and
slots that house our valuables but
there's something special about how one
might differ from another what makes it
unique and what makes this one special
here
that's 24 bucks but the question is what
exactly does 24 bucks get you with a
backpack for starters this is not flashy
at all it's a simple one color design
super stealthy which may be exactly what
you're looking for because the backpack
doesn't scream yeah you I got some
expensive in here so that way
whether you're traveling to work or to
school or wherever you keeping the
attention on you down to a minimum now
this is made for laptops up to 16 inches
of what's nice is in the main
compartment there's a mesh pocket which
will prevent your laptop from sliding
around on top of that there's also a
really handy velcro strap that's going
to add a layer of secure
little things like that are a nice
surprise and not something you'd expect
on a backpack this inexpensive reference
this is a 15-inch MacBook Pro so if you
plan on using this was anything smaller
like a 13 inch laptop or tablet I would
definitely recommend picking up a sleeve
to go along with that to keep everything
secure beyond the laptop though there's
still space in the main compartment for
books or an 8 by 10 Drake and while I
wish there was a little more padding on
the sides for your laptop it's still
nice that you get patted on the back
which results not only protection for
your laptop or tablet but also overall
comfort for you as far as the straps go
they are straps and keep the backpack on
your shoulders but in all seriousness
this is one area where I wish there was
a little more padding on each side of
the backpack are slots for water bottles
I was easily able to fit a one liter
bottle on each side but aside from just
water these are going to work great for
Bluetooth speakers or if you love beans
you can throw them cans in there now as
far as the middle compartment goes this
is going to work great with over your
headphones even those that have cases
and beyond that this is where you have a
ton of nooks and crannies for thumb
drives hard drives a stylus pen pencil
or funny enough the Apple pencil in case
you own an iPad pro because Apple does
not give you a decent way to store that
thing what I thought was a really nice
touch is this little dangling hook right
here which is perfect for something like
a pair of keys because you don't want
them falling all the way down to the
bottom now unfortunately there is no 30
pin connector
into the backpack which may break some
hearts out there on the bright side it's
2016 and battery banks are like 10 bucks
you can pick whatever cable your heart
desires lastly there's a zipper pouch
towards the front and this is perfect
for those things that you need quick
access to whether it's your 4 by 6 at
Drake because there are certain
situations where you simply cannot whip
out your 8 by 10 your earphones and
external power bank and honestly it's
perfect for things like snacks and food
because we all got to eat and overall
it's a really well-rounded backpack that
could easily sell for more than 24 bucks
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching and hopefully enjoy the
video if you did and you love backpacks
as much as I do make sure to go
eight-by-ten at Drake on that like
button if you love budget tech or you
want to see more awesome things on our
25 bucks check out the playlist here
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later hey yeah you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
