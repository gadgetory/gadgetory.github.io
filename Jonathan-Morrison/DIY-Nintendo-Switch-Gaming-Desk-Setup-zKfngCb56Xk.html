here is no secret I love desks I love
setups but this one in particular next
to me is beautiful the grade mixes the
custom blue and red drawers look amazing
in shots marble Etica because this is
clearly direct envoy inspired now the
goal in line with this was knowledge
create the perfect setup we could dock
and play your switch but to actually
switch between the Nintendo switch the
NES classic and a fully functioning
computer so the centerpiece of this
setup is the Alex desk from Ikea which
is one of my favorite desk of all time I
will admit it does hold a special place
in my tech cart because it pays tribute
all the way back to the original dream
death that was showcased in white this
of course is in grey but what's awesome
is back then it was pricing around 170
bucks and now it has dropped all the way
down to 130 something you're not going
to find that IKEA however are those
super-sweet custom blue and red drawers
which when paired to the grey the desk
look incredible next to the switch so
the process behind this really wasn't
too crazy we pull the drawers out and
from there spray painted them with a
two-in-one primer spray paint combo
now if you're wondering what kind of
paint we use then nose is not a sponsor
so much in fact I've got to look down
and see what these are called we got a
little rest only on painters touch
action and satin poppy red and satin
Oasis blue now I'm not going to like the
end result came out way better than I
ever could hope for the drawers are
vibrant they pop it really makes desk
look like they were meant for the switch
now hands down one of the best things
about this desk is the integrated cable
management because without a dislike a
rat's nest paradise this setup in
particular was a little more complicated
most simply because there are multiple
devices going into a single monitor
declare that what the speakers and Hyden
cables became a little jerky but the end
result was pretty fantastic
now the magic behind this setup is
located in the blue drawer behind me
inside there is a knievel HDMI switch
and what this is get allowed to do is
jump back and forth between us which the
NES classic and a super tiny Intel nook
which is a crazy value mini PC which
comes in under 300 bucks now
unfortunately both a Nintendo switch and
the NES classic are pretty much
impossible to fire right now but if you
need to have one right now a post a
couple links down below where you can
scoop one up if you don't mind paying
markup so what I have the switch the NES
classic and the nut going into is a
samsung CFG 70 which is a pretty badass
27 inch curved gaming monitor so funny
enough during the infancy stages of this
setup I actually posted a teaser on
Instagram with a 23 inch Acer monitor
that's actually much cheaper around a
hundred bucks but I got a ton of
requests to go for a bigger monitor
that's why I ended up going the Samsung
route but if you don't mean anything as
robust or maybe you like smaller form
factor the Acer is a great alternative
now as far as the speakers goes I'm
using the bose companion 5 and these
have also kind of turned into a secret
trick of the set up so to speak what I
love about these speakers are the fact
that they come with a super handy volume
control which I was actually able to
mount underneath the debt which makes it
easy to access and also hides it
keeping the setup clean and tidy so
rounds up to set up across the rest of
the desk got some classics fake IKEA
greenery followed by this super cool
solar blade Mega Man from pixel piles it
actually lights up like so amazing
popping this guy back on the desk with a
no-look action on the other side of the
desk is the breath of the wild Zelda
amiibo
next that is not super necessary for the
setup but I just really loved how the
blue matched a Nintendo switch theme
this is the Bose Soundlink in aquatic
blue these come in a few different
colors and while they're not the ideal
setup for a desk they do make a
fantastic portable Bluetooth speaker
lastly as far as the keyboard and mouse
go this is actually a really good deal
from jelly Comus both the mouse and the
keyboard as a pair for 30 freakin bucks
before I forget though because I know
someone's going to yell at me if I don't
talk about it the artwork above me is a
Super Mario Banksy canvas that I found
on Amazon I'll make sure to post a link
to each and everything we talked about
down below aside from that hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
smash that like button and if you
haven't caught it yet there is still a
chance to win a brand new Nintendo
switch which you can check out here also
my buddy Kevin Kenton may have figured a
way to get wireless charging on the
metal switch that is here this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later
reach for the sky the double flip what
does it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
