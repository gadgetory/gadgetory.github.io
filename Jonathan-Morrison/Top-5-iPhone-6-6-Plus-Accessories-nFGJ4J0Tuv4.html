are closing out the final 12 days of top
fives this time we are looking at the
top 5 accessories for both the iPhone 6
and 6-plus
now going all the way back to the top 5
tech under 25 bucks we took a look at
the owe maker 10,000 milliamp hour beast
of an external battery but if you own an
iPhone and don't want to worry about
carrying extra cables and you got to
check this out from Rab power now this
might look like your everyday average
external battery but the AC power is
actually built-in so you don't need a
cable to get power to it on top of that
it also features an MFI certified
lightning cable so like I mentioned no
need to carry any extra cables now most
models that I've seen that feature a
built-in lightning cable are usually
around 2500 to 3000 milliamp hours but
this guy is packing a massive 9,000
milliamp hour so you're gonna get a ton
of juice now if you happen to already
own an external battery and don't
necessarily need to buy this number 2 on
the list is actually a portable
lightning cable there's two options the
first is from Nomad and there's not a
whole lot to explain with this there's a
three-inch Apple MFI certified lightning
cable that pops onto your keychain
alternatively if you're not the keychain
kind of guy or gal amazonbasics has
another option which is also a passer
defied this is two meters but it's
actually retractable so this is ideal
for a backpack or purse because it's not
gonna take up a whole lot of space but
it will give you that length when you
need it to use with an external battery
or even a USB wall charger now next up
this is for you that go to the gym or
try to stay fit if you're like me
music makes a workout a million times
easier and more enjoyable the problem is
though is that getting that music into
your head usually requires wires that
get in your way so these are the jaybird
blue buds ex and they're going to
connect wirelessly to your phone via
bluetooth now what I love about these is
they got a sweet design that's going to
keep them locked into your ears while
you're working out I'm not going to fall
out there's built-in control so you can
actually even leave your phone out of
sight in your bag and if you are of the
sweaty nature do not worry because it
has a lifetime warranty against sweat
now these are black but they also come
in white models and I have both of them
linked in the description now coming in
at number four is the 12 cells hi-rise
for iPhone now it will work with the
iPad Mini as well but the focus of this
video is for the iPhone
we'll work both the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
now to me this is one of the absolute
best accessories you can get not only
for your iPhone but for your desk as
well because going to keep things
looking clean and tidy now I have it set
up to hold an iPhone without a case but
you can adjust to hold it with the case
as well all you need is an apple
lightning cable and you are good to go
so closing out today's top 5 if you're a
klutz or drop your phone like I do from
time to time one of the best accessories
you can get for your iPhone of course is
a case now for the iPhone 6 one of my
absolute favorite is the spigen Neo
Hybrid medow which actually made my top
six iPhone 6 cases video which is linked
down below just in case you missed that
now this is going to come in a handful
of different colors and is one of the
best-looking up in 6 cases that I have
seen this is made out of a TPU housing
and aluminum frames you're going to get
the best of both worlds as far as
protection codes now if you need just a
little more protection you can actually
check out their tough armor Fri phone 6
this is actually gonna have built-in
shock absorption so that way if you drop
it you know you are in good hands I
really dig the looks of this one because
it almost has a stealth type look
they're super clean cutouts and overall
it just looks really good and protects
your phone at the same time now just
like the iPhone 6 if you need a little
more protection maybe you work in an
environment or a job where you drop your
phone or it's a little rougher they also
make a tough armor for iPhone 6 plus and
what you're looking at is electric blue
so again this is a 2 layer design
features shock absorption just in case
you drop it and what's cool with this
one is it actually features a built-in
kickstand because if you own an iPhone 6
plus chances are you are consuming media
on there like a madman or madwoman
whether you're watching YouTube or
catching up on the latest shows and I
actually just started watching flack it
seems pretty legit so far I've been
super crazy trying to pump out these
videos so I usually don't get a chance
to watch the shows as they come on TV
but thanks to Hulu I can do that they
have a beautiful app for both the iPhone
6 and 6-plus
and have full seasons of shows like
South Park now if you're looking for a
sweet deal for yourself or a gift for
somebody don't have a lot of cash you
can actually score a free two week trial
just for being a TLD fan by heading over
to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD so thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being off so make sure to
go crazy on that like button we are
almost to the final day at the 12 days
of top 5 this is John with TLD again
everything is linked down below and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
