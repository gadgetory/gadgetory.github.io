little early morning tech fost for you
guys we were lucky enough to head out to
namm this week let's check out the press
event yesterday the pre-show I've got
our hands on first look at the meteor
mic from Sampson which looks to be in
direct competition with the blue
snowball so I know you guys do a lot of
tech reviews from you guys record music
so you do voiceovers instrument
recordings and everything like that this

bit different it's got some legs that
you can move around we actually have
mark from Sampson he's going to show to
you guys and tell you guys all about it
this is the meteor mic from Sampson this
is our new USB microphone and the thing
that distinguishes it from the pack is
its adjustable legs so you can set it in
any position for optimal recording
positioning for example if you are
playing an acoustic guitar on you wanted
to point it down at your you know at
your sound hole you can set it up like
this so it's got a its got a headphone
jack out from no latency monitoring to
put threads on the bottom if you want to
mount it it's got our largest condenser
at 25 millimetres to get really rich
audio it's a sink body so it feels
really robust it's also chrome-plated
get that nice cool retro shine to it and
it's going to be ninety nine dollars
available everywhere on April fifteenth
including 1100 best buy stores
nationwide so let's see meteor mic from
Samsung so you guys saw it ships in
April we will definitely be looking
forward to getting our hands on it
comparing to the snow ball and reviewing
it for you guys so if you guys are
interested in music we are covering and
we have a lot more videos on our music

music PC hybrid amp which is all on one
