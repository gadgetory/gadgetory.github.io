that distinguishes it from the pack is
its adjustable legs so you can set it in
any position for optimal recording
positioning for example if you are
playing an acoustic guitar on you wanted
to point it down at your you know at
your sound hole you can set it up like
this so it's got a its got a headphone
jack out from no latency monitoring to
put threads on the bottom if you want to
mount it it's got our largest condenser
at 25 millimetres to get really rich
audio it's a sink body so it feels
really robust it's also chrome-plated
