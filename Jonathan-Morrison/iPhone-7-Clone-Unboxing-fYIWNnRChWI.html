totally non sketchy boxes which should
be one of the best looks we've had yet
at the upcoming iPhone 7 and if you guys
can get this video to 50,000 likes which
I know you can when the iPhone 7 is out
I will give one away so go to smash that
like button and definitely subscribe if
you haven't yet so you don't miss out
now once we're past the battered and
beaten cardboard inside that is some
bubble wrap which naturally we got a pop
a couple nice beyond that there is yet
again one more layer bubble wrap this
time colored and this layer is giving me
a slightly harder time because we got to
cut through some tape once we get
through that and say goodbye to the
bubble wrap here is a case which is not
what we're interested in so imma go
ahead and toss that aside and this
reveals what looks to be surprisingly a
really good looking iPhone 7 clone
taking a closer look one of the things I
was personally most curious about is
whether or not the headphone jack was
there and clearly it is not now if we
stack this side by side next to an
iPhone 6s it lines up pretty accurately
with everything we've heard so far gone
is the headphone jack and in place of
that is a second speaker grille which in
turn should give us stereo speakers on
the iPhone 7 personally for the most
part I use wireless bluetooth headphones
so I might actually fall towards the
side of giving up the headphone jack for
better sounding speakers but regardless
if you were conned on the headphone jack
stain it is not looking good right now
now the other noticeable difference when
stack side by side next to the iPhone 6s
is of course the camera which is way
bigger this lenses help to be an upgrade
not so much towards the megapixel count
which should remain the same at 12 but
rather larger pixels which will actually
be really helpful and as part of the
reason the galaxy s7 has such a great
camera this year
now with this clone lining up directly
with the iPhone 6s there is no sign of a
dual camera if we do see that it's
either going to be an ass phone seven
plus or the iphone 7 pro the only thing
up in the air right now is whether or
not Apple is going to have two or three
models there is totally a chance we see
the iPhone 7 and 7 plus with the single
larger camera and then a third model the
iphone 7 pro with that dual pixel camera
personally I wish there was one camera
option uniformly across the iPhone 7
lineup but they have to choose between
models for a completely different and
better cam
is not going to be cool now one of the
things I was initially negative on and
if kind of come full circle is the
removal of the antenna bands up until
this point we've really only seen
renders or low-quality pictures which
were potentially photoshopped but now
that I have this close-up and in my
hands I kind of really like how it looks
and looking at this side by side with
the iPhone 6s I think I definitely
prefer the looks of the iPhone 7 clone
now the downside and the reality check
for everyone is that it looks really
close to the iPhone 6s there is not a
lot different between the two obviously
those who continually upgrade to a new
iPhone every year are going to buy this
phone but if you're coming from now from
6 or especially in iPhone 6s this is not
going to be drastically different the
one positive note is there should be a
bump as far as storage goes so the
iPhone 7 should be the death of 16
gigabyte base iPhones more than likely
will see 32 64 and 128 gigabyte models
and if we are to see the highly rumored
256 gigabyte model I would suspect
that's only going to be on the iphone 7
pro if that's released now by no means
does this mean the iPhone 7 is going to
be a bad phone based off this I think
it's going to look great it's going to
perform well it's gonna take fantastic
photos and video but again the moral of
the story is that it's not going to look
at that much different than the iPhone
6s now if you want to see more in depth
comparison against the iPhone 6s code
and check out my buddy Austin Evans
video he's busting out rulers calipers
and getting deep into it so you're going
