New York City checking out the unpacked
event bringing you guys a first look at
Samsung's all-new Galaxy s4 which upon
first glance does look a little similar
to the Galaxy s3 but galaxy s3s jokes
aside the screen alone on the galaxy s4
is reason enough for me to call it an
upgrade the galaxy s4 actually isn't
much bigger than the Galaxy S terrain in
fact it's actually thinner and lighter
than its predecessor the display jumps
up slightly from 4.8 inches on the
galaxy s3 up to 4.9 n inches on the
galaxy s4 but they are definitely
rounding that up and marketing this as a
5-inch smartphone the big thing though
is not the actual screen real estate
increase it's the amount of pixels that
they packed in the display so now it is
rockin a full 1920 by 1080 resolution
display packing a mass of 441 pixels per
inch now I'm sure the video does not do
it justice but seeing it in person the
display looks absolutely incredible now
I have briefly mess with the Xperia Z
from Sony and while that is 1080p as
well it's a little washed out leaves a
little bit too desired and from first
impressions this display definitely
outperforms that one the camera on the
galaxy s4 also got a pretty big update
jumping from 8 megapixels on the galaxy
s3 all the way up to 13 megapixels on
the galaxy s4 the front-facing camera
got a slight update from 1.9 megapixels
to 2 megapixels so not really a whole
lot there the big focus was actually
software on the camera we actually see
some of the features brought over from
the Galaxy camera over to the galaxy s4
save a lot more control in customization
they also have what they called dual
cameras where you can use both the front
and the rear cameras at the same time
I'm not exactly sure how useful that is
or if I found myself needing to use both
the front and the back camera at the
same time but you guys Colet me know
what you think with a comment down below
now as far as other specs ago they
didn't officially announce or highlight
the cpu from what I gather the US
version is indeed gonna be quad-core
while the international version is gonna
have the 8 core Exynos processor now
specs and upgrades and all that good
stuff aside they spent a lot of time on
the actual software as Translate is
pretty much your personal translator
where you can take actual spoken words
or something like an email and translate
it to a different language and from what
I can see from the demos it did work
extremely well now we also see air view
brought to the Galaxy s4 so we saw that
on the galaxy note 2 where you take the
s-pen hover over a picture get a preview
you can actually now do that without the
s-pen and actually just use your finger
to hover over a picture and get a little
preview actually scroll through video or
even browse webpages see actually want
to scroll you just swipe her hand left
or right - I even change tabs and that's
gonna allow you to control your screen
without actually touching it so that's
actually cool if you're eating or you
don't want to get your display dirty
they also did announce smart scrolling
with your eyes which is a little bit
weird I will bring you a closer look at
that and some of the features more this
week and when I have some more time to
sit down and process everything I'm on
about two hours of sleep right now but I
wanted to bring you guys a quick first
look at the galaxy s4 let me know what
you think of it down below with a
comment what is your favourite features
would he like would he dislike and what
do you guys want to see more coverage on
so thank you guys for watching this is
Jonathan with TLD you guys did enjoy the
video make sure to hit that like button
as it does help the channel out and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
