2018 no hardware but tons of software
iOS Mac OS watch OS Apple TV OS I'm
gonna do a more in depth video on those
later but today got a chance to hang out
some awesome people and we're gonna go
over our top 10 favorite announcements
number one for me is pretty small but I
like it a lot its dark mode in a Mac OS
Mohave it's small but it like it changes
everything in the UI and I'm waiting for
something like that and plus it's gonna
be on an iMac Pro for me so space gray
everything so I like dark mode a lot
dark mode in Mac OS this is something
that I am so excited about and judging
by everybody on Twitter I think they're
also really excited to I feel like for
dark mode usually I'm sitting in the
dark and my screen is always super
bright overpowering and sometimes when I
have my computer in the background
having that be sort of like an all nice
darker color I'm gonna be excited about
it next I'm gonna go with dynamic
desktop on Mac OS Mojave it's a little
bit of that like Mufasa but I also want
to hear Charles Barkley say either way
Mac OS Mojave got probably the biggest
update out of the bunch this year iOS 12
was a little underwhelming so there were
tons of new features to Mac OS Mojave
but I think dynamic desktop in the sense
where it'll actually change your
wallpaper from day to night depend on
the time of day is freaking rad so my
top favorite announcement is now I can
finally track yoga on my Apple watch
because every time I go to yoga I'm like
well I guess this is gonna be completely
useless because I can't track it so I'm
super excited about that I'd say desktop
stacks for me my desktop looks like
trash all the time and I usually have to
like make this one folder that I take
everything and just kind of throw it in
there and deal with it later
but desktop stacks should make it a lot
simpler to just have all my files
available to me without you know having
to do the organization myself I don't
think is gonna keep me that organized
but at least it'll look clean now it's
probably gonna be trash on my desktop
all day but it's gonna look good while
it's doing it so it's basically gonna be
a better way to organize all those
random screen
documents to put on your desktop and so
how he described it was oh look at me
scrubbing my stacks so I don't know why
that sounds so weird and wrong but I
look forward to scrubbing my stacks
really did we say the same of that thing
okay I can I can say another thing let's
see I probably say like group
notification is like who's not gonna say
that because it's awesome been waiting
for it forever so pretty stoked of this
year be able to triage every
notification right from the lockscreen
so I was a long time coming but
definitely stoked about that
one of my favorite things was probably
not like technically the coolest but me
emoji is just super fun
it took me a few minutes to understand
how to say it I was like me emoji
because it sounds Italian almost but
it's an emoji so me emoji super cool I
got to just test it out and the most
fascinating thing is that it has that
tongue detection so you'll find yourself
sitting in front of the phone just like
cuz it it can detect your tongue now so
we're living in the future is 2018 thank
goodness
um emoji is pretty cool and yeah I think
it'll just enhance the way we chat with
people on iMessage and anywhere anywhere
else probably group FaceTime now I'm not
gonna lie I've got a ton of friends or
anything like that but the select few
that I do have it's gonna be really fun
to have more than one person on FaceTime
so I'm really looking forward to that my
buddy John Austin Evans probably helped
me out with some PC stuff
let's see marques for read questions who
else is there Lou to make me laugh team
crispy obviously and the last one is my
wife count for a brownie point you'd
better count yeah there we go
your average girlfriend probably do not
disturb while sleeping is pretty cool
because I'm definitely a phone addict
everybody here is so to be able to like
help put that down at night and kind of
concentrate on sleeping anything to help
that digital health stuff is an awesome
something to go with maybe one of the
more underrated or at least
underappreciated features at WWDC and
that is the walkie talkie feature on a
watch that last one
but as cool as it is to take a phone
call on your watch I actually think
that's much more practical for those
quick one-on-one communications where
you don't need to actually dial you can
instantly ask judge nur hey where's my
camera and actually my second what is
the walkie talkie feature because I love
annoying people on my Apple watch and
you know it I love annoying people on my
Apple watch anytime there's like a
notification the pop stuff when they
completed an activity and now I can
annoy them with walkie talkie this is
gonna be so much fun something actually
really interesting is simultaneous AR
where two different devices from totally
different angles can interact with the
same environment in AR and mess with it
and share that experience with each
other it's pretty cool I've never seen
that before
so clearly youtubers think alike I'm
editing this video to realize I only got
nine features so for the tenth feature
I'm gonna go with Dolby Atmos support on
Apple TV would've loved to have seen
some further updates with the
introduction of airplay to now we can
hook up to air funds Apple TV but it's
still a little bit clunky but
nonetheless I am pretty happy with Dolby
Atmos on Apple TV so those are our top
ten WWDC 2018 announcements features big
shout out to everyone that jumped in
this video make sure you guys check them
out drop a like if you enjoyed it and
I'll catch you guys very soon with some
more coverage on iOS Mac OS TV OS you
name it see you
lack of Siri upgrades was pretty
disappointing everyone's probably said
there anyone 32a top five like this
appointment that all serious yeah I mean
they said they're gonna go into Siri and
they had this logo on but behind the
stage and they started and then they
didn't really do anything other than add
one or two features that they're useful
features don't get me wrong but Syria
has a long way to go so yeah that's
definitely disappointing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
