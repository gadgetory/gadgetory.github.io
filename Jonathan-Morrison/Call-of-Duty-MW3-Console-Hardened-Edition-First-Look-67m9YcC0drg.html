you guys a little bit of an update a
little late for some but in case you
guys haven't heard yet today a lot of
new info came out for modern warfare 3
at their XP tournament today first off
there was sort of a surprise
announcement of a new 360 console
designed for it it's actually the same
deal as the gears of war one you get a
customized console with 320 gigabyte
hard drive two controllers as well as
the game and a headset and all the
normal stuff that comes with a new 360
like a month membership to build it's an
all right design personally it's
actually my least favorite under the
three special edition consoles that are
coming out soon we've got the gears of
war one coming out in September which
just has a little of a black and red and
in my opinion a little more of an
artistic style to it and then more of a
novelty item it's still awesome there's
the Star Wars one coming out early next
year which has like the r2d2 design with
r2d2 sounds which just looks hilarious
and awesome at the same time that one's
going to run for 400 the same price of
the gears of war one it's coming out
when modern warfare 3 is released and
today we also have confirmation on the
price and contents of the hardened
edition it's going to be hundred dollars
higher than usually is but that's
because the fact that it looks like
there's not going to be a prestige
edition this year now in that hardened
edition in terms of physical content
you're going to get a steelbook case
alternative cover on the disc and a
little extra field journal which is
basically just an art book featuring
sketches and small notes they're trying
to be fancy with different words it's an
art book everyone accepted as far as
in-game content goes comes with a few
small benefits the first major one being
the fact that you do get a year
membership to their elite service which
is basically just a way for activation
make a little more money by offering you
special community options as well as
online tournaments and early access to
DLC the other small addition there are a
few unique benefits for 360 and ps3 ps3
you get a special theme for your ps3
main dashboard as well as Xbox getting a
special bonus costume for multiplayer
overall fun small bonuses it's basically
an art book and a membership for paying
40 bucks more not a terrible collector's
edition membership sounds like it's
going to be more than the price
difference to begin with but it's
definitely be the limited supply so I
just want to give you guys a little
update for those of you that haven't
kept up with what's been announced at
the XP tournament today make sure to
stay tuned for those two week when I'm
finally going to be giving you my
reviews of deus ex and el shaddai as
well as doing some first looks for major
games coming out on tuesday like dead
island till next time i'm kevin for TLD
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
