TLD with a hands-on tour and demo of the
all new iPhoto application for the iPad
which just hit the App Store today
for $4.99 but you must upgrade to iOS
5.1 before you can use this so let's go
to open up the application see what it
looks like and by default you can see we
have our album so we can swipe over fail
to photos then to events and lastly to
journals we can also individually select
the tabs up top so it's going to go back
to photos select a picture and let's
select these two monkeys right here now
towards the top left hand corner you can
see all of our photos we can switch back
and forth between them let's use this
photo for example we got a little flower
towards the bottom middle section we
have a Auto enhanced feature which is
pretty self-explanatory it's gonna
automatically enhance it and if we move
up to the top right hand corner we can
see what it looks like before the effect
so it's a little dull this kind of just
gives a little more vibrance kind of
darkens and beefs it up a little bit so
you can see it does a pretty good job
it's not gonna work perfectly every time
but for most instances it's gonna do a
really good job to the right of that we
can rotate the photo 90 degrees let's
get it back to the original state we can
flag the photo we can hold that down for
more options so it's going to unflagging
got a little sound effect going on we
can favorite the photo little ding you
can actually turn these sound effects on
and off as well from the home screen and
then lastly we can hide the picture so
from here you may notice it's not going
anywhere but if we select a new picture
you notice it's gone from the little row
up in the left-hand corner now for more
in-depth controls and editing towards
the bottom left-hand corner we have the
crop feature so it's pretty
self-explanatory you're gonna drag to
crop if you don't want to crop it no big
deal right here this little dial right
here we can actually adjust the angle of
the picture so it kind of looks like we
tilted the camera a certain way so you
can see how clean how intuitive how easy
it works with the touch screen so it's
gonna leave it like that for the sake of
this video and let's go ahead and jump
maybe to these android dude for another
little instance of this application so
right here there's actually a ton of
different options and they actually
explain it very well all you could do is
press the question mark up top and it'll
give you guides for everything so we can
drag the photo to adjust parameters
that's gonna saturate it now down here I
really dig how much control you have
over this
single line right here now by dragging
this inward we can adjust the shadows by
dragging this part inward we can adjust
the highlights
we have contrast which is obviously
gonna tweak it a little bit we have
brightness so brighter darker and you
can see how instantaneous everything is
so if we go over to the color section
they really lay it out if you really
have no idea about photography or
editing we have a master saturation
section so we're going to saturate the
crap out of it or if you have like a
picture of the sky you're gonna increase
saturation there and handsome' blueness
of the sky that's not gonna really show
right here but since this is an android
dude we got a greenery section now
obviously that's for plants and things
of that nature but this dude is green so
it's going to drag this and that's gonna
enhance the greenness of the picture if
you have a picture of people we got skin
tones and then we also have white
balance to the right of that you
actually have a lot of options on here
so for this infants let's go ahead and
jump over to this picture I've got
another little leaf going on let's go to
white balance open that up again now we
have original Sun cloudy flash shade
incandescent fluorescent face balance
and custom which is really cool so let's
go to and jump between a few of these
and it was cloudy when I took this
picture and you can see that kind of
works the best
so let's gonna go to undo select that
now if we have those little settings bar
in the right corner we can also revert
at any time we can reset the color
that's gonna go back and we'll go to
this little cup of tea for the last set
of options so a little detail going on
right here are the tool brushes so it's
gonna select that kind of magically pops
out and we have repair redeye saturate
desaturate light and dark and sharpen
and soften now what these are gonna do
is going to give you precise control
over a particular part of the picture so
let's say you don't want to actually
edit the whole thing but you want to do
a specific section so we'll select maybe
the saturate for example let's go to
turn the question mark off so we can see
kind of the layout and you're right here
we have this little green tag now if we
want to saturate that all I'm doing is
dragging around that and that's going to
enhance the saturation of just what I'm
touching we go back to the brushes open
it up so I can see the layout will go to
darken and say now I want to darken this
section you can see how it's following
me so I'm kind of like a bright green to
a dark green and you can see how
responsive it is
just for messing with you guys can see
how well it works lastly we have the
effects section we have a few different
tabs we have warm and cool duotone black
and white or a vintage and artistic so
we can select one of these I will go to
vintage for example and we can actually
drag and adjust the parameters right
here so that's not actually going to
change the settings so you can see
that's gonna give kind of a grungy kind
of dirty look we're really going kind of
the opposite spectrum increasing it
right in the middle is going to bring it
back and again right here we can reset
that to remove it and that's pretty much
it so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
