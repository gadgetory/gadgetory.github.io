unboxing I've ever done on this channel
maybe not size wise but for sure sheer
mass Apple dropped a ton of new
computers this month so I decided to
channel my inner Detroit blog and get
pretty much every single one of them
here is a high-end 27-inch iMac here is
the lower-end 21 and a half inch iMac
this is the 15-inch Space Gray touch bar
MacBook Pro and last but not least the
lowest standard non touch bar 13-inch
MacBook Pro this may be a terrible idea
so my debate if I should go from
smallest to biggest and I think what
I'll do is I'll go from cheapest to most
expensive that's going to give us a nice
cross pattern here to here to here to
here that means we're going to start
with the 13-inch MacBook Pro which again
is the cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy
this is the non touch bar model maybe
people don't need it this might be a
fantastic option nothing more satisfying
than some sweet sweet we have the USBC
cable some literature and that USB C
power brick I wish everything would go
USBC nothing really new has changed on
the outside with these MacBook Pros that
has all been internally up greatest on
the outside they look exactly the same
as last year dropped that so next up is
the 21 and a half inch iMac and from
what I've seen this is the $14.99
configuration and I think it might be
the best bang for your buck which is
really strange
as far as Apple products go but I'm a
con boxing's are always a really smooth
smooth experience
I am potentially going to murder that
bring it down keyboard mouse Oh No Oh
hates IRA foam I'm sorry why did I think
this is a good idea wipe it stop not
coming out it is in awhile since I've
seen a 21 and a half inch iMac in person
they always look like that's not good
alright power supply next let's undress
this guy the baby iMac
god there's so much plastic with these
things iMac one out box go away 13-inch
MacBook Pro out 21 1/2 inch iMac out I'm
gonna give you that sweet view the
backside stare at some glossy
reflections cheapest to most expensive
this is the highest and GPU can you get
so I'm pretty excited to see as far as
performance those I've actually filled
in using my 2016 MacBook Pro and haven't
really got a chance to see the
performance bump on these so I'm kind of
nerding out a little bit for that you
got baby brothers and bigger brothers in
every shape in form right now of course
I'll stay straight I wish these were
spaced grade but unfortunately we have
to wait for the iMac Pro for that for
reference quick size comparison 13-inch
MacBook Pro 15 inch MacBook Pro smashed
next to the 21 and a half inch iMac so
I'm going to set these down actually
let's get a little stack action you guys
saw what came with 13 inch MacBook Pro
it's exactly the same - a slightly
bigger more powerful power brick with a
15-inch MacBook Pro 15 inch MacBook Pro
away and we are on to the Big Daddy the
27 inch iMac again much like the 15-inch
MacBook Pro it is respect out highest
and GPU 512 gigs of that sweet fast
flash storage hopefully it's a little
that was much easier than the 21 inch
model so there's a terrible idea there
we go we are almost there
oh well if nice sounds like a nice rip
one more pink plastic and we got the
full family completed 27 inch iMac here
we're going to go 21 and 1/2 inch iMac
here 15 inch MacBook Pro 13 inch MacBook
Pro and before I continue I want to give
a huge shout out to LastPass for making
this craziness possible so huge that the
LastPass for sponsoring this video with
LastPass they eliminate the need to
worry about remembering passwords and
potentially getting locked out of your
account true story which actually missed
out on a pair of zebras this weekend
because he could not remember his
password with LastPass unity to write
remember or even reset those passwords
they essentially do all the work for you
put you in autopilot mode so you can do
things like unbox an insane amount of
computing machine not getting you love
grandma but it's not always the most
convenient thing in the world trying to
remember her maiden name when you're
trying to figure out that security
question this is going to allow you not
to do that plus on top of that it's also
been enabling you to never use the same
password on every single website
hopefully you're not doing that
hopefully you're not using one two three
four if you are any of those people make
sure you guys check out LastPass which
is linked down below now for reference
this 13-inch MacBook Pro is the only
dual poor machine this this and this are
all quad-core right off the bat by far
as far as price to performance goes this
is hands-down the most impressive on
Geekbench 4 we get a single core score
of 4924 multi-core was 14,000 215 and
why that is so impressive is this this
is a 2800 our MacBook Pro it scored four
thousand seven hundred seventy-six on a
single core score side and 15,000 851 so
this on a single core side outperformed
this MacBook Pro it was really really
close from a multi-core side now for
comparison this 13-inch MacBook Pro did
pretty well in a single core side 4500
16 obviously you are getting nowhere
near the power on the multi-core side
with two cores versus four here that
scored nine thousand 497 but as we move
over to the giant this is the clear
winner as far as performance goes single
core score five thousand eight hundred
and five and then we hop over to the
multi-core score nineteen thousand seven
and 37 from there I'm going to test out
the disks be test performance this is
actually the only oddball here as far as
that goes all three of these machines
are pure fast flash stores whereas this
is the fusion drive still though a much
better option than a 7200 rpm hard drive
or for whatever reason Apple still sells
a 5400 rpm hard drive and the baseline
iMac it is twenty seventeen and no one
should use that so hopping over to the
forty one half inch iMac the Czar's
performance goes this is 357 megabytes
per second on the right and then 566
megabytes per second on the read so
jumping over to this MacBook Pro that is
where we really start to see the speed
gains as far as flash storage goes on
the right side this scored 686 megabytes
per second whereas read with a crazy
fast 1848 megabytes a second where we
see the absolute fast performance though
is when we hop over this MacBook Pro in
this 27-inch iMac on the right side here
this was 1987 megabytes per second and
then read 2415 same story here where the
right side comes in at 1990 megabytes
per second and the read side 2547 so
just slightly fast in the MacBook Pro
but still both of these are crazy fast
now whether you go from the 27-inch iMac
or the 21 and a half inch iMac both of
these in addition to the USB 3 ports
also have Thunderbolt 3 in the USBC
flavor so you definitely have more port
options compared to the MacBook Pros
these are stuck would just under both
three ports in that USB see flavor now
one more thing I think often gets
overlooked with these iMac to the fact
that on top of the computer inside there
is a beautiful display attached this is
a 21 and half inch 4k display whereas
this is a big beautiful 27-inch 5k
display yet the specs may not be as
thick or as media the PC master-race may
want but all in all they are pretty
solid machine ultimately what I've seen
here is I think this is surprisingly the
best bang for your buck as far as the
Mac goes you're getting great
performance the only downside I would
say would be the fusion drive so if you
do go this route you can upgrade to pure
flash storage that is going to be the
best total experience this one is still
a great value if you need the power plus
the portability the 15-inch MacBook Pro
is what you want to go and if you need
the most power it is clearly the 27-inch
iMac hopefully enjoyed this video if you
did
and you're feeling like we can also make
sure to drop a like down below this is
Jonathan and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
