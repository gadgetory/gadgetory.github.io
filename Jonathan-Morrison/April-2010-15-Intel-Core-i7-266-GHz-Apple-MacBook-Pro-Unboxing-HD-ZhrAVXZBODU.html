lunch and dinner here bringing you the
i7 15-inch MacBook Pro unboxing let me
go ahead and bring the specs up there
for you guys to take a quick look at
this is a two point six six gigahertz
version four gigs around 500 gig hard
drive I left everything stock because
I'm gonna boost the memory and probably
throw an SSD in there very soon this is
the Intel GeForce GT 330 M as far as the
graphics card go it's the 512 megabyte
version other than that let's go ahead
and dig in and open the box up I was
kind of debating whether I was going to
get the 17 inch or not now the screen
looks fantastic but once I close the lid
it just looked way too big
also the fact is that I'm going to be
hooking it up to a monitor seemed kind
of pointless to go for the huge screen
at the same time I like the portability
factor of the 15 it's kind of a sweet
spot Thirteen's a little too small and a
17 just a little bit too big in my eyes
okay opening up you see the MacBook Pro
right there in front it's got a nice
little plastic cover on I'm going to set
that aside just for a minute so we can
see what else is inside the box as
always from Apple Oh everything is
always well packed very tight very neat
you get the power supplies right here
right out front take a look at those a
little bit of close-up now we go here a
little bit of a tab we're plugging to
see the software of course you always
get the Apple stickers we'll go ahead
and go through that in detail right now
sorry for that so let's take it out one
by one you get the Apple stickers two of
them like usual here's the software
license agreement here is a little five
microfiber cloth to clean your macbook
pro screen and here are your install
DVDs and then obviously you get your
owner's manual that kind of goes
everything over if you haven't used them
back before it kind of gets you a
QuickStart guide other than that let's
get right to the MacBook Pro itself so
we're going to go ahead and put the Box
away for a minute
and we're gonna bring out what you guys
have been waiting to see let's go ahead
and get that little plastic cover up all
right you guys can see it's very thin
this is the aluminum unibody design
nothing on this side it looks like they
are usually before you see a couple USB
ports on this side but it looks like
they're keeping it very plain and their
sandwich and everything else on the
other side does we take a look at this
we have the power supply the Ethernet
port firewire 800 the mini DisplayPort
now what's cool with this I was reading
it actually is going to do audio and
video so if you get an HDMI adduct
adapter you can hook it up to your TV
and then you have two USB ports and then
I hear obviously they have the SD card
slot audio in and audio out this is the
battery indicator and as I mean that
let's go ahead and pop that open so you
can see this is the backlit keyboard
display I'm going to be doing a full
review of this probably within the next
few days if you guys want to feel free
to subscribe stay tuned for that I will
keep you guys posted and thank you for
