with TLD with a comparison of the white
iPad Mini against the black iPad Mini
which even though the iPad Mini has been
out for a couple weeks now
I still get this question on a daily
basis not sure exactly which model or
color you should pick now I don't
particularly think a color is better
than the other but I will give you my
personal preference as well as a really
really close up look at these that way
just in case you can't make it to a
store or there's not one nearby you
hopefully this will help you with your
buying decision the white model is
really clean and classy I think the all
silver hardware gives it a really sharp
look and the black model has more of a
stealth look with all black hardware and
a slate and eyes aluminum back which to
me just looks badass now as far as
advantages and disadvantages what pros
and cons is one color have over the
other I would definitely say the black
model definitely is more susceptible to
fingerprints as you can see right here
so the white model is definitely gonna
be easier to clean and maintain and for
those of you curious about the black
model whether it scratches or not and I
have not had an issue with that so far
now as far as pros for the black model I
actually prefer this color one for the
stealth look and actually combine it
with a red smart covert kind of gives it
a Chicago Bulls look but I actually
prefer because of the black bezel just
kind of think of it like watching a
movie with the lights on being the white
iPad Mini or watching a movie with the
lights off being the black iPad Mini so
you get more submerged and definitely
more consumed and engaged into the
content itself again both look fantastic
so I'm not saying one is better than the
other but those are my reasons hopefully
that helped ease your decision a little
bit now if you're not even sure if the
iPad Mini is worth the money period make
sure to check out my full review which
is right here in front of your face is
