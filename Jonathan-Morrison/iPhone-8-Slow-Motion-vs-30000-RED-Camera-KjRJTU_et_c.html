wondering why I look like this it all
makes sense shortly but essentially the
reason we're here is to check out the
240 FPS 1080p slo-mo on the iPhone 8 and
to make it interesting
stack it side-by-side against this the
red epic w which is a $30,000 camera and
the reason I'm doing that is
surprisingly 240 FPS 1080p is not a
feature you will find on many phones or
even cameras out there I think as of now
until the next GoPro comes out allegedly
I've also heard that the pixel 2 is
going to have 1080p 240 slow motion but
for now it's like something where the
scarlet W or the Raven is the cheapest
option was like 14 or 15 grand just to
get that feature obviously it's a
different sensors different camera I'm
not gonna say this is magically gonna be
better but the fact that you have this
in your pocket is kind of crazy and
let's test it out and see why am i fully
colored rich but how do you feel about
that count can I take the red in the
water absolutely not never
woah why are you yelling at me because
it's a crazy John
yep he gets it he said anything for the
shot now the one thing I just realized I
may not have had to get in the water the
second time because in order to get 240
frames per second on this camera we have
to switch it to 2k that in turn crops it
in crazy much so to kind of get a
similar framing I'm actually you know
right about here I'm gonna roll
so for reference you saw how close I was
with the iPhone eight I was able to get
pretty much right up in there where with
this because of the crop factor after
standing all the way back here which is
kind of crazy
so for test number two I'm not sure if
it's the greatest idea but I'm gonna try
and jump and clear that bench right
there right now I have the iPhone 8 set
up and then following that once we get
this done I'll set up the red in a
similar configuration so we kind of
match that framing let's try this out
Jake a flag first be jumping how's it
full clear that was a full clear
spider-man what's up ready for it clean
dismount I'm not a skateboarder but if
you are time off you better upgrade do
you know how to kickflip but you
normally could also I can't turn good ok
so we were back on the red and again
because of that crop fact you're about
to see I'm gonna have to move back quite
a bit compared to the iPhone again this
is not super scientific Danny widget
what kind of more or less is having fun
here ah way back jump test number two
hopefully I don't fall my face this time
good all right I got this down to
clearance to clearance read down one
more so at this point in the day where
it's getting darker and because that
crop is so intense we are effectively
letting in much less light to the sensor
so you can see it start to get gray near
in noisier again the point of a red
camera is not for 240fps slow motion
especially we need to crop that
beautiful sensor this much it's more so
an example of how that actually is a
really cool feature to have on a
smartphone but I think that case is made
so from here on out it's time to enjoy
some iPhone 8 slow motion goodness so
for the grand finale
we have a photo Joe Joe Cutler blasts
KITT
I must refresh go pink or blue Ralphie's
got yellow I'm not even sure how this
works looks like a bottle of mustard
hello guys my name is Ralphie today
you're watching Disney Channel
it got me man this is my this is good
now you're hired so thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully enjoyed this
test again it wasn't meant to be super
scientific but at least we had some fun
right now it's actually just about time
to go take out the Galaxy s8 and iPhone
8 out of the water I think because magic
and somehow you're gonna see this video
second so if you missed that video click
right here there's also a chance to win
either an iPhone 8 or a galaxy I state
here this is Jonathan and I'll catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
