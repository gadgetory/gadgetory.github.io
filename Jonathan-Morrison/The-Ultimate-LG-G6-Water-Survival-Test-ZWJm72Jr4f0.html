to be a fun day LG reached out one of
the sponsoring stream water tests and I
was like wait you want me to try and
destroy your phone with water they said
yes so I was like I am in and now we're
about to put the LG G six through its
paces so what we're going to do is
increment leek lime the latter of
extreme so to speak we're start up
somewhat small with a simple one hour
and water test once it hopefully passes
that we can then move on so that's the
disclaimer do not do what I do just
because it's phone can withstand the
water doesn't mean she replicates the
dumb things I'm about to do drop a like
if you appreciate that though because
the last thing I want to do to see you
boys your warranty with that out of the
way let's drop this guy in water so the
hours pass I'm actually taking a look at
the phone we got a little more than that
we're currently sitting in about an hour
and 13 minutes everything looks good so
far but I'm going to pull it out just to
make sure shake it off a little bit
someone hop out of the timer and
everything looks good so far I do want
to make sure these speakers are still
intact so let's go and actually test out
the screen with some audio plane
so definitely passed that test it really
wasn't too much of a shocker but what it
does mean that we're ready for round two
part of the next test we are taking the
g6 hiking might get a little wet Palmer
will be fine this is just the beginning
but increase is he going to be listening
yes your feet are going to get way so
we're about 15 minutes in right now
and Matt hiking is pretty good cardio
but we're racing a lie right now hoping
to find the waterfall before it gets
dark
so we shall be all right so we made it
and kind of hoping that maybe we
wouldn't make it in time with the Sun
dropping output now this means I got to
do it
Oh Oh cold food go well I was cold but
uh obviously the phone cause that test
we're on to the final round so next up
yes I have standing on top of a washing
machine that's because we're about to
toss the g6 inside I will of course make
sure we use cold water we're gonna treat
that sweet display but now let's go to
soak this baby up
so the cycle is completed honestly we
may have gone a little too extreme with
this in the sense that there is nothing
but the phone no pillows no blankets no
padding to protect it but now it is the
moment of truth and we've got a see if
it survives you kind of a little bit
scared I heard it rattling and smashing
around inside so pop the door open grab
the phone holy crap the phone is still
alive the screen is on no dings no
damage no cracks the screen is working
perfectly and it's probably a little
hard to see and it's blinding slicing
sunlight so as impressive as the water
test I might be more surprised due to
the fact that it actually survived being
tossed around like a rag doll inside but
that means we are ready to move on to
the next round so next up it's time to
whip out the heavy artillery and by no
means is an official ip69k test nor am I
in official tester so please do not do
what I do I'm about to blast this g6
full of water
look at that notifications work the
camera is still recording think we
should probably bump up the test a
little
so at the end of the day whether it's an
hour underwater a hike through a
waterfall beam toss in a load of laundry
or blasts with pressure and water the
LGG six held its own and then some huge
thanks to LG for sending this my way
early again this is a pre-production
model for things may change in the final
version again don't do what I did but
hopefully you enjoyed it and had some
fun if you did make sure you guys drop a
like down below this is Johnson and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
