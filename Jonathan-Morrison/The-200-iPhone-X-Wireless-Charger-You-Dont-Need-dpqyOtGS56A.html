been in a situation where you knew there
are something you shouldn't buy like
really shouldn't buy but you still
wanted to anyways that is this the 200
are wireless charges that you don't need
but still kind of want
so this was a my Amazon cart for a long
time I went back and forth should I buy
this should I not it looked interesting
one aesthetically it was really unique
not really like any other Wireless
charters out there and to there's a
twenty two thousand million about our
battery inside so in theory once this is
charged up it is truly Wireless where
you could place anywhere you want I
think what finally won me over is on the
Amazon page the first bullet point you
see is Scandinavian design I'm thinking
to myself well Scandinavia brought us we
as fish IKEA pewdiepie that is a really
impressive list I then go down this
weird rabbit hole and find the five
greatest Scandinavian inventions the
first of which being the heart rate
monitor which is kind of a big deal to
is the speaker are you kidding me you
were more likely using a speaker to
listen to this video right now they also
invented the three-point seat belt
that's kind of a huge deal the trip-trap
chair I'm not exactly sure with that as
before out of those five were clearly
enough to get me to buy the wireless
charger now going into this I wanted to
be as objective as possible without a
doubt the number one reason why you
wouldn't buy this is the price 200 bucks
is a lot of money on the low end of the
spectrum I've covered a dual wireless
charger that is 25 bucks to phones it's
not flashy it's not truly Wireless so
you have to be plugged into a wall but
it does the job and you could buy eight
of those for this price now aside from
aesthetic and its unique look the reason
I could get behind this is the fact that
I think it's really geared to kind of
stay in one spot what I mean by that is
picture this you have someone over they
need to charge because that always
happens you be the nice guy or girl
you're off from a battery bank or even a
smaller wireless charger like this the
problem with that is that it's small and
kind of screams take me move me and put
me in a place you're not gonna find me
after with this yet it is truly wireless
so you have that freedom and flexibility
to put it anywhere you want but I think
for the most part the idea is to put it
in an entranceway in your kitchen and is
big enough to where someone's not gonna
put in their pocket or accidentally walk
off with it what's also cool with this
is that it's kind of stealthy at a first
glance I don't think anyone would know
or guess that this is a piece of tacky
it looks like somewhere where you place
your keys or kitchen items and then all
of a sudden BAM you got a secret hidden
wireless charger now to turn this on the
power button is located on the bottom an
initial ray
might be why the heck what I want to
flip this upside down every time I use
it but the way it works is once you set
your phone down you actually push down
that engages the power button and then
turns everything on which is kind of
smart the one weird thing I'll say
though is these LED lights are supposed
to indicate the amount of power or
charge left inside I'm not sure if I got
a faulty units or just kind of a weird
design but it's not super clear or easy
to read mine kinda looks like there's
this film or plastic that doesn't want
to come off and maybe that's the case at
certain angles it also looks like maybe
those LEDs bounce off a table or
reflective service but overall I would
have liked to have seen something
clearer and maybe at the top of the
units this one here is called deep sea
which looks really nice especially when
you get that right angle of light that
bounces off of it but on top of that it
also comes in Walnut sunburst and maple
as well the one thing I wouldn't expect
with this though are fast charging time
to think for the most part that's kind
of expected with wireless chargers if
you need that fast quick charge
hands-down plugged in is the way to go
with an iPhone tan at about 40 minutes I
went from about fifteen percent up to
thirty five percent battery it's not a
huge jump but again I think the thing to
remember is that this isn't gonna be
your main form of charge in your house
more so just a cool bonus like somewhere
in your kitchen now again this is
intended to charge two phones
simultaneously here's an iPhone 10 next
to a Galaxy Note 8 it works but I could
see if you had two large phones next to
each other it might get a little bit
crowded overall it's cool I like it I
would use it but at $200 it's a little
bit of a hard sell potentially if it was
priced closer to 129 bucks or 149 bucks
it would be a little bit easier to
swallow but at that price you can
definitely get a lot more for your buck
that being said though if you like the
looks if you like the uniqueness of it
if you like the idea of having something
that is truly Wireless the idea what
this is supposed to last around a week
or two without even charging it so in
that case it works as advertised the
only problem with it again is that it's
pricey as hell now I'd love to hear your
opinion is a worth the money or hell no
I would never pay that much money for a
wireless charger if you're on that side
of the cab I'll post some links to some
of my favorite that won't break the bank
hopefully you guys know this video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go on that like
button this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later
