unboxing and performance review of the
just released 2013 13 inch MacBook Air
now I haven't had it long enough to
bring you a full in-depth review I
really want to put the battery through
its paces test it out before I bring you
the full review but at the very least
for now I can sure as heck show you how
it performs so from that we can go to
move on to the obligatory plastic ripich
from there set it up give it a little
nudge and pop the cap in there she is
the new 2013 MacBook Air as always Apple
does an excellent job with the packaging
in terms of aesthetics and just laying
it out there so you can bring it out
with ease well go to set it aside and
take a look at the accessories first so
of course you do get all your
documentation which includes a Quick
Start Guide a MacBook Air important
product information guide and of course
what would an Apple unboxing be without
Apple stickers now aside from that you
have your MagSafe 2 power adapter with
an extension cable just in case you need
some more length now in terms of what's
new with the 2013 MacBook Air most of
the tweaks and changes are under the
hood so these feature Intel's fourth
generation Core processors either with
an i5 or i7 the model I am looking at is
the baseline i5 model spec was a 1.3
gigahertz dual core i5 CPU but the
kicker is it actually turbo boosts up to
2.6 cigarettes which is pretty
impressive now because these do feature
Intel's fourth gen CPUs not only are
they bringing better power efficiency
but it also brings HD 5000 integrated
graphics to the table and in terms of
how much of an improvement that is over
the previous HD 4000 graphics well I
will show you in a minute now of course
the MacBook Air still features its
ridiculously thin design sizes in at
point six eight inches at its thickest
point and then tapers down to an insane
point 11 inches at its thinnest point it
weighs in at just a shade under three
pounds and out features a 720p FaceTime
HD camera now in terms of the ins and
the outs on the left side we have a Mac
safe to power input there is the first
of two USB 3.0 ports a headphone jack
and dual microphones on the flip side we
have an SDXC card slot which you do not
have on the 11 inch model by the way the
second USB 3.0 ports and a single
Thunderbolt port so with that said let's
go ahead and jump into the performance
section of the video we're going to
start out with a boot up speed test see
how fast this guy is now something
really kind of cool with the new 2013
MacBook Airs is that they feature PCI
Express base SSDs so you effectively
eliminate any state
bottlenecks so you should get faster
performance so it looks like we clocked
in at a hair under 13 seconds let's go
ahead and move on to the speed test of
the SSD and see exactly how fast it is
now in the Blackmagic Design disk speed
test application I saw write speeds over
four hundred and thirty megabytes per
second and read speeds were a staggering
700 plus megabytes per second
comparatively if you stack that up
against a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro
which features a SATA 3 SSD that's
pulling in write speeds of 320 plus
megabytes a second and read speeds of
450 plus megabytes per second so you can
see there is a pretty significant
difference there in Geekbench these
64-bit Edition the MacBook Air scored in
at six thousand seven hundred and
seventy two and again using the 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro as a reference that's
scored at seven thousand three hundred
and ninety so considering the clock
speeds on both there's not a huge
difference between the two which was
actually pretty surprising again I am
using the baseline i5 1.3 gigahertz
model and if you stack that up with the
MacBook Pro you'll notice the base clock
speeds there's a huge difference 1.3 to
2.5 on the i5 retina MacBook Pro but if
you look at the turbo boost clock speeds
that's actually not as big of a
difference it's 2.6 on the MacBook Air
and 3.1 on the MacBook Pro so there you
can kind of see why the performance
difference isn't that drastic and again
the MacBook Air just like the MacBook
Pro also features hyper threading so
even though it is physically a dual-core
CPU
there's actually four threads so the OS
will actually see and utilize four
threads almost like a virtual four core
processor jumping over to Cinebench 11.5
the MacBook Air and the CPU portion
scored two point four six or again the
13-inch retina MacBook Pro scored two
point seven eight again not a huge
difference there jumping over to the
OpenGL side of things the MacBook Air
put out a score of just about twenty
three average frames per second whereas
the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro pumped
out just about twenty frames per second
now the HD 4000 graphics that are found
in the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro are
the exact same found in the 2012 MacBook
Air so that should give you an idea in
terms of graphic improvement of how that
differs there wasn't a huge difference
in Cinebench in the OpenGL section but
moving on to Unigine valley there was
actually a pretty big difference there
the MacBook Air with the HD 5000
graphics got a max frames per second of
29.5 and a score of 751 whereas the
13-inch retina MacBook Pro again using
the HD 4000 graphic
much like the 2012 MacBook Air scored a
maximum frames per second of eighteen
point eight and a score of 528 so you
can kind of see the gap starting to
build there now like I said I have only
had it for two days so I will be doing
more extensive gaming tests I'll
probably throw Windows on their bench
market so if you have not subscribed
make sure you do so so you do not miss
any of that coverage hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
hit that like button as always it is
much appreciated in return I am dishing
out virtual high-fives or internet
cookies your choice now if you guys
found this type of video helpful and
you're looking to buy a new MacBook Air
definitely make sure to check out the
links down below there's pricing the
different models available most states
don't pay tax on Amazon so you may save
100 plus bucks picking it up from there
and helps the channel at the same time
so everybody wins
now obviously if you're in a state like
California where you do pay tax
obviously get it where you can get it
cheapest but for reference I will have
all those links down below so again
thank you guys very much for watching
also shot a lot of this video with a new
rocket on lens if you want more info on
that or my gear check that out down
below as well let me know what you
thought of the video quality if you
liked it again hit that like button and
I will see you guys very soon with some
more 2013 MacBook Air coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
