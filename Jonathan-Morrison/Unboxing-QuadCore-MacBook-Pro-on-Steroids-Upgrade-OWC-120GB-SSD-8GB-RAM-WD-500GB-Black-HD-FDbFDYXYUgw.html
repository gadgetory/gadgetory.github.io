everything in the mail today to upgrade
my quad core macbook pro this is from
owc this is a 120 gigabyte SSD from owc
and 8 gigabytes of ram so go to start
with that also got something called the
data doubler what that's going to allow
me to do is take out the optical drive
and throw a second hard drive in there i
ordered a 500 gigabyte black edition
western digital hard drive from amazon
i'll get to that in a second go to start
here that you see here memory tools but
there we go this is the 8 gigabytes of
memory hopping over to this i'll assume
this is the data doubler now this is
actual SSD so 120 gigabyte owc SSD about
240 read/write speeds so it's gonna be
blazing fast kind of just plowing
through this unboxing since there's so
much stuff here and last but not least
from owc is the data doubler so it has
instructions like i said this will allow
me to remove the optical drive on the
macbook pro this is going to insert
there and i can put a 2.5 inch hard
drive into that slot so i'll have to
duel drives on my macbook pro last but
not least we got the amazon order let's
go to top this guy open this is the 500
gigabyte 72 and RPM western digital
black drive think it was like 69 bucks
so it's pretty cheap again i will post
that link down below now for the memory
the SSD in the data doubler I bordered
that up owc if you actually use amazon
you can save 10 bucks on the check out
if you guys want to do that i'll post
that link and i'll also post the link
straight to Oh Toby see if you don't
want to use Amazon I just want to give
you guys some options here we have it so
this is going to go as a secondary drive
let's go and bring the owc drive this
will be the main boot drive last but not
least we have the eight gigabytes of
memory I'm gonna play that from four to
eight so I hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing stay tuned
for the actual installation and the
results of how it performs after that
thank you guys for watching make sure to
check out the latest video it's a really
cool review on the quad core macbook pro
