bringing guys our holiday gift guide for
xbox 360 and ps3 games now just as a
clarification because i know we got a
lot of comments on this last room we did
the gift guide this is not a list of my
choices for Game of the Year these are
just games that came out recently in the
past couple months that make great
choices to give to people and something
that a lot people might be asking for
for the holidays now just get the first
obvious one out of the way call of duty
black ops 2 whether you love it or hate
it personally it's really hard to deny
that this is one of the top selling
franchises currently and has a great
choice for anyone that's really into a
lot of big shooting or military games
it's definitely the biggest military
shooter to come out this year and is
also a great choice for those looking
for some zombie shooting action next up
we have the walking dead video game
which is a little different from the
others listed here because it's actually
been released for some time now in DLC
chapters but just recently they've now
released an actual disc based version
which wraps up a lot better than dlc
code it's the perfect choice for anyone
you know who is a fan of the series or
is a great gateway into the series when
you know someone that wants to play a
more story driven point-and-click based
adventure style game rather than just a
shoot-'em-up now one of my more recent
personal favorites on the list is far
cry 3 and one of the things that makes
this one a great choices because it just
came out to the start of this month
meaning that a lot of gamers may not
have had enough time or money to pick it
up just yet which means you have a good
chance of getting it for them as a gift
this is a perfect choice for anyone that
likes solid FPS mechanics but more
importantly likes a really good free
roam experience giving you lots of free
options to choose from and having one of
the most solid storylines in an FPS game
for recent years up next we have
borderlands 2 which is definitely one of
the biggest co-op games to come out this
year it's a great choice for those that
like not so serious storytelling and pop
cultural jokes and it's perfect if you
know that someone else in the family or
one of their friends also has the games
they can play co-op or at least someone
that can do two player local with at
home now one of the more awkward
recommendations Assassin's Creed 3 which
is a great game but has one major flaw
in that you have to play the game as the
cam out before it if you know someone
that's played the first four and hasn't
had a chance to pick this one up yet
then it's a perfect choice however if
you don't know what they play or what
they have this one's really weird to get
because they'll just find themselves
feeling very lost in a very convoluted
story line now up to this point all the
games we've listed to have been
multi-platform meaning they're on ps3
and 360 but there are a few console
exclusives that are also very much worth
considering now first up for the xbox
360 we have halo
for which is the first part of a new
trilogy planned meaning it's great for
fans of the series but also for
newcomers to it when big upside to it is
that it's a great choice for those of
you that know younger kids that want to
get into shooting games but you don't
want to expose them to things that are
too mature even though it is an M rated
game it's honestly one of the more soft
ones and that it really only has blood
most of which is aliens and violence in
the form of shooting weapons all the
humans are completely armored and fully
covered and all they ever do is fall
down once they die it's not very gory
and there's not even any cursing in this
particular entry now for something ps3
exclusive we have PlayStation all-stars
battle royale which is also the first
non m rated game we've listed so far in
this list featuring a number of
characters from some of Sony's and third
party companies biggest titles this is a
great cross of provider that's less of a
balanced fighting game and more of a fun
party title to play with friends it's a
great choice for kids or for anyone
that's a die-hard Sony fan that you know
oh and because I know to get an angry
text if I don't mention it yes John

game gift and is probably game of the
year so that's our holiday gift guide
