and dinner with our first impressions of
Fable 3 for the Xbox 360 first off the
game starts with a rather epic opening
sequence that involves a chicken
escaping its coop as a metaphor for
rebellion it's both strangely
appropriate as well as being a really
hilarious way to start a game whose
subject matter focuses on something as
serious as political reform through
revolution for the most part graphics
and sound wise the game feels very
similar to its predecessor of able to
the only major notice will change being
the occasional landscape shot looking
just a little bit more detailed than
before actual gameplay in terms of
combat is almost identical to previous
games in which the hero makes use of a
melee weapon a gun and magic spells and
even has an accompanying dog as seen
them to growth however works a bit
different this time around there is a
special area in which several chests can
be unlocked by spending XP new chests
become available as the character
progresses through the main story and
they contain various power-ups such as
the usual increase in melee or ranged
power unlocking new spells or even a
minor things such as new color dyes for
clothes and expressions to use the
people interaction with normal people
seems to play a bigger role in this
installment and major decisions seem to
be far more often in fact very early on
you're forced to make a rather tough
decision that you cannot redo though I
won't spoil the particulars overall thus
far for the first hour and a half the
game feels a lot like playing a more
robust version of the series past
incarnations and it feels as though
great things around the horizon for my
character whether or not this is
actually how the game will end up
playing I'll let you guys know when I
finish the game and we have a full
review till then I'm Kevin for TLD today
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
