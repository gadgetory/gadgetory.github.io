quite back damn you cold but nonetheless
we're continuing the 12 days of TLD this
time with top 5 tech under 25 bucks so
first up is this little guy right here
an ultra portable compact bluetooth
speaker from anchor which even though
it's incredibly tiny still packs a
really solid punch now on top of being
bluetooth this is also NFC compatible as
a 12 hour battery life and just in case
you really weren't sure what to get that
certain someone in your life for the
holidays this is a perfect go to now for
the next item I'm gonna actually kick
this off to jut nur so here we have the
synthesized XTC where you wouldn't have
guessed is under 25 bucks so we've got
an inline remote with the play and pause
button as well as a mic so it'll work
with both Android and iOS devices these
are wooden case earbuds with a braided
cable that actually comes in a quite a
few different color options so you can
get whatever matches your style and this
thing's got some pretty decent bass so
if you want to add some thump to your
audio this is a solid bet so next up is
for those of you out there who always
seem to lose your USB cable especially
when you need that charge this is a
keychain USB cable from nomads you have
your micro USB cable here this does also
come in a Lightning version so this way
as long as you have your keys on you you
are always going to have a cable it
doesn't matter if you're on iOS or
Android this has you covered if you
happen to lose your keys though you've
got this guy this is tile if you lose
your stuff a lot or you're just playing
cautious you definitely want to look
into this now this is a Bluetooth device
that sends a signal to your phone that
lets you know the location of whatever
you attach it to and with this guy's app
you'll be able to see a map of the
location of the tile and if you can't
find your phone you can actually send
off an alert now speaking of smart
phones if you're not quite happy with
your camera I got a solution for you
with not one not two but three lenses
from mpow which is going to get your
macro fisheye and super wide so to get
this going all you're going to do is
literally snap this onto the top of your
phone and right now we're going to go to
test out these super wide lens which
from just looking at it is pretty crazy
so Jay take a look geez take a snap
cameraman Austin Evans BAM
it also works on the front-facing camera
as well so if you selfie maniacs out
there this has you covered so you guys
should be able to see a huge difference
with that we got it back on there one
more time I'm pretty close to Judd right
now and we are getting all of that
snapback santahat so really for that
right there I would say this will be
worth 20 bucks but the fact that you get
macro an officiai on top of that is
killer now aside from the rest of the
video hopefully you guys enjoyed it if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go snapback Santa
on that like button
big shout out to judge for joining in he
actually just dropped a gift card of his
own
that's link below along with everything
we talked about this is Jonathan with
TLD and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
