perfect macbook pro set up photographer
edition so over the years I've gotten a
ton of requests for a photography based
setup but the problem is I am NOT a
photographer so for this one I called a
mr. Tyler Stallman who's an insanely
talented photographer and this is what
he does for a living
now the centerpiece of the setup is not
something you would normally expect
honestly
had I not collaborated with Tyler I
don't think I would have found this
option either so this is a 62 inch
adjustable work table from husky which
is something you grabbed from Home Depot
rather than IKEA or furniture spot but
it worked surprisingly well
so Tyler's in the mists of redoing his
studio which is why he was looking to do
a desk setup and the number one priority
for him was to have everything kind of
locked and loaded on the desk but with
the freedom to move around Jonathan and
his team mounted a power bar underneath
the back of the desks there could just
be that one cable running off so that as
I move it around nothing's gonna get
caught everything's contained and when I
come there with my MacBook Pro I can
just put it down
plug one or two cables in and I'm ready
to go in choosing the actual desk it was
important to me that it was adaptable so
that for one meant that it could be
raised up and down it also has to kind
of be able to get the beat up because
when the camera gets put on it it
scratches the nice table in an open
studio space like this we're always kind
of moving things around depending on the
shoot so it was important that it was on
wheels so I can easily bring it from one
side of the room to the other depending
on what we're shooting now this
particular desk we couldn't get shipped
out in time while Tyler was out in LA so
we actually borrowed this from another
photographer sound Hopkins who also does
amazing work makes you guys check him
out but what was interesting is he
actually stained the top of this which
came out amazing now as far as the
computer Tyler's choice is a 20-18
15-inch MacBook Pro the way that we work
is a lot of travel photography and also
in studio stuff so it had to be a
15-inch MacBook Pro so that I've got
plenty of screen real estate on the go
and then when I come and plug it in I've
still got lots of power when I'm in the
studio now as far as the monitor goes we
don't want to go crazy expensive so we
kind of met in the middle of size and
performance this is a 32 inch 4k 10 bit
HDR monitor from Ben q and what's
awesome is that it connects via USB see
I thought that Ben cue monitor was a
really interesting choice it's it's
enormous it's 30 inches and it has P
three color space as well as 4k so it
looked pretty great but out of the box
their color accuracy wasn't quite
perfect so we used a spider five Express
to calibrate it so then it can match the
MacBook Pro monitor or a printer or any
other digital devices as well even if
you have a really high precision monitor
it's good to calibrate your colors about
once a month they gradually
so we went for a slightly more
affordable big monitor and just made
sure it was as accurate as possible now
it kind of ties everything together and
brings the hub or dock like
functionality to the setup is this
awesome
let's see external Thunderbolt 3 hard
drive which has card readers built-in
which is perfect for photographers see
if blazing fast storage come out with
quick access to upload your files and I
love the fact that it kind of just keeps
everything together and super clean and
minimal now as far as the mouse and
keyboard one the trusty Logitech
performance MX which you can't go wrong
with then an Apple wireless magic
keyboard with number pad we added a
full-size wireless apple keyboard
because I think one mistake they made on
the MacBook Pro is that those arrow keys
aren't the shape of a tee anymore so
when you're just feeling around with
your fingers it's hard to know exactly
what you're pressing until you look at
it in a Lightroom navigating left/right
up/down is something you're doing all
the time so this bigger keyboard gives
you more room for that it also has
another numerical pad which is great for
rating photos now without a doubt what
was the most interesting element of this
setup was the pallet control surface kit
this is the expert Edition which is kind
of this awesome modular control surface
which in this case Tyler used with
Lightroom and this you can assign to any
controls within Lightroom or Photoshop
and they're super modular so you can
shape them around your desk like I was
just getting started with them but it
made me want to have a lot more of them
they felt really good to use and I
especially just like to have them for my
exposure and white balance like it was
just that that's very useful right there
honestly was just kind of awesome seen
Tyler work in his element he's so fluid
and seamless you can tell it kind of
just comes second nature so this was
definitely a cool way to kind of enhance
his overall workflow if you curious on
why there's no speakers on this desk
Tyler just use your rocks a pair of
wired Sony headphones and it turns out
that the adjustable crank on the desk
works perfectly to hang those headphones
this desk turned out awesome so Jonathan
thanks for having me be a part of it
photographers are very particular about
their gear so it was great to put
something to custom together that was
just what I needed so that is the
perfect macbook pro set up for
photographers this would also work
amazing through 13 inch macbook pro as
well hopefully enjoyed the video if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome makes you guys smash that like
button check out some of Tyler's work
link down below he does some amazing
work and if you're looking for more
setup inspiration I actually just posted
a secret office tour which is linked
here or down
as well this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
