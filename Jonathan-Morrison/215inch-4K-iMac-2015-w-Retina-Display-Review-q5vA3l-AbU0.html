is my review of the 2015 21 point 5 inch
4k iMac now design wise not much has
changed it's got that classic brushed
aluminum finish and these just a single
power cable to get you up and running
which results in a super clean minimal
and space-efficient setup on the back we
have the power button and then your ins
and outs include gig Ethernet
Thunderbolt 2 USB 3 SDXC and a headphone
jack which also doubles as an optical
audio output now as most of you should
know by now I am not afraid to rip Apple
especially when they deserve to be
ripped but when it comes to what is the
single most appealing thing about this
iMac which is the 4k display if you love
pixels if you love technology there is
no denying that this looks insanely good
for reference the videos that you're
watching right now is output it to a
resolution of 3840 by 2160 which is
technically UHD then we have cinema 4k
which is 4096 by 2160 and then this iMac
is slightly larger than that with a
resolution of 4096 by 23:04 now as far
as why you'd want a screen resolution
that high on a screen size that small
what Apple does is scale everything down
so for text and UI elements this is done
at a four to one ratio meaning for every
pixel of screen real estate there are
four pixels jammed inside and that's
actually what allows the text and things
like the application icons to look super
sharp and super crisp now what's awesome
is things like photos and videos those
are scaled to a one-to-one ratio so for
example here in Final Cut Pro 10 I have
a full 1080p video plane and I'm able to
see a hundred percent of those pixels
with a ton of screen real estate left
over now on the technical side this iMac
is scaled to look like 2048 by 1152
but you can also give yourself a little
extra room with options that look like
2304 by 12 96 or 2560 by 1440 which
crazy enough was the resolution of the
27-inch iMac before it got the 5k
upgrade now speaking of the 27-inch iMac
one of the big upgrades there was the
fact that it now supports AP three color
gamut which is 25 percent wider and that
also applies to these 21 inch IMAX and
that really just kind of
the cake on the overall quality and
fantastic display now if there were any
downsides with this display I would say
it's the fact that there is no target
display mode which means you cannot use
it as a monitor with other Macs and
that's definitely a bummer so that was
the good but now it's time for some
ripping because for some reason Apple
decided to take this beautiful machine
and stick a 5400 rpm hard drive in there
which is a travesty if you walk into the
Apple store and they try to sell you a
machine with a 5400 rpm hard drive you
tell them no hell no now if we open up
black magic to speed test we're getting
around 98 megabytes per second on both
read and write which isn't terrible but
by no means good especially in 2015 as
far as what that translates to you're
going to get painfully slow boot ups
which gives you flashbacks to those
older computers where you turn it on
walk away go make coffee and do you like
15 of the things before your computer
started up on top of that that means
you're going to get that dreaded doc
bounce now because of that you should
never ever ever buy or let someone buy
this iMac with a 5400 rpm hard drive and
in my opinion there are only two
configurations you should consider the
first being the hundred dollar upgrade
which gets you a one terabyte fusion
drive or the second being the two
hundred dollar upgrade which gets you
256 gigs of pure flash storage now the
reasoning behind that and to put things
in perspective if you did the fusion
drive upgrade you're looking around
$15.99 us if you upgraded either the RAM
or the processor you're at $17.99 which
is also the same price as the
entry-level 5k iMac which not only get
you a bigger higher resolution screen
but also a dedicated AMD r9 M 380
graphics card conversely if you were
thinking about maxing out the processor
and the RAM on this 4k iMac that puts
you at $19.99 us which is the same price
as the second tier 5k iMac which not
only gets you a fusion drive as a
standard option but also a bump in
graphics with the r9 m390 also with the
27-inch iMac you're able to upgrade the
RAM after the fact and with the 21 inch
iMac you are capped off with what you
order as far as performance goes you're
getting a 3.1 gigahertz eye 5 quad core
processor which will also turbo boost up
to 3.6 gigahertz in Geekbench 3 on a
single core side dished out a score of
3779 as far as multi-core
formitz that was twelve thousand six
hundred and seventy now I went ahead and
tested out a little bit of 4k editing in
Final Cut Pro 10 and much to my surprise
it actually handled my fs7 footage
pretty well I was able to export a 60
second 4k h.264 file in about 90 seconds
which considering isn't bad at all so
the performance is there but I think
again the biggest bottleneck here
especially if you're trying to edit 4k
video is that hard drive so again at the
very least make sure you get the fusion
drive or ideally you want to be editing
off an external scratch drive as far as
graphics go this features intel's iris
pro graphics 6200 and as far as
integrated graphics go it actually
performed really well running tomb
raider at 1080p on low settings i was
seen around 43 average frames per second
hopping over to battlefield 4 windows 10
by a bootcamp at 1080p on low settings
we're getting nearly 50 average frames
per second now yes I know this is not a
gaming machine nor is it intended to be
so if you want to go game build your PC
but it's still nice know that as far as
integrated graphics go you're getting
some pretty solid performance with this
machine so all know aside from the
horrendous based option as far as your
hard drive goes this is a pretty solid
machine it shipped with El Capitan you
now have the new magic keyboard and the
Magic Mouse - with the dummest charging
port on the face of this planet or you
have the option to upgrade to the Magic
Trackpad - for 50 bucks more which I
prefer over the Magic Mouse now for
those curious those fancy-pants graphics
that you saw during Geekbench and the
speed test those were courtesy of
videoblocks comm specialize in stock
footage motion graphics and After
Effects templates on top of that they
also have a marketplace you guys that
shoot crispy video can also submit your
footage to be sold as stock footage and
make a hundred percent of the cash now
if you guys want to check this out you
can do so for free for seven days all
the details are linked down below slide
from that hopefully enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button as hard as you would smash a 5400
rpm hard drive its Jonathan with TLD and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
