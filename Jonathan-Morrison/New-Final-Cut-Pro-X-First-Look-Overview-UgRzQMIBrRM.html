been a little while since I did a video
just been getting over a cold this past
week so you guys can hear my voice is
still a little bit shot going out all
good though bulls beat the Knicks got
their 61st victory and more importantly
Apple showed off their new version of
Final Cut Pro at nab 2011 one of the
more shocking things to me was the fact
that it's going to sell for 299 it's
going to be released this June and you
can download it straight from the mac
app store there's been no mention of the
other studio products or Final Cut
Express so we'll have to wait and see if
those get updated in the coming months
before the release of the new Final Cut
Pro the new Final Cut Pro is finally
64-bit so it's going to utilize the
newer systems it's going to run smoother
faster and finally take advantage of
more than 4 gigabytes of RAM it'll
support resolutions of video up to 4k
which is insane and it's finally going
to utilize multicores which not only is
going to mean faster exporting but it's
going to have background renderings so
everything is going to be pretty much
instantaneous including effects one of
the biggest things was new Final Cut Pro
there's no more waiting no more
transcoding the media is ready to edit
on import it's also going to analyze
stabilization which is huge for DSLR
users so it's going to eliminate those
rolling shutter problems we're also
going to see people and shot detection
so people is pretty self-explanatory
it's going to organize them and detect
the faces and subcategories in that way
sha detection is really cool it's going
to take the shots analyze them and
actually organize them by the type of
shots some medium shot or close up for
example obviously Final Cut Pro is a
video editing program but some of the
new audio updates got me most excited
for the new Final Cut Pro they've
included automatic audio cleanup and
auto syncing so if you're recording to
an external device like a zoom h1 or h2
and for example it's going to
automatically sync that clip from the
video to the audio so you're not going
to clap anymore Apple sunup new Final
Cut Pro in three words quality
organization and editing it's been
completely rewritten from the ground up
I got to admit it does have a little bit
of an iMovie esque look to it but I'm
still stoked and super excited and
looking forward to it when it does come
out so if you guys want a complete recap
new details I haven't even covered in
this video check out the link down below
hopefully you guys enjoyed this let me
know if you'll be picking it up I of
course will be once it comes out in june
other than that feel free to subscribe
and i will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
