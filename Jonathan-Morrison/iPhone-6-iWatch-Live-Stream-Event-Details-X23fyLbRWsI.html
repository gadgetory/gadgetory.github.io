guys doing well i am finally back in
california after a pretty extensive two
weeks of traveling it started out in new
york city where myself marquez of mkbhd
liu from vox therapy Austin Evans and
Judd nur from your average consumer got
together and put together that iPhone 6
parody that most of you have seen by now
and thank you guys for the tremendous
feedback it is much appreciated and if
you missed it though I probably would
suggest to check it out I'll have it
linked down below or annotated somewhere
around here from there that turned into
San Francisco which turned into Chicago
and yes that is a moto 360 on my wrist
gotta check out that along with the new
Moto X and Moto G so definitely look
forward to coverage on those very soon
now the actual whole point of this video
is actually to quickly address one of
the questions I've been getting on a
regular basis and that is where can I
watch or check out coverage on Apple's
upcoming iPhone 6 events now this is on
Tuesday September 9th 2014 at 10 a.m.
Pacific 12 central that is one Eastern
if you are anywhere else in the world I
will have a link down below which
converts it into your timezone and the
big important part of this this is
actually livestream on Apple's website
so that is also linked down below in
terms of what you need to watch it and
everything you need to know to check it
out obviously without a doubt we're
gonna see the iPhone 6 for sure and a
4.7 inch edition and quite possibly a
5.5 inch addition to me that is really
not the biggest thing I'm looking for
too though it's really what Apple is
gonna do in terms of the wearable market
what are they gonna do with the iWatch
which is rumored to be announced on
Tuesday as well to me it almost seems
like Apple really didn't care about all
the iPhone 6 leaks they just kind of put
it out there and kind of almost use that
as a distraction for the tech world
because we really haven't seen or heard
anything on the possible high watch so
to me it's almost like Apple is kind of
hey look at the iPhone 6 that's cool and
all but we're really gonna do some
things and shake up the world with the
eyewash so definitely stay tuned for
that let me know what you're most
excited for I just wanted to make this
quick video as you can see I am running
out of light it's getting a little dark
but I wanted to just answer that
question so you guys could be up-to-date
on the iPhone
six event you guys can't watch it
however I will be watching it myself and
kind of covering it on Twitter you guys
can follow me at TLD today and of course
I will have that link down below along
with everything else I talked about in
this video but again if you do want to
check out live coverage and maybe you
can't watch the event I will be tweeting
out updates to definitely follow me and
other than that I will see you guys back
probably Tuesday or Wednesday with some
updates and coverage on what Apple
announced on the event besides tonight
thank you guys very much for watching
this Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later
and I think we're close we're really
close we want you to know that we care
about the environment just as much as
YouTube and that's why the iPhone 6 BPA
free PVC free TLD free it's probably
even gluten free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
