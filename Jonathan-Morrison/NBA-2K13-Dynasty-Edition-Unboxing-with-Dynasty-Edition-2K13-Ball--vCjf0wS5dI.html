night unboxing of the NBA 2k13 dynasty
Edition so if you were up watching this
as I upload this user or ma'am deserve a
high-five
I am unboxing the Xbox 360 version but
it's also available for ps3 so if you
guys are interested in pricing and
availability for either of those or the
Standard Edition 2k13
I have those linked down in the
description below now taking a quick
look at the box before we open it up
towards the top we got the dynasty
Edition with the Roman numeral 13 and
then below that we got little
silhouettes of Blake Griffin Kevin
Durant and DeRose may have a speedy
recovery as we open it up we see these
Skullcandy 2k sports inked earbuds and I
actually have no need for these so if
you guys want them I'm gonna give them
away all you got to do is like this
video and leave me a comment down below
with your favorite basketball team next
this little car right here is going to
be your key to your sprite 2k13 all-star
downloadable content so don't lose this
don't throw it away it is going to be
your access to your bonus content beyond
that we get a 2k13 controller skin from
skin it obviously this is for the Xbox
360 controller but if you do pick up the
ps3 version you're going to get a ps3
skin it's got a nice little texture to
it not sure if I would actually install
this on my controller but it is nice
that they added it now onto the item
that I thought was coolest obviously
aside from the game itself is a full
sized NBA 2k13 basketball made by
Spalding so it's not like some cheap
knockoff you actually get a collector's
edition Spalding basketball
unfortunately it's a little flat so
excuse me one moment I'm going to pump
it up
and what would an NBA 2k13 unboxing with
the basketball mind you be without the
obligatory basketball finger spin and
that is enough spitting so we'll get to
the last item the heart of the matter
that's 2k13 again like I said this is
for the Xbox 360 stay tuned for my first
look and gameplay which I've annotated
right here as soon as it's up subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you guys very soon with some more to
kick goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
