lunch and dinner bringing you our review
of final fantasy for the complete
collection for the PSP now I must admit
I've been a longtime fan of the Final
Fantasy series however while I enjoy the
new games from time to time I really
feel as though the series hit its peak
during 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 in which the games
utilized 2d sprites alongside strong
narratives and old-school turn-based
battles while this entry has been remade
a number of times before on PlayStation
game boy advance and the DS this
particular port has the benefit of not
only featuring the original Final
Fantasy 4 but also the after years a
sequel that up until now was only
available as a Wii where title in the
USA then to really make this collection
complete the game also has a third story
line entitled interlude which helps to
bridge the gap between both games the
first game in the collection the
original Final Fantasy 4 is very similar
to its GBA incarnation while still
handling almost identically did the
original SNES game this version does
include bonus dungeons as well as the
ability to eventually pick your own
party members not only that but the PSP
version also features redone sprite
animations as well as the ability to use
either the original music score or the
redone music that was used in the DS
remake while nothing's shining your new
is really added to this port Final
Fantasy 4 itself is still one of the
best entries in the series with a strong
plot as well as some great old-school
style animation and some of the best
tripe musical liver here in the file
pasty series anyone who has yet to play
this game will find that the PSP version
is one of the best ways to experience it
then there's the new chapter interlude
which in all honesty is practically
non-existent it only takes about three
to four hours to complete most of which
is dialing and all the game's dungeons
and enemies are simply taken straight
from the original game by itself it's
not enough to justify getting the
collection but it's a nice little added
bridge part for those who are playing
through either of the other games for
the first time last but not least is the
after years a sequel which takes place
almost 20 years after the original game
and features a chapter based storyline
in which events are viewed from many
different characters perspectives until
the final chapter in which they all
joined together while playing through
the original game is an absolute
necessity to understand any of its plot
the after years itself is actually a
really enjoyable game with enough
changes and additions to help set it
apart from FF 4 while some dungeons and
enemies are reused the new plotline as
well as the number of new characters
really helps make the game feel fresh
one of my personal favorite additions is
the banding of
in which some combinations of team
members can lead to special combo
attacks allowing for massive damage
against enemies like with the first game
the complete collection has also given
the after years a full sprite makeover
and is easily the best-looking version
of this game in all honesty the
collection itself really hasn't added
that much to the original games and the
new interlude chapter by itself isn't
enough to justify picking up the game
however if you have yet to play the
original game and/or the after years
then the complete collection is easily
the best way to pick up both of these
fantastic games anyone who's a fan of
the Final Fantasy series will surely
enjoy this port however for those of you
that loathe of the series but only know
it for what it's become since file
Fantasy 7 I really think you should give
this one a shot because it really shows
what it once was and is well worth
playing for any RPG fan
I'm Kevin for TLD thanks for watching
colder in here
