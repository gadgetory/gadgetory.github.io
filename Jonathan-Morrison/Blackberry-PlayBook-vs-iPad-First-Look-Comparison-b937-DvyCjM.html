jonathan with teal because many you guys
know the blackberry tablet was announced
yesterday it's called the playbook which
honestly I kind of like the name better
than the ipad but as far as specs ago
this thing walks all over the ipad on
paper it literally does no but all in
all seriousness really looking forward
to this tablet I've been hearing a lot
of articles and comparisons a lot of
talk comparing to the ipad if it's going
to be the ipad killer so let's go ahead
and walk through some spec comparisons
let you guys know what i think of it
compared to the ipad and then i'll let
you guys know if i think it's going to
be an ipad killer at the end of this
video alright so like I said spec wise
this thing's an absolute beast as far as
the blackberry playbook we get a 1
gigahertz dual-core processor as opposed
to the 1 gigahertz Apple single core and
1 gig ram compared to the 256 megs on
the iPad so 4 times that as far as the
RAM goes now the display the iPads
bigger and it's an LED display is
opposed to an LCD now the OS is one of
the biggest things I want to point out
right here the blackberry OS versus the
iOS so regardless of specs the iOS is
intuitive it runs smoothly on from my
experience with any blackberry mobile
device I never really liked the actual
user interface so that's one thing I
want to actually take a look at when I
get my hands on with a new blackberry uh
playbooks now as far as the camera
obviously we have none on the iPad and
the blackberry play likely is very
impressive there's a 3 megapixel front a
5-megapixel rear and they both do 1080p
recording on those of course the
blackberries gonna have flash support
the ipad doesn't to me that's not a huge
deal i'm kind of getting a used to html5
i like that where that's going obviously
there's a lot of people that do like
flash that's a good thing for the
blackberry now as far as high definition
support this does 1080 playback on the
playbook like I said does 1080p
recording and also has an hdmi output
which I wish they would have on the ipad
I don't think we'll see that any time
soon on the future iPads but as of right
now it only does 720p playback there's a
few other things that we got a factor
and we don't know the pricing yet on the
blackberry and the biggest thing I want
to point out is that the actual iPads
been out for almost a year now and the
blackberries not due out until 2011 and
honestly I wouldn't be surprised if we
saw the iPad second-generation hit
before we see the blackberry playbook
and that's really the kind of thing we
got to compare so for you guys talking
about the ipad kill
we really gotta wait until its next iPad
comes out because honestly like I said
it's been out for a year and they really
got to compete with something new
instead of comparing it with the older
iPad that's going to be kind of obsolete
a couple months so we will see the
front-facing camera on the next iPad and
like I said there's a couple of things
we got to consider as far as battery
life i think the PlayBook is going to
come nowhere near as far as battery life
compared to the ipad because of the dual
core processor because of flash i think
this is going to eat up through battery
and i wouldn't be surprised if
realistically we saw a three to five
hour battery life on the playbook so
that's just kind of my opinion let me go
let me know you think on the comments
below if you guys are looking forward to
this like i said i'm not knocking the
playbook this thing looks absolutely
phenomenal on paper as far as the specs
ago and because of the processor is
going to do multitasking extremely well
the 1080p video recording is absolutely
amazing as far as that goes so hopefully
they do like straight to youtube uploads
for those of you guys do vlogs I think
that would be kind of cool for someone
like myself doing quick videos being
able to take that I mean you guys can
look through all the stories to a quick
article edited so as far as that goes
i'm really excited looking forward to
this the competition like i said it's
gonna be great as far as that it's going
to make the other vendors step up their
game really looking forward to the ipad
to try out the samsung tab but let me
guys know what you think you guys think
this is the ipad killer or the second
generation ipad killer you guys looking
forward to this let me hear your
opinions in the comments below so other
than that you guys haven't subscribed
feel free to do so already and I'll
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
