dinner giving our first look of Fallout
New Vegas to the ps3 360 and PC in
particular the clips are going to see
are from the xbox 360 version so what
you'll notice right away is that the
look and feel of the game are almost
identical to its predecessor fallout 3
however shortly after the beginning of
the game the developers attempt to show
off a lot of the new features that are
supposed to set it apart for instance
the trade system has a comeback from
fallout 2 that was absent in fallout 3
there's also a reputation system that
has been added now for me personally the
most engaging addition is the hardcore
mode and the hardcore mode both
ammunition and money have weight which
makes item management a lot harder not
only that the player character is
required to eat sleep and drink water in
order to avoid negative status effects
and wounds are a lot harder to heal
especially crippled limbs it gives the
game a much grittier tone overall now
we're only about an hour and a half of
the game so most of the main plot
questions have been answered at all
however there is an engaging mini plot
at the beginning of the game that
involves a group of towns folk versus a
group of thugs that shows off both the
reputation system and a lot of new
additions to the game now all the game
handles a lot like fallout 3 the new
additions as well as the new setting
keep the feeling really friend now
whether or not these new additions make
the whole game worth playing I'll let
you guys know in our upcoming review so
then I'm kevins protective lunch and
dinner thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
