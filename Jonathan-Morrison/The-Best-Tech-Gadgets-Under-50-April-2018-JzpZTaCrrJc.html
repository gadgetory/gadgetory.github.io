with the best tech under 50 it's been a
while so drop a like if you're excited
and let me know if you want to see these
monthly and I will make that happen
today though I'm kicking it off with
these the costs Porter Pro wired
headphones so can be a little messy but
if you're looking for a wire pair of
headphones these are surprisingly good
not gonna lie when I first took these
out of the box when they are nice and
compacted thought they were kind of like
baby headphones and I wasn't sure if
they fit on my head because those look
tiny but once you extend them you get
them to their full potential they
actually fit surprisingly well what I
like about these is there's actually two
comfort zones there's a firm fit and
then a light fit so if you want them to
hug your ears so you can get a really
close listen to that sound you can do
that or if you want a more comfortable
feel switch to light and it's going to
be much lighter on your ears now I
realize there are pretty much no phones
out there right now they have a
headphone jack aside from the galaxy s 9
so you pick that up or if you have an
older phone or your rocket one plus this
might be the perfect partner in crime
and you're probably wondering about the
sound quality because these look so tiny
you wouldn't expect the amount of bass
that comes out of these guys they look
old-school they kind of give up like the
stranger things retro vibe which I
really love
honestly they almost seem like the
perfect combo for like a Walkman or
something like that so if you dig that
retro look these are gonna be perfect
and the more important thing is they
sound good really good for the price
they're lightweight they're not gonna
throw a ton of strain on your ears and
again if you're looking for a wire pair
of headphones I would definitely check
these out so next up is this guy right
here the cyber acoustics Shasta USB
microphone I figure what better way to
showcase how a microphone sounds and to
use it for the video itself and
everything you were hearing right now is
coming through the Shasta microphone
what I like most about this is assuming
you have a computer it's going to give
you everything you need out of the box
to get going
it's USB powered it also sends the audio
into your computer through USB you got
this nice fancy mic stand I'm not going
to touch it because I'm not gonna mess
with the audio and screw with your ears
but let me know what you think of the
quality with a comment down below the
one thing I will mention though is most
likely from a distance this thing looks
like it's built really well but it's not
it looks like it might be metal but it's
actually plastic all the way around so
in terms of durability I'm not sure how
long it's going to
long term but for the price is a pretty
fantastic value so whether you're
musician or you jumped on the Fortnight
train you want to record and/or stream
your gameplay do yourself and everyone
else around you a favor
don't yell into your computer mic and
grab something like this it's not gonna
sound mind-blowing or absolutely amazing
but for the price it does a damn good
job link below when it comes to switch
accessories under fifty bucks my
absolute favorite has got to be this
battery shell from on tank now I love
using my switch in portable mode and
there's nothing more frustrating than
when you start seeing that battery light
blinking so with this guy right here
you're gonna get over twice the playtime
in handheld mode on a full charge and
while that alone is great it has a
couple other little extras as well for
instance you've got double kickstand
setup that is way better than the one
that's built into the switch itself and
there's a little storage compartment
here where you can put two extra games
for when you're on the go so you got a
couple options especially you don't have
a case speaking of cases while this
thing does add a little bit of bulk to
the switch definitely it's actually
still just small enough that it's gonna
fit in most carrying cases no problem
whatsoever this thing is an absolute
must buy so next up is for those of you
out there who shoot video this is a
crazy cheap but surprisingly awesome
portable LED light that is currently
under 40 bucks now I totally get it
super easy to get lost in fancy
expensive gear but I wanted to take a
minute to showcase so you can still make
something really awesome especially with
a light like this and in fact you
already watched an entire scene that was
lit using only this light this shot here
that you just watched with mr. Kevin
Kenton was lit only using this single
LED to give an example of how this looks
here's the light off here is the light
on was a little bit of diffusion and a
showcase how important diffusion is
here's that same light with no diffusion
which can get kind of nasty and a little
harsh also a huge shout-out to and you
for coming up with this crazy dust pan
diffusion contraption rigged for the
lights it really showcases that you can
do a lot with a little bit and whether
you use that or you do something as
simple as pin up some diffusion paper or
use an umbrella those are all great
examples of what you can do with some
really inexpensive lighting now it's
cool just light is that it's color
temperature adjustable from 30 300
kelvin up to 5600 so I actually got it
up there behind me and this is that
3,300 kelvin act and as a warm little
accent light or a kicker they might say
in the business and it really showcases
that you can either use
a as your main source and your key light
as we saw before or use it to kind of
complement and add some flavor to your
video like I'm doing it right now
overall it's built really well and the
only downside or my complaint with this
is there's no power supply and the
included battery doesn't last that long
so either by a second or definitely add
a power supply if you plan on shooting
for extended periods of time so next up
is this electronic candle which sounds
silly but is actually awesome it's
better known as the Yi light which is a
silly name but you guys know I love
lighting whether it's a circle light a
lamp anything that essentially adds eye
candy to a video and this definitely
fits the bill
right off the bat what's awesome about
this is that it's battery-powered so
you're not stuck to a wall or to an
outlet in this case we are clearly
outside moving around with this and the
way control it is either through
rotating it which is strangely
satisfying it almost feels like you're a
cavemen making fire or you can control
out there an app through Bluetooth which
is awesome as well so if you're on your
couch maybe you're in the bath and you
want to change how bright it is but you
can't reach the candle you can do that
to get nerdy for a second oh this is
actually rated at 1800 Kelvin which is
really really warm so it gives this
really oranjee glow off which i think
looks amazing in the background so if
you shoot video or you just want to add
some ambience to your house to your
apartment this thing is fairly
inexpensive it works on both Android or
iOS or if you just want to turn it
yourself that motions are probably gonna
get me demonetized
either way I would recommend this
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome smash that like button this is
Jonathan and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
