TLD was an unboxing of the House of
Marley freedom collection stir it up on
ear headphones and you can see the box
has got a very earthy vibe going on with
it
and that kind of goes hand-in-hand with
the theme of the headphones being eco
friendly which we'll get to a little
later in this video but towards the top
of the box we have the House of Marley
logo towards the bottom left we can see
these stirred up bottle name then you
can see these are made for the iPod
iPhone and iPad being that they have a
microphone and built-in 3 button
controller which can be seen right here
and as we flip it over to the side we
got a little see-through window action
going on so you can see what the
headphones look like themselves and
lastly on the backhand side we got a
little overview of the headphones with a
picture going over the specs and a
picture of Bob Marley himself so it's
not waste any time go and slide these
open get the little tabs out of the way
and that should do the trick
so get that out of the way looks like we
got a nice little badass pouch I didn't
see that one coming so let's try to do
this without annihilating the cardboard
flip the tab open actually has it's
gonna go kind of swings open but there
we can see a nice little cloth carrying
bag which is pretty neat that they
include that now that we've busted
through the cardboard we can see the
headphones themselves which actually
fill insanely comfortable these are very
nicely padded this feels comfortable and
they also have a detachable audio cable
which is always a plus so we'll get a
little close-up action of that for you
got definitely the Rasta vibe going on
with those colors they're kind of
Jamaican colors but you can see the
microphone as well as the three button
control which will work again with the
iPhone and iPod and iPad we have a
little bit of literature kind of just
going over the warranty information
which is always nice to have included
and lastly one close up look at the
headphones themselves so you can see the
House of Marley logos on each ear cup
now the wood is actually FSC certified
beech wood and the aluminum sites are
recycled so everything on here is that
eco-friendly a little close up of where
you would insert the audio jack and a
closer look at the padding and these do
fill extremely padded and look extremely
comfortable
we got a top look at the band so it's
definitely got a little appeal to it as
far as the looks department and overall
these look pretty solid they feel pretty
comfortable just to my hands I'll be
sure to test these out let you guys know
what I think as far as the sound comes
and if they are worth the money so thank
you guys for watching this video if you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to give it a thumbs up I always
appreciate that if you haven't done so
make sure to check out our top iPhone
apps and games of 2011 and I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
