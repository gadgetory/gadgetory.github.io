happy thanksgiving to those of you who
celebrate if you're outside the US and
you don't whelps just another happy
thursday but if you can take anything
from this video definitely take a minute
to think about what you're thankful for
and show the people who met in your life
some love because most of us are more
fortunate than you think now last year i
made a black friday deals video a lot of
you guys really enjoyed it a lot of you
guys have requested i do the same this
year so i'm back with my top five black
friday deals of 2013 kicking off the
list this one is from target if you
haven't looking for a brand new ipad air
they have it for for 79 99 so it's 20
bucks off but you get a hundred or a
gift card so if you happen to shop at
Target a lot that's basically a hundred
bucks back in your pocket that's a
pretty damn good deal next up best buy
has a 55 inch LG 120 hertz LED 1080p TV
for 499 now this has sold out online but
if you do feel like battling the crowd
you can actually get this in stores now
if you don't feel like battling the
crowds and punching Jimmy in the face
just to get a deal on a TV I will be
looking for similar deals and
live-tweeting them as they happen the
only problem with internet deals is I
usually come and go so definitely follow
me at tldtoday so you can stay up to
date on the latest and greatest black
friday deals just to name a few that
i've seen so far amazon has AC key for
freaking k 39 inch ultra HDTV for under
500 bucks they also have a 46-inch 1080p
TV for under 350 and there's also tons
of deals on samsung HD TVs now coming in
at number three best buy has the galaxy
s4 40 bucks on a new tier contract they
have verizon AT&amp;amp;T so if you have been
looking for an upgrade and you don't
want to drop any money upfront this is
definitely a good deal to check out next
up coming in at number four if you are
feeling brave and you want to battle the
walmart crowds they have a 4 gigabyte
xbox 360 for 99 bucks now again if you
don't want to go outside you want to
stay at your computer amazon had the
xbox 360 e the 250 gigabyte bundle for
189 bucks today that comes with halo 4
and tomb raider but again it's only
going to last today so if you're
watching this tomorrow that deal may be
gone last up at number five best buy is
having 200 bucks off their retina
MacBook Pro so that brings the 13-inch
baseline read a macbook pro down to 1099
which is a killer deal now again I do
expect to see online sellers match some
of these prizes so if i do see similar
deals i'll definitely let you guys
no like I said the online deals do
fluctuate they come in and out and go
really quickly but it will have a few my
favorite ones that I've seen today and
tomorrow down below in the description
and I will try to update them as
frequently as possible now if you've
made it this far into the video virtual
high-five because i have to give aways
